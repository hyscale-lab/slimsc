Okay, so I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh right, |alpha> is a coherent state, and |-alpha> is another coherent state with opposite amplitude. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). 

The problem gives phi as -pi/4 and alpha as 0.5. So first, I should plug these values into N. Let me calculate N first.

Wait, let me compute sin(2phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2phi would be -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. Then exp(-2 alpha²) with alpha=0.5. Alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Now, the state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is non-Gaussian. So rho is the density matrix of |psi>, which is |psi><psi|.

The relative entropy measure is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Tau is the density matrix of a Gaussian reference state. Now, what's the reference state here? Oh wait, in measures of non-Gaussianity, the reference is usually the closest Gaussian state to the given state. So perhaps in this case, the reference Gaussian state is the closest one to |psi>.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: the relative entropy between the state and a Gaussian state. If the state is already Gaussian, then the relative entropy would be zero because rho equals tau. But our state is a superposition, so it's non-Gaussian, hence nG should be positive.

Wait, but in the options, option D is 0. Maybe if phi is such that the state becomes Gaussian? Let me think. When is a superposition of coherent states Gaussian? Well, coherent states are Gaussian, but their superposition is not unless perhaps the superposition is coherent itself.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The state |psi> is (cos phi |alpha> + sin phi |-alpha>)/N. For this state to be Gaussian, it must be another coherent state. But that's only possible if the combination is another coherent state. Let me think: a coherent state is a displaced vacuum. A superposition of two coherent states is Gaussian only if it's another coherent state, which would require certain conditions on alpha and phi.

Wait, but in our case, phi is -pi/4. Let me compute cos(phi) and sin(phi) when phi is -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.707.

So |psi> is [0.707 |alpha> -0.707 |-alpha> ] / N. Alpha is 0.5, but maybe this can combine into something else. Wait, if alpha is 0.5, then |-alpha> is |−0.5>. So the state is a superposition of |0.5> and -|−0.5> scaled by N.

Wait, but for the state to be Gaussian, it must be a coherent state. Let's see what |a> and |-a> combine into. If I have a state like |a> + |-a>, that's a different coherent state? Or perhaps a squeezed state?

Wait, perhaps if we have a state like (|a> + e^{iθ} |-a> ), this could be another coherent state under certain conditions. Let me think about this. For example, if a is real, and theta is such that the coefficients combine constructively.

But in our case, the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi). Hmm, maybe for certain phi values, the state becomes Gaussian again.

Wait, but in our problem, phi is -pi/4. So cos(phi) is positive, sin(phi) is negative. So the state is a superposition with opposite signs. Does this make the state Gaussian?

Wait, let me think about the case when the coefficients are such that the state becomes a coherent state again. For instance, if the coefficients are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, perhaps the state is a different coherent state.

Wait, suppose the state is (|a> - |−a>)/N. Then, can this be written as a coherent state |b> for some b?

Alternatively, perhaps this is a different state. Let me compute the density matrix of |psi> and see if it's Gaussian.

Alternatively, there's another approach. If the state is a cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states, it's highly non-Gaussian. But wait, maybe when phi is such that the state becomes a squeezed vacuum state, which is Gaussian. Or maybe when the coefficients are such that the state can be expressed as a displaced thermal state or another Gaussian state.

Wait, but what's the relative entropy here? It's the difference in the entropy between the state and the reference Gaussian. So if the state itself is Gaussian (a coherent state in this case), then the relative entropy would be zero because the reference is the same as the state. But in our case, the state is a superposition, so it's non-Gaussian, and thus the relative entropy would be positive.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the state is a coherent state, then it's Gaussian. So in that case, nG would be zero.

So when would the state |psi> be a coherent state? Let's see. The state |psi> is a superposition of |a> and |−a>, which are themselves coherent states. However, a superposition of two coherent states is not, in general, a coherent state unless the coefficients are arranged in a certain way.

Let me think about when the state becomes a coherent state. Let me write |psi> = (c1 |a> + c2 |-a> ) / N.

For this to be a coherent state, perhaps c1 and c2 must be such that the sum c1 |a> + c2 |-a> is proportional to a single coherent state |b>.

But perhaps for specific values of phi and a, this is possible. Let me think about the case when a =0. Then |a> is |0>, the vacuum, and |-a> is also |0>, so |psi> becomes 1. But that's trivial.

Wait, but in our case, a is 0.5, which is not zero. So maybe the state |psi> is not a coherent state, but a squeezed state or something else.

Wait, another approach: The state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's a cat state. If the state is a cat state, it's non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy should be positive.

But wait, the options include D) 0. So perhaps, in this specific case, the state is Gaussian, so the relative entropy is zero. So the nG is zero. How could that be?

Wait, perhaps when phi is such that the state becomes a Gaussian state. Let's compute the state again.

Wait, let's compute |psi> when phi is -pi/4, and a=0.5.

So cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707, and sin(phi)=sin(-pi/4)= -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.707.

So |psi> = (0.707 |0.5> - 0.707 |−0.5> ) / N.

Hmm, let me think: maybe this can be rewritten as a single coherent state. Let me try to factor out terms.

Wait, |a> = e^{-|a|^2/2} sum (a^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>, and |-a> is similar but with (-a)^n.

So |0.5> is e^{-0.25/2} sum (0.5^n / sqrt(n!)) |n>, and |-0.5> is e^{-0.25/2} sum (-0.5)^n / sqrt(n!) |n>.

So when I compute 0.707 |0.5> -0.707 |−0.5>, substituting:

0.707 e^{-0.125} [ sum (0.5^n / sqrt(n!) ) |n> - sum ( (-0.5)^n / sqrt(n!) ) |n> ].

Wait, that becomes 0.707 e^{-0.125} sum [ (0.5^n - (-0.5)^n ) / sqrt(n!) ] |n>.

Hmm, for even n, (-0.5)^n is (0.5)^n, so their difference is zero. For odd n, it's 0.5^n - (-0.5)^n = 0.5^n +0.5^n= 2*(0.5)^n.

So the sum becomes sum [ for odd n: 2*(0.5)^n / sqrt(n!) ) |n> ].

So |psi> is proportional to sum [ |n> for odd n ] multiplied by some coefficients.

Wait, that's an equal superposition of all odd photon numbers. That's a highly non-Gaussian state, isn't it? Because coherent states have Poissonian distributions, but this state only has odd photon numbers. So its density matrix would be non-Gaussian.

Wait, but wait. The relative entropy is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Since the reference Gaussian state tau is the closest Gaussian to rho, del_b is the non-Gaussianity.

If the state is non-Gaussian, then del_b is positive. So why is option D 0? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Alternatively, maybe when phi is such that the state becomes a coherent state. Let me compute what phi would make this happen.

Wait, perhaps if phi is zero. Let's see: cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So |psi> would be |a> / N. Since N would be sqrt(1 + sin(0) exp(-2a²)) )= sqrt(1). So N=1. So |psi> is |a>, a coherent state, which is Gaussian. Hence, nG would be zero.

But in our problem, phi is -pi/4. So perhaps in this case, the state is not Gaussian, so the nG is non-zero.

Wait, but the options have option C) 1.38, B) 0.25, etc.

But wait, could the state be Gaussian in this case? Because maybe when phi is -pi/4, the normalization N is something that makes the state a coherent state.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the state is ( |a> - |−a> ) / N. Could this be a coherent state |b> for some b?

Wait, let me compute the expansion of (|a> - |-a> ) as a state. For a=0.5.

|a> is sum_{n} (a^n / sqrt(n!)) e^{-a²/2} |n>
|-a> is sum_{n} ( (-a)^n / sqrt(n!)) e^{-a²/2} |n>

So |a> - |-a> = e^{-a²/2} sum_n (a^n - (-a)^n) |n> / sqrt(n!).

Which, as I said before, for even n, (a^n - (-a)^n ) is zero. For odd n, it's 2 a^n.

So the state is proportional to sum ( 2 a^n |n> ) / sqrt(n!), for odd n.

This is a superposition of only the odd photon numbers. Now, is this state Gaussian?

Gaussian states have Wigner functions that are Gaussian, and their density matrices can be written in terms of position and momentum quadratures, which are normally distributed. Coherent states are Gaussian, but so are squeezed states, thermal states, etc.

But this state only has odd photon numbers, which is non-classical and non-Gaussian. For example, the photon number distribution is non-Poissonian, and the state is highly non-Gaussian.

So, if the state is non-Gaussian, then the relative entropy del_b would be positive, so the non-Gaussianity would be non-zero. But the options include D) 0, so why is that?

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state itself. No, that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian. Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes Gaussian.

Wait, another approach: let me compute the density matrix rho and see if it's Gaussian.

Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to realize that the state is a two-mode squeezed vacuum state or a cat state.

Wait, wait. Another thought: the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which forms a Schrödinger cat state. These are known to be highly non-Gaussian, so their non-Gaussianity should be positive. So the answer would not be D) 0.

But wait, the question specifies using the relative entropy measure. The relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. So, if the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, the relative entropy would be positive, meaning the non-Gaussianity is positive. So the answer would be either A, B, or C.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the state is Gaussian, so del_b is zero, meaning nG is zero. But I thought the state is non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state simplifies in a way that it's Gaussian. Let me think about the initial state.

|psi> = [ cos(phi)|a> + sin(phi)|−a> ] / N.

If phi is such that the coefficients create a state which is Gaussian, maybe when the state can be expressed as another coherent state.

Wait, perhaps if I choose phi such that the coefficients are symmetric in a way that the state becomes a coherent state. Let me compute the condition.

Let me assume that the state |psi> is a coherent state |b>. Then,

|psi> = ( cos(phi) |a> + sin(phi) |-a> ) / N = |b>.

But for this to hold, the superposition should be proportional to a single coherent state. But wait, |a> and |−a> are orthogonal in general. So their superposition would not be a coherent state unless perhaps the coefficients are arranged in a way that they form a different displacement.

Wait, perhaps when the coefficients are such that the resulting state ends up being a coherent state. For example, if cos(phi) = sin(phi) = 1/sqrt(2), but with opposite signs. Wait, in our case, phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)= -sqrt(2)/2. So the coefficients are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

So, |psi> is [ |a> - |−a> ] / N.

Is this a coherent state? Let me think about a=0.5.

Wait, perhaps this can be rewritten as sqrt(2) |a> e^{-i pi/4} or something like that. Alternatively, maybe it's a squeezed state.

Wait, perhaps the state |a> - |−a> can be written as a squeezed coherent state. Squeezed states are Gaussian, so if |psi> is a squeezed state, then it's Gaussian, and del_b would be zero.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a two-mode squeezed state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a coherent state in another basis. For example, by writing the state in terms of a rotated displacement.

Wait, for instance, if we have |a> + |−a> = 2 |0> when a is real, but that's only when a=0.

Wait, but in our case, a is 0.5, so |0.5> - |−0.5> would not be a vacuum state. So perhaps the state is not Gaussian, making nG non-zero.

But I'm a bit stuck. Let me think about the problem again. The question is to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure.

The relative entropy is del_b = S(rho) − S(tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state. If the state rho is Gaussian, then tau is equal to rho, so del_b is zero. So nG is zero only if the state is Gaussian.

Wait, so is the state rho Gaussian in this case?

Let me compute the state for given parameters. Phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2. Alpha is 0.5.

So N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

We calculated N as sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

So |psi> is [ 0.707 |0.5> - 0.707 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, but is this a Gaussian state? Or is it non-Gaussian.

Wait, coherent states are Gaussian, but superpositions of two different coherent states are not. Unless the superposition is a coherent state, which requires the coefficients to form another coherent state.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the state can be written as a displaced thermal state or a squeezed state, which are Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps the state can be expressed as a squeezed state. Squeezed states are Gaussian, so their non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But wait, how can I check if |psi> is a squeezed state?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a cat state, which is non-Gaussian, so nG is positive.

Alternatively, perhaps in this specific case, the state is Gaussian. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: the Wigner function of a Gaussian state is Gaussian. If the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the Wigner function would have interference terms, making it non-Gaussian. But in some cases, maybe the interference terms cancel, making it Gaussian.

But for a superposition of |a> and |-a> with coefficients of equal magnitude and opposite sign, perhaps the Wigner function becomes Gaussian again.

Wait, let me consider the case when the state is (|a> - |-a> ) / N.

The density matrix rho would be |psi><psi|.

Hmm, perhaps the density matrix can be written in terms of a single coherent state.

Wait, let me think in terms of position representation. The Wigner function of a coherent state |a> is Gaussian centered at (x0, p0) determined by a. The Wigner function of |a> + |-a> would be two Gaussians centered symmetrically, leading to a non-Gaussian Wigner function. But in our case, it's |a> - |-a>, which would also have a similar Wigner function, but perhaps with some interference.

Wait, but wait. When you have |a> - |-a>, the Wigner function would be [W_a(x,p) + W_{-a}(x,p)] − 2 sqrt(W_a W_{-a}) cos( some phase ) ]? Or perhaps it's the modulus squared, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Wigner function of |a> - |-a> would look like a single Gaussian, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the Wigner function of (|a> - |-a> ) would have terms that cancel the interference, making it look Gaussian. Or maybe not. I'm not certain, but I think that a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases would lead to a non-Gaussian Wigner function with two humps or something else.

So, from this reasoning, the state is non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy would be positive, hence nG is non-zero. So the options A, B, or C are possible.

But how do I compute the relative entropy?

Wait, the relative entropy is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. So I need to compute the entropies of rho and tau.

But calculating this for a given state might be tricky without knowing the specific form of rho and tau. Alternatively, perhaps the state is such that the relative entropy del_b is zero, meaning nG is zero.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the given options. Option D is 0. So if the state is Gaussian, the answer is D. Otherwise, not.

So, when is the state |psi> Gaussian? Let's think about the case when a is zero. Then, |a> is |0>, and |-a> is also |0>. So |psi> becomes (cos(phi) |0> + sin(phi) |0> ) / N. So it's ( cos(phi) + sin(phi) ) |0> / N. Which is a coherent state |0>, so Gaussian. Thus, nG=0.

But in our problem, a is 0.5. So perhaps when phi is such that the state becomes a coherent state again.

Wait, let's compute N. N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 a²)).

With a=0.5 and phi=-pi/4.

We have sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈0.6275.

So |psi> is [cos(phi)|a> + sin(phi)|-a> ] / N.

Wait, could this be written as |b> for some b?

Let me think about the state as a linear combination of two coherent states. For a state to be a coherent state, it must be an eigenstate of the annihilation operator. So, perhaps if |psi> is an eigenstate of a, then it's a coherent state.

Let me compute a |psi>:

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |a> + sin(phi) a |-a> ] / N.

But a |a> = a |a>, and a |-a> = -a |-a> because a |z> = z |z>, so a |-a> = -a |-a>.

So,

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |a> + sin(phi) (-a) |-a> ] / N.

Which is [ cos(phi) a |a> - sin(phi) a |-a> ] / N.

But |psi> is [ cos(phi) |a> + sin(phi) |-a> ] / N.

So, a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |a> - sin(phi) a |-a> ] / N = a [ cos(phi) |a> - sin(phi) |-a> ] / N.

Which is a times [ cos(phi)|a> - sin(phi)|-a> ] divided by N.

But |psi> is [ cos(phi)|a> + sin(phi)|-a> ] / N.

So, unless [ cos(phi)|a> - sin(phi)|-a> ] is a multiple of |psi>, which would require some condition on phi.

Hmm, but I don't see an obvious condition here. So perhaps |psi> is not an eigenstate of a, meaning it is not a coherent state, hence non-Gaussian, leading to a positive nG.

Thus, the non-Gaussianity would be positive, so the answer is not D) 0.

But wait, the options don't include the other choices as exact numbers. How can I compute the relative entropy without more information?

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning that |psi> is non-Gaussian. Maybe when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes a coherent state, making nG zero.

Wait, let me compute the state again.

|psi> is ( |0.5> - |−0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, perhaps this can be rewritten as some other coherent state. For example, perhaps the state is |b> where b is i times 0.5 or something.

Wait, another approach: the sum |a> + |-a> is 2 e^{-|a|^2} sum_{n even} a^n |n> / sqrt(n!).

But in our case, it's |a> - |-a>, which is 2 e^{-a^2/2} sum_{n odd} a^n |n> / sqrt(n!).

Now, a coherent state is e^{-a^2/2} sum a^n |n> / sqrt(n!).

But our state has only the odd terms. So it's not a coherent state, but a superposition state with only odd photon numbers.

Which means it's non-Gaussian.

So the conclusion is that the state is non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy is positive, hence nG is non-zero.

But the options are A) 2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

So I'm now confused. It seems the correct answer would be non-zero, but the options include D)0, which suggests I was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the state is Gaussian. Let me think about the expectation values.

In a Gaussian state, all the higher-order moments can be expressed in terms of second-order moments. For example, the photon number distribution would be Gaussian-like.

But our state has only odd photon numbers, so the photon number distribution is non-Gaussian. So the state must be non-Gaussian, making the relative entropy positive.

Hmm. Therefore, the answer should be either A, B, or C.

But without knowing the exact computation, how can I choose between them?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is Gaussian because the superposition leads to a coherent state. But I don't see how.

Wait, another angle: the state could be Gaussian if it's a squeezed vacuum state. Because squeezed states are Gaussian.

Wait, let me check whether the state |psi> can be written as a squeezed vacuum state.

A squeezed vacuum state is typically |0, r>, where r is the squeezing parameter. The squeezing operator acts on the vacuum, producing a state with variance squeezed in one quadrature.

But can the state (|a> - |-a> ) / N be written as a squeezed vacuum?

Hmm. Let me think about a=0.5. The state |0.5> is a coherent state. So |0.5> - |−0.5> is a superposition of two coherent states.

Alternatively, perhaps the state can be transformed into a squeezed state via some displacement or squeezing operations.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is already a squeezed state.

Wait, another approach: the density matrix of a squeezed vacuum state is Gaussian. So if |psi> is a squeezed state, then nG is zero. Otherwise, it's positive.

But I'm not sure whether |psi> is a squeezed state.

Wait, perhaps the state is a squeezed vacuum, but I need to compute.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a two-mode squeezed state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coherent state displaced in phase space in some way.

Wait, perhaps the state can be written as a displaced thermal state, which is Gaussian.

But again, without knowing the exact form, it's hard to say.

Let me think about the Wigner function.

A Gaussian state has a Wigner function that is Gaussian. The Wigner function of a superposition of two coherent states would typically have interference terms, making it non-Gaussian.

But for certain superpositions, like (|a> + |−a> ) / sqrt(2), the Wigner function would be a Gaussian centered at the origin, perhaps with higher intensity. Wait, because |a> and |−a> are coherent states at a and -a.

Wait, let me compute the Wigner function for (|a> + |−a> ) / sqrt(2).

The Wigner function of |a> is W_a(x,p) = exp( - (x - x_a)^2 / (2σ^2) - (p - p_a)^2 / (2σ^2) ) ), where x_a = Re(a), p_a = Im(a), and σ^2 is the variance.

So, when you have |a> + |-a>, the Wigner function would be W_a + W_{-a}.

Wait, but when you take the modulus squared, perhaps it simplifies.

Wait, no, when you have a superposition, it's |alpha|^2 |psi|^2 not just a sum.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the state in question is a cat state and thus non-Gaussian, making nG positive. So the answer is not D) 0.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C) 1.38.

Wait, but without the exact calculation, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps another approach: compute the purity of the state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the relative entropy measure requires finding the closest Gaussian state to rho. The minimal relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian tau is the non-Gaussianity.

But without knowing the exact form of rho and the expression for tau, it's challenging to compute del_b.

Alternatively, perhaps in this specific case, the non-Gaussianity equals the logarithm of the inverse of N squared, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is calculated as the logarithm of the inverse of the purity, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is zero because the state is Gaussian. But earlier reasoning suggests it's non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps when the state is a coherent state, the relative entropy is zero. But in this case, the state is not a coherent state, so the del_b is positive.

But perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis. Maybe the state is Gaussian. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the state is a coherent state when phi is -pi/4. Let me compute.

The state |psi> is [ cos(phi)|a> + sin(phi)|-a> ] / N.

If phi is -pi/4, then cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2.

So |psi> is [ (|a> - |-a> ) ] / sqrt(2) * 1/N.

Wait, N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 a²)).

sin(2 phi) with phi=-pi/4 is sin(-pi/2)=-1. So N= sqrt(1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)).

So N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So |psi> is [ (|0.5> - |−0.5> ) ] / (sqrt(2) * 0.6275 ) ≈ [ (|0.5> - |−0.5> ) ] / 0.882.

Hmm, but will this state be a coherent state?

Wait, perhaps if I write [ |a> - |-a> ] as a different coherent state. Let me think about it.

Wait, |a> - |-a> = (a - (-a))^something? I'm not sure.

Wait, let me compute the action of a on |psi>. If |psi> is a coherent state, then a |psi> = b |psi>, where b is the complex amplitude.

So, a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |a> + sin(phi) a |-a> ] / N.

But a |a> = a |a>, and a |-a> = (-a) |-a> because a |z> = z |z>.

So,

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |a> + sin(phi) (-a) |-a> ] / N.

But |psi> is [ cos(phi) |a> + sin(phi) |-a> ] / N.

So,

a |psi> = [ cos(phi) a |a> - sin(phi) a |-a> ] / N.

Which is a [ cos(phi) |a> - sin(phi) |-a> ] / N.

But |psi> is [ cos(phi) |a> + sin(phi) |-a> ] / N.

So unless [ cos(phi) |a> - sin(phi) |-a> ] is proportional to |psi>, which would require a condition on phi.

Wait, let me see for phi=-pi/4.

cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2.

So,

a |psi> = a [ (sqrt(2)/2 |a> ) - (-sqrt(2)/2) |-a> ] / N.

= a [ (sqrt(2)/2 |a> + sqrt(2)/2 |-a> ) ] / N.

But |psi> is [ (sqrt(2)/2 |a> - sqrt(2)/2 |-a> ) ] / N.

So, a |psi> = a [ (sqrt(2)/2 |a> + sqrt(2)/2 |-a> ) ] / N.

Which is a times [ |a> + |-a> ] / (sqrt(2) N ).

But |psi> is [ |a> - |-a> ] / (sqrt(2) N ).

Wait, so a |psi> = a [ |a> + |-a> ] / (sqrt(2) N ) = a * [ (|a> + |-a> ) ] / (sqrt(2) N ).

But |psi> is [ |a> - |-a> ] / (sqrt(2) N ). So, unless a is zero, which it's not, a |psi> is not a multiple of |psi>.

Thus, |psi> is not an eigenstate of a. Therefore, |psi> is not a coherent state, so it is non-Gaussian.

Therefore, the non-Gaussianity is non-zero. So the answer must be one of A, B, or C.

But without knowing the exact calculation, perhaps the answer is C) 1.38.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the state |psi> can be written as a squeezed state. Let me think about that.

The squeezing operator S(r) acts on the vacuum to produce a squeezed vacuum state. The squeezed vacuum state has a Wigner function that's Gaussian.

But can |psi> be written as a squeezed state?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a displaced thermal state, which is Gaussian.

But I'm stuck. Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite amplitudes, it's likely a cat state, hence non-Gaussian, making the non-Gaussianity positive.

But given the options, perhaps the correct answer is C) 1.38.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is Gaussian when phi is -pi/4. Let me think about the normalization N.

Wait, when a is zero, the state is Gaussian. For a non-zero a, it's a cat state.

But with a=0.5 and phi=-pi/4, the state is a non-Gaussian cat state.

So the relative entropy would be positive, so the nG would be positive, so the answer is not D.

Hmm.

Wait, considering that this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, meaning the state is Gaussian. But I can't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps when phi is -pi/4, the state becomes a coherent state, making nG zero.

Wait, if I plug in phi=-pi/4, a=0.5, and compute the state, perhaps it's a coherent state.

Wait, let me calculate:

phi=-pi/4,

cos(phi)=sqrt(2)/2,

sin(phi)=-sqrt(2)/2,

N= sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈0.6275.

So |psi> = [ (0.707 |0.5> ) - (0.707 |−0.5> ) ] / 0.6275.

Wait, maybe this can be written as another coherent state. Let me think of it as ( |0.5> - |−0.5> ) / N.

Wait, could this be a coherent state with a complex amplitude b? Let me see:

|b> = sum_{n} (b^n / sqrt(n!)) e^{-|b|^2/2} |n>.

If I could write |psi> as |b>, then it's Gaussian.

But I'm not sure. Let me compute the coefficients.

Wait, |0.5> is sum_{n} (0.5^n / sqrt(n!)) e^{-0.25} |n>.

|−0.5> is sum_{n} ( (-0.5)^n / sqrt(n!)) e^{-0.25} |n>.

So when I subtract them, I get:

[0.5^n - (-0.5)^n ] e^{-0.25} |n> / sqrt(n!),

divided by N.

Which, as before, for even n is zero, for odd n is 2 * 0.5^n e^{-0.25} |n> / sqrt(n!).

So,

psi = [ sum_{n odd} 2 (0.5^n / sqrt(n!)) e^{-0.25} |n> ] / N.

Which is sum_{n odd} [ 2 (0.5^n) e^{-0.25} / (N sqrt(n!)) ) ] |n>.

But a coherent state |b> would have all n terms, not just odd. So the state |psi> is not a coherent state.

Thus, it's non-Gaussian, so the relative entropy is positive, meaning the answer is not D) 0.

But without the exact calculation, I can't compute del_b. So perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not sure.


To calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) of the given Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure, we analyze the state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi)e^{-2\alpha^2}}\). The parameters are given as \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Normalization Constant \(N\):**
   - For \(\phi = -\pi/4\), \(\sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1\).
   - For \(\alpha = 0.5\), \(e^{-2\alpha^2} = e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065\).
   - Thus, \(N = \sqrt{1 - 0.6065} = \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6275\).

2. **State Structure:**
   - Substituting \(\phi = -\pi/4\), \(\cos(\phi) = \sin(\phi) = \pm \sqrt{2}/2\).
   - The state becomes:
     \[
     |\psi\rangle = \frac{\sqrt{2}/2 |0.5\rangle - \sqrt{2}/2 |-0.5\rangle}{0.6275}.
     \]
   - This is a superposition of two coherent states \(|0.5\rangle\) and \(|-0.5\rangle\), which is characteristic of a Schrödinger cat state.

3. **Gaussian vs. Non-Gaussian:**
   - Coherent states \(|a\rangle\) and \(|-a\rangle\) are Gaussian, but their superposition is generally non-Gaussian unless it reduces to another coherent state.
   - For \(\phi = -\pi/4\), the coefficients of the superposition are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. This does not simplify the state into a coherent state or any other Gaussian state (e.g., squeezed or thermal state). Therefore, the state remains non-Gaussian.

4. **Relative Entropy Measure:**
   - The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity is:
     \[
     \text{nG} = \text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
     \]
     where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state \(|\psi\rangle\), and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of the closest Gaussian reference state.
   - Since the state \(|\psi\rangle\) is non-Gaussian, \(\text{nG}\) is expected to be positive.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options:**
   - **Option D (\(\text{nG} = 0\)):** This would imply the state is Gaussian. However, the analysis shows that the state is a non-Gaussian Schrödinger cat state, so this option is incorrect.
   - **Options A (\(\text{nG} = 2.48\)), B (\(\text{nG} = 0.25\)), and C (\(\text{nG} = 1.38\)):** These represent positive non-Gaussianities, consistent with the state being non-Gaussian. Without explicit computation of the relative entropy, the exact value cannot be determined, but the non-Gaussianity is clearly positive.

### Conclusion:
The state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity (\(\text{nG}\)) is positive. Among the given options, the most plausible answer is **C (\(\text{nG} = 1.38\))**, as it aligns with the expected positive value for a Schrödinger cat state.
