Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift of a star's position as observed from Earth when it moves along its orbit. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

Wait, the formula for distance in terms of parallax is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. Oh right, because 1 parsec is the distance where 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsecond. So if the parallax is small, the star is far away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly in terms of what? Oh, I think it refers to uniform density in space, meaning the number density of stars is the same throughout. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends only on the volume.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking for how the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d (so with parallax plx) depends on plx.

Let me think about the volume involved. For a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be approximately 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the shell's volume is the difference between two spheres of radius d and d+dr, which approximates to 4πd² dr when dr is small.

But since we're dealing with parallax, plx = 1/d. So d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that into the volume equation.

The volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But wait, since plx is 1/d, a change in plx, dplx, relates to dr. Let's see: plx = 1/d, so dplx = -1/d² dr. Because the derivative of 1/d with respect to d is -1/d². So dr = -d² dplx.

Wait, but when plx increases, d decreases. So if I have a thin shell in plx space from plx to plx + dplx, it corresponds to a change in d from d to d - something. But maybe I should express dr in terms of dplx.

From plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking differential: d (d) = - (1/plx²) d(plx). So dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx). Since we're dealing with small increments, the negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But when calculating the volume, the shell's thickness dr is positive, so I should take the absolute value. So dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

Wait, but in the volume formula, the shell's volume is 4π d² dr. Substitute d = 1/plx, so d² is 1/plx². And dr is (1/plx²) dplx. So substituting:

Volume = 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the number of stars in this shell would be the number density multiplied by the volume. If the number density (stars per unit volume) is uniform, say n, then the number of stars is n * Volume.

So the number of stars per unit parallax range (dplx) would be proportional to n * (1/plx^4) dplx. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax, so maybe it's the number in a thin shell, which would be n * Volume. So the number per unit plx (d) would be n*(1/plx^4) because the dplx is the unit range.

Wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx." So it's N per (dplx), which is the number per unit plx. So from the
