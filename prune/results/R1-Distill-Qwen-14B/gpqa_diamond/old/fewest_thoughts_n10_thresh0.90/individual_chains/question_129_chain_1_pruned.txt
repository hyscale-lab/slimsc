Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions. Let's see what the steps are and how each transformation affects the structure.

First, the reaction scheme starts with compound A. When A reacts with HCN, it produces compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D, and finally, D loses an inert gas to become E.

Looking at the hints, hint a) says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, right? So the Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide (like a phosphorus ylide) with an aldehyde or ketone. So A must be a ketone because the Wittig reaction requires an aldehyde or ketone.

The product of the Wittig reaction here is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me draw this structure. Cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent attached by a double bond. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be a propene group attached via the C2? Like CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 attached to the cyclopentane?

Wait, no. The structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene). Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Propane is CH3CH2CH3. Propan-2-yl would be CH2CH(CH3)-. Wait, but ylidene is a substituent with a double bond. So propan-2-ylidene would be a substituent where the ylidene group is attached to the central carbon. So, maybe it's CH2=C(CH3)-CH2-? Or maybe it's CH2CH2 where the double bond is between the second and third carbons? Hmm, perhaps I should think of it as a substituent where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the propane, making it CH2=CHCH2-? Wait, actually, propan-2-ylidene would have the double bond starting at the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2? No, perhaps it's CH2=C-CH3? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents at 1,2-dimethyl and 4-position as a propan-2-ylidene group. So the cyclopentane has a ring, and at position 4, there's a propene substituent attached such that the double bond is between the two central carbons of the propene.

So, the Wittig reaction forms an alkene. So compound A must have been a ketone that, when reacted with a Wittig reagent, gives this product. The Wittig reagent would have a structure that would attack the carbonyl group of A to form the alkene.

Wait, but in the Wittig reaction, the ylide (the reagent) has a structure like PR3+–CH2–CH2–, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics. But the key point is that A is a ketone because the Wittig reaction targets carbonyl groups.

So, if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, then the starting material A must have been a cyclopentane ring with a ketone group, because the Wittig would add an alkene in place of the ketone.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Wittig reaction converts a carbonyl (like a ketone) into an alkene. So if the product after Wittig has an alkene, then the starting carbonyl must have been in the position where the alkene is formed.

So, if the product is a cyclopentane with substituents at 1,2, and 4, the 4 position has an alkene substituent. So the starting ketone must have been at that position, right?

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a propene substituent attached via its central carbon. So the structure would be cyclopentane with a substituent at 4 that's like CH2–C(=CH2)–CH3? Maybe not. Alternatively, the substituent is a methylene group (CH2–) attached to a cyclopentane, with a double bond to a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the ring at position 4, then a double bond between that CH2 and a CH(CH3). So the structure would be cyclopentane with substituents at 1 (methyl), 2 (methyl), and 4 (CH2–CH(CH3)).

Wait, no, the substituent at 4
