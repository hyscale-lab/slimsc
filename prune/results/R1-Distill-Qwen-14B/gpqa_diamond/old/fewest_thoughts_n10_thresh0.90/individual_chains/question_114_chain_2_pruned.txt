Okay, let's tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Let me read it again.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Wait, so the first part is an addition reaction, probably a nucleophilic addition. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition. Let's think about the reagents. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, which are nucleophiles. So butan-2-one (a ketone) reacting with NaCN would form a cyanohydrin. Oh right! Cyanohydrin formation. The reagent for that is usually an acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4, which protonates the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic so the CN- can attack.

So for the first reaction, A should be something acidic, like H3O+ or H2SO4. Looking at the options, A in options A and B is H3O+, while options C and D have NaHSO3. Hmm, wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a source of HSO3- ions. I'm not sure if that's used in cyanohydrin formation. I think H3O+ or another acid is more common. So A is likely H3O+.

Now the second reaction. The starting material is a nitrile (the -CN group) attached to a hydroxybutane group, which in turn has a benzylphenyl substituent. The product is a carboxylic acid. So, the nitrile is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents are either strong acid with H2O and heat, or using a base like aqueous H2SO4 and heat. Wait, but in this case, the reagent is B, which is H2O. So probably, it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, but the reagent is given as B (H2O). So H2O is the solvent, but what's the catalyst? Oh, right, in the presence of an acid or base. For the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, I think it's done under acidic conditions. So maybe adding HCl (H+ source) as a catalyst.

So in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O, but the catalyst is HCl. So the correct B reagent would be HCl. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option A says B is HCl, option C says B is HCl as well. So now, for the first reaction, the options are A (H3O+) and D (NaHSO3). So from earlier thoughts, the first reagent should be H3O+, so A is correct for the first.

Wait, but let me double-check. For cyanohydrin formation, the conditions are usually a catalytic acid. So H3O+ or H2SO4 would be used. Sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3) is used in other reactions, like the reduction of ketones to alcohols, or maybe in some addition reactions. But I don't think it's used for cyanohydrin formation.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+, so options A and B are possible. The second reaction uses HCl as the catalyst. So looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, which matches what I'm thinking.

Wait, but let me think again. The second reaction is hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. Another possible reagent is H3O+ (like in the first step), but the options for B are either HCl or CH3COOH. Wait, CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid.

So for the second reaction, using HCl (H+ and Cl-), perhaps as a catalyst in the hydrolysis. So B would be HCl. Looking at the options, option A (B=HCl) and option C (B=HCl) have that.

Wait, but the second reaction is written as reagent B is H2O, but in the problem statement, the reagent is B (H2O) meaning that B is the solvent, perhaps. Or maybe the reaction is done in water with another catalyst.

Wait, the second reaction's reagent is B, which is H2O. So the actual catalyst is part of B. Maybe the reagent is H2O and another acid. So B is HCl, which is the catalyst.

So putting it together, the first reaction uses H3O+ (A), and the second uses HCl (B). Looking at the options, option A says A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that fits.

Wait, but wait, another thought: sometimes, nitrile hydrolysis can be done using a base, but that would give a carboxylate. If the product is a carboxylic acid, then you need to protonate it, which would require an acid workup.

So the second reaction probably involves hydrolysis under acidic conditions. So adding HCl (a strong acid) as a catalyst makes sense.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+; for the second, B is HCl. So the correct option is A.

Wait, but let's check the options again. Option A is A= H3O+, B=HCl. Option C is A= NaHSO3, B=HCl.

Wait, would NaHSO3 work in the first reaction? I think NaHSO3 is used in the reduction of ketones to alcohols. For example, in the Clemmensen reduction, but that uses HCl with Zn(Hg). Or maybe the sodium bisulfite is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles? Or perhaps in some other reaction.

Wait, another possibility: could the first reaction be an example of the Stephen reduction? No, that involves CH3CN and a catalyst, but that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, maybe the first reaction is an example of the addition of HCN to a ketone,
