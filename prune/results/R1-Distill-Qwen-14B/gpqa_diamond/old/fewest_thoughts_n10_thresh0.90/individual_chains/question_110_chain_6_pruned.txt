Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that each spectrograph has its own brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, while HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So the stars must be bright enough for both, right? Wait, no, each can observe up to their limit. So a star visible to both would have to be within the brighter limit of the two. Since HIRES can go down to 16, and ESPRESSO can go down to 17, the star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO to see it, but wait, noâ€” wait, the wording is tricky. The question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. So apparent magnitude (how bright it appears) matters. So for ESPRESSO, m_v < 17. For HIRES, m_v < 16. So the star's apparent magnitude must be less than the higher of the two? Wait, no. Because both can only see brighter than their limits. So a star that's brighter than 17 (so magnitude less than 17) can be seen by ESPRESSO, and a star brighter than 16 can be seen by HIRES. So a star must have m_v < 17 to be seen by ESPRESSO and m_v <16 to be seen by HIRES. Wait, but the question is which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be brighter (i.e., lower number) than both 17 and 16. So the star's m_v needs to be less than 16. Because if m_v is 16.5, then it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it, but it's also brighter than 16? No, wait. Wait, no, 16.5 is brighter than 17 but dimmer than 16. Because in magnitudes, lower is brighter. So if a star has m_v=16.5, ESPRESSO can see it (since 1
