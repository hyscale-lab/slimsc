Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. The task is to find out what their energy difference should be so that we can clearly distinguish between the two energy levels.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Specifically, the energy-time uncertainty relation. The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is approximately equal to Planck's constant over 2π. Or wait, sometimes it's written as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, but I think for this purpose, it's the order of magnitude that matters.

So the formula is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. But wait, the energy-time uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≥ ħ/2. So if I have a certain uncertainty in time, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional. But in this case, the lifetimes of the states are given. So the lifetimes would relate to the uncertainty in time, right? Because the lifetime is the time during which the system is in that state, and the uncertainty in energy would be the minimum resolution needed to distinguish the two states.

Wait, so the problem is about being able to clearly distinguish two energy levels. That means the energy difference between them must be greater than the uncertainty in energy. Otherwise, the two states might appear the same due to the uncertainty.

So each state has its own lifetime. Which one do I use? The lifetimes are 1e-9 seconds and 1e-8 seconds. Hmm, the state with the shorter lifetime (E1) would have a larger energy uncertainty because ΔE is inversely proportional to Δt. So for E1, Δt is 1e-9 s, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(1e-9). For E2, Δt is 1e-8 s, so ΔE2 is about ħ/(1e-8). But wait, since E2 has a longer lifetime, its energy uncertainty is smaller. So to clearly distinguish E1 and E2, the actual energy difference must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe the maximum uncertainty, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Each state's energy is uncertain within a range. For E1, the uncertainty is ΔE1, and for E2, it's ΔE2. To clearly distinguish E1 and E2, their energy difference must be larger than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the difference is smaller than that sum, the two might overlap, making it impossible to tell them apart.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the energy difference must be larger than the individual uncertainties. Because each state's energy is uncertain, but the separation between them needs to be bigger than the individual spreads. Hmm. Let me think about it. Suppose ΔE1 and ΔE2 are their individual uncertainties. The energy difference should be greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if the energy difference is larger than both uncertainties, then the two states can be distinguished. If the difference is smaller than either, they might not be resolvable.

Wait, no. Let me look for another approach. The question is about the minimum energy difference required for the two states to be clearly resolved. So the energy resolution required is such that the difference is larger than the uncertainty in energy from the shorter-lived state. Because the shorter lifetime implies a larger uncertainty, so that's the more restrictive condition.

Let me calculate the uncertainty for each state.

Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I should probably convert units.

First, let's compute ΔE for each lifetime.

For E1: Δt = 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 ≈ ħ / (Δt) = (1.05e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) )= 1.05e-25 J.

Wait, but to convert this into eV. Since 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so 1 J is 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So ΔE1 = 1.05e-25 J * (6.242e18 eV/J) = (1.05e-25
