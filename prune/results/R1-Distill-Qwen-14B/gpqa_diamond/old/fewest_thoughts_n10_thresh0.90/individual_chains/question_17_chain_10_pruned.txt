Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The question gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex and the formation constant, KCa-EDTA. I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions.

Alright, let's think. The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. I assume that the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, I should double-check what the stoichiometry is. Oh, right, EDTA typically forms a 1:1 complex with metal ions. So each Ca-EDTA complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4- when it dissociates.

The formation constant (K) is given as 5x10^10. Wait, formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. The reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. So the formation constant K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, in this problem, the solution is of the Ca-EDTA complex, which is the product. So the dissociation would be CaEDTA^2- ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-. The equilibrium expression for dissociation would then be K_d = [Ca²+][EDTA^4-]/[CaEDTA^2-]. But K_d is the dissociation constant, which is the inverse of the formation constant. Oh right, because if K_form is [complex]/([M][L]), then K_dissoc is [M][L]/[complex] = 1/K_form.

So K_dissoc = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Now, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's set up an ICE table to find the equilibrium concentrations.

Let me denote the change as x.

At equilibrium,
[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - x
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA^4-] = x

Wait, but wait a minute. Since K_d is so small (2e-11 is a very small number), the dissociation of the complex will be minimal. So x will be very small compared to 0.02, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. That's a useful approximation because it simplifies the math.

So plugging into the K_d expression:
K_d = (x)(x) / (0.02) = x² / 0.02 = 2e-11.

Solving for x²:
x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is 4 * 1e-13. The square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is the same as 2*10^(-6.5). Let me calculate that numerically. 10^(-6.5) is the same as 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5) ≈ 1e-6 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-7. So 2e-6.5 is about 6.324e-7.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recalculate:

x² = (2e-11) * 0.02 = 0.02 * 2e-11 = 0.0000002e-11?

Wait, 0.02 is 2e-2.

So 2e-2 * 2e-11 = 4e-13. Yes, that's right. So x² is 4e-13, so x is sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5.

Wait, 2e-6.5 is 2 * (10^-6.5).

Hmm, 10^-6 is 1e-6, 10^-7 is 1e-7. So 10^-6.5 is between them. Let's compute:

10^0.5 is approximately 3.1623, so 10^-0.5 is about 0.31623. So 10^-6.5 = 1e-6 * 0.31623 ≈ 3.1623e-7. Then multiply by 2: 6.3246e-7.

So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7 M. That looks right.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the solution is 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M, and upon
