Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with Reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is reacting with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ is probably a proton source, maybe in the workup.

Wait, spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. So the structure is a spiro compound with a vinyl group attached. The starting alcohol is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. When I look at the substituents, the spiro is between a 5-membered and a 3-membered ring? Or wait, wait, the spiro notation is [3.5], which means one ring has 3 carbons (so it's a 3-membered ring?), and the other has 5, so a 5-membered ring. But wait, wait, spiro compounds count the rings as the number of carbons plus one for each. Or wait, the notation is spiro[x.y], where x and y are the number of carbons in each ring. So 3 and 5. So the first ring has three carbons, making a three-membered ring? That's a bit strained, but okay. The second ring has five, so a five-membered ring.

The compound is 1-vinyl, so a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) attached to the spiro center (position 1). And there's an enol structure—so maybe an enol is present, but wait, the formula is non-5-en-1-ol. So non is nine carbons? Wait, spiro[3.5]non-... So the non indicates nine? Let's see. Spiro[3.5]non means the two rings share a single atom (the spiro atom), and the total number of carbons is 3+5 +1 (because the spiro atom is counted once). Wait, no, the spiro[x.y]non would mean that the total carbons are x + y, but each ring is x and y, and they share one carbon, so the total is (x + y) -1 + 1 (the spiro carbon). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should just picture it as a bicyclic structure where two rings are connected at a single carbon.

When this compound reacts with KH, which is a strong base, and THF as solvent. I think this is a deprotonation reaction. The starting alcohol has a hydroxyl group. Deprotonating the alcohol would give an alkoxide. But wait, the structure is 1-vinylspiro...-1-ol. So
