Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a pretty complex organic molecule. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, how does that connect to bond energies and atomization?

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize this structure. It looks like a chain with some double bonds and branching. There are two double bonds, I think. Let me count: each 'C=C' part is a double bond. So, maybe there are two double bonds in this molecule. Oh wait, let me check. The formula is a bit long, but I think there are two C=C bonds.

The data given includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh right, atomization enthalpy is the energy required to break a bond in an element to form isolated atoms. So, for carbon, it's the bond energy for C-C bonds. But wait, if it's the atomization enthalpy, maybe it's the energy per mole to break all the bonds in the molecule into atoms. So for carbon, each C-C bond would require 1000 kJ per mole to break? Or wait, no—wait, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol for carbon. So, each C-C bond would require 1000 kJ per mole? Or is that the total for all the bonds in a mole of carbon atoms?

Wait, no, carbon in its standard state is graphite, which has each carbon bonded to three others. So the bond energy per C-C bond is part of the overall atomization. So the 1000 kJ/mol is the energy to break all the bonds in a mole of carbon into individual atoms. So each C-C bond would have a bond energy of 1000 kJ per mole divided by the number of bonds per mole of carbon. Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe the bond energies are provided directly.

Wait, looking at the given data: bond energies for H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, C-H is 400. So perhaps the enthalpy of atomization for carbon is 1000 kJ/mol, which is the bond energy for C-C bonds. Wait, but then why is the C-C bond energy given as 200 kJ/mol? Oh, perhaps the 1000 kJ/mol is the atomization energy, which would be the same as the bond dissociation energy, but per mole. So maybe each C-C bond in graphite requires 200 kJ/mol? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Atomization enthalpy is the energy required to break all bonds in a mole of a substance to produce gaseous atoms. For carbon, which is a solid with each C bonded to three others, the atomization enthalpy would involve breaking all those bonds. So each C-C bond in graphite has a bond energy of about 1000 kJ/mol divided by the number of bonds per mole. Let me think, in graphite, each carbon has three bonds, but each bond is shared between two carbons. So for one mole of C atoms, how many moles of C-C bonds are there? 

In one mole of C atoms, each has three bonds, so three moles of bonds per mole of C, but each bond is shared, so total bonds are (3/2) moles per mole of C. So the atomization energy, 1000 kJ/mol, would be the energy to break (3/2) moles of C-C bonds. So each C-C bond has an energy of (1000 kJ/mol) multiplied by (2/3), which is approximately 666.67 kJ/mol per bond. But wait, in the given data, the C-C bond energy is 200 kJ/mol. That's conflicting. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the data here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given bond energies are standard values. So, when asked to calculate the enthalpy of formation, I should use the bond energies provided, not the atomization. Wait, but the question says "Given, Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." and then gives bond energies. Maybe the problem is expecting me to use the bond energies provided, not the atomization value. Because bond energies are usually used in enthalpy of formation calculations.

Wait, the enthalpy of formation calculation using bond energies typically involves the following formula: 

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of reactant bonds) - (sum of bond energies of product bonds) 

Wait, no, actually, it's the reverse. Wait, no, wait: Enthalpy of formation is calculated from the elements in their standard states. So, for a reaction where elements combine to form the compound, the enthalpy change is the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken (elements) minus the sum of the bond energies of the bonds formed (in the compound).

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of bonds broken in reactants) × bond energy ] - [ (number of bonds formed in products) × bond energy ]

But wait, for each bond type, I have to calculate how many bonds are broken in the reactants (elements) and how many are formed in the product.

So, for example, to form 1 mole of the compound, how many moles of each bond are broken and formed.

But in the case of enthalpy of formation, the reaction is:

elements (in standard states) → 1 mole of compound

So, in this case, the reactants are the elements: carbon (graphite?) and hydrogen gas. The product is the given compound.

So, to compute ΔHf°, we calculate the total energy required to break the bonds in the elements (i.e., the bonds in the reactants) and subtract the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

Wait, more precisely:

ΔHf° = [sum (bonds broken in reactants) × bond energy] - [sum (bonds formed in products) × bond energy]

Because breaking bonds requires energy (positive), forming bonds releases energy (negative), so the overall enthalpy change is (energy in) - (energy out).

So, for the reactants (elements):

Carbon (C) is in standard state, which is graphite. Each C in graphite is bonded to three others, as I thought. So, for each mole of C, how many C-C bonds are there? Let me see: in graphite, each C is bonded to three others, but each bond is shared between two carbons. So for one mole of C atoms, the number of C-C bonds is (3/2) moles. So, per mole of C, 1.5 moles of C-C bonds.

Similarly, for H2 gas, each molecule has one H-H bond. So, per mole of H2, one mole of H-H bonds.

So, the reactants are:

1. C (graphite) → (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2
2. H2 → same product

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count all the bonds in the elements that need to be broken to form the product.

Wait, maybe I should first find out how many moles of each bond are present in the product.

So, for the product molecule:

Let's count the bonds:

Each molecule of the product has:

- Number of C-C bonds: Let's see. Each carbon in the molecule is connected via single or double bonds.

Wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: So, there's a double bond between the first and second C. Then, single bonds to two CH3 groups.
2. Then, CH2-: single bond.
3. CH(CH3)-: another CH group with a methyl branch.
4. CH2-: single bond.
5. CH=C(CH3)2: another double bond.

Wait, maybe it's better to count all the bonds in the molecule.

Let me try to count all the bonds:

Each molecule:

- Each single bond is a C-C, C-H, etc.

Let me count each type.

First, let's count the number of each type of bond.

C-C bonds:

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond. Let's go through each part.

The structure is:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the molecule as a chain with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

(CH3)2C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, I'm getting confused. Maybe drawing it isn't feasible, but I can count bonds by considering each part.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the molecule as consisting of several parts. Let me think of each segment and count the bonds.

Let me imagine the molecule as:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : part 1
2. CH2- : part 2
3. CH(CH3)- : part 3
4. CH2- : part 4
5. CH=C(CH3)2 : part 5

So, for each part:

Part 1: (CH3)2C=CH- 

- The double bond is C=C. So that's one C=C bond.

- Each CH3 group is attached to the central C. So for each CH3, there are three C-H bonds. But wait, the central C is bonded to two CH3 groups and the double bond. So:

Central C: bonded to two CH3 groups (each has three C-H), a C (from the double bond), and the next CH group.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all C-H, C-C, and C=C bonds in the entire molecule.

For each molecule:

Number of C-H bonds: Each CH3 group has 3 C-H. How many CH3 groups are there?

Looking at the formula:

(CH3)2C... plus in the middle, CH(CH3)... and at the end, another (CH3)2.

So:

- (CH3)2: two CH3 groups at the start.

- Then, the structure has another CH(CH3), which is one CH3.

- And at the end, another (CH3)2.

So that's 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 CH3 groups.

Wait, let's see:

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

That's:

- (CH3)2C=CH- : here, two CH3 on the first C.

- Then, CH- (so one C with a H).

- Then, CH2- : another CH2.

- CH(CH3)-: another CH with a CH3.

- CH2-CH=C(CH3)2: the last part is a CH connected to a C with two CH3 groups.

Wait, maybe I should count each CH3 group.

Each (CH3) is a methyl group. Let's count all CH3 groups:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: two CH3 groups.

- CH(CH3)-: one CH3.

- CH=C(CH3)2: two CH3 groups.

So that's 2 + 1 + 2 = 5 CH3 groups. Each CH3 has three C-H bonds, so 5 * 3 = 15 C-H bonds.

Wait, but wait. Some of the CH3 groups are part of larger substituents. Let me double-check:

In (CH3)2C=CH-: the central C is connected to two CH3 groups, a C (from the double bond), and the CH- part.

Then, CH- is connected to CH2, etc.

But perhaps the total number of CH3 groups is 5, each contributing three C-H bonds. So 15 C-H bonds.

Additionally, there are other C-H bonds. For example, the CH- groups.

Wait, the molecule has several CH2 and CH groups. Let me count all the C-H bonds.

Each CH3 has 3 C-H: 5 of them contribute 15.

The structure also includes:

- The CH in (CH3)2C=CH- : that's one C-H.

- The CH- in CH2-CH(CH3)-: another C-H.

Wait, no, perhaps each CH group has one C-H. Let's count all the CH groups.

Looking at the formula:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : CH has one C-H.

2. CH2- : each CH2 has two C-H bonds.

3. CH(CH3)- : CH has one C-H.

4. CH2
