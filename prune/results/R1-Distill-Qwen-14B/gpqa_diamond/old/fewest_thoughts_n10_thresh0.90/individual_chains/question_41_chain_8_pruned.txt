Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Specifically, a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are labeled A to D.

Hmm. I remember that the speed of light in a medium is generally given by c divided by the refractive index n. So in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light would be v_glass = c/n. But wait, the glass is moving relative to the lab frame, so I probably need to consider relativistic effects here because the speed is significant compared to the speed of light. Or maybe not? Because if v is much smaller than c, maybe a non-relativistic approach would work.

Wait, but the problem says the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So that's a unit system where c is 1, simplifying things. So the speed of light in the glass is 1/n in the glass's rest frame.

Now, the glass is moving at velocity v. Since the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, and the glass is moving towards the observer, how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just use Galilean addition (v_glass + v), because that doesn't account for relativistic effects.

The relativistic velocity addition formula is given by: u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, in our case, c is 1, so the formula simplifies to u' = (u + v) / (1 + u*v).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the formula right. The correct formula for transforming velocities from one frame to another moving at speed v relative to the first frame is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/c²)

Wait, wait, no. The standard formula is for when the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to frame S (the lab frame here). So if in frame S (lab), the glass is moving at velocity v, then in the glass frame (S'), the lab is moving at velocity -v.

But the light's velocity in the glass frame is u' = c/n. Wait, no, in the glass frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n, right? Because for the glass, which is at rest, the speed of light is c/n, which is 1/n in our units.

Wait, but in the glass frame (S'), the light speed is u' = 1/n. We need to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame (S), which is moving relative to S' at velocity v. So we use the velocity transformation from S' to S.

The formula is u = [u' + v] / [1 + (u' * v)/c²]. Since c is 1, that becomes [u' + v]/(1 + u' v).

So substituting u' = 1/n, we get:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Let me factor out 1/n in the numerator:

Wait, wait, perhaps I should just compute it directly. Let's write it as:

u = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + v/n )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the denominator:

Numerator becomes (1 + n v )

Denominator becomes (n + v )

So u = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v), which matches this result.

Wait, but
