Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, wait, the wavelengths are the same? Oh right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's law. Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the object. So if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because Wien's law λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So same λ_max implies same temperature.

Wait, but wait a second. If their temperatures are the same, then their luminosities would depend on their radii. Because the luminosity of a star (assuming it's a perfect black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R² times T⁴. Since T is the same for both stars, the luminosity depends on R squared.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. Let's plug that into the luminosity formula.

L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴ = 4π R2² σ T⁴ * (2.25) → Because (1.5)^2 is 2.25.

So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be 2.25. So looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. So that would be the answer, right?

Wait, but wait. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How does that affect their observed luminosities?

Oh, right! When a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift in the wavelength of the light we receive. But wait, the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed wavelength, but what matters is their intrinsic properties, like their actual temperature and radius. Because when calculating their luminosities as black bodies, you have to consider their rest frame or the observed frame?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The stars' actual temperatures are what determine their luminosity. But if one is moving towards us, the observed wavelengths are blueshifted, and if moving away, redshifted. But in this problem, after considering Doppler shifts, the peak wavelengths are observed to be the same. So that implies that their rest frame temperatures might not be the same, unless the Doppler shifts are somehow accounted for.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's say the actual temperatures are T1 and T2. But due to Doppler shifts, the observed wavelengths are shifted. The problem says they have the same observed peak wavelength, so maybe their rest frame temperatures are different, but after applying Doppler shift, the observed λ is same. So for example, if Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength would be longer than its rest frame λ, which would imply a lower temperature. Similarly, if Star_1 is moving towards us, its observed λ is shorter, implying higher T. But the problem says their observed λ_max are same.

Wait, but the problem says "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So the observed λ_max is same for both. So when they calculate the luminosity, do they use the observed temperature or the intrinsic temperature?

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me think. Because the original calculation of luminosity is based on the star's actual properties, not the observed ones. So when
