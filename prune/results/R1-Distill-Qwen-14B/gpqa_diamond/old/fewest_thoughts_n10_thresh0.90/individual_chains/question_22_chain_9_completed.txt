Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions and its reaction kinetics in acidic versus basic solutions. 

Wait, I remember that in electrochemistry, the strength of an oxidant relates to its tendency to gain electrons, right? So a stronger oxidant has a higher reduction potential. And for kinetics, it's about how fast the reaction happens, which depends on factors like activation energy, concentration, and maybe the pH of the solution.

The question says that thermodynamically, oxygen is a ….. oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts …. in acidic solutions. The options are combinations of weaker/stronger and faster/slower.

Let me split this into two parts. First, the thermodynamic part: oxygen as an oxidant in basic solutions. I think the standard reduction potential for O2 is something like 1.23 V in acidic conditions. But wait, when the solution is basic, the potential might change because the concentration of H+ ions decreases. Since the Nernst equation relates the cell potential to concentrations, in basic conditions, O2 might have a higher or lower potential?

Wait, the reaction for O2 in basic solution is probably O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^-. The standard potential for that is about 0.401 V. Wait, but wait, isn't the standard O2 reaction in acidic solution O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O with a higher potential, like 1.23 V? So in basic solution, the potential is lower because the solution isn't as acidic, right? Because the presence of OH- ions affects the reaction.

But wait, the question is about whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant. A higher reduction potential means a stronger oxidant because it's more likely to be reduced. So in acidic solution, the O2 has a higher E°, making it a stronger oxidant. In basic solution, the E° is lower, so O2 is a weaker oxidant there.

So the first blank should be 'weaker' in basic solutions. Because in basic conditions, the oxidizing power is lower than in acidic.

Now the kinetic part: oxygen reacts ... in acidic solutions. Kinetics is about the rate of reaction. Factors that affect reaction rates include the concentration of the reactant, activation energy, and the presence of catalysts. Also, in acidic solutions, H+ ions are present which could influence the reaction.

Wait, the rate of a redox reaction often depends on the concentration of ions involved. In acidic solution, maybe the ions are more available, so the reaction is faster. Alternatively, the reaction might have a higher activation energy in certain conditions.

Wait, the reaction for O2 in acidic solution is O2 + 4H+ +4e^- → 2H2O. But in basic solution, it's O2 + 2H2O +4e^- → 4OH^-. So in acidic solution, H+ is present and the reaction might proceed more quickly because the necessary ions are in higher concentration, making the reaction faster. Or maybe the activation energy is lower in acidic conditions.

But wait, another angle: the reaction rate can also depend on whether the reaction is more or less favorable. If a reaction is more thermodynamically favorable, sometimes it can proceed more quickly, but that's not always the case. The thermodynamics (ΔG) and kinetics (rate) are separate factors.

Another thought: in acidic solution, the H+ ions could make the solution more conductive, allowing electrons to move more easily and the reaction to proceed faster. Alternatively, the reaction in acidic conditions might involve more stable intermediates or transition states, lowering the activation energy.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) or ORR (oxygen reduction reaction) in different pH conditions. I remember that in acidic solutions, the O2 reaction might have a lower activation energy because of the presence of H+ ions stabilizing certain transition states or intermediates, making the reaction proceed faster.

So, in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 (as part of the redox process) would be faster. Therefore, the second blank should be 'faster'.

Putting it together: thermodynamically, O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (since E° is lower), and kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions.

Looking at the options:

Option C) weaker – faster. So that would be the correct combination.


To determine the correct combination of terms for the given statement, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions thermodynamically and kinetically.

1. **Thermodynamic Behavior**:  
   The reduction potential of oxygen depends on the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the standard reduction potential for the reaction \( \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \) is approximately \( +1.23 \, \text{V} \), making oxygen a strong oxidant. In basic solutions, the reaction shifts to \( \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \), with a lower standard reduction potential of approximately \( +0.401 \, \text{V} \). This indicates that oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Behavior**:  
   The rate of oxygen's reaction depends on the availability of ions and the solution's pH. In acidic solutions, the higher concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions increases the conductivity of the solution and stabilizes intermediates, lowering the activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the reaction is slower due to the absence of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions and the higher activation energy.

Combining these observations, thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions, and kinetically, it reacts **faster** in acidic solutions. The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
