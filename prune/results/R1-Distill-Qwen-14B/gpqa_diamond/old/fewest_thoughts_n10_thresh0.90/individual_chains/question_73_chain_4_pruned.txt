Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to relativity, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c in the positive x-direction. We need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds as you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, Einstein's velocity addition formula is needed here. The formula is a bit tricky: (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/(c²)). Wait, or is it (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)) or the other way around? Let me get that straight. Oh wait, if both are in the same direction, then for the relative speed, it's (u - v) divided by 1 minus their product over c squared. That sounds right.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, I think I might be mixing up the formula. Let me recall. The velocity of an object as seen from another frame moving at velocity v is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, no. Because if A and B are moving in the same direction, then from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) / (1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of the rest frame. Alternatively, perhaps I should treat it as the relative speed of the two as observed from one of their frames. Wait, but the problem says "relative speed" without specifying whose frame. Hmm. But I think in this context, they're asking for the speed of one as seen from the other's frame. So, for example, what's the speed of astronaut B as seen from astronaut A, or vice versa.

Wait, but in relativity, the relative speed isn't symmetric. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and B at 0.5c in the same direction, then from A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c)/(1 - (0.5c * 0.6c)/(c²)).

Wait, let's compute that numerator and denominator. Numerator: 0.5 - 0.6 = -0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.5 * 0.6) c² / c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So the speed is (-0.1 c) / 0.7 = approximately -0.142857 c. But since speed is a magnitude, it would be 0.142857 c, which is about 0.14c. Oh, so the relative speed is 0.14c. That would match option C or D, which have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Wait, but what if I did it the other way around? Suppose I compute the speed of A as seen from B's frame. Then u would be 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) )= (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 = same 0.142857 c, or about 0.14c. So same result. So the relative speed is about 0.14c.

So looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. Now, the energy part. The total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy is their relativistic energy, which is gamma times m c squared. So the total energy would be the sum of each astronaut's energy.

Wait, the problem says "the total energy of the system." So I think we need to calculate each astronaut's energy and add them up, assuming they're moving in the same direction.

So astronaut 1 has mass 2m, speed 0.6c. So gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So for astronaut 1: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 - 0.36 = 0.64. sqrt(0.64) is 0.8. So gamma is 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 is gamma * m c² for 2m? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the mass is 2m, so E1 = gamma * (2m) c². So 1.25 * 2 m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the mass is 2m, so m in the formula is 2m. So E1 = gamma * (2m) c². So 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I made a mistake there. The formula is E = gamma * m c², where m is the rest mass. So for astronaut 1, m = 2m, so E1 is gamma * (2m) c².

Similarly, astronaut 2: v=0.5c. So v²/c²=0.25. 1-0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660. So gamma is 1/0.8660 ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma * (3m) c². So 1.1547 *
