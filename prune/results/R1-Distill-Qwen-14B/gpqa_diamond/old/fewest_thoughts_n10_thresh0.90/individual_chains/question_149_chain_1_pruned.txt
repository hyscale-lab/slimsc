Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, the scenario is that I have a small peptidic compound that's been chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly like what we expect, except there are two peaks from the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we expect. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling because... I think spin-spin coupling would cause splitting into a multiplet, not two separate peaks? Or maybe because the coupling constants are similar, but the question says that the peaks are from the same alpha-proton. Hmm, maybe it's not coupling with adjacent protons but something else.

Then there's the LC-MS part. They ran the crude compound on LC-MS at elevated temperature, and saw two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching the expected molecule. So, same molecular weight, same everything else. So, what does that mean? Well, if they have the same mass, it's not a fragment or a different isomer with a lower mass. So same molecular formula, same mass.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if it was a precursor, the mass would be different, right? Because a precursor would have a larger mass. But the question says the mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule, so same mass. So A is probably not it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in the NMR, do they show different peaks? For chiral centers, the alpha protons would be in different environments. Wait, but if they're enantiomers, their NMR would be the same because they have the same chemical environment but mirrored. So the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks unless there's something else, like maybe the compound is not completely racemized or something? Or maybe if the compound is a mixture, but in the NMR, they might not split into two separate peaks. Hmm, maybe that's not it.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. So, during the formation of an amide bond, when you form a new bond, maybe there's some kind of coupling that leads to two different structures. Like perhaps an isomerization. Wait, but how would that affect the NMR? If it's a coupling that creates two different diastereomers, maybe. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh wait, maybe it's about double bonds or something else. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' refers to here. Maybe it's a misnomer, or perhaps it's a situation where two different coupling partners cause two peaks.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. But wait, in the NMR, the same alpha-proton is splitting into two. How? If the molecule has a diastereomer, the environment of the alpha-proton would be different. So you'd have two sets of peaks. But in this case, the integrals add up to 1H, so each is integrating to 0.5H? That could mean that each peak corresponds to a different diastereomer, each with one alpha-proton. So in the mixture, the two diastereomers are present, each contributing their own set of peaks for that proton. And in the LC-MS, if the two diastereomers have the same mass, which they would if they're structural isomers but not enantiomers, then they'd elute as two separate peaks with the same mass. That fits the LC-MS data.

Wait, but diastereomers would have different physical properties, so if they're present in equal amounts, their peaks would be equal in area, which matches the LC-MS part.

So looking back, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same integral (so each is 0.5H), same shift? Hmm, but diastereomers would cause different shifts. Because their structures are different, the environment of the alpha-proton would be different. So their shifts would be slightly different, which is what the question said: similar chemical shifts. So perhaps the two diastereomers have protons that are in very similar environments, leading to similar shifts. But why would they have similar shifts?

Alternatively, maybe it's the same alpha-proton in two different environments, but with similar environments, so similar shifts. So for example, maybe it's a case of axial and equatorial protons in a ring structure. No, wait, that's about conformers, which would usually average in NMR unless they're in slow exchange. Or perhaps it's a situation where the molecule is in a dynamic process, like if there's a ring opening and closing, but that's more about exchange in the NMR timescale.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. So, if the molecule has some symmetry or if the protons are equivalent in some way, but not in others. Hmm, maybe it's a case of diastereotopic protons. Wait, but diastereotopic protons are non-equivalent in a chiral environment. But if the molecule is a racemic mixture, then each enantiomer would have the same environment for each proton. Wait, but in that case, the NMR wouldn't split into two for the same proton. Unless the sample isn't pure, but that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe it's a case of a mixture of diastereomers which have the same molecular formula but different structures. So for each diastereomer, the alpha-proton
