Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It's reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI. The options given are A) 1, B) 3, C) 5, D) 0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbon atoms, H is the number of hydrogen, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. Since the product here doesn't mention any halogens or nitrogens (I think), I can maybe ignore X and N.

The reaction given is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right! That's the reaction for the hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amine, but no, wait. Or maybe it's the treatment of a carbonyl group with HI and red phosphorus. Oh wait, I think when you have a carbonyl (like a ketone or aldehyde) reacting with HI and red phosphorus, it's part of the Wittig reaction setup. Or wait, another possibility: maybe it's the reduction of the carbonyl group. Wait, no, red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles but that's not it here. Wait, another thought: maybe it's related to the addition to triple bonds or alkenes. Wait, but the starting material has a cyclohexene ring and a vinyl group, so maybe some addition is happening.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's draw its structure. So it's a cyclohexene ring. Let's number the carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2-CH2, but wait, vinyl
