Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest probability to transit because they have limited observation time. Let me try to break this down.

Hmm, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the star relative to the planet's orbit. Oh wait, more precisely, it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Because if the planet's orbit is much larger than the star, the chance that it lines up directly in front of the star from our viewpoint is lower.

The formula I think is: P = (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?) Wait, no, I think it's a bit more. Oh right! The probability is proportional to (R_star / a_planet) * (1 / (eccentricity factor)), but since both have circular orbits, eccentricity is zero, so that part is 1. So actually, the transit probability simplifies to (R_star / a_planet) * (some constant factor depending on the orbital inclination, but I think the question is considering the maximum possible, so we can ignore that for now).

Wait, no, wait. I'm a bit confusing. Let me think again. The transit probability for a planet is given by the formula P ≈ (R_star / a) * ( (1 + (R_planet / R_star)) ) approximately, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, that term is about 1. So it's roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by another factor.

Wait, no, I think the exact formula for the probability is: P = (R_star / a)² * ( (R_star + R_planet) / (a * R_star) ) ? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the geometry. The probability that we see a transit is the ratio of the area where the planet's orbit intersects the star's disk, as seen from Earth. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of the planet. Because the star's radius is much smaller than a, the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by (some factor like 1 or something else).

Wait, I think I'm mixing up some factors. Let me look it up
