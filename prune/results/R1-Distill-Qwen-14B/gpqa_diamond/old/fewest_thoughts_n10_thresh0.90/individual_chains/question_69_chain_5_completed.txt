Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. 

The question is about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime, which I think is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle, is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are all different resolutions, measured in meters.

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime. This is due to time dilation in special relativity. The formula for the dilated lifetime τ is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how does this relate to the decay resolution? Oh wait, the resolution probably refers to the minimum time resolution needed to detect the decay. Or maybe it's the minimum length over which the decay can be observed. Wait, no, the resolution in the context of particle detectors usually refers to the ability to distinguish small distances or times. Since the decay products will travel some distance before being detected, the detector must have a good enough spatial resolution to see that.

So, the particles Y⁺ and Z⁻ will fly some distance before interacting and being detected. The longer the lifetime (from time dilation), the further they can travel. The detection resolution is the smallest distance change we can measure—so to observe the decay, the particles must travel a distance that is larger than the resolution. 

Wait, but the problem states that the proper lifetime is given. So, maybe we need to calculate the speed of the decay products. Because the decay products are moving at relativistic speeds, the distance they travel before decaying (or before interacting) is important.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, perhaps 30% of the decays are such that the decay products have moved a certain distance, and the detector must have a resolution that can capture that distance. Otherwise, the decay would not be detected because the particles would move beyond the detector's ability to resolve them.

Alternatively, perhaps we're looking at the mean proper decay length and ensuring that the detector's resolution is such that it can capture a fraction of that length.

Wait, maybe I should think about the path length of the decay products. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So, knowing the lifetime (proper time) and the velocity, we can calculate the mean decay length.

But wait, the proper lifetime is given, but in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So, the lab frame lifetime τ = γ τ₀. So, the particles will travel a distance L = v * τ = v * γ τ₀.

But wait, the velocity v of the decay products—wait, X⁰ is the particle decaying. So, X⁰ has a certain energy, and from that, we can find its velocity, and because Y⁺ and Z⁻ are products, perhaps they have energies as well. Or maybe if X⁰ is at rest, but probably not since the energy is given as 27 GeV, which is the kinetic energy or total energy?

Wait, the problem says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. I'm a bit confused about what that refers to. Is it the kinetic energy of X⁰, or its total energy (rest mass plus kinetic)? I think usually in particle physics, when given energy without specifying, it's the total energy. So, E_total = 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV, so its rest energy is 3.41 GeV. Then, its kinetic energy would be E - m c², but since we're working in units where c=1, it's E = gamma m.

Wait, so the energy E of X⁰ is 27 GeV. Its rest mass is 3.41 GeV. So, gamma (γ) would be E / m = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. 3.41 * 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 * 8=27.28. So, 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.915. So, γ ≈ 7.915.

So, gamma is about 7.915. So, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀ ≈ 7.915 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 8e-16 * 8 is 64e-16, but since it's 7.915, approximately 7.915 * 8 is 63.32, so 63.32e-16 s, which is 6.332e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does that relate to the decay length? The decay length L is the distance the particle travels before decaying. So, L = v * τ.

But wait, X⁰ is the particle that's moving. Wait, no, X⁰ is the one decaying into Y⁺ and Z⁻. So, the products would be moving in the same direction as X⁰ was moving, but perhaps their velocity depends on the decay kinematics. But maybe for this problem, we can take the velocity of X⁰ as the same as that of the decay products, which might not be accurate, but perhaps an approximation.

Alternatively, since X⁰ is the one decaying, its velocity is what determines the time dilation, and the decay products will have some velocity, but maybe the problem expects us to approximate that the decay products move at speed v, same as X⁰.

Wait, but in reality, decay products would share the momentum, but their velocities would depend on the mass. But perhaps for this calculation, we can assume that the decay products have the same velocity as X⁰. Because the problem might not require detailed calculation of the decay kinematics.

So, let's proceed under that assumption.

So, first, find the velocity v of X⁰. Since X⁰ has energy E = 27 GeV and mass m = 3.41 GeV, we can find the velocity.

The total energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum. E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But since we're in units where c=1, E² = p² + m².

So, p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(27² - 3.41²) GeV. Let me compute that.

27 squared is 729. 3.41 squared is approximately 11.63. So, 729 - 11.63 = 717.37. The square root of 717.37 is around 26.78 GeV. Because 26^2 is 676, 27^2 is 729. 26.78^2 is 717.37. So, p ≈26.78 GeV.

The momentum p is also equal to gamma * m * v, since p = gamma m v. But since gamma is 7.915, m is 3.41 GeV, so v = p/(gamma m) = 26.78 / (7.915 * 3.41). Let's compute denominator first: 7.915 * 3.41 ≈ 26.99. So, v ≈ 26.78 / 26.99 ≈ approximately 0.992 c. So, v is about 0.992 times the speed of light.

So, v ≈0.992 c.

Now, the lifetime in the lab frame is τ = gamma τ₀ = 7.915 * 8e-16 s ≈ 6.332e-15 s.

So, the average decay length L would be v * τ. So, L = 0.992 c * 6.332e-15 s.

Compute that. Let me compute c in m/s. c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So, L = 0.992 * 3e8 m/s * 6.332e-15 s.

Let me compute that:

First, multiply 0.992 *3e8 = 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply 2.976e8 m/s by 6.332e-15 s.

2.976e8 * 6.332e-15 = (2.976 * 6.332) * 1e-7.

2.976 *6.332: Let's see. 3*6=18, but more accurately:

2.976 *6.332 ≈ 2.976 *6 = 17.856; 2.976 *0.332 ≈ 0.987. So total around 18.843.

So, 18.843e-7 meters, which is 1.8843e-6 meters.

Wait, 1e-7 is 1e-7, so 18.843e-7 m is 1.8843e-6 m, approximately 1.88e-6 meters.

So the average decay length is about 1.88e-6 meters.

But the question is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So, perhaps we need to find the length that corresponds to 30% of the mean decay length, or maybe the length where 30% of the decays are within that length, so that the detector can capture that.

Wait, I think I need to recall something about the decay probability. The probability of a decay happening within a certain length would relate to the decay's exponential distribution. The decay length L is a random variable, and the probability P(L < l) = 1 - e^(-l / λ), where λ is the mean decay length.

Wait, the decay length distribution is exponential. So, the probability that a decay occurs within a distance l is P = 1 - e^(-l/λ). We want P >= 0.3, so 1 - e^(-l/λ) >= 0.3 → e^(-l/λ) <= 0.7 → -l/λ <= ln(0.7) → l >= -λ ln(0.7).

Compute ln(0.7): natural log. 0.7 is about 0.703... Let me think, ln(0.7)= about -0.3567. So, -ln(0.7)=0.3567.

So, l >= λ * 0.3567.

So, the minimum l is λ * (1 - 0.7) → wait, wait, no. Let me re-express:

From P = 1 - e^(-l/λ) >= 0.3 → e^(-l/λ) <= 0.7 → -l/λ <= ln(0.7) → l >= -λ ln(0.7).

But ln(0.7) is negative, so -ln(0.7) is positive. So, l >= λ * |ln(0.7)|.

So, the minimum l is λ * (0.3567) → Wait, wait, no, because ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, so -ln(0.7)=0.3567.

So, l >= λ * 0.3567.

So, the minimum decay length l_min that captures 30% of the decays is about 0.3567 times the mean decay length λ.

Wait, but wait, the mean decay length is λ = v * τ = L we computed earlier, which is about 1.88e-6 m.

So, l_min = λ * 0.3567 ≈ 1.88e-6 * 0.3567 ≈ let's compute that. 1.88 *0.3567 ≈ 0.6706. So, 0.6706e-6 m, which is 6.706e-7 m.

But wait, I think I might have messed up the logic. Because to capture 30% of the decays, we need l such that the probability of decaying within l is 30%. So, P=0.3. So, e^(-l/λ ) = 0.7 → l = λ * ln(1/0.7) → which is λ * ln(10/7) ≈ 0.3567 λ. So, yes, that's what I did.

So, l_min ≈ 0.3567 * 1.88e-6 m.

Wait, 1.88e-6 is 1.88μm. 0.3567 * 1.88e-6 ≈ 0.67e-6 m, which is 0.67μm.

But wait, the options are 2.08e-6 m, 2.08e-9 m, etc. Hmmm. So, 0.67e-6 is about 6.7e-7 m, which is 0.67 μm. The options don't have that. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the proper decay length, not the lab frame. No, because the proper lifetime is given, but the movement is in the lab frame. So, I think the approach is correct.

Wait, but perhaps the velocity of the decay products is different. Oh, wait, perhaps I should calculate the velocity of the decay products Y and Z, not the parent particle X⁰. If X⁰ is moving at v, and it decays into Y and Z, which are lighter particles, then their velocities would be different. But maybe the problem expects us to take the velocity as the same as X⁰'s.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum resolution in terms of the proper lifetime, but I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the time resolution needed to measure the decay. Because to observe the decay, the detector must have a time resolution such that it can measure the decay time with an uncertainty that captures the decay properly.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." So, perhaps it's about the time resolution. Because the lifetime is τ, and the minimum time resolution (Δt) needed is such that 30% of the decays are within Δt. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, but the problem gives the proper lifetime, τ₀. So, the lab frame has τ = γ τ₀. The decay time distribution is exponential, so the probability that a decay happens within time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-t/τ). So, to have 30% probability, we set P=0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - e^(-t/τ) → e^(-t/τ) = 0.7 → t = -τ ln(0.7) ≈ τ * 0.3567.

So, the minimum time resolution needed is t_min = τ * 0.3567 ≈ 7.915 * 8e-16 s * 0.3567.

Wait, compute that: 7.915 *8e-16=63.32e-16 s=6.332e-15 s. Then 6.332e-15 * 0.3567 ≈ 2.26e-15 seconds.

But how does this relate to the spatial resolution? Because the decay happens over a time, and the spatial resolution is the minimum distance change you can detect. So, if the decay time is measured with a certain uncertainty, the spatial resolution would be v * Δt, where Δt is the uncertainty in the time measurement.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about how much the decay products can spread during their lifetime, and the detector needs to have a spatial resolution better than that to see the decay.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach it differently.

The decay length is L = v * τ. But to observe the decay, the decay products must travel a distance that's detectable. So, the minimum resolution (spatial) should be such that L is at least a certain value so that the detector can see the track.

Wait, but the problem says 30% of the decays. So, perhaps we need to find the length which corresponds to 30% of the particles decaying before that length, so that the detector can see the decay. So, the minimum resolution would be that length.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the uncertainty in the decay point. The detector has a certain spatial resolution, so to see the decay, the decay products have to be within a certain distance from the interaction point.

Wait, but I'm not exactly confident about the approach. Let me try to re-examine the problem.

The problem states: "What minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays?" I think "resolution" here refers to the ability to distinguish the decay vertex from the interaction point. So, the decay must occur within a certain distance, and the detector's resolution must be good enough to detect that.

So, the decay length L is the average distance. So, 30% of the decays will have a decay length less than some L_min, and the detector must be able to resolve that.

But earlier calculations gave L as about 1.88e-6 m (1.88 micrometers). But the options are 2.08e-6 m (2.08 micrometers), which is close to our computed value.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations. Our computed decay length was about 1.88e-6 m, but the option A is 2.08e-6 m. So, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me compute v and τ more accurately.

First, compute gamma more precisely.

E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV.

gamma = E/m = 27 / 3.41.

Let me compute 27 / 3.41:

3.41 * 7 = 23.87

3.41 * 7.9 = 3.41*(7 +0.9) =23.87 + 3.069 =26.939.

So, 7.9 *3.41 =26.939. Since 27 is 0.061 more than 26.939, so 7.9 + (0.061 /3.41 ) ≈7.9 + 0.0179≈7.9179. So, gamma≈7.9179.

So, τ = gamma * τ0 =7.9179 *8e-16 s≈6.3343e-15 s.

Velocity v: p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2)=sqrt(729 - 11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.782 GeV.

p = gamma * m * v → v = p/(gamma m).

p is 26.782 GeV, gamma 7.9179, m=3.41 GeV.

So, v=26.782/(7.9179 *3.41).

Compute denominator: 7.9179 *3.41 = approx.

7 *3.41=23.87.

0.9179 *3.41 ≈3.13 (since 0.9*3.41=3.069, 0.0179*3.41≈0.061, so 3.069+0.061=3.130).

So, 23.87 +3.13=27. So, denominator is 27.

So, v=26.782/27 ≈0.992 GeV/(GeV) → velocity ≈0.992 c.

So, v=0.992c.

So, decay length L= v * τ = 0.992c *6.3343e-15 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, 0.992 *3e8 =2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3343e-15 s:

2.976e8 *6.3343e-15 = (2.976 *6.3343) * 1e-7.

Compute 2.976 *6.3343:

2.976 *6 = 17.856.

2.976 *0.3343 ≈ 2.976*0.3=0.8928, 2.976*0.0343≈0.1019. So, 0.8928+0.1019=0.9947.

Total: 17.856 +0.9947=18.8507.

So, 18.8507e-7 m → which is 1.88507e-6 m.

So, L≈1.885e-6 m, which is 1.885 micrometers.

But the options are 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers.

Hmm. So, why is there a discrepancy? Perhaps I made a miscalculation in gamma or something else.

Wait, let me compute gamma again. E=27, m=3.41.

gamma = 27 /3.41 = let's compute it accurately.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41= approx 0.9178.

So, gamma =7 + 0.9178=7.9178.

So, the gamma is correct.

Wait, what about the velocity? v= p/(gamma m).

p=26.782 GeV.

gamma m=7.9178 *3.41=26.999 GeV.

So, v=26.782 /26.999 = approx 0.99198 c.

So, v=0.99198 c.

Then, L= v * tau=0.99198 *3e8 m/s *6.3343e-15 s.

Compute that:

0.99198 *3e8=2.97594e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.3343e-15 s: 2.97594e8 *6.3343e-15.

2.97594 *6.3343 ≈ let me compute accurately.

2.97594 *6 =17.85564.

2.97594 *0.3343= approx.

2.97594 *0.3=0.892782.

2.97594 *0.0343≈0.10191.

So, 0.892782 + 0.10191=0.994692.

Total:17.85564 +0.994692=18.850332.

So, 18.850332e-7 m → 1.88503e-6 m.

So, L≈1.885e-6 m.

But the options are 2.08e-6 m. So perhaps the problem expects us to calculate with a different approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the proper decay length instead. Wait, no, because proper lifetime is for the rest frame. The decay length is in the lab frame, so we must have considered the time dilation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation for gamma. Let me compute gamma again.

gamma = 27 /3.41.

3.41 *7 =23.87.

27-23.87=3.13.

3.13 /3.41 = let's compute it as 3.13 ÷3.41.

3.41 goes into 3.13 about 0.917 times.

So, gamma=7.917, same as before.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the decay length as the mean proper decay length multiplied by gamma.

Mean proper decay length would be c * tau0. So, c *8e-16 s= 3e8 m/s *8e-16 s =2.4e-7 m=240 nm.

Then, decay length in lab is gamma * c tau0=gamma *240 nm.

gamma=7.917 → 7.917*240 nm= approx 1900 nm=1.9 micrometers. Which is what I calculated earlier.

But the options have 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers.

Wait, perhaps the exact gamma is 27/(3.41)=7.917857..., so more precisely, 7.917857.

So, 7.917857 *240 nm = ?

240 *7.917857 ≈ 240 *7.918 ≈ let's compute:

240 *7=1680 nm.

240 *0.918=240*(0.9 +0.018)=216 +4.32=220.32 nm.

Total:1680 + 220.32=1900.32 nm, which is 1.90032 micrometers. Approximately 1.900 micrometers.

But the option given is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. That's higher than our calculation. So, perhaps the problem is considering something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the decay length, but about the time resolution needed to observe the decay. Let me think again.

The proper lifetime is 8e-16 s. The lab frame lifetime is gamma *tau0=7.9178 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

To observe the decay, the detector must have a time resolution (delta t) such that the decay can be detected within delta t. But how does this relate to the 30%?

Wait, the probability P that a decay occurs within a time t is 1 - e^(-t/tau). So, for t to capture 30% of the decays, set P=0.3.

t = -tau * ln(1-0.3) = tau * ln(10/7) ≈ tau *0.3567.

So, tau=6.334e-15 s.

t_min=6.334e-15 *0.3567≈2.26e-15 s.

But the spatial resolution needed would be v * delta_t, where delta_t is the time resolution needed. So, delta_L= v * t_min.

v=0.99198c≈2.9759e8 m/s.

delta_L=2.9759e8 m/s *2.26e-15 s= (2.9759 *2.26)e-7 m.

2.9759 *2.26≈6.728.

So, delta_L≈6.728e-7 m=0.6728e-6 m=0.6728 micrometers.

But again, the options are 2.08e-6 m, which is about 2.08 micrometers. So, this approach doesn't give the needed option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Or perhaps the problem expects the mean decay length as the resolution. Because 30% would imply that perhaps the minimum is the mean decay length multiplied by a factor.

Wait, earlier calculation gives the mean decay length as approximately 1.88e-6 m. The closest option is A) 2.08e-6 m. So, perhaps the exact calculation gives 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate more accurately.

Let me recompute gamma:

gamma = E/m =27 /3.41.

3.41 *7.917=27.000 exactly? Let's compute 3.41 *7.917.

Wait, 3.41 *7=23.87.

3.41 *0.917=?

3.41 *0.9=3.069.

3.41 *0.017=0.05797.

So, total 3.069 +0.05797=3.12697.

So, 3.41 *7.917=23.87 +3.12697=26.99697≈26.997 GeV.

So, gamma=27 GeV /3.41 GeV=7.917857.

So, tau=gamma *tau0=7.917857 *8e-16=63.342858e-16 s=6.3342858e-15 s.

v= p/(gamma m).

p= sqrt(E^2 -m^2)=sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2)=sqrt(729 -11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.782 GeV.

gamma m=7.917857 *3.41=26.997 GeV.

v=26.782 /26.997= approx 0.99195 c.

c=3e8 m/s.

So, v=0.99195 *3e8=2.97585e8 m/s.

Decay length L= v * tau=2.97585e8 m/s *6.3342858e-15 s.

Compute 2.97585e8 *6.3342858e-15.

Multiply 2.97585 *6.3342858:

2.97585 *6=17.8551.

2.97585 *0.3342858= approx 0.994 (earlier calculation).

So, total is 17.8551 +0.994=18.8491.

So, L=18.8491e-7 m=1.88491e-6 m≈1.885e-6 m.

But the option is 2.08e-6 m, which is about 20% higher than my calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the mean decay length multiplied by a factor to get the minimum resolution. For example, using the formula for the probability, perhaps we can find the length where the probability is 30% and then find the resolution needed.

Wait, the probability P that the decay occurs within length L is P=1 - e^(-L/lambda), where lambda is the mean decay length. We want P=0.3.

So, 0.3=1 - e^(-L/lambda) → e^(-L/lambda)=0.7 → L= -lambda ln(0.7)= lambda * 0.35667.

So, for lambda=1.885e-6 m, L=1.885e-6 *0.35667≈6.71e-7 m=0.671e-6 m=0.671 micrometers.

But that's even smaller than the mean decay length, so the resolution must be at least that.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the question is asking for the mean decay length, not the minimum.

Wait, if the question is about the minimum resolution to observe at least some fraction of the decays, perhaps they're asking for the mean decay length, and the option is the closest.

But the mean decay length is 1.885e-6 m, but option A is 2.08e-6 m. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recheck.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the speed of the decay products, which might have a different gamma. Because when X⁰ decays, Y⁺ and Z⁻ will have some velocities. However, without knowing their masses, maybe the problem assumes that the decay products have the same speed as X⁰.

But wait, the particles Y and Z must have a combined momentum equal to X⁰'s momentum, due to conservation of momentum. So, if X⁰ is moving at v, the decay products must have a net momentum in the same direction. But without knowing their masses, it's hard to compute their velocities.

But perhaps the problem expects us to proceed with the assumption that the decay products have the same velocity as X⁰, which would make the calculation manageable.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum time resolution, not the spatial resolution. So, the time needed to observe 30% of the decays.

Wait, but the question mentions resolution, which is typically spatial in detectors. So, perhaps the spatial resolution must be such that 30% of the decays are within that distance.

But back to the problem. The computed L is approximately 1.885e-6 m. The option A is 2.08e-6 m, which is close. So, perhaps the exact calculation would give 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, perhaps because I used more precise values, the exact result is 2.08e-6 m.

Wait, wait. Let me compute L precisely.

Using precise calculation:

gamma =27 /3.41 =7.917857...

tau=7.917857 *8e-16 =63.342858e-16 s=6.3342858e-15 s.

p= sqrt(27^2 -3.41^2) =sqrt(729 -11.6281)=sqrt(717.3719)=26.78204 GeV.

v=p/(gamma * m) =26.78204/(7.917857 *3.41) =26.78204 /26.997=0.99195 c.

Thus, v=0.99195 *3e8 =2.97585e8 m/s.

Decay length L= v * tau =2.97585e8 m/s *6.3342858e-15 s.

Compute 2.97585e8 *6.3342858e-15.

This is 2.97585 *6.3342858 *1e-7.

Compute 2.97585 *6.3342858:

Let me compute 2.97585 *6 =17.8551.

2.97585 *0.3342858: 

Compute 2.97585 *0.3 =0.892755.

2.97585 *0.0342858≈0.101909.

So sum:0.892755+0.101909=0.994664.

Total:17.8551 +0.994664=18.849764.

So, 18.849764e-7 m=1.8849764e-6 m≈1.885e-6 m.

Hmm, so exact calculation still leads me to 1.885e-6 m.

But the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m

B) 2.08e-9 m

C) 2.08e-1 m

D) 2.08e-3 m

So, none of the options match my calculation. The closest is option A, but it's about 10% higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should have used beta gamma instead of gamma. Wait, beta is v/c, so beta*gamma is (v/c)*gamma.

Wait, beta =v/c=0.99195.

Beta * gamma= 0.99195 *7.917857≈7.848.

Wait, the decay length is c * beta gamma tau0.

So, L= c * beta gamma tau0.

Compute that: c=3e8 m/s.

beta gamma=7.848.

tau0=8e-16 s.

So, L=3e8 *7.848 *8e-16.

Compute 3e8 *7.848=2.3544e9.

Multiply by 8e-16: 2.3544e9 *8e-16=1.8835e-6 m.

Which is 1.8835e-6 m, same as before.

Hmm. So, again, I get 1.88e-6 m.

So, if the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the decay length multiplied by a factor based on the required probability, but I thought that was already accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic gamma incorrectly. Wait, let me check: gamma is indeed E/(m c²), and since we're using units where c=1, it's E/m.

Yes, so gamma=27/3.41=7.917857.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considered the energy as 27 GeV/c², but I don't think that affects the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is about the minimum time resolution. Let's compute the time resolution needed to observe 30% of the decays.

Wait, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is 6.334e-15 s. The time resolution delta_t is such that 30% of the decays are observed within delta_t.

So, using P=0.3=1 -e^(-delta_t/tau).

So, delta_t= tau * ln(1/(1-0.3))= tau * ln(10/7)=6.334e-15 *0.3567≈2.26e-15 s.

But how does this relate to spatial resolution? The spatial resolution would then be v * delta_t.

v=0.99195 c≈2.97585e8 m/s.

So, delta_L=2.97585e8 m/s *2.26e-15 s= (2.97585 *2.26) e-7 m.

2.97585 *2.26≈6.722.

So, delta_L≈6.722e-7 m=0.6722e-6 m=0.6722 micrometers.

But this is still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays, which would mean that the detector must have a resolution (spatial) such that at least 30% of the decay products are within that length. So, the minimum resolution required is the length where 30% of the decays occur beyond that. Wait, no, that would require a longer length.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the mean decay length and use that as the required resolution.

But the mean decay length is 1.88e-6 m. So, perhaps the answer is 1.88e-6 m, but the option is 2.08e-6 m. So, perhaps the problem expects a different approach.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of another angle. The question says 'minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.' So, perhaps the minimum is the length that 30% of the decays have occurred beyond that point, so the detector can't see them. So, the detector must have a resolution better than that length to capture those 30% that have decayed beyond it.

Wait, but that would require the detector to resolve the decay point up to that length.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the decay probability in terms of the proper time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the speed of the decay products as c, which would give a longer decay length. Let me compute that.

If v=c, then L=c * tau =3e8 m/s *6.334e-15 s=1.9002e-6 m.

That's about 1.9e-6 m, which is 1.9 micrometers. Still not matching the option.

Wait, but the option is 2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. So, perhaps the problem used gamma as 27/(3.41) =7.917, then computed L =gamma *c *tau0=7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute that:7.917 *3e8=2.3751e9.

2.3751e9 *8e-16=1.9001e-6 m=1.9 micrometers.

But again, no match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the mean lifetime as gamma times tau0, but the decay length is just beta gamma c tau0. So, beta gamma is approximately 0.99195 *7.917≈7.848.

So, L=7.848 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

So, 7.848 *3e8=2.3544e9.

2.3544e9 *8e-16=1.8835e-6 m=1.8835 micrometers.

So, again, same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem considers that the mean life is gamma^2 tau0. No, that's incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the lab frame velocity as measured in the X⁰ rest frame, which would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic Doppler effect for time, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the minimum time resolution, but the options are in meters, so that can't be.

Hmm. I'm stuck. My calculations keep leading me to about 1.88 micrometers, but the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m, which is 2.08 micrometers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer is 1.88e-6 m. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the gamma.

Wait, let me recompute the gamma.

E=27 GeV, m=3.41 GeV.

gamma=E/m=27/3.41.

Compute 27 ÷3.41.

3.41 ×7=23.87.

27−23.87=3.13.

3.13/3.41=0.9178.

So, gamma=7.9178.

So, correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the velocity as (p c)/E.

Wait, because p=E beta/(c), and gamma = E/(m c²). So, velocity v= beta c= (p c²)/(E).

Wait, p= sqrt(E² -m² c^4)/c.

Wait, in units where c=1, p= sqrt(E² -m²).

So, v= (p c²)/(E) )= (p c²)/(E) → but since c=1, it's (p c²)/(E) = (p c²)/(E). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute beta as (p c²)/(E).

Because beta= v/c = (p c²) / (E).

So, p=26.782 GeV/c (if we're considering units where c=1, then p=26.782 GeV).

So, beta= (26.782 GeV/c * c²) / (27 GeV) )= (26.782 * c )/(27 GeV) * GeV → units cancel, gives beta=26.782 /27=0.991925.

So, beta=0.991925, which is consistent with earlier calculation.

So, v= beta c=0.991925 c.

So, tau=gamma tau0=7.9178 *8e-16=6.334e-15 s.

So, L=beta c gamma tau0 =0.991925 *3e8 m/s *7.9178 *8e-16 s.

Compute 0.991925 *3e8=2.975775e8 m/s.

Multiply by tau=6.334e-15 s.

Wait, no, L=beta gamma c tau0.

Wait, another formula: L= beta gamma c tau0.

So, beta=0.991925, gamma=7.9178.

beta gamma=7.848.

c tau0=3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m.

So, L=7.848 *2.4e-7=1.8835e-6 m=1.8835 micrometers.

Again, same result.

So, I'm confident that the correct answer is approximately 1.88e-6 m, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the minimum resolution in terms of the momentum or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the proper time resolution.

Wait, but the problem says 'minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays.' So, perhaps it's about the minimum time resolution needed. So, the minimum time delta_t such that 30% of the decays are observed within delta_t.

As before, delta_t= tau * ln(10/7)=6.334e-15 *0.3567≈2.26e-15 s.

The spatial resolution would then be v * delta_t=0.991925 *3e8 m/s *2.26e-15 s= 0.991925 *3e8=2.975775e8 m/s *2.26e-15= (2.975775 *2.26 )e-7 m=6.727e-7 m=0.6727e-6 m=0.6727 micrometers.

But again, the closest option is A)2.08e-6 m, which is about three times larger than this.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the question is about the maximum distance the decay products can travel before the detector can no longer resolve them. So, the detector must have a resolution (spatial) such that at least 30% of the decays are within that distance. So, the minimum resolution is the length where 30% of the decays occur within it.

Wait, but earlier we found that the length where 30% of the decays occur is approximately 6.7e-7 m, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimum time resolution, but the options are in meters. So, perhaps the question is misworded.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the proper decay length, which is c * tau0=3e8 m/s *8e-16 s=2.4e-7 m=240 nm. 240 nm is 2.4e-7 m, which is 0.24 micrometers.

But this isn't any of the options.

Wait, the options are:

A) 2.08e-6 m → 2.08 micrometers.

B) 2.08e-9 m →2.08 nanometers.

C) 2.08e-1 m →20.8 cm.

D) 2.08e-3 m →2.08 mm.

So, option A is about 2 micrometers, which is in the same ballpark as our 1.88e-6 m.

So, perhaps the intended answer is option A.

But why would there be a discrepancy? Maybe the problem expects to calculate using gamma as 27/(3.41) ≈7.917, then compute L=gamma * c * tau0.

So, L=7.917 *3e8 m/s *8e-16 s.

Compute 7.917 *3e8=2.3751e9 m/s.

2.3751e9 *8e-16=1.90008e-6 m=1.90008 micrometers.

Which is close to option A's 2.08e-6 m.

But 1.9 is not 2.08. So, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as calculating gamma*m.

Wait, gamma m=7.917 *3.41≈26.997 GeV.

Wait, but I don't see how that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem used an approximate value for gamma, perhaps 8, leading to:

gamma=8.

So, L=8 *3e8 *8e-16=8*3e8=2.4e9; *8e-16=1.92e-6 m=1.92 micrometers. Still not matching.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem expects us to compute the minimum possible resolution as the mean decay length multiplied by the natural logarithm factor, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the calculation to use the momentum directly without considering gamma.

Wait, perhaps the decay length is L= p * tau0 * c / m.

Wait, p=26.782 GeV/c.

tau0=8e-16 s.

m=3.41 GeV/c².

So, L= (p * tau0 * c) / m.

But in units where c=1, it's L= p tau0 / m.

p=26.782 GeV/c.

tau0=8e-16 s.

m=3.41 GeV/c².

So, L= (26.782 GeV/c *8e-16 s )/(3.41 GeV/c²) )= (26.782 *8e-16 /3.41 ) * (GeV *s)/(GeV/c² *c )= (26.782 *8e-16 /3.41 ) * (c² *s)/c = (26.782 *8e-16 /3.41 ) * c s.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps considering L= (p * tau0 * c)/(m).

p=26.782 GeV/c.

tau0=8e-16 s.

m=3.41 GeV.

So, L= (26.782 GeV/c *8e-16 s * c ) / (3.41 GeV).

The GeV cancels, c cancels with 1/c.

So, L= (26.782 *8e-16 )/(3.41 ) m.

Compute 26.782 *8=214.256.

214.256 /3.41≈62.83.

So, L=62.83e-16 m=6.283e-15 m=6.283 femtometers. That doesn't make sense.

No, that's way too small; the decay length should be in micrometers.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps the intended answer is option A)2.08e-6 m.


To determine the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of the particle \( X^0 \) in the CERN Bubble Chamber, we analyze the decay process and calculate the decay length in the lab frame. The proper lifetime of \( X^0 \) is given as \( \tau_0 = 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \), and its energy is \( E = 27 \, \text{GeV} \) with a rest mass \( m = 3.41 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay length \( L \) is the average distance the decay products travel before being detected, and the resolution must be sufficient to capture at least 30% of these decays.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Relativistic Factor \( \gamma \):**
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{E}{m} = \frac{27}{3.41} \approx 7.917
   \]

2. **Lab Frame Lifetime \( \tau \):**
   Using time dilation, the lifetime in the lab frame is:
   \[
   \tau = \gamma \tau_0 = 7.917 \times 8 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{s} \approx 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Momentum \( p \):**
   The momentum of \( X^0 \) is calculated using the relativistic relation \( E^2 = p^2 + m^2 \):
   \[
   p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2} = \sqrt{27^2 - 3.41^2} \approx 26.782 \, \text{GeV}
   \]

4. **Velocity \( v \):**
   The velocity of \( X^0 \) is:
   \[
   v = \frac{p}{\gamma m} = \frac{26.782}{7.917 \times 3.41} \approx 0.99195 \, c
   \]

5. **Decay Length \( L \):**
   The decay length in the lab frame is:
   \[
   L = v \tau = 0.99195 \times 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \times 6.334 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s} \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
   \]

6. **Minimum Resolution for 30% Decays:**
   The probability of a decay occurring within a distance \( L \) is given by:
   \[
   P = 1 - e^{-L / \lambda}, \quad \text{where } \lambda = v \tau
   \]
   For \( P = 0.3 \), solving \( 0.3 = 1 - e^{-L / \lambda} \) gives:
   \[
   L = \lambda \ln\left(\frac{1}{1 - 0.3}\right) = \lambda \ln\left(\frac{10}{7}\right) \approx \lambda \times 0.3567
   \]
   Substituting \( \lambda = 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \):
   \[
   L \approx 1.885 \times 10^{-6} \times 0.3567 \approx 6.71 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}
   \]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \)):** This is close to the calculated decay length (\( 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \)) and is the most reasonable choice.
- **Option B (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \)):** This is far too small and unrealistic for the given setup.
- **Option C (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-1} \, \text{m} \)):** This is excessively large and irrelevant to the problem.
- **Option D (\( 2.08 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \)):** This is also much larger than the calculated decay length and is not appropriate.

### Conclusion:
The minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays is best approximated by **Option A**. While the exact calculation yields \( 1.885 \, \mu\text{m} \), the closest match to the provided options is \( 2.08 \, \mu\text{m} \).

Answer: A
