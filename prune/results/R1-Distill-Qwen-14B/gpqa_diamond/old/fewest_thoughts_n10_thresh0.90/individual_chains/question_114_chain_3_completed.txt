Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question involves two reactions, and I need to select the correct reagents (A and B) from the options given. 

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm. I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile, often used in nucleophilic substitution reactions. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. So, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to a carbonyl group.

Wait, in the first reaction, butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When NaCN is added, perhaps it's a nucleophilic addition. The CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, adding to it. The carbonyl oxygen would then have a negative charge, which would pick up a proton. But wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(O-)CN. Then, maybe in acidic conditions, the hydroxyl group is protonated and leaves as water, but that would give a ketone again. Wait, but the product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me think about that structure. The nitrile group is at the end, so maybe the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Or perhaps it's (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2CN? Wait, no, the formula for 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile is CH2-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2-CN. No, wait, but butanenitrile is four carbons. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but in this case, the butanenitrile is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl, so the structure is probably (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN. Wait, no, but butanenitrile is four carbons, so the nitrile is on the fourth carbon. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2C(OH)-CH2-CN? That would be five carbons, but the name is butanenitrile, which is four carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. So, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but that's probably 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile, but the question says butanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating the structure, and I should focus on the reaction.

So, the first reaction is a nucleophilic addition of CN- to the ketone. The product is a cyanohydrin. Wait, yes! When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (like NaCN) in a nucleophilic addition, it forms a cyanohydrin. The reaction is typically done in a basic solution, but sometimes under acidic conditions as well.

Wait, the general reaction of a ketone with CN- is: R2CO + CN- → R2C(OH)CN. So, that would give the cyanohydrin. But what's the role of reagent A here?

Wait, I think the reaction of ketones with HCN (which is a source of CN-) typically requires an acid catalyst, like H2SO4 or H3O+. So, maybe reagent A is H3O+ which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, allowing the CN- to attack. So, in the first step, butan-2-one plus HCN (but here it's NaCN, probably in an acidic solution) would form the cyanohydrin. So, reagent A is H3O+.

But wait, the options given for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. So, looking at the options, in options A and B, A is H3O+, whereas in C and D, A is NaHSO3.

Wait, but another possibility is that reagent A acts as a catalyst. For the formation of cyanohydrin, sometimes an acid like H2SO4 is used. So, H3O+ is a source of H+.

So, for the first reaction, I think A is H3O+.

Now, moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So, that's a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. The reaction is with reagent B, which is H2O, and the product is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So, from nitrile to carboxylic acid. How does that happen? Well, typically, nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. If it's under acidic conditions, it forms a carboxylic acid. If under basic, it forms a carboxylate, which can then be acidified.

Wait, the product is a carboxylic acid, so the hydrolysis must be done in acidic conditions. But the reagent is B, which is H2O, but perhaps with an acid catalyst.

Wait, but the reagent B is given as H2O, but the reaction conditions may involve an acid. Looking at the options, B can be HCl or CH3COOH.

Alternatively, the second reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. The nitrile group (CN) is at the end of a chain. Wait, but the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Wait, the structure is something like R-C(OH)-CH2-CH2-CN? No, wait, the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, which probably has the structure (PhCH2Ph)C(OH)CH2CN? Or maybe the nitrile is on the same carbon as the hydroxyl group. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the reaction.

So, the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid. For that, hydrolysis is needed. The typical conditions are either strong acid or strong base followed by acid work-up.

In the presence of H2O, perhaps with an acid catalyst, the nitrile would hydrolyze to the carboxylic acid. So, the reagent B is H2O in the presence of an acid. So, B must be the acid. But the options for B are HCl or CH3COOH.

Wait, but the problem states that reagent B is (H2O), but that's probably the solvent, and the acid is the catalyst. Wait, no, looking back, the way the question is written: "2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) ---> ...". So, the reagent is B, which is H2O. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps B is the acid, which is added along with water.

Wait, perhaps in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+ (proton source), and in the second reaction, the reagent is an acid (like HCl) to catalyze the hydrolysis of the nitrile to the acid.

So, the second reaction is the hydrolysis of nitrile to carboxylic acid. The conditions for that are typically H2O with HCl (acidic conditions) or with a base followed by acid. But in this case, since the product is a carboxylic acid, it's probably done under acidic conditions. So, B would be HCl.

Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, which fits.

Wait, but let me think again. What's the exact reaction? The second reaction is:

R-CN → R-COOH

This would involve hydrolysis. The general reaction is:

R-CN + H2O → R-COOH (under acidic conditions)

So, the reagent B is H2O, but in the presence of an acid catalyst (like HCl). So, the reagent would be HCl, which is option A: B=HCl.

So, putting it all together: first reaction uses H3O+ as A, and the second uses HCl as B.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl → fits.

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH → B is acid, but why not HCl? Not sure.

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl → A isn't H3O+.

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH → same issue.

So, option A seems correct: A is H3O+ and B is HCl.

Wait, but I remember that another possibility for the first reaction is that NaCN is used under specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe the first reaction isn't just about nucleophilic addition but something else.

Wait, but the product is a cyanohydrin, which is formed by the addition of HCN to a ketone. So, that's correct. So, H3O+ is the correct acid catalyst for that.

So, the answer should be option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.

Wait, but wait another thought. What if the second reaction uses a different catalyst? For nitrile to carboxylic acid, the common reagents are H2O with HCl or H2SO4.

So, yes, B being HCl as a catalyst would make sense. So, in option A, B is HCl, which is correct.


The question involves two reactions, and the goal is to determine the correct reagents (A and B) from the given options.

### Reaction 1:
The first reaction involves butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone, forming a cyanohydrin. The reaction typically requires an acid catalyst to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Among the options, **H₃O⁺** (a source of H⁺) is the suitable acid catalyst for this reaction. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺.

### Reaction 2:
The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (H₂O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is the hydrolysis of a nitrile group (CN) to a carboxylic acid (COOH). Such hydrolysis typically occurs under acidic or basic conditions. Since the product is a carboxylic acid, the reaction must proceed under acidic conditions. Among the options, **HCl** is the appropriate acid catalyst for this reaction. Therefore, B = HCl.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A:** A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl  
  This matches the requirements for both reactions.  
- **Option B:** A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH  
  While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is not the strongest acid catalyst for the nitrile hydrolysis.  
- **Option C:** A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl  
  A (NaHSO₃) is not suitable for the first reaction, as it is not an acid catalyst for cyanohydrin formation.  
- **Option D:** A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH  
  Both A and B are incorrect for their respective reactions.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
