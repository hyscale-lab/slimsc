Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the pH is ideal, which I think means that the EDTA is in its correct protonation state for the complex to form properly. The temperature is 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think that affects much here. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex is given as 5x10^10. So I need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions like Ca²+ and forms a complex. The formation constant, Kf, tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher K means it's more stable. So in this case, the K is quite large, which suggests that most of the EDTA and calcium would be tied up in the complex.

Wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let me write that as [Ca-EDTA] = 0.02 M. But I'm supposed to find [Ca²+], the free calcium ions.

The complex is probably [Ca(EDTA)]^2−, because EDTA typically has a charge of 4− when deprotonated enough to form the complex. So when it binds Ca²+, it gives a complex with charge 2− (since 4− + 2+ = 6−? Wait, no. Wait, Ca²+ is +2. EDTA in the Y^4− form. So when they combine, it's CaY^2−. Right, because +2 + (−4) gives a complex with charge −2? Or wait, Ca²+ has +2 charge, Y^4− has −4, so CaY^2− would have a charge of (2+) + (4−) = 2−. No, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Calcium is Ca²+ and EDTA is Y^4−. So when they combine, the complex would be CaY^2−: Ca²+ + Y^4− → CaY^2−. So the charge is 2−, because 2+ (Ca) + 4− (Y) = 6−, but wait, no. Oh wait, no—the formula would be CaY^2−. So charge is −2. Because Ca²+ (charge +2) and Y^4− (charge -4) combine to give a complex with charge -2? Wait, that doesn't add up. Because 2+ + 4− = 6−, so the complex would have a charge of -2? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is CaY^2−, so the charge is 2−.

But maybe I don't need to worry about the charge because the Kf is given. I think the key here is to use the formation constant expression.

The formation constant Kf is given by:

Kf = [CaY²−] / ( [Ca²+][Y^4−] )

But wait, in solution, we have the Ca-EDTA complex and the dissociated forms. But the problem states that the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So [CaY²−] is 0.02 M.

Now, EDTA exists in different protonation states depending on pH. But the problem says pH is ideal, so perhaps the most common form is Y^4−, which is the one that forms the complex. So in this case, we can assume that [Y^4−] is the main species, and maybe other forms are negligible. Or perhaps the solution considers that all EDTA is in the Y^4− form because the pH is right. So for simplification, I can consider [Y^4−] as a certain value.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give me the concentration of EDTA. Hmm, that's tricky. Wait, no, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex, which is the same as the concentration of the complex being 0.02 M. So if the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that all EDTA is in the form of Y^4−, then the concentration of Y^4− would be equal to the concentration of Ca²+ multiplied by the concentration of the complex divided by Kf.

Wait, maybe I should set up the equation properly. Let me denote:

Let [Ca²+] = x.

The concentration of the complex [CaY²−] is given as 0.02 M.

The formation constant expression is:

Kf = [CaY²−] / ( [Ca²+][Y^4−] )

But in this case, the EDTA is already in the Y^4− form because the solution is ideal pH, so when all the EDTA is Y^4−, the concentration [Y^4−] would be equal to the concentration of free EDTA in solution. Wait, but how much EDTA is present?

Ah, wait. The solution is 0.02 M in Ca-EDTA complex. So the concentration of CaY²− is 0.02 M.

But in solution, the EDTA could also be in other forms, but if the pH is ideal, then perhaps all EDTA is in the Y^4− form. So the total EDTA (free + complex) would be equal to the concentration of
