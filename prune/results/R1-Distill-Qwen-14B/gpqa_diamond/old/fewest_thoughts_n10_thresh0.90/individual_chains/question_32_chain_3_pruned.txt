Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I think that's like Lithium-6 or something? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, let me think. Lithium usually has 3 protons. So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it Li-6, right? Because 3 protons + 3 neutrons is 6, so Li-6. Okay, so I need to find the energy of the collider when the speed is 0.96 times the speed of light.

I remember that in relativity, when particles are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their energy isn't just kinetic; it's the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. Oh right, the total energy is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, calculated as 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared).

Wait, but wait. The problem says the energy of the RHIC is so that the speed is 0.96c. So I think the question is asking for the total energy of the nucleus. Or is it the kinetic energy? Hmm, the way the question is phrased, I think it's the total energy because when colliders are referred to by their energy, it's usually the total energy each beam has. So each nucleus has energy E, which is gamma * m c squared.

So first, I need to find gamma when v is 0.96c. Let's calculate gamma. The formula is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So plugging in v = 0.96c, we get (v²/c²) = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714. Wait, wait, let me check: 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1, right? Because 3.5714 × 0.28: 3.57 * 0.28 = let's see, 3 * 0.28 is 0.84, 0.57 * 0.28 is ~0.16, so total ~1.0. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately. Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So 1 - 0.96^2 = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. Square root is sqrt(0.
