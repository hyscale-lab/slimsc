Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because particle physics isn't my strongest subject. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process involving a particle X⁰. 

The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A through D, each with different resolutions.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think this has to do with the particle's lifetime from the lab frame perspective. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame.

The formula for time dilation is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. And γ is equal to E/mc², but since we're given energy and mass in GeV, maybe units will work out. Wait, but in particle physics, energy E is often considered equal to γ m c², right? Because E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since we're dealing in units where c is 1 (GeV and GeV/c² mass), perhaps the units simplify.

Wait, but wait, the energy given is the energy of the X⁰ particle in the lab frame. So E = 27 GeV. Its rest mass is 3.41 GeV. So γ is E/(m c²). But since c is 1 in these units, E in GeV is the same as the total energy. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. Let's say about 7.917.

So the dilated lifetime τ is γ τ₀, which is 7.917 * 8e-16 seconds. Let me compute that. 7.917 *8= around 63.336, so 63.336e-16 seconds, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but why do I need this? Because the lifetime affects how far the particle travels before decaying. The distance L is v * τ, where v is the particle's velocity.

Hmm, but wait, what's the speed? Since the particle is moving relativistically, v is approximately c (since γ is about 8, so beta is close to 1). So v ≈ c = 3e8 m/s.

So the distance L is approximately c * τ. So L = c * γ τ₀.

Wait, but let me compute that. c is 3e8 m/s, τ is 6.3336e-15 s. So L = 3e8 * 6.3336e-15 = let's compute 3 *6.3336 =19 approx, and 1e8 *1e-15 is 1e-7. So 19e-7 meters, which is 1.9e-6 meters. So 1.9e-6 meters is 1.9 micrometers.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think the resolution should be such that we can distinguish the decay products' paths. But wait, no, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Because 30% refers to the fraction of decays observed, which relates to the detection efficiency. But I'm a bit confused. Wait, maybe the time resolution isn't the issue but the spatial resolution.

Wait, another approach: The proper lifetime is τ₀, so the particle's lifetime in the lab frame is τ = γ τ₀, as I thought before.

The distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * τ. But v = β c, so L = β c τ.

Wait, but how does this relate to the resolution? Oh, wait, maybe the question is about the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying, because if the chamber's resolution is better than that, you can see the decay products. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the minimum time resolution required to detect the decay, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the time resolution. Because if the lifetime in the lab frame is longer, but if the detector's time resolution is not good enough, you might not see the decays. But I'm not so certain.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying. Because if the chamber has
