Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC accelerates heavy ions to very high speeds. 

Wait, nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Li is lithium, right? So the isotope would be Li-6 because Li typically has 3 protons and 3 neutrons makes it Li-6. So the mass number A is 6. 

The speed is given as 0.96c, which is pretty close to the speed of light. I think I'll need to use the relativistic equations here. Oh right, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times m c squared, but wait, the question is about kinetic energy or total energy? Because RHIC's energy usually refers to the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says "energy of the RHIC", so I think it's the kinetic energy. But sometimes in these problems, they might refer to total energy. Hmm. I need to clarify that. Oh, wait, in particle accelerators, the energy given is usually the kinetic energy. So yes, I should calculate the kinetic energy.

But wait, let me think again. The problem states the speed is 0.96c, which is relativistic. So we can't use non-relativistic formulas. The kinetic energy (K) is given by (gamma - 1) * m c^2, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. 

Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. So v is 0.96c, so v²/c² is (0.96)^2 = 0.9216. 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 (since 0.28^2=0.0784). So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Then the kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) * m c². 

Wait, but what's the rest mass of the nucleus? The nucleus is Li-6, so its mass is approximately 6 times the mass of a proton, but actually, a neutron is slightly heavier. Hmm, but for such calculations, I think the mass is approximately the same as 6 times the proton mass. Wait, no, protons and neutrons have similar masses. So the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is about 6 * (proton mass + neutron mass)/2? No, wait, each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². So the mass of Li-6 is 6 * 938 MeV/c² ≈ 5628 MeV/c². But wait, the exact number might matter for precision, but the options are given to about 4 decimal places, so maybe I should be precise here.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of lithium-6 can be found using the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is approximately 931.49 MeV/c². So 6.015 u * 931.49 MeV/u = let's compute that. 

6 * 931.49 = 5588.94 MeV. 0.015 * 931.49 ≈ 13.97235 MeV. So total is approximately 5602.91 MeV = approx 5.60291 GeV/c². 

So m c² is about 5.60291 GeV. 

Now, the kinetic energy K is (gamma -1) * m c². Gamma was 3.5714. So gamma-1 is 2.5714. 

So K ≈ 2.5714 * 5.60291 GeV. Let me calculate that. 

2.5714 * 5.60291. Let me compute step by step. 

5 * 2.5714 = 12.857. 0.60291 *2.5714 ≈ 1.551. So adding them: 12.857 +1.551 ≈14.408 GeV. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, because 2.5714 *5.6 is around 14.4. But looking at the options, the highest is around 23 GeV. Hmm, did I make a mistake?

Wait, no. Wait, I think I confused the units. Wait, the problem says the energy is in GeV, but in the question, the speed is given as 0.96c. So I think I miscalculated the mass. Let me double-check the mass calculation.

Wait, no, the mass of the lithium nucleus is correct. 6.015 u is correct for Li-6. 6.015 *931.49 MeV is about 5602.91 MeV, which is 5.60291 GeV. So that's correct. 

Wait, but perhaps I should use the more precise value of gamma. Let me recalculate gamma accurately. 

v = 0.96c. So v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c². 

1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 exactly, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1/0.28 = exactly 3.57142857... So gamma is approximately 3.57143.

So gamma -1 = 2.57143.

So K = 2.57143 * 5.60291 GeV.

Let me compute this more accurately. 

5.60291 * 2.5 = 14.007275.

5.60291 * 0.07143 = ?

Wait, 5.60291 * 0.07 = 0.3922037.

5.60291 * 0.00143 = approximately 0.008002.

So adding that, 0.3922037 + 0.008002 = 0.4002057.

So total K is approximately 14.007275 + 0.4002057 = 14.40748 GeV.

Wait, but the options are all higher than that. The options are A) 18.475, B)23.069, C) 20.132, D)21.419. Hmm, 14 GeV isn't matching any. So I must have made a mistake. 

Wait a second, perhaps I was wrong to assume that the energy is the kinetic energy. Maybe the question is asking for the total energy (gamma * m c²) instead. Because if that's the case, then:

Total energy E = gamma * m c² = 3.57143 *5.60291 ≈ ?

Let me compute that: 

3 * 5.60291 = 16.80873.

0.57143 *5.60291.

0.5 *5.60291 = 2.801455.

0.07143 *5.60291 ≈ 0.40123.

So 2.801455 + 0.40123 ≈ 3.202685.

Adding to 16.80873: 16.80873 +3.202685≈20.0114 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close. But wait, perhaps I did the gamma calculation wrong. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Wait, v=0.96c. So beta is 0.96. Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So no problem there. So total energy is 3.57142857 *5.60291 GeV.

Wait, 5.60291 *3.57142857.

Let me compute 5.60291 *3 =16.80873.

5.60291 *0.57142857 ≈5.60291 *0.5=2.801455, and 5.60291*(0.07142857)= ~0.4002056. So 2.801455 +0.4002056=3.20166.

So total E=16.80873 +3.20166=20.01039 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.010 GeV. But the option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the mass calculation.

Wait, maybe the mass of the lithium-6 nucleus is more accurately computed. Let me check the exact mass.

The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015023 atomic mass units (u). 1 u is 931.494095 MeV/c². So 6.015023 u * 931.494095 MeV/u = ?

Let me compute that precisely.

6 * 931.494095 = 5588.96457 MeV.

0.015023 *931.494095 = 

Let me compute 0.01 *931.494095 =9.31494095.

0.005 *931.494095 =4.657470475.

0.000023 *931.494095 = approximately 0.021424364.

Adding these: 9.31494095 +4.657470475 =13.972411425 +0.021424364≈13.9938358.

So total m c² is 5588.96457 +13.9938358 =5602.9584 MeV =5.6029584 GeV.

So m c² =5.6029584 GeV.

Now, E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6029584.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.6029584.

Let me compute step by step.

3 *5.6029584 =16.8088752.

0.57142857 *5.6029584.

Compute 0.5 *5.6029584=2.8014792.

0.07142857 *5.6029584≈ 0.4010125.

Adding those: 2.8014792 +0.4010125=3.2024917.

So total E=16.8088752 +3.2024917≈20.011367 GeV.

So approximately 20.011 GeV. The options don't have this exact, but option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me check the exact gamma.

Wait, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2).

Wait, 0.96 squared is 0.9216. 1 -0.9216=0.0784. sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28=3.571428571... correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total energy as the sum of kinetic plus rest, but no, because the total energy is already gamma m c^2. Oh wait, perhaps the question refers to the kinetic energy. Let me compute that.

Kinetic energy K= (gamma -1) m c².

Gamma is 3.57142857, so gamma -1=2.57142857.

So K=2.57142857 *5.6029584.

Compute:

2 *5.6029584=11.2059168.

0.57142857 *5.6029584 ≈ Let's compute 0.5 *5.6029584=2.8014792, 0.07142857 *5.6029584≈0.4010125.

So K= (2.57142857) *5.6029584 = 2.57142857 *5.6029584.

Wait, 2.571... *5.6029584.

Let me compute it more accurately.

2 *5.6029584 =11.2059168.

0.57142857 *5.6029584.

0.5 *5.6029584=2.8014792.

0.07142857 *5.6029584≈ 0.07142857 *5=0.35714285; 0.07142857 *0.6029584≈≈0.043053.

So 0.35714285 +0.043053≈0.4002.

So 0.57142857 *5.6029584≈2.8014792 +0.4002≈3.2016792.

Total K=11.2059168 +3.2016792=14.407596 GeV.

So K≈14.408 GeV. But none of the options match this. The options are all higher. Hmm. So perhaps the energy in the question is the total energy, not the kinetic. Then it would be about 20 GeV. So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV. But our calculation is 20.011 GeV. Hmm. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass. Maybe the mass of Li-6 is not 6.015 u. Let me double-check. The atomic weight of Li-6 is approximately 6.015 u. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but could the problem be using a different value for c? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rest mass energy as the energy, but that would be about 5.6 GeV, which isn't an option.

Wait another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the energy per nucleon, but no, the question states nucleus X, so it's the entire nucleus.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the gamma more accurately. Let me compute gamma using more precise calculation.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.9216) =1/sqrt(0.0784).

Compute sqrt(0.0784). 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt is exactly 0.28. So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571...

So that's precise. So no error there.

Wait, perhaps the actual mass of lithium-6 is a bit higher. Let me check precise values. The exact mass of Li-6 is 6.015023 atomic mass units. Let me compute 6.015023 u * 931.494095 MeV/u.

6 *931.494095 =5588.96457 MeV.

0.015023 *931.494095.

Compute 0.01 *931.494095=9.31494095.

0.005 *931.494095=4.657470475.

0.000023 *931.494095=0.021424364.

Adding these: 9.31494095 +4.657470475=13.972411425 +0.021424364=13.993835789 MeV.

So total is 5588.96457 +13.993835789 =5602.9584058 MeV =5.6029584058 GeV.

So m c²=5.6029584 GeV.

So E = gamma * m c² =3.57142857 *5.6029584 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication accurately.

3.57142857 *5.6029584.

Let me break 3.57142857 down into 3 + 0.5 + 0.07142857.

3 *5.6029584 =16.8088752.

0.5 *5.6029584 =2.8014792.

0.07142857 *5.6029584.

Compute 0.07 *5.6029584=0.392207088.

0.00142857 *5.6029584= approx 0.008002.

So 0.392207088 +0.008002=0.400209088.

Adding all parts: 16.8088752 +2.8014792 =19.6103544 +0.400209088=20.0105635 GeV.

So E≈20.01056 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. That's a little higher. Hmm. Did I make a mistake? Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is supposed to use more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.96c, so beta is 0.96, but I might have used an approximate value for gamma. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute gamma as 1/(sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2)).

Wait, 0.96^2=0.9216, so 1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly, so gamma=3.57142857.

So no error there.

Wait, maybe the problem refers to the energy per nucleon. No, the question says the nucleus X. So the energy is for the nucleus, not per nucleon.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the mass of the nucleus. Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, so total mass is 6 nucleons. But the actual mass is slightly less than 6*(proton mass + neutron mass) because of binding energy, but in this case, for a rough calculation, the mass is taken as 6.015 u, which includes the binding energy. So I think I did that correctly.

Hmm, but according to the precise calculation, the energy is approximately 20.01056 GeV, which is about 20.011 GeV. But the option closest to this is option C)20.132 GeV. Hmm, but that's a bit higher. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me re-calculate gamma with more precise beta.

Wait, beta is 0.96, so beta^2 is 0.9216.

1 - beta^2 =0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So gamma is 3.57142857.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the kinetic energy as the total energy. Wait, no, because the kinetic energy is about 14.4 GeV, which isn't matching any option. Hmm.

Alternatively, could the question have a typo and the speed is 0.98c? Because with beta=0.98, gamma is about 5, which would give a higher energy. But that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for the mass. Let me think: perhaps it's using the mass of a single lithium nucleus as 6 * (mass of a proton + neutron). The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, neutron is about 1.008665 u. So for Li-6, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

So total mass is 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

But wait, the actual atomic mass is 6.015023 u. So it's lighter than the sum of individual protons and neutrons, which is expected due to binding energy.

So if someone uses the sum of 6.047823 u, the mass would be higher. Let's see what happens.

Compute m c²: 6.047823 u *931.494095 MeV/u.

6 *931.494095 =5588.96457 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494095 = let's compute 0.04 *931.494095=37.2597638.

0.007823 *931.494095≈7.3008 MeV.

So 37.2597638 +7.3008=44.56056 MeV.

Total m c²=5588.96457 +44.56056=5633.52513 MeV=5.63352513 GeV.

Then, E=gamma * m c^2=3.57142857 *5.63352513.

Compute 3 *5.63352513=16.90057539.

0.57142857 *5.63352513.

0.5 *5.63352513=2.816762565.

0.07142857 *5.63352513≈0.403728.

So adding, 2.816762565 +0.403728≈3.220490565.

So total E=16.90057539 +3.220490565=20.121066 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.121 GeV. Now, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is very close. So perhaps the problem uses the sum of individual proton and neutron masses without considering binding energy, which leads to a higher mass. So the correct answer would be option C)20.132 GeV.

But I'm a bit confused because the actual mass of Li-6 is 6.015 u, not 6.047 u. So why would the problem use the sum of individual masses? Maybe the question expects to use the atomic mass. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact value of gamma.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation. Let's compute gamma as 1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) with more precise steps.

sqrt(1 - 0.96^2) = sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 3.57142857.

So earlier calculation for E when m c²=5.602958 GeV is 20.01056 GeV, which is 20.01056 GeV. But none of the options match this exactly, except perhaps option D is 21.419, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, the options are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, only option C is close. Another thought: perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula without considering that it's a nucleus. Wait, no, because the nucleus is a composite particle, but the mass is already accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but earlier that gives about 14.4 GeV, which isn't an option. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation when using the exact mass. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.6029584 GeV precisely.

Let me compute it as 3.57142857 *5.6029584.

Breaking it down:

Multiply 3.57142857 by 5.6029584.

Using a calculator approach:

3.57142857 ×5.6029584

= (3 + 0.57142857) ×5.6029584

=3×5.6029584 +0.57142857 ×5.6029584

=16.8088752 +3.2016792

=20.0105544 GeV.

So approximately 20.01055 GeV.

But the options don't have that. Now, the options are given to four decimal places, so the correct calculation should match one of them. Let's see the options again:

A) 18.475 GeV

B)23.069 GeV

C)20.132 GeV

D)21.419 GeV

Hmm. 20.01055 is closest to option C, but not exactly. Wait, perhaps I should carry the calculation to more decimal places.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the mass is being calculated without considering that the nucleus is moving, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, let me think: maybe the problem is using the mass in a different unit. Wait, no, I converted u to GeV correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for c². But I think the standard conversion is 931.494 MeV/u to GeV.

Another thought: perhaps I should compute beta as v/c=0.96, but I mistakenly used beta as 0.96c. No, v=0.96c, so beta is 0.96.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the rest mass of the entire nucleus, which is correct. So the calculation should be as before.

But the exact calculation gives about 20.011 GeV, but option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the mass more accurately. Let me re-calculate the mass of Li-6.

Li-6 has an atomic mass of 6.015023 u.

So 6.015023 u *931.494095 MeV/u.

Compute 6.015023 ×931.494095.

Let me compute this as:

6.015023 ×931.494095 = ?

Let me compute 6 ×931.494095 = 5588.96457 MeV.

0.015023 ×931.494095.

0.01 ×931.494095=9.31494095.

0.005 ×931.494095=4.657470475.

0.000023 ×931.494095=0.021424364.

Adding these: 9.31494095 +4.657470475=13.972411425 +0.021424364=13.993835789 MeV.

So total is 5588.96457 +13.993835789 =5602.9584058 MeV =5.6029584058 GeV.

So that's correct.

Hmm. I'm not sure why the calculation is giving 20.0105 GeV, which isn't exactly any of the options. But option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but not exact.

Wait, perhaps I should consider more precise gamma calculation. Let me compute gamma with more precise steps. Wait, beta is 0.96. So let me compute gamma =1/(sqrt(1 - 0.96^2))=1/sqrt(1 -0.9216)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.571428571428571...

So gamma is exactly 3.571428571428571.

So E=gamma * m c² =3.571428571428571 *5.6029584058 GeV.

Let me compute this multiplication precisely.

3.571428571428571 ×5.6029584058.

Let me break it into parts:

3 ×5.6029584058 = 16.8088752174.

0.571428571428571 ×5.6029584058.

Compute 0.5 ×5.6029584058=2.8014792029.

0.071428571428571 ×5.6029584058.

Compute 0.07 ×5.6029584058=0.3922070884.

0.001428571428571 ×5.6029584058≈0.008002.

So 0.3922070884 +0.008002=0.4002090884.

Adding to 2.8014792029: 2.8014792029 +0.4002090884=3.2016882913.

So total E=16.8088752174 +3.2016882913=20.0105635087 GeV.

So E≈20.01056 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the kinetic energy. Let me re-calculate kinetic energy.

K=(gamma -1) * m c².

Gamma=3.571428571.

So gamma-1=2.571428571.

So K=2.571428571 ×5.6029584058.

Compute 2 ×5.6029584058=11.2059168116.

0.571428571 ×5.6029584058.

Compute 0.5 ×5.6029584058=2.8014792029.

0.071428571 ×5.6029584058≈0.4002090884.

So 2.8014792029 +0.4002090884=3.2016882913.

So K=11.2059168116 +3.2016882913=14.4076051029 GeV.

Which is approximately 14.4076 GeV, which doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed as 0.98c instead of 0.96c. Let me check what E would be if beta is 0.98.

Beta=0.98, beta^2=0.9604. 1 - beta^2=0.0396. sqrt(0.0396)=0.199. Gamma=1/0.199≈5.0251.

Gamma=5.0251.

E=5.0251 ×5.6029584 ≈5.0251×5.603≈28.17 GeV. Hmm, that's not matching any options either.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99c. Let me compute gamma for beta=0.99.

Beta=0.99, beta^2=0.9801. 1-beta^2=0.0199. sqrt(0.0199)=0.141067. Gamma=7.0928.

E=7.0928 ×5.6029584≈7.0928 ×5.603≈39.74 GeV. Still not matching any options.

Hmm. So I'm going back, the only option close to our calculation is C)20.132 GeV, but our calculation is 20.0105 GeV. The difference is about 0.12 GeV, which is about 120 MeV. That's a noticeable difference, but perhaps the problem expects us to use the sum of individual nucleon masses without considering binding energy.

Wait, if I use the sum of 3 protons and 3 neutrons' masses instead of the actual atomic mass, the mass would be higher. Let me compute that scenario.

Proton mass: 1.007276 u.

Neutron mass: 1.008665 u.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons: 3*(1.007276 +1.008665) =3*(2.015941)=6.047823 u.

So m c²=6.047823 u *931.494095 MeV/u.

6 *931.494095=5588.96457 MeV.

0.047823 *931.494095 ≈0.047823×931.4941=44.58 MeV.

So m c²=5588.96457 +44.58=5633.54457 MeV=5.63354457 GeV.

Now, E=gamma * m c²=3.57142857 *5.63354457.

Compute:

3 *5.63354457=16.90063371.
