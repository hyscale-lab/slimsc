Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, because in quantum mechanics, states are supposed to be normalized. Hmm, maybe I should check that later.

Then there are two operators, P and Q. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The matrix for Q is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Hmm, so I think I need to find the probabilities of those outcomes and then multiply them if they're independent, but wait, no, because the state after measuring P will collapse into a specific state, which affects the measurement of Q.

Wait, no, the measurements are sequential. So first, after measuring P, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on that new state would give the probability for -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the combined probability of first measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the dependencies here. Let me think through each step.

First, I think I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 because when P is measured, the state collapses to one of its eigenstates. So the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the initial state.

Wait, but wait. Let me find the eigenvalues of P first. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, maybe it's easier to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues can be read off, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the question is focused on the probability of getting P=0, perhaps the matrix P has 0 as an eigenvalue. Let me compute the eigenvalues of P.

Hmm, the matrix P is:
Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, that's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and since it's real and symmetric, its eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues. The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I)=0.

So,

| -λ    1/sqrt(2)      0     |
|1/sqrt(2)   -λ    1/sqrt(2)|
| 0     1/sqrt(2)    -λ     |

Hmm, calculating the determinant:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [...] 

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row.

So,

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))^2 ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0.

So,

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * ( -λ / sqrt(2) )

Simplify each term:

First term: -λ (λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)/2

Second term: -(1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ)/(2)

So overall, determinant equation is:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0 → -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ (-λ² +1 )=0 → λ (1 - λ²) = 0.

So eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Ah, so P has eigenvalues 0, 1, -1.

So when someone measures P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, or -1.

So the probability of getting 0 is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to 0 in the initial state.

But wait, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1). Let me check if it's normalized.

Compute the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state should be normalized. Probably, it is |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * (-1, 2, 1).

Wait, I think the initial state is given as a column vector, which is (-1, 2, 1). So to make it a valid quantum state, it should be normalized. So the actual state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So any calculations should use this normalized state.

Now, I need to find the eigenvectors of P for each eigenvalue.

Let me find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v =0.

So the equations are:

1st row: (0)v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 +0*v3 =0 → v2 =0.

2nd row: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 =0.

3rd row: 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 +0*v3=0 → v2=0. Which is consistent.

So from 2nd equation: v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to (1, 0, -1). Let me check: substituting into P.

P * (1,0,-1) ?

First component: 0*1 + 1/sqrt(2)*0 +0*(-1) =0 → yes.

Second component:1/sqrt(2)*1 +0*0 +1/sqrt(2)*(-1) = (1 -1)/sqrt(2) = 0 → yes.

Third component: 0*1 +1/sqrt(2)*0 +0*(-1)=0 → yes. So yes, (1,0,-1) is an eigenvector for λ=0.

But we might have to normalize it.

The norm of (1,0,-1) is sqrt(1 +0 +1) = sqrt(2). So normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) (-1, 2, 1).

Wait, so to find the probability of measuring P=0, I need to compute the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector |v0> for λ=0.

So |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The inner product is <v0 | ψ> = [1/sqrt(2) * (-1) / sqrt(6) ] + [0*2/sqrt(6)] + [ (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1)/sqrt(6) ) ].

Wait, no, wait. Actually, |v0> is the eigenvector. So the inner product is <v0 | ψ>.

So:

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1)/sqrt(6) + 0 * (2)/sqrt(6) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1)/sqrt(6)

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2) * sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-2) ] / (sqrt(12)) )

Simplify sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so denominator 2 sqrt(3).

So (-2)/(2 sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/3). So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Wait, but wait. The initial state is ( -1, 2, 1 ) → normalized by 1/sqrt(6). So when I compute <v0 | ψ>, I have to take the conjugate transpose of v0 and multiply by ψ.

But all the vectors given are real, so it's just the dot product.

So the inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2))* (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + ( -1/sqrt(2) )*(1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-1) -1 ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) ) → -1/sqrt(3).

So the magnitude squared is (1/3). So the probability of P=0 is 1/3. So that's the first part.

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the system collapses into the state |v0>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, I need to measure Q on this new state and find the probability of getting -1.

The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

Matrix Q is diag(1, 0, -1). So the eigenstates are |e1>=(1,0,0), |e2>=(0,1,0), |e3>=(0,0,1).

So when we measure Q in the state |v0>, the probability of getting -1 is the square of the amplitude of |e3> in |v0>.

So |v0> is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

The component along |e3> is (-1/sqrt(2)).

The amplitude is (-1/sqrt(2)), so the probability is (1/2).

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 after P=0 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0.

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequential measurements of the observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given quantum state. The initial state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}(-1, 2, 1)^T \), which is normalized. The operator \( P \) has eigenvalues \( 0, 1, -1 \), and the operator \( Q \) is diagonal with eigenvalues \( 1, 0, -1 \).

### Step 1: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \) of \( P \) corresponds to the eigenvector \( |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \), normalized to have unit length. The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |v_0\rangle \) in \( |\psi\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The magnitude squared is:

\[
|\langle v_0 | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to the state \( |v_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1, 0, -1)^T \). The operator \( Q \) is diagonal, so its eigenstates are the standard basis vectors \( |e_1\rangle = (1, 0, 0)^T \), \( |e_2\rangle = (0, 1, 0)^T \), and \( |e_3\rangle = (0, 0, 1)^T \). The eigenvalue \( -1 \) corresponds to \( |e_3\rangle \).

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( |e_3\rangle \) in \( |v_0\rangle \). The component of \( |v_0\rangle \) along \( |e_3\rangle \) is \( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \), so the amplitude is \( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \). The probability is:

\[
\left|\frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}\right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Answer: D
