Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with sodium hydroxide. So, the setup is that we've diluted 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we're titrating this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. They also give the Ka of acetic acid as 1.85x10^-5. The options are A to D, each with two pH values.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its dissociation increases because of Le Chatelier's principle. So the pH should go up a bit after dilution, but since we're titrating, the pH will change depending on how much NaOH is added.

First, let's think about the initial solution after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The concentration of acetic acid will be half because the volume doubles. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we're adding equal volume, so the concentration becomes 0.025 M. Because M1V1 = M2V2. So 0.05 *20 = M2 *40, so M2 is 0.05*(20/40)=0.025 M.

But wait, wait, the initial solution is 20.00 cm³, which is 0.02 L. So the moles of acetic acid before dilution are 0.02 L * 0.05 M = 0.001 mol. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M, yes. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The first part is to find the pH at 25% titration. Then the pH at equivalence point.

Let me structure this into steps.

Step 1: Calculate the equivalence point volume.

Equivalence point occurs when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol (from 0.05 M * 0.02 L). Then, after dilution, it's still 0.001 mol because dilution doesn't change the number of moles, only the concentration.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, moles = Molarity * Volume. Let's find Volume (V) when moles NaOH = 0.001.

0.1 * V = 0.001 → V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH.

25% titration means 25% of the equivalence point volume is added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Wait, no. Wait, 25% of the equivalence point volume. So the equivalence point is 10 cm³, so 25% is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added
