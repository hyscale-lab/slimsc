Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it my best shot.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. So first, I think I need to normalize this state. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors should be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should be 1.

So, the state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me calculate the norm of this vector. The norm squared is (1+i)(1-i)*|up><up| plus (2 - i)(2 + i)|down><down|, but wait, no, actually, it's the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each coefficient. So the modulus squared of (1+i) is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. Similarly, for (2 - i), the modulus is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So |2 - i|^2 is 5. So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. Therefore, the normalized state |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional to that, so we can just proceed with the given coefficients, knowing that the actual state is divided by sqrt(7).

Next, the question is about measuring the probability of finding the particle in each eigenstate of the operator A, whose matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So A is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

Since it's a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j run from 1 to 2, let's say |up> corresponds to row 1 and |down> to row 2.

So, for i≠j, A_ij = hbar/2, and A_ii=0. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, no. A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j. So A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and A_11 = A_22 =0. So yes, the matrix is as above.

Now, this operator A has eigenstates. Wait, but wait: to find the probabilities when measuring the operator A, we need to find its eigenstates first. Because the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the square of the amplitudes of the eigenstates in the given state |alpha>.

So, first, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the eigenvalues of A first. Let's compute the eigenvalues.

The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation.

The trace is 0 +0 =0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = - (hbar^2)/4.

The characteristic equation is λ² - Tr(A) λ + Det(A) =0 → λ² -0 + (- (hbar²)/4 )=0 → λ² = (hbar²)/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v =0 → [[-hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, -hbar/2]] * [v1; v2] =0.

From the first equation: (-hbar/2)v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = v2.

So the eigenvector can be any scalar multiple of [1; 1]. But we can normalize it. The normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2)) [1;1].

Similarly, for λ =-hbar/2:

(A + λ I) v =0 → [[hbar/2, hbar/2], [hbar/2, hbar/2]] * [v1; v2] =0.

The first equation: (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 =0 → v1 = -v2. So the eigenvector is [1; -1], normalized, which becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [1; -1].

Wait, but wait: the operator A is a 2x2 matrix, and it's Hermitian? Because if A_ij = hbar/2 for i≠j, and 0 on the diagonal. So yes, it's symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which means real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait: the eigenvectors I found for λ=hbar/2 are [1;1], so in the standard basis (|up>, |down>), that's (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Similarly, the other eigenvector is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are these two vectors.

Now, the state |alpha> is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, scaled by 1/sqrt(7). So, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A. Then, the probability of measuring each eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of each eigenstate in |alpha>.

So, let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) = a |up> + b |down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->, which are the eigenstates of A.

Let me write |alpha> = c |+> + d |->.

But |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

c |+> = c (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
d |-> = d (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Adding them together:

c/sqrt(2) |up> + c/sqrt(2) |down> + d/sqrt(2) |up> - d/sqrt(2) |down> 
= [ (c + d)/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ (c - d)/sqrt(2) ) ] |down>.

This should be equal to |alpha> which is a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So equating coefficients:

( c + d ) / sqrt(2) = a = (1+i)/sqrt(7),
( c - d ) / sqrt(2) = b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Let me write these as two equations:

1) (c + d) = a * sqrt(2) = (1+i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
2) (c - d) = b * sqrt(2) = (2 -i) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)

Let me solve for c and d. Add equations 1 and 2:

2c = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → [ (3) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ c = (3) sqrt(2)/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2d = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (1 -2) + (i +i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
= [ (-1 + 2i) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ d = ( (-1 + 2i) ) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7) )

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the coefficients c and d more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute c and d by taking inner products.

Wait, the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate gives the amplitude, whose square is the probability.

So, to find c, take the inner product of |alpha> with |+>:

c = < + | alpha >.

Similarly, d = < - | alpha >.

Let me compute c:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2),
|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> all over sqrt(7).

So,

c = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7)  ·  (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
= [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(1) ] / (sqrt(7) sqrt(2)) )
= [ (1 + i + 2 - i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (3) / sqrt(14)
= 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, d would be the inner product with |->:

|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2),
so,

d = [ (1+i)(1) + (2 - i)(-1) ] / sqrt(7) * 1/sqrt(2)
= [ (1 + i) - (2 - i) ] / sqrt(14)
= [ (1 -2) + (i + i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(14).

Wait, but that gives c=3/sqrt(14). So the probability of measuring eigenvalue hbar/2 is |c|^2 = (3)^2 /14 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857. But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64.

Then, the probability of the other eigenvalue is |d|^2. Let's compute |d|^2.

d = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14), so |d|^2 = ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 ) /14 = (1 +4)/14=5/14≈0.3571428.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is around 0.36. But wait, looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, and average value hbar/7. Hmm.

Wait, but wait: maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check c.

c is the inner product of |alpha> and |+>.

|alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, divided by sqrt(7).

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So,

c = <alpha | +> = [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*1 ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) )

= [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(14)
= (3) / sqrt(14).

Yes, that's correct.

So |c|^2 is (3^2)/14 =9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |d|^2 is |(-1 +2i)|^2 /14 → (1 +4) /14=5/14≈0.357143.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is around 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 64% and 36%.

Looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36. But let me check the average value.

The average value of A is given by <alpha| A |alpha>.

But another approach is, since the eigenstates are |+> and |-> with eigenvalues hbar/2 and -hbar/2 respectively, the expectation value is |c|^2*(hbar/2) + |d|^2*(-hbar/2).

So,

⟨A⟩ = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [9/14 -5/14] (hbar/2)
= (4/14) (hbar/2)
= (2/7) (hbar/2)
= hbar/(7).

So the average is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A is 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. That matches.

But wait, let me check the normalization of |alpha> again. The state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. The modulus squared of (1+i) is 2, and (2 -i) is sqrt(5), so total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So yes, |alpha> is correctly normalized.

Wait, but wait: the first part of the problem says to calculate the probability of measuring each eigenstate of operator A. So, the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.642857 (approx 0.64) and 5/14 ≈0.357143 (approx 0.36). So the probability of measuring the +hbar/2 eigenstate is 9/14 ≈0.64, and the other is 5/14 ≈0.36.

So the average value is hbar/7, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is "0.64, 0.36 and hbar /7". So it matches.

Wait, but let me look at the other options. Option D is probabilities 0.61 and 0.29. That doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of |c|² and |d|².

Wait, earlier I calculated |d|= [(-1 +2i)]/sqrt(14), so |d|^2 is (1^2 + (2)^2 ) /14= (1+4)/14=5/14. That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the inner product calculation for d.

Wait, another way: state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> / sqrt(7).

The operator A has eigenstates |+> and |->.

So, |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

The inner product < + | alpha > is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Which is [3]/(sqrt(14)) → |c|^2 is 9/14.

Similarly, < - | alpha > is [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)).

Which is [ (1 +i -2 +i) ] → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14) → |d|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + 2^2 )/14 =5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.6429) and 5/14 (~0.3571). The average is (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2) = (9-5)(hbar/28) )=4 hbar/28 = hbar/7.

So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. That matches.

Wait, but let me think. The first probability is for eigenvalue hbar/2, which is the + case, and the other is for -hbar/2.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.6429 and 0.3571. Rounding to two decimal places, they are 0.64 and 0.36, respectively.

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state described by \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}} \), and the task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) for \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be computed.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( A \)
The operator \( A \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) matrix:
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \implies \lambda^2 - \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = 0 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]
The corresponding eigenvectors are:
\[
|+\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}, \quad |-\rangle = \frac{|\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in Terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is given as:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]
To express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), compute the inner products:
\[
\langle +|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) + (2-i)}{\sqrt{7} \sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad
\langle -|\alpha\rangle = \frac{(1+i) - (2-i)}{\sqrt{7} \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1 + 2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]
The probabilities of measuring the eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \) are:
\[
P\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = |\langle +|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \frac{9}{14}, \quad
P\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = |\langle -|\alpha\rangle|^2 = \frac{5}{14}.
\]
In decimal form:
\[
P\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \approx 0.64, \quad P\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 3: Average Value of \( A \)
The average value of \( A \) is:
\[
\langle A \rangle = P\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]
Substituting the probabilities:
\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{4}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.

Answer: A
