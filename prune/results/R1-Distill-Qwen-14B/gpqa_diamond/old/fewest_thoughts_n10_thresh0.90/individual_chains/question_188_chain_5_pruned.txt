Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are related to the crystal structure and Miller indices. Let me think this through step by step.

Wait, the question gives me a rhombohedral crystal with interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. Oh, wait, interatomic distance, that's the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. But wait, in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a three-dimensional figure with all sides equal and all angles equal, right? So alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Got it.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Oh right, interplanar distance refers to the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Miller indices (hkl) are given here as (111), so h, k, l are all 1.

I think the formula for interplanar distance (d) is derived from the unit cell parameters. The general formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, no, that's not exactly right. Or is it? I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me recall.

Oh wait, no, the formula for interplanar distance d in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the recip
