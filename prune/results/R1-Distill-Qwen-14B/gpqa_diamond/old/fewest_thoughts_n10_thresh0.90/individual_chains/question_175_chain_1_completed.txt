Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f that depends on λ and the angle θ from the z-axis.

They say the maximum power is A. I need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of f in terms of λ's exponent.

From what I remember, when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the type of dipole or higher-order moments involved. Oh wait, a spheroidal distribution... Maybe it's a dipole? Or quadrupole? Or something else?

Wait, but the problem states it's an oscillating charge distribution. So if it's oscillating, it's probably an electric dipole radiator. Because a dipole oscillating would radiate. But wait, spheroidal symmetry—could it be a quadrupole? Or maybe a dipole in a symmetric setup.

Wait, the maximum power is A. The power per solid angle is f(λ,θ). So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. But for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is a function of θ, and the maximum is along the z-axis (θ=0), I think.

Wait, but for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2, right? Or wait, the radiation intensity for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum occurs at θ=90 degrees, because sinθ is maximum there. Hmm, but wait, no—dipole radiation has maximum at θ=90 degrees. Wait, no, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again. The dipole's radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees because the dipole's field is strongest perpendicular to the dipole axis. So yes, the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum power A. So the function f would have its maximum at some angle. So if the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, then at θ=30 degrees, the power would be less than A.

Alternatively, perhaps the function f is maximum at θ=0 for some reason, but I don't think so. Wait, in the dipole case, the maximum occurs at θ=90, so that's when sinθ is maximum.

Wait, but wait. The problem says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So A is the maximum of f(λ,θ) over all θ and λ? Or is it the maximum for each λ? Hmm, maybe the maximum in θ for a given λ. Because the question says the fraction of A that is radiated at θ=30 degrees. So for each λ, the maximum power per solid angle occurs at some θ, and A is that maximum. Then, at θ=30 degrees, what is the fraction of A?

Wait, but in the dipole case, the function f is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum is at θ=90°, which would give f_max = (sin90)^2 = 1. So for θ=30°, sinθ=0.5, so (0.5)^2=0.25. So f(30)/f_max = 0.25. So the fraction would be 1/4.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of A that is radiated at θ=30°. If the maximum is A, then the fraction would be (f(θ=30°) / A) = (0.25 A) / A = 0.25, which is 1/4. So that's the fraction.

But wait, another possibility: if the charge distribution is a dipole, then the radiation pattern for intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum is at θ=90°, which would make the fraction at 30° be 0.25 times A. So that would be 1/4 of A.

So the first part is 1/4. Now, the second part is the form of f as a function of λ.

What's the dependence of the power on λ?

I remember that the radiated power for a dipole is proportional to (acceleration)^2 or something like that. But in terms of wavelength, I think for an oscillating dipole, the power (intensity) is inversely proportional to λ^4. Let me think: the Poynting vector for dipole radiation goes as (E × H), and E is proportional to (1/r) * (1/(λ^2)) maybe? Wait, no, let me think about the radiation fields. The electric field for dipole radiation is E ~ (p0 ω² sinθ) / r, where p is the dipole moment and ω is the angular frequency. Hmm, but p is oscillating, so its time derivative gives the radiation.

Wait, the intensity (power per unit area) for dipole radiation is proportional to (p''^2) (sinθ)^2 / (r^2). But p'' is the second derivative of the dipole moment, which relates to the acceleration of the charges. But in terms of frequency, p'' would have terms involving ω^2.

Wait, maybe a better approach: The power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by P = ( ( μ0 p0^2 ω^4 sin²θ ) / (12 π c^3 )) ) ... something like that. Let me check the formula. Alternatively, I remember that the average power radiated by a dipole is P_avg = ( ( (e^2 a^2 ) / (6 π ε0 c^3 )) ), where a is the acceleration. And a is the second derivative of displacement, which for oscillation is a ~ ω². So P_avg ~ ω^4.

But ω is related to λ. Since ω = 2π c / λ. So substituting, ω^4 = (2π c / λ )^4. So P_avg ~ (1/λ^4).

But the power per unit solid angle is the intensity, which is P divided by (4π), because solid angle is 4π steradians. Wait, no, the intensity is power per unit solid angle, so if the total power is P, then intensity I = P/(4π). But in the dipole case, the intensity varies with angle. So for maximum intensity, I_max = P/(4π) * (some factor). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the intensity (power per unit area per unit solid angle) for dipole radiation is I = ( μ0 p0² ω^4 sin²θ ) / (12 π c^3 r² ). But in the radiation zone, r is large, so the intensity depends on 1/r². But the question is about the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity times r²? Wait, wait, no. Because in the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle (intensity, actually) is a function that doesn't depend on r. Or maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the radiated power is given by the Poynting vector. For a dipole, the Poynting vector (which gives the intensity) is proportional to (E × H), which for dipole radiation is E ~ (ω p sinθ) / r and H ~ (ω^2 p sinθ) / (c r^2). So E × H ~ (ω^3 p^2 sin²θ) / (c r^3). Then, the intensity, which is the time-averaged Poynting vector, would be proportional to ω^4 p^2 sin²θ / (c^2 r^3). Wait, but I thought intensity is power per area. So for the total power, you multiply by the area, which is 4π r², so total power P would be intensity × 4π r². So P = I × 4π r². So I = P/(4π r²). But in the far field, r is large, so the intensity becomes I ~ (ω^4 p^2 sin²θ ) / (c^2 r^3 ) * (4π r²) ? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the dependence on λ. From the formula for the power radiated by a dipole, which is P = ( ( μ0 p0^2 ω^4 ) / (12 π c^3 )) ). So substituting ω = 2π c / λ, we get ω^4 = (2π c / λ )^4. So P ∝ 1/λ^4. Thus, the intensity, which is P/(4π), also scales as 1/λ^4. So the function f (which is the intensity) would be proportional to 1/λ^4.

Wait, but the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So if the total power P is proportional to 1/λ^4, and the maximum intensity is at a particular angle, then the function f itself must have a dependence on λ^−4.

So putting it all together: the fraction of the maximum power at θ=30° is 1/4. And the function f is proportional to λ^−4.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1/2, λ^-4. No, the fraction is 1/4.

Option B: 1/4, λ^-3. No, the λ exponent is -4.

Option C: 1/4, λ^-4. Yes, matches both.

Option D: 3/4, λ^-6. No, the fraction is 1/4.

So the correct answer is option C: 1/4 and λ^(-4).


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \( \lambda \). The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the maximum power radiated is \( A \). The goal is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the functional dependence of \( f \) on \( \lambda \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern**: For a dipole radiator, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 0.5 \), so the intensity is reduced by a factor of \( (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \).

2. **Dependence on \( \lambda \)**: The radiated power for an oscillating dipole is proportional to \( \omega^4 \), where \( \omega = 2\pi c / \lambda \). Substituting \( \omega \), the power scales as \( 1/\lambda^4 \). Since the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to the total power, it also scales as \( 1/\lambda^4 \).

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \). Incorrect because the fraction of \( A \) at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
   - **Option B**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \). Incorrect because the functional dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
   - **Option C**: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \). Correct because both the fraction of \( A \) and the functional dependence on \( \lambda \) match the analysis.
   - **Option D**: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \). Incorrect because the fraction of \( A \) is \( 1/4 \), and the functional dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

### Final Answer:
The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the function \( f \) scales as \( \lambda^{-4} \).
