Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that accelerating charges radiate energy. The question is about the power radiated at a certain angle and how it depends on wavelength.

The setup is an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, as well as the form of f.

So I think I need to recall the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna because oscillating charges often relate to dipole radiation. Wait, dipole radiation has a certain angular dependence. I remember that the intensity pattern of a dipole is directed along the equator, meaning maximum radiation perpendicular to the axis. The radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin²θ. Oh wait, no, wait a second. No, wait, dipole radiation is maximum when θ = 90 degrees, the equator. So the intensity varies as sin²θ. So the radiation pattern isn't uniform in all directions.

Wait, but how does that relate to the power per unit solid angle? The function f would be the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity, I think. So for a dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum intensity occurs at θ=90 degrees, and it's zero at θ=0 and θ=180.

But wait, the problem says the maximum power is A. So the total power radiated would be the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. So the total power P_total is integral of f(θ) over 4π steradians.

Wait, if f is the intensity (power per unit solid angle), then P_total = ∫ f(θ) dΩ. For a dipole, f would be proportional to sin²θ, so the integral over all angles would be ∫ sin²θ * sinθ dθ dφ. Let me compute that.

Wait, f(θ) is proportional to sin²θ. So the integral is ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dφ ∫ (from 0 to π) sin^2θ * sinθ dθ. Wait, no, wait. The solid angle element is sinθ dθ dφ. So the integral becomes:

Integral over φ: 0 to 2π, which is 2π.

Integral over θ: ∫ sin²θ * sinθ dθ from 0 to π. Wait, no. Wait, f(θ) is sin²θ, so the integral becomes ∫ (sin^2θ) * sinθ dθ = ∫ sin^3θ dθ.

So for θ integral: ∫ (0 to π) sin³θ dθ. Let me compute that.

I remember that the integral of sin^n θ dθ from 0 to π is 2 * ∫ from 0 to π/2 of sin^n θ dθ. And for odd n, like n=3, the integral is (2/3) * (4/5) )? Wait, the formula for ∫ sin^n θ dθ from 0 to π/2 is (sqrt(π)/2) Γ((n+1)/2) ) / Γ((n+2)/2)) ), but maybe a better approach is to compute it directly.

Alternatively, for n=3, ∫ sin^3θ dθ from 0 to π is 4/3. Because, substitution: let u = cosθ, then du = -sinθ dθ. So ∫ sin^3θ dθ = ∫ sin²θ * sinθ dθ = ∫ (1 - u²) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1. So that becomes ∫ (1 - u²) du from -1 to 1. Which is 2 * ∫ (1 - u²) du from 0 to 1. So 2[ (1)(1) - (1^3/3) ) ] = 2*(1 - 1/3) )= 2*(2/3) )= 4/3.

Wait, but that's from 0 to π. So the integral is 4/3. So the total power would be 2π * (4/3) times the proportionality constant. But wait, the exact value isn't important here because the question is about the fraction at a specific angle.

Wait, but the function f(θ) is given as a general function, but for this problem, since it's a dipole-like radiation, I think f(θ) is proportional to sin²θ. So the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and zero at the poles.

So the question is, what's the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees.

Wait, no, the question says the maximum power is A. So the total power is the integral of f(θ) over all solid angles, which is P_total = ∫ f(θ) dΩ. And A is the maximum of f. Wait, no, wait. The question says "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So A is the maximum value of f, the intensity?

Wait, wait, no. Because f is the power per unit solid angle. So the maximum intensity, which is the maximum value of f, would be A. So A is the maximum of f(θ), which occurs at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem states: "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So I think A is the maximum value of the radiated power per unit solid angle. So when θ is such that f is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees, the power per unit solid angle is A. So the maximum power per unit solid angle is A.

But then, the total power would be the integral of f(θ) over all solid angles. So the total power P_total is ∫ f(θ) dΩ. Since f(θ) = A sin²θ, so P_total = ∫ A sin²θ * sinθ dθ dφ. So P_total = A * ∫ sin^3θ dθ ∫ dφ.

Wait, no. Wait, f(θ) is the intensity, which is the power per unit solid angle. So the integral over all
