Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem says: We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy related to their movement. 

Out of these 13, 12 are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, okay. So, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem because we're dealing with charges and their potential energy. Since all the charges are fixed except the 13th, which is fixed at P, I need to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges at 2m and the fixed charge at P.

Wait, but wait: the charges are identical, each being 2e. So, each of the 12 charges has a charge of 2e, and the 13th is also 2e and fixed at P.

So the system consists of a central charge (charge Q = 2e) and 12 other charges (each also 2e) fixed at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 is 2e, located at 2m from the center. 

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy between two point charges is given by U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². 

But wait, in this case, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is interacting with the fixed charge. So for each of the 12, the energy is k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). 

Wait, but let me think: since the 12 charges are identical and fixed at 2m, and the 13th is fixed, each of the 12 will have a potential energy with the 13th. So each pair contributes U = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2). 

Wait, the distance between each of the 12 and the 13th is 2m, right? Because point P is their center, and each is at 2m from P. So each is 2m away from the fixed charge. 

So each pair (the fixed charge and one of the 12) contributes U = (k)(2e)(2e)/(2m). Since e is the elementary charge, e ≈ 1.602×10^-19 C. 

So let's compute that. 

But wait, since there are 12 such charges, each contributing the same potential energy, the total potential energy would be 12 * U_single, where U_single is the energy between the fixed charge and one of the 12.

So U_single = k * (2e)^2 / (2) 

Wait, wait, wait. Let me write that
