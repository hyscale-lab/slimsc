Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Oh, and the mass is also 1.5 times larger, but wait, I'm not sure how mass plays into this since the question is about luminosity. Hmm, but maybe mass isn't directly relevant here? Or perhaps it's a red herring. Let me see.

The astronomers looked at the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest. They found the same wavelengths for both. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law, which is lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, that means the temperatures of both stars are the same? Because if T were different, the lambda_max would change. So both stars have the same temperature? That's an important point.

Wait, but the question is about luminosity. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. Since both stars are black bodies, this applies.

So, from the problem statement, R1 = 1.5 R2. And since T1 = T2 (because lambda_max is same), let's plug into the luminosity formula.

L1 = 4π(R1)^2 σ T^4
L2 = 4π(R2)^2 σ T^4

So the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. Since T1 = T2, (T1/T2)^4 is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. Wait, but that's option A, which is 2.25.

But wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Oh, right, the radial velocity of Star_1 is 0 km/s, and Star_2 is 700 km/s. Oh, wait, how does that affect the observed wavelength?

Ah, right! The Doppler effect. When a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and when moving away, it's redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has radial velocity 0, so no shift. Star_2's velocity is 700 km/s. Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same. So the actual emitted peak wavelengths are the same, but when you have Doppler shift, the observed lambda would change.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The problem states that they used spectroscopy to find the wavelengths where the stars appeared brightest, and they're the same. So the observed wavelengths are the same.

But if Star_2 is moving, its emitted light would be Doppler shifted. So for Star_2, its actual emitted peak wavelength would be different from the observed wavelength. Let's clarify.

The observed wavelength
