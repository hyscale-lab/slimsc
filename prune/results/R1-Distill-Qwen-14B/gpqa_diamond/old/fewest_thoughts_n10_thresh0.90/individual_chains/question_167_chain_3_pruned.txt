Alright, so I have this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2 alpha²)). The goal is to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure del_b. The formula for del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the given state's.

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I need to compute this for these values.

Wait, what's non-Gaussianity? I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a Wigner function which is Gaussian, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states have non-Gaussian Wigner functions, and calculating non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. The relative entropy approach compares the given state's entropy to that of the closest Gaussian state.

So the first thing I should do is figure out what the state |psi> looks like when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Let's compute the components. Let me write out |psi> in terms of |alpha> and |-alpha>.

phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) which is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So |psi> becomes [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N.

Wait, but wait, alpha is 0.5. So let's plug that in. Hmm, but maybe I should first compute N, the normalization.

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). Let's compute sin(2 phi) when phi is -pi/4. 2 phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So the term inside N becomes 1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5).

Exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 is approximately 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So |psi> is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, but wait, what about the state |alpha> and |-alpha>? Those are coherent states with amplitudes alpha and -alpha, respectively. So this state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. That sounds like a Schrödinger cat state, which is a non-Gaussian state because it's a superposition of two coherent states.

So the state is non-Gaussian, which means its Wigner function will have negative regions, unlike Gaussian states which are positive definite in their Wigner functions.

Now, to compute the non-Gaussianity, I need to compute the relative entropy between this state and the reference Gaussian state tau. But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the question says 'tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.' But how is tau defined? Is tau the closest Gaussian state to |psi>, or is it a specific Gaussian state like the coherent state or something else?

Wait, maybe the relative entropy is calculated with respect to the closest Gaussian state. Or perhaps the reference is the fully mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, I think that the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (del_b) is defined as S(rho) - S(tau), where S(rho) is the von Neumann entropy of rho and tau is the Gaussian state that is the closest to rho in terms of relative entropy. Or perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy, making del_b the minimal difference.

Wait, the formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So it's the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau.

But wait, von Neumann entropy is S = - trace(rho ln rho). So the expression here is the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau. Since del_b is a measure of non-Gaussianity, a higher value would mean more non-Gaussian.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But that's not what's given here. The question has del_b as the difference between rho's entropy and tau's entropy, which is S(rho) - S(tau). So that's different.

Wait, but I'm getting off track. Let me see what I need to do. I need to compute del_b, which is S(rho) - S(tau). So to find this, I need to find the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau.

But wait, what's tau? The reference Gaussian state. But I'm not given tau; I need to figure out what tau is. I think that in some cases, the reference Gaussian state is the closest Gaussian state to rho, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, sometimes people compare to a thermal state or a coherent state.

Wait, but perhaps the state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, so the reference Gaussian state could be the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a cat state, the reference Gaussian is the classical (thermal) state that has the same first and second moments as the cat state. Or maybe it's the state that minimizes the relative entropy difference.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the problem. The relative entropy measure is being used to compare the non-Gaussian state's entropy to the reference Gaussian state's. So perhaps for the cat state, the reference Gaussian is a specific Gaussian state, perhaps the state that minimizes the relative entropy, making del_b the minimal possible.

Alternatively, maybe in this problem, the reference Gaussian is the state that has the same first and second moments as the cat state. But
