Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of calculations. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. The goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Also, we need to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D, each giving a pH and a volume.

Hmm, so first, I think I need to figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. Let's start by finding the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16 g/mol, and Hydrogen (H) is about 1 g/mol. So for Fe(OH)3, it's Fe + 3(OH) groups. So that's 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1). Let me calculate that: 3*(17) is 51. So 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 mol, which is about 9.358e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. When it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, it should form Fe^3+ ions, water, and Cl^- ions. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, the acid is monobasic, so each molecule provides one H+. The moles of H+ needed should be three times the moles of Fe(OH)3, right? Because for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+ to neutralize the three OH- groups.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. That's 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.0028074 mol of H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, which means moles per liter. We need to find the volume (in cm³) that contains 0.0028074 moles. So volume (V) = moles / concentration.

Concentration is 0.1 mol/L, which is 0.1 mol/dm³. Since 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, 0.1 mol/dm³ is 0.1 mol per 1000 cm³, which is 0.1 mmol/cm³.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check the units. 0.1 M is 0.1 moles per liter. So 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 0.1 M = 0.1 mol / 1000 cm³ = 0.0001 mol/cm³. Or, per cm³, 0.0001 mol.

So, V = moles / concentration = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L. But wait, since 1 L is 1000 cm³, concentration in mol/cm³ is 0.1 mol/L = 0.1 / 1000 = 0.0001 mol/cm³.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in liters. So, 0.0028074 mol divided by 0.1 mol/L is 0.028074 L, which is 28.074 cm³. Hmm, but wait, this is the volume of the acid needed if we only consider the stoichiometric amount of H+ needed. But wait, is that the minimum volume? Because when you add the acid to the solution, you're also adding more solvent, which dilutes the solution. But wait, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid's volume plus the Fe(OH)3's volume (which is negligible) and the solvent... Wait, maybe I should consider the total volume.

Wait,
