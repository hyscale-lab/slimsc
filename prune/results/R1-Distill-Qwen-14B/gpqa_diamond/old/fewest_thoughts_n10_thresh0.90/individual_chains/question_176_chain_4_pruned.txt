Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to understand what it's asking. Alright, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that can't be right because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors, right? The sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1. Let's check: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 6. Oh, so that's not normalized. So I guess the actual state vector is (-1, 2, 1) divided by the square root of 6. Because when you normalize, you divide by the norm. So the state is ( -1/√6, 2/√6, 1/√6 )^T.

Then there are two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as square matrices. The matrix for P is:

First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0.

Wait, what's the structure of this matrix? Let me think. P is a 3x3 matrix. The diagonal elements are zero in the first and third rows, and the middle of the second row is zero. The off-diagonal elements have 1/√2 in some places. Hmm, perhaps this matrix has some symmetry. Maybe it's a permutation matrix scaled by 1/√2? Because if you look at the first row, it only has a 1/√2 in the second column. The second row has 1/√2 in first and third columns, and the third row has 1/√2 in the second column. Oh, I see. So P swaps the first and second elements? Or maybe it's a more complex permutation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of both P and Q to find the possible outcomes of the measurements. Because when you measure an observable, the possible results are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

But the question is about measuring P first, then Q. So first, when we measure P, we get an eigenvalue, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector. Then we measure Q on this new state.

Wait, but the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So we need to find the probability that the first measurement (of P) gives 0, and the second measurement (of Q) gives -1.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is first in state |ψ>, then someone measures P. The outcome 0 corresponds to a particular eigenvector of P, so the state collapses to that eigenvector. Then measuring Q on that state gives outcome -1 with some probability.

But let's think step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

Starting with operator Q because its matrix looks simpler.
