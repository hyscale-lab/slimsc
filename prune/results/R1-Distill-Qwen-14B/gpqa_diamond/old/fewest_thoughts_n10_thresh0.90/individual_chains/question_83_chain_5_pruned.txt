Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see. It's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the initial concentration might change because of the dilution. Oh wait, right, when you dilute a solution, the concentration decreases. The formula is M1V1 = M2V2. So the volume doubles, so the concentration halves. So 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M after dilution. Because 20 cm³ + 20 cm³ is 40, so 40 cm³ total. So acetic acid is 0.05 * (20/40) = 0.025 M.

Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? That's when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate that. So, moles of acetic acid initially: M = moles/volume (in liters). So 0.025 M * 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L) equals 0.001 moles. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, original volume was 20 cm³, 0.05 M. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then when you dilute with 20 cm³, the moles stay the same, right? So 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

So the NaOH has to neutralize that. NaOH is 0.1 M. So at equivalence, moles NaOH = moles acetic acid. So M_NaOH * V = 0.001. So V = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume? So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Let me think about each part.

First, the 25% titration point. So, for that, let's calculate the moles of NaOH added. 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Acetic acid has 0.001 moles initially. So after adding NaOH, which reacts with acetic acid: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So moles of acetic acid remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.

Moles of acetate ion formed: 0.00025 moles.

The total volume is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So 42.5 cm³ or 0.0425 L.

So concentrations:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find pH.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) → wait, pKa is the negative log of Ka. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.735.

Wait, let me calculate that. Let me compute log(1.85e-5). 1e-5 is log 5 = -5. 1.85 is about 1.85, so log(1.85) ≈ 0.267. So
