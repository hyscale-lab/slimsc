Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm going to try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about identifying compound E in a series of reactions. Let's break down the reaction steps one by one.

First, compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to give D, and finally, D eliminates an inert gas to form E. 

There are also some hints provided. Hint a says that when compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes by reacting with carbonyl groups. So that suggests that compound A must have a carbonyl group because Wittig reagents react with ketones or aldehydes.

Looking at the product from A's reaction with the ylide: it's 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene group is a substituted methylene group (like a CH2-C(CH3)2). So, I think the Wittig reaction adds an alkene to the carbonyl group of A. So, A must be a cyclopentanone derivative because the product is a cyclopentane with substituents.

Wait, cyclopentanone has a ketone group. So if A is cyclopentanone with some substituents, then the Wittig would add a double bond adjacent to the carbonyl. But wait, the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, but propan-2-ylidene is a CH2-C(CH3)2 group. So when the Wittig reacts with A, which probably has a carbonyl, it would form a double bond. But in the product, the substituents are 1,2-dimethyl and 4-something. Wait, maybe A is a substituted cyclopentanone. 

Let me think about the structure. The Wittig reagent would add a CH2 group to the carbonyl, but in this case, the product has a propan-2-ylidene group attached. Maybe the ylide was derived from propanal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is a di-ketone? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Wittig is adding a substituted group. Let me try to visualize this.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The propan-2-ylidene is the ylidene group, so that would come from a ylide like CH2-C(CH3)2-PPh3+ which would react with a carbonyl in A. So when the Wittig adds, it would connect to the carbonyl, forming a double bond. So the cyclopentane ring in the product would have a substituent at position 4, which is a CH2-C(CH3)2 group, connected via a double bond, perhaps?

Wait, but the product is a cyclopentane with substituents. So maybe the starting carbonyl is part of the ring. For example, if A is cyclopentanone, and the Wittig adds a substituent adjacent to the ketone. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps A is something like 4-methylcyclopentanone. When the Wittig reagent adds, it would form a double bond between carbons 4 and perhaps 5, leading to the substituents. But I'm not entirely sure yet. Maybe I should come back to this and look at the other hints.

Hint b says that the IR of A has a strong peak
