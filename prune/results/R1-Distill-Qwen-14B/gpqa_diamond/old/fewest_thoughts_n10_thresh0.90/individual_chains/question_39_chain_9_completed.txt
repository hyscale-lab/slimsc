Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. From what I remember, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like being normalized so that the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1.

Alright, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wave functions usually have both real and imaginary parts, right? But for normalization, I think we only consider the square of the absolute value of the wave function. Oh, because the probability density is the square of the modulus.

So the modulus squared would be [ (a / sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)² ] because the imaginary part is 0.5i. So each term is squared and added together. That gives the probability density.

The next thing I remember is that the integral of the probability density over all space must equal 1. But in this case, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the normalization condition is the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check. The modulus squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, right? Because (a + ib)^2 is a² + b²? No, no, wait. Wait, no. No, the modulus squared of (a + ib) is (a)^2 + (b)^2. So in this case, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So yeah, that's correct.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx equals 1.

Let me break this integral into two parts:

Integral from 1 to3 of a²/(1+x) dx + integral from 1 to3 of 0.25 dx = 1.

Let me compute each part separately.

First integral: a² ∫ (1/(1+x)) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x|.

So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2). So the first integral becomes a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2=0.5.

So adding the two parts: a² * ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

Then a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, ln(2) is approximately 0.6931. So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.7213.

Then a is the square root of that. So sqrt(0.7213) is about 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. The wave function is a/sqrt(1+x) minus 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. Correct. Then the integral of that from 1 to3 is 1.

Yes, that seems right. So a is approximately 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \) in the wave function \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), we use the normalization condition. The wave function must satisfy:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1,
\]

where \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) is the modulus squared of the wave function. For \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), the modulus squared is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

The normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

Breaking this into two integrals:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

1. For the first integral, \( \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx \), the antiderivative is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating from \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(4/2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first term becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

2. For the second integral, \( 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx \), the result is:

\[
0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.25 \cdot 2 = 0.5.
\]

Combining the two parts:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213,
\]

and taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
