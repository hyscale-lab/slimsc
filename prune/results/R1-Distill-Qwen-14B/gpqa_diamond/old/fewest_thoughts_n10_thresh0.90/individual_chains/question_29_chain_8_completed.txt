Okay, I have to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The gene has five exons and four introns. The problem is that this compound is being synthesized because the gene is functional. So, if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made, making the barley usable.

The question is about which mutation would disrupt the gene's function. The wild-type sequence is given, and each mutant has some changes in the first exon. So the mutations are in the first exon area.

Looking at the mutations:

Intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTC... So the first part is ATG, which is the start codon.

Mutant 1: The first part is ATGTTCTACG... Wait, looking at the first few bases. The intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT... Mutant 1 has ATG TTC TAC GCT... So the second codon in the wild type is TTT (Phe), and mutant 1 is TTC (which is also Phe). Wait, TTT and TTC are both phenylalanine. So that’s a silent mutation; the amino acid doesn't change. So that's probably not the cause of a nonfunctional gene.

Wait, but I need to look more carefully. Let me write out the changes:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

So, the second codon is TTC (Phe) instead of TTT (Phe) — same amino acid. So no change there. But then the third codon in the mutant is TAC, which is Tyr. In the wild type, it's CTC, which is Leu. So that's a change from Leu to Tyr. That's a substitution. But does it cause a frameshift? No, because it's a point mutation, same reading frame.

So the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. Maybe that disrupts the function. But perhaps it's not enough. But without more context, hard to say.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT G...

Wait, the first codons: ATG is the start. The second is TTC (Phe), same as mutant 1. Third codon is TAA, which is stop. Oh! So in mutant 2, after the start, the second codon is Phe, third is stop. So the protein would be truncated at that point. That would likely produce a nonfunctional protein. Because the gene product is the enzyme that makes the anti-nutritional compound. If the enzyme is not made or is nonfunctional, the compound won't be synthesized.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The wild type third codon is CTC (Leu), but mutant 2 has TAA. TAA is a stop codon. So the mRNA would be read as ATG TTC TAA ... So the translation would start with Met, Phe, then stop. The protein would be very short, just two amino acids (Met and Phe), then it stops. So the gene would be nonfunctional. That would prevent the compound from being made.

So mutant 2 introduces a premature stop codon. That would likely eliminate the gene function.

Let me check the other options.

Mutant 3: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT TCA CTT CTG...

Wait, let me compare. The wild type has:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant 3's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT TCA CTT CTG...

So the first codon is same (ATG). Second codon same (TTT). Third codon is TAC (Tyr), whereas wild type is CTC (Leu). So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr. But further in, the fifth codon: wild type is GCT (Ala), mutant 3 is GCT (Ala) in the same position? Wait, no, looking at the sequences:

Wild type: ...CTA CTT CTG...

Mutant 3: ...TCA CTT CTG...

So, the fourth codon in the wild type is ACT (Thr). Mutant 3 has TCA (Ser). So, another substitution. No stop codon here. So the protein would have some changes, but not a premature stop. So the gene might still produce a functional protein, but with some amino acid changes. It’s possible that the enzyme is still active, or maybe not. But it's less likely to completely eliminate the compound compared to a premature stop.

Mutant 4: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

Hmm, so looking at the sequence:

Wild type: ...GGT ACT TCT G...

Mutant 4: ...GGT ACT TCT G...

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me look again. The wild type is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4 is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the wild type starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, so the third codon in wild type is CTC (Leu). In mutant 4, it's TAC (Tyr). So at position three, substitution.

And the fourth codon in wild type is GCT (Ala), in mutant 4, it's GCT (Ala?), but wait, let me see:

Wait, the fourth codon in wild type is GCT (Ala), but in mutant 4, it's ACT? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused with the way the sequences are written. Alternatively, perhaps the change is in a different area.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the number of changes and see if any cause a frameshift or introduce a stop.

Wait, another thought: The question says the gene consists of five exons and four introns. So exons are the coding regions. Since the mutation is in the first exon, which is part of the coding region, so all these mutations are in the exons. So the changes are in the coding DNA sequence.

Looking again at the mutations:

Mutant 1: The third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). So that's a missense mutation. No stop codon.

Mutant 2: Third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So that creates a premature termination codon. So the protein is way shorter.

Mutant 3: Changes include third codon to Tyr and later codon substitution, but no stop.

Mutant 4: Let me look again. The target region is in the first exon. So the change in mutant 4 is perhaps a deletion or insertion?

Wait, looking at the given sequences, maybe I should compare the lengths. But all the mutants start and end with the same TGA at the end. So same length, so no frameshift—the mutations are substitutions, not indels.

So for each mutant, the mRNA is the same length, so no frameshift. So all are point mutations.

So, the question is, which mutant would disrupt the gene function, leading to no compound.

Mutant 2 introduces a stop codon at the third position. That would truncate the protein at the second amino acid (since the first is Met, second is Phe, then stop). So the protein is way too short to have any function. So that's likely to eliminate the compound.

Mutant 1 and 3 cause amino acid substitutions, but no stop. So the enzyme might still be functional, perhaps with altered activity, but maybe it still produces the compound. So those mutations might not eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant 4: Let's see. The wild type after the first few codons has CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT... Wait, in mutant 4, I think the third codon is TAC (Tyr), which would be a substitution. Then looking further down, in the wild type, the next part is GGT ACT TCT... In mutant 4, it's ACT TCT... So perhaps a different codon at that position. But I don't see a stop. So the gene would produce a protein, but perhaps with some altered regions. Could that disrupt the function? Maybe, but it's not as certain as a stop codon.

So, the best bet is Mutant 2, which introduces a stop codon, leading to a nonfunctional gene.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The gene's function is responsible for synthesizing the compound, so disrupting its function would prevent the compound from being produced.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - The second codon remains the same (Phe), but the third codon changes from **CTC (Leu)** to **TAC (Tyr)**.  
   - This is a **missense mutation**, altering the amino acid but not introducing a stop codon.  
   - The protein may still be functional, so the anti-nutritional compound might still be synthesized.

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - The second codon remains the same (Phe), but the third codon changes from **CTC (Leu)** to **TAA**, which is a **stop codon**.  
   - This introduces a **premature stop codon**, truncating the protein at the second amino acid (Met and Phe).  
   - The resulting truncated protein would likely be nonfunctional, preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - The second codon remains the same (Phe), but the third codon changes from **CTC (Leu)** to **TAC (Tyr)**.  
   - Further downstream, another codon changes from **ACT (Thr)** to **TCA (Ser)**.  
   - These are **missense mutations**, altering the amino acids but not introducing a stop codon.  
   - The protein may still be functional, so the anti-nutritional compound might still be synthesized.

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - The second codon remains the same (Phe), but the third codon changes from **CTC (Leu)** to **TAC (Tyr)**.  
   - Downstream, the codon changes from **GGT (Gly)** to **ACT (Thr)**.  
   - These are **missense mutations**, altering the amino acids but not introducing a stop codon.  
   - The protein may still be functional, so the anti-nutritional compound might still be synthesized.

### Conclusion:
Mutant 2 introduces a **premature stop codon**, which is the most likely mutation to disrupt the gene's function and eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only introduce amino acid substitutions, which may not completely abolish the gene's function.
