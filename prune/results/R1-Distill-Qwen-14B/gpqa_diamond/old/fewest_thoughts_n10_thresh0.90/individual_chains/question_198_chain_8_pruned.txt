Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about the formation of cobalt complexes with thiocyanate ions. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are involved in these kinds of problems. So the main idea is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species in the solution.

Wait, dithiocyanato... so that's the complex with two SCN- ions, right? Like [Co(SCN)_2]^n+? But wait, the exact charge might vary. But I think that for the purpose of calculating the percentage, I just need to figure out the fraction of Co that's in the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ form, which is the blue one.

The given data: the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, those are the β values for the first, second, third, and fourth SCN- ligands attaching to the Co(II) ion. So the complexes would be [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^(2+?), [Co(SCN)_3]^(3+?), and [Co(SCN)_4]^4+? Or maybe the charges are different. But I think the exact charge isn't critical here, as the stability constant accounts for the overall formation.

Since the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one, the [Co(SCN)_2]^n+ species. So I need to find the fraction of Co that is in this complex.

I think the approach here is to model the formation of all possible complexes and then find the fraction that corresponds to the dithiocyanato (n=2) case.

The general approach for these kinds of problems is to consider the formation of each complex step by step. The total concentration of Co is the sum of all the species: Co^2+, [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, [Co(SCN)_3]^+, [Co(SCN)_4]^0. Wait, wait, but the exact charge isn't given. But maybe that's not necessary because the stability constants are given in terms of the formation steps.

The stability constant (β) for each step is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where each SCN- is added. So the formation of each complex is stepwise, and the overall β for each complex is the product of the individual β values up to that step.

Wait, no. Wait, the β given are the stepwise constants. So β1 is for Co^2+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)]^+; β2 is for [Co(SCN)]^+ + SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_2]^2+; and so on. So the overall β for each complex is the product of β1 to βn, where n is the number of ligands.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Stability constants can be either stepwise or overall. So in this case, β1 is the first step, β2 is the second, etc. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, the overall formation constant would be β1 * β2.

Alternatively, when considering the distribution of Co species, we need to calculate the fractions based on these stepwise β values.

But sometimes, the overall β (formation constant) for each complex is the product of the β's up to that point. So for each n, the overall βn is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but the question gives four β values, which might correspond to the four possible ligand addition steps. So for [Co(SCN)_m]^something, the log β for that complex would be the sum of the logs of β1 to βm. But perhaps here, each β is the stepwise formation.

Wait, perhaps I should treat each step as a separate step, and model the distribution accordingly.

Let me try to outline the possible species:

1. Co^2+ (uncomplexed)
2. Co(SCN)^+ (monodentate)
3. Co(SCN)_2^2+ (didentate)
4. Co(SCN)_3^3+ (tridentate)
5. Co(SCN)_4^4+ (tetradentate)

But I'm not sure about the charges, but perhaps the exact charge doesn't matter because we're dealing with ratios.

The total concentration of Co is given as c = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all Co species is 1e-2 M.

The [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is 1e-1 M.

The task is to find the fraction of Co that is in the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ form, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

So, to model this, I think we can use the concept of the formation of each complex step by step, considering the stepwise β values.

The general approach is to consider each possible complex and calculate the concentration of each, then sum them all and find the ratio of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ to the total.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the distribution equation.

Another approach is to consider that the formation of each complex is a stepwise process, so the fraction of each species can be calculated using the cumulative β values and the concentrations of ligand.

Let me think about this: the fraction of each species depends on the product of the βs up to that species and the [SCN^-] raised to the number of ligands.

Wait, the fraction of the nth complex is given by (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β1β2[SCN^-]^2 + β1β2β3[SCN^-]^3 + ... + β1β2β3β4[SCN^-]^4 )

But wait, each step's β is multiplied by the next. So the denominator is the sum of all possible species, each term being the product of βs up to that point multiplied by [SCN^-]^n, where n is the number of ligands.

Alternatively, the fraction for the dithiocyanato complex (n=2) would be (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2) / (sum from m=0 to 4 of (product β1 to βm) [SCN^-]^m ), where for m=0, it's 1, and for m=1, β1 [SCN^-], etc.

Wait, but the given β4 is 16. So for m=4, the product would be β1 β2 β3 β4.

So, the denominator is:

1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN^-]^4

Each term corresponds to the concentration of Co in the nth complex.

So, the fraction f2 for n=2 is:

(β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2) / (denominator)

So let me calculate each term.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term0 (m=0): 1

Term1 (m=1): β1 * [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9

Term2 (m=2): β1 * β2 * [SCN]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 9*40 *0.01 = 9*0.4=3.6

Term3 (m=3): β1 β2 β3 * [SCN]^3 =9*40*63 * (0.1)^3 = let's compute this step by step.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; (0.1)^3=1e-3=0.001.

So 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68.

Term4 (m=4): β1 β2 β3 β4 * [SCN]^4 =9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880; (0.1)^4=1e-4=0.0001.

So 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

Now sum all terms: 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

Let me add them up.

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 +3.6 =5.5

5.5 +22.68 =28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

The numerator for f2 is term2, which is 3.6.

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction f2 is term2 divided by the denominator. So f2 = 3.6 /64.468.

Compute that.

3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.055555556 (since 64.468 * 0.055 is approx 3.5457, 0.055555556 *64.468= 3.6 exactly).

So 3.6 /64.468 = approx 0.055555556, which is 5.5555556%.

Wait, that's only 5.56%? But looking at the options, none of them is around 5%. The options are 16.9, 25.6, 38.1, 42.3. Hmm, so that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, let's compute each term again.

Term0: 1.

Term1: 9 *0.1 =0.9.

Term2:9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 *0.01=3.6. That's correct.

Term3:9*40*63 * (0.1)^3.

Compute 9*40=360.

360 *63= 22680.

(0.1)^3=0.001.

22680 *0.001=22.68.

Yes, that's correct.

Term4:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4.

Compute 9*40=360.

360 *63=22680.

22680 *16=362880.

(0.1)^4=0.0001.

362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Yes.

So denominator is 1 + 0.9 =1.9 +3.6=5.5 +22.68=28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator is 64.468.

But wait, the numerator for f2 is term2, which is 3.6.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is the concentration of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ divided by the total Co concentration.

But according to the model, the fraction is (β1 β2 [SCN^-]^2) divided by the denominator.

So the fraction f2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 5.555%, which is about 5.56%.

But the options don't have that. So that's a problem. Did I get the model wrong?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the total concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, but in the denominator, the sum is in terms of (β products) multiplied by [SCN]^n, which is the concentration of each species. But wait, the actual concentrations are [Co] = sum of all species. So maybe the fraction is (β products * [SCN]^n) / denominator, but the denominator is the sum of all such terms, each multiplied by [Co], which is 1e-2 M.

Wait, maybe I should consider that each term is [Co] * (β products * [SCN]^n) / denominator.

Wait, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Let me think again.

Another way is to model the situation using the formation constants.

The idea is that each complex is formed stepwise, and the concentrations of each species depend on the ligand concentration and the stability constants.

The formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = ( β₁ β₂ ... β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β₁ [SCN^-] + β₁ β₂ [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β₁ β₂ ... β_n [SCN^-]^n )

So the denominator is the sum of all possible species, considering each step.

Wait, but in the denominator, each term is [Co]_uncomplexed, [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)_2], etc., which are the concentrations. So, the denominator is the sum of all these concentrations, each of which is (β terms) multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

But the [Co]_total is the sum of all these concentrations, which is 1e-2 M.

Wait, no, the [Co]_total is given as 1e-2 M, which is the sum of all species. So, the denominator in the fraction is just the sum of the terms that I calculated earlier (64.468), but that sum is in terms of (β terms) multiplied by [SCN]^n.

So, the actual concentration of each species is [Co_total] * (term) / denominator.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me explain.

Let me denote each species as Co_n, where n is the number of SCN ligands.

The concentration of Co_n is:

[Co_n] = (β₁ β₂ ... β_n [SCN^-]^n ) * [Co_total] / (denominator)

Because the denominator is the sum of all (β products) [SCN]^n terms, which equals the total concentration of Co.

Wait, no, perhaps not. Let me think about the charge balance or the equilibria.

Alternatively, considering that each complex formation is a stepwise process, the fraction of each species can be found by:

f_n = (β₁ β₂ ... β_n [SCN^-]^n ) / (1 + β₁ [SCN^-] + β₁ β₂ [SCN^-]^2 + ... + β₁ β₂ ... β_n [SCN^-]^n )

So, the denominator is the sum for all possible n (including n=0, which is [Co^2+]).

In this case, the denominator is 64.468 as calculated before.

So, f_2 = (β1 β2 [SCN]^2) / denominator.

Which is 3.6 /64.468 ≈ 0.0555555, about 5.555%.

But that's not one of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the β values given are the overall formation constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones.

Wait the problem statement says: "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." 

Wait, stability constants are usually overall, not stepwise. Oh, wait, but sometimes the stability constants are given as the overall for each complex, which would be the product of the stepwise constants.

Wait, β1 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc.

Wait, no. Because normally, the stability constant for the first complex (mono) is K1 = β1 = [CoSCN]/[Co][SCN].

For the second complex, K2 would be the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ from [CoSCN]^+ and SCN^-.

So, the overall β for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would be K1 * K2 = β1 * β2.

Wait, but in the problem statement, β1=9, β2=40, etc. So perhaps β1 is the overall constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is the overall for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^3+, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^4+.

If that's the case, then each subsequent β is the overall for that n.

So, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is a separate equilibrium, with K = β2 =40.

Wait, but that can't be, because the problem gives four βs, which would correspond to four complexes.

But that approach would complicate things because each complex's formation would be a separate reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the given βs are the stepwise constants. Let me clarify.

In the problem statement, it's said "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Stability constants are usually given for each complex, so for [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, etc. So β1 is the stability constant for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, and so on.

If that's the case, then the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex has a stability constant of β2=40. So, the formation of [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ↔ Co^2+ + 2 SCN^-.

The stability constant, β2, is given by:

β2 = [ [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ] / ( [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^2 )

So, if that's the case, then each complex is considered separately, and the formation is not stepwise but overall.

But in that case, I would need to model each complex's concentration based on their individual βs.

Wait, but that complicates the problem because the presence of multiple complexes would affect each other. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the stepwise βs.

Wait, another approach: the problem may involve the general formula for the distribution of metal complexes in solution, considering each possible complex, and the fractions are calculated using the cumulative β's.

In that case, the initial approach I took earlier using stepwise βs would be correct.

But according to that approach, the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex is about 5.56%, which isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I didn't consider that the stability constants are given as the overall β for each complex, not stepwise. So for [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2=40 is the overall, which is the product of β1 and β2_stepwise.

Wait, so if β1 is the stepwise for the first ligand, and β2_stepwise is the second, then β2_overall = β1 * β2_stepwise.

But in the problem, β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

So, perhaps the overall β for [Co(SCN)_n]^m is βn = β1 * β2 * ... * βn, where each βi is the stepwise.

Wait, but that's not possible because if β1=9, β2=40, then the overall for n=2 would be 9 * 40=360, but the problem says β2=40. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the β's are the overall constants for each complex. So:

β1 = [Co(SCN)]^+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]) =9

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 )=40

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 )=63

β4 = [Co(SCN)_4]^4+ / ([Co^2+][SCN^-]^4 )=16

If that's the case, then each complex's concentration can be expressed in terms of the free [Co^2+] and [SCN^-].

So, for each n, the concentration [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ is βn [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

The total [Co] is the sum of [Co^2+] plus all the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+.

So, [Co]^total = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ + [Co(SCN)_3]^3+ + [Co(SCN)_4]^4+.

Substituting each term using the β expressions:

[Co]^total = [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4.

Factor out [Co^2+]:

[Co]^total = [Co^2+] (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4 )

We know [Co]^total is 1e-2 M. So,

[Co^2+] = [Co]^total / (1 + β1[SCN^-] + β2[SCN^-]^2 + β3[SCN^-]^3 + β4[SCN^-]^4 )

Once [Co^2+] is known, the concentration of each complex can be calculated.

But wait, if that's the case, let's compute the denominator.

Given [SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

Compute each term:

Term0: 1.

Term1: β1 * [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9.

Term2: β2 * [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

Term3: β3 * [SCN]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063.

Term4: β4 * [SCN]^4=
