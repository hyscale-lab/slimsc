Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching. That might suggest an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is often a carbonyl group. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm-1, so 1720 might be a bit higher, maybe an ester or ketone? Hmm, but the 3400–2500 is a broad peak, which is typical for O-H in carboxylic acids. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but another possibility is an alkyne C-H stretch, but that's usually 3300-2500, but the 3400–2500 could also be an alcohol. Hmm. Let me think. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the O-H would be a broad peak around 2500. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but the IR for aldehydes usually has a strong peak near 2820 and 2720 for the C-H stretch, but I'm not sure if that's what's happening here.

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a key point. Carboxylic acids have that around 1700, maybe a bit higher, esters at 1730-1750. So 1720 is in the range for a carboxylic acid, perhaps. Then, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching. So the compound has a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a very deshielded proton. For a carboxylic acid, the -COOH proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and broad. So that's probably the COOH proton.

Then, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. So two substituents on the benzene, in the para positions. The higher chemical shift (8.0) suggests electron-withdrawing groups, which would deshield the protons. Since the carbonyl is present, perhaps it's a benzoic acid derivative, with substituents.

The next peak is at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating to 1H. That could be a methine proton adjacent to an oxygen, maybe.

Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons in a multiplet, perhaps part of a chain attached to another group.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, possibly a methyl group attached to something. Wait, a doublet with 3H? Or is it a triplet? No, the description says d, so doublet. That makes me think it's a methyl group attached to something that splits it into a doublet. For example, a CH2 next to a CH3. Wait, like maybe a CH(CH3) group? Or perhaps a CH2CH2 group where the CH2 is next to a CH3. Hmm.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating to 3H. That's a terminal methyl group, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together. Maybe the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a CH2CH2CH3 group or similar. Wait, the 1.7 ppm is m (multiplet) of 2H, which could be part of a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or perhaps a branching point.

Wait, let me try to sketch this out. We have a benzene ring with a substituent (probably at para position) that is a carbonyl group (like COOH), and another substituent which is an ethyl group or something similar.

Wait, the NMR has an integration of 1H at 2.9 ppm, which is a multiplet. That's a single proton. So perhaps it's like a CH connected to another group. Let's see.

Maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a COOH group and a CH2CH2CH3 group attached. Let's think about another possibility. Let me consider the substituents.

The benzene ring has substituents in para positions. One substituent is the COOH group. The other substituent is another group. Let's say it's an ethyl group, but perhaps more complex.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group, perhaps connected to a CH2 and a CH3. Like a -CH(CH2CH3) group? Or something else.

Wait, let's consider the IR. It has a peak at 3400-2500, which is O-H for a carboxylic acid. So the compound has a COOH group.

The NMR also shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H, which is probably a CH2CH3 group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a doublet, which suggests that the methyl group is adjacent to a CH2 that's split into a doublet. Wait, no—wait, a doublet in NMR for a methyl group usually comes from being next to a CH that has two neighboring protons. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl is attached to a CH that is split into a triplet. Hmm, maybe it's a (CH2)2CH3 group. Or perhaps it's a branching.

Wait, another possibility is that the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think: a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that's more like iso-butyl. Wait, wait, correction: the structure of iso-butyl is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-, but I might be getting this confused.

Wait, the substituent on the benzene could be something like -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let me look at the NMR again. The 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H, which could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. The 2.9 ppm is a multiplet of 1H, maybe a CH connected to a CH2 group. The 1.4 ppm is a doublet of 3H, perhaps a methyl attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to another group.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the integration. The NMR has 1H at 10.5 (COOH), 2H at 8.0 (para to another 2H), 2H at 7.2, 1H at 2.9, 2H at 1.7, 3H at 1.4, and 3H at 0.9. So the total protons add up: 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 14. So the molecular formula likely has 14 H's, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group or something similar.

Wait, let me think of the substituent as a CH2CH2CH3 group, but that doesn't fit the NMR. Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH3 substituent, but that would give a triplet for the CH2CH3, but the 0.9 ppm is a triplet, which fits.

Wait, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH2CH3 group. So there's an ethyl group attached somewhere. Then, the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH2 and perhaps another group. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps, which is attached to another group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is an ethyl group attached to a benzene and a propyl chain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group.

Wait, another thought: the substituent could be a propyl group, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the splitting.

Wait, the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is a single proton. So perhaps it's a CH that's connected to two other CH2 groups, like in a chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group, but that would have a different NMR pattern.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let me think: the substituent is a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3), but that would give a triplet for the terminal CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm, which fits. The adjacent CH2 would be at around 1.7 ppm as a quartet or triplet, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet. Alternatively, perhaps
