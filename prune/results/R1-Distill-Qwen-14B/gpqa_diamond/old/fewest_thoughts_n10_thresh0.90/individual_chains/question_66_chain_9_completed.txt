Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an approach where you consider all possible higher-dimensional operators that could modify the Standard Model. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact symmetries they must respect.

The question is asking which of the given symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. Let me think about each one.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I think all terms in the SMEFT must respect this because the Standard Model itself is Lorentz invariant. So any operator you add shouldn't break that. That makes sense because otherwise, you'd be introducing non-covariant terms, which would complicate things a lot.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. But wait, Lorentz and Poincare are related. Poincare symmetry requires that the theory is invariant under Lorentz transformations and translations. But in SMEFT, when you write down the operators, you're working in a specific frame, right? Or maybe the operators are written in a way that includes all possible terms that respect the symmetries. Wait, I'm not sure. Do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare symmetry as well? Or is it automatically included if they respect Lorentz symmetry?

Wait, no. Poincare includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But when you construct operators for SMEFT, they are written in terms of the fields and their derivatives, so they inherently respect translation symmetry because terms are built from local field operators. So Lorentz symmetry and Poincare might automatically hold together. So if all SMEFT operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they also respect Poincare? Because translation symmetry is already part of the setup.

Or maybe I'm mixing things up. I think that in SMEFT, the operators are written in a way that respects Poincare symmetry. Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense as a low-energy effective theory.

Wait, but isn't Poincare symmetry a bigger symmetry that includes Lorentz and translations. So if you have Lorentz symmetry, what about translations? Since the operators are local and built with fields and derivatives, they must respect translation symmetry. So perhaps all SMEFT operators automatically respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Wait, but the question lists them as separate options. So the first option is 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare). So if both are required, then the operators must respect both. But I thought that Poincare implies Lorentz? Or is it the other way around? Because Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. But does the SMEFT enforce Poincare, or just Lorentz?

Wait, I think in SMEFT, you have to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which is a Poincare-invariant theory. So the SMEFT must respect Poincare symmetry as well. Thus, all operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So options 1 and 2 are correct.

But wait, I also recall that the Standard Model doesn't have CP symmetry in some cases, like in the CKM matrix. But wait, CP symmetry is an approximate symmetry in the Standard Model. So in SMEFT, do they require operators to respect CP symmetry?

Hmm. SMEFT operators can have terms that break CP symmetry, right? Because the Standard Model itself doesn't have exact CP symmetry. For example, the SM has CP violation in the CKM sector. So SMEFT would include operators that can account for that. So the operators aren't required to respect CP symmetry. Therefore, option 3 is not a must.

What about CPT symmetry? CPT is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories. I remember that all renormalizable theories respect CPT symmetry, and so do effective field theories. So SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry. So option 4 is correct.

Wait, but the question is which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So looking back, options 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT) are required, while 3 (CP) is not necessarily required.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare is a bigger symmetry. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. So if the question asks which must be respected, then including both 1 and 2 may not be correct. Because if a theory respects Poincare, it's already respecting Lorentz, so requiring both isn't necessary.

Wait, perhaps the question is whether each operator must separately respect all the listed symmetries. So if Poincare is not the same as Lorentz, but includes it, then I think the correct approach is that operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare. Or maybe both are part of the same requirement.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Poincare group includes Lorentz transformations and translations. So if an operator respects Poincare symmetry, it must also respect Lorentz. But the converse isn't true. So if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it doesn't necessarily respect Poincare unless it also respects translations.

But in the SMEFT, when we write the operators, we include all possible operators that are consistent with the symmetries of the SM, which includes Poincare. So all SMEFT operators must respect Poincare symmetry, which implies they respect Lorentz as well.

Wait, but the options here are separate. So if an operator must respect Poincare, then it's automatically respecting Lorentz, but if it's only required to respect Lorentz, it may not respect Poincare. So in the options, if the operator must respect Poincare, then it must also respect Lorentz. So if a question includes both 1 and 2, that may be redundant.

But the question is, which symmetries must all operators respect? So, whether all operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare, or just one.

Wait, I think in SMEFT, the operators are written down in a way that they are consistent with the underlying Poincare symmetry. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are enforced. Therefore, options 1 and 2 are correct.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me think of the structure of SMEFT. The SMEFT is an effective theory that is valid below the cutoff scale. The terms in SMEFT are organized by dimension, and each term is constructed from the SM fields and their derivatives, in a way that respects the SM gauge symmetry, Lorentz symmetry, and possibly other symmetries.

Wait, so all terms in SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, because that's a part of the Poincare symmetry. But wait, does the SMEFT allow for operators that break Lorentz symmetry? I don't think so. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. So all operators must be Lorentz-invariant.

But Poincare symmetry requires both Lorentz and translation invariance. So for example, the terms in SMEFT are built with fields and their derivatives, so they are automatically translation-invariant. So the SMEFT operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries.

Therefore, both 1 (Lorentz) and 2 (Poincare) are required.

So the correct options are 1, 2, and 4?

Wait, because the question lists four options, and the choices are:

Options:
A) 1,2
B) 3,4
C) 1,2,4
D) 1,3,4

Wait, earlier I thought that operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not CP.

So which of these options includes 1,2,4? That's option C.

But wait, earlier I decided that 1 and 2 are both required. But that would mean that if an operator respects Poincare, it must also respect Lorentz. So perhaps the correct way is that all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. But the question lists both as separate options.

Wait, but the question is about which symmetries must be respected. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz, but the converse isn't true. So if the question is asking which symmetries must be respected, then both Lorentz and Poincare are required. But that can't be the case because Poincare includes Lorentz. So perhaps only Poincare symmetry needs to be considered, but the options don't have that.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach it differently. The Standard Model is a Poincare-invariant theory. Therefore, any effective theory derived from the SM must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So the SMEFT must include operators that respect Poincare.

Therefore, Poincare is a required symmetry. But Poincare implies Lorentz and translation invariance. So if an operator respects Poincare, it automatically respects Lorentz. Thus, requiring both 1 and 2 is redundant because 2 implies 1.

But the question is about which symmetries must be respected, so perhaps both Lorentz and Poincare are required, but in reality, they're both aspects of the same bigger symmetry. So the answer depends on whether the question considers Poincare and Lorentz as separate or not.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the structure of the SMEFT terms. The SMEFT is constructed by including all possible operators that are invariant under the Standard Model gauge symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. So, perhaps only Lorentz symmetry is explicitly required, and Poincare is automatically satisfied because the operators are built from local terms.

Wait, but in reality, the SMEFT is an effective field theory, so it must respect all the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so the SMEFT must also respect that.

But then, all operators must respect Poincare, which includes Lorentz. Therefore, the correct symmetries are 1 (Lorentz), 2 (Poincare), and 4 (CPT), but 3 (CP) is not required.

Wait, but the options are whether the operator must respect each of these. So in the options, option C is 1,2,4. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: Which symmetries are part of the "good behavior" of the SMEFT? SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must respect Lorentz symmetry. Additionally, effective theories like SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because it's a general feature of quantum field theories. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz and translations. So if operators are built from local terms, they automatically respect translations. Hence, the SMEFT operators must respect Poincare.

So in that case, operators must respect Lorentz, Poincare, and CPT, but not necessarily CP.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1,2,4. So the correct answer is C.


In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, which includes Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries. Lorentz symmetry ensures that the theory is invariant under Lorentz transformations, while Poincaré symmetry extends this to include translations. Since SMEFT operators are built from local field operators and derivatives, they inherently respect translation symmetry, meaning that Poincaré symmetry is automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry is respected. Therefore, both Lorentz and Poincaré symmetries must be respected by all SMEFT operators.

CP symmetry, on the other hand, is not a fundamental symmetry of the Standard Model or SMEFT. The Standard Model already incorporates CP violation (e.g., in the CKM matrix), and SMEFT operators can include terms that break CP symmetry. Thus, CP symmetry is not a requirement for SMEFT operators.

CPT symmetry, however, is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories, including effective field theories like SMEFT. All SMEFT operators must respect CPT symmetry.

In summary, all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4), but they are not required to respect CP symmetry (3). Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
