Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability is related to the dimensions of the coupling constants. Let me think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ.

Wait, mass dimension... Right, in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ and c are 1). So each term in the Lagrangian density should have mass dimension 4.

Let me break down the components of the Lagrangian term.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let me figure out the dimensions of each part.

First, ψ is a Dirac spinor. I remember that in 4 dimensions (since we're talking about F^{μν}, which is a field strength tensor of electromagnetism or something similar), the Dirac spinor has mass dimension 3/2. Because in 4D, the fields are: scalar (dim 1), spinor (dim 3/2), vector (dim 2), tensor (dim 3), etc. So ψ̄ (which is the adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ) has dimension 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices and their commutator, but dimension-wise, σ_{μν} is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless. Because gamma matrices are part of the spinor representation and don't carry mass dimensions themselves.

Then, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is a antisymmetric tensor of rank 2. In 4 dimensions, the field strength tensor F has mass dimension 2. Because the Maxwell term is F_{μν} F^{μν}, which has dimension 4, so each F has dim 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, F.

Wait, wait. Let's see the structure: ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the product is ψ̄ (3/2) * σ_{μν} (0) * ψ (3/2) * F^{μν} (2). So the product of the fields is (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2. Let me add them: 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the fields part has mass dimension 5.

Wait, but the entire term must have mass dimension 4 because it's part of the Lagrangian. So κ multiplied by the fields (dimension 5) must have dimension 4. So the equation is [κ] + 5 = 4. That gives [κ] = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That would eliminate options B and D, which have κ with dimension 1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the coupling constants having non-negative mass dimensions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, renormalizable theories require the coupling constants to have mass dimension less than or equal to 4 in 4D. Wait, more accurately, the interaction terms must have mass dimension ≤4.

Wait, another approach: the coupling constants in renormalizable theories must have mass dimension ≤ 4 - (sum of fields’ dimensions). Hmm, maybe I should think about the superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, but in this case, the coupling is dimensionful, as κ has dimension -1. So when you have a coupling with negative mass dimension, that suggests that the interaction term has a higher dimension. So for a term with dimension higher than 4, it's non-renormalizable, because you need the coupling to have negative dimension to compensate for higher dimension of the fields.

Wait, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian term is 4. So when you have a term in the Lagrangian, the product of the coupling and the fields in the term must be dimension 4.

In this case, the term is κ * (ψ̄ σ F ψ). The fields part is dimension 5, so κ must be dimension -1 to make the term dimension 4.

Now, for renormalizability: a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ 4 - d, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no: in general, a term in the Lagrangian with mass dimension D is allowed if D ≤4.

But in terms of renormalizability, the interaction terms must have dimension ≤4. The coupling constants cannot have positive mass dimensions because that would imply that the interaction term is of higher dimension and thus non-renormalizable.

Wait, no: wait, the coupling constant's mass dimension is given by [κ] = 4 - (sum of the fields in the term). So if the sum of the fields is greater than 4, the coupling would have negative dimension. For example, here, the sum is 5, so κ has -1.

In 4 dimensions, a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction term is of higher dimension (since the product of the coupling and the fields is 4). So for a term with more than four dimensions (sum of fields) would require a coupling with negative dimension. Such terms are non-renormalizable because they lead to interactions with higher derivative terms, which can't be handled by the renormalization process in the same way as lower-dimensional terms.

So, in this case, the term is dimension 5, so the coupling κ has dimension -1. Since the coupling has a negative dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable.

Wait but wait, I think I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Renormalizable theories are those where all the interaction terms (vertices) have a coupling with mass dimension ≤ D, where D is 4 in 4D spacetime.

Wait, more accurately: A coupling constant's mass dimension is determined by the requirement that the Lagrangian term has dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. The coupling's dimension is 4 minus the sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term.

For example:

In a φ^4 theory, the term is g φ^4. Each φ has dimension 1 (since in 4D, scalar fields are dim 1). So sum is 4, so [g] is 0. So it's renormalizable.

In Fermi's theory of the four-fermion interaction, the term is g ψ̄ ψ ψ̄ ψ. Each ψ is 3/2. Sum is 3* (3/2) = 4.5? Wait, wait, wait: 4 spinors (ψ̄ and ψ), but each is 3/2. So 4*(3/2) = 6. So [g] would be 4-6= -2. So Fermi's coupling is dimension -2. Since it's negative, the theory is non-renormalizable. Which is correct because Fermi's theory is effective, valid up to some cutoff.

So in our case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. The fields: ψ̄ (3/2), ψ (3/2), F (2). So sum is 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 3 + 2 =5. So [κ] =4-5= -1. So the coupling is dimension -1. Since it's negative, the interaction term is of higher dimension (5), so the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. Looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renormalizable, which would be wrong. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$.

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$
In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ must therefore satisfy:

\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = 4.
\]

- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint spinor $\bar{\psi}$ has the same dimension as $\psi$, $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$.
- The commutator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless, so $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0$.

Adding these dimensions:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

The coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This indicates that the interaction term has a mass dimension higher than 4 (specifically, dimension 5). Such terms are non-renormalizable because they require an infinite cutoff scale, leading to a lack of predictive power at low energies.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable. This corresponds to **Option C**.
