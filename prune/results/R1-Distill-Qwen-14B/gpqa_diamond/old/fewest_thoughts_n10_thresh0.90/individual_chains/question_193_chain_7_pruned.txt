Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's see what the question says.

The question states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, so the formula is like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So if plx increases, the distance is smaller, and vice versa.

Wait, no, wait. Parallax is measured in arcseconds, and the formula for distance is distance in parsecs d = 1/plx. So if the parallax is small, the distance is large. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d or something like that. So plx is proportional to 1/d, which means d is proportional to 1/plx.

But how does the number of stars depend on plx? The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So I can write that as N ∝ (1/plx)^5. Since d is proportional to 1/plx, substituting that in, N ∝ d^5. Because (1/plx) is d, so (d)^5 would be d^5.

Wait, no wait. Let me think again. If N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/d, then 1/pl
