Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again: There's a system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay 2 meters away from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, right, the question is about potential energy in an electrostatic system.

Wait, so the setup is like this: there's a central charge (the 13th) fixed at point P, and 12 other charges are all at a fixed distance of 2 meters from P. Since all the charges are identical, and the system is isolated, I think the potential energy here is the electrostatic potential energy between these charges.

But wait, I remember that electrostatic potential energy is calculated using Coulomb's law. The formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, in this case, the charges are identical, so each pair will contribute to the total potential energy.

But wait, since all 12 charges are identical, each pair between the fixed charge and the others, and between the other charges themselves, will contribute. So I need to calculate the potential energy for all possible pairs and sum them up.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Oh, right! Because in a system of charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained at a fixed distance from P, so their positions relative to each other might not be variable. Wait, but in that case, the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves would have to be considered. Hmm, but if all 12 are at the same distance from P, are they arranged in some symmetric way, like on a sphere around P?

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from point P. So each of them is at a distance of 2m from P. But are they free to move around on that sphere? If they're constrained to that distance but can move on the surface, then the problem might be about the potential energy between all the pairs. But wait, the question is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the configuration with the lowest possible potential energy.

Wait, but wait: since all the charges are the same sign (since each is 2e, so positive if e is positive), the potential energy between any two positive charges is positive because the product q1*q2 is positive. So the system's potential energy would be positive, and to find the minimum, we need to arrange the charges in a way that minimizes this energy. But arranging them as close as possible would decrease the potential energy (since U is positive, making it as small as possible is the same as making it more negative? Wait, no. Wait, if all charges are positive, bringing them closer increases the potential energy because each pair contributes a positive value which grows as r decreases. So to minimize the potential energy, you want the charges to be as far apart as possible. But in this problem, each of the 12 charges is fixed at 2 meters from P, so their distance from each other isn't fixed. Wait, but the problem states that the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps their positions are fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P, but their positions on the sphere can vary. So to minimize the potential energy, how should they be arranged? Because the potential between any two of the 12 charges would be higher if they're close together. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy.

Wait, but wait another moment. The potential energy between two charges is U = (k * q^2) / r. So each pair of the 12 charges contributes that. So the total potential energy from the 12 charges alone would be the sum over all pairs. How many pairs are there? For 12 charges, the number of unique pairs is (12 * 11)/2 = 66 pairs.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy of the entire system. So the system includes the 13th charge fixed at P and the 12 others. So the total potential energy would consist of two parts: the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges.

Let me break it down:

Total U = U_center + U_surrounding

U_center is the potential energy between the central charge and each of the 12 surrounding charges. Since each surrounding charge is at 2m, U_center for each pair is k*(q_center * q_surrounding)/r. Since all charges are 2e, q_center is 2e, and each surrounding is 2e. So each U_center pair is k*(2e)(2e)/(2m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/(2m) = k e² / m. Wait, no: wait 2e * 2e is 4e², divided by 2 meters. So each pair contributes (k * 4e²)/(2) = 2k e². So for 12 such pairs, U_center = 12 * (2 k e²) )? Wait, no, wait: each of the 12 charges is a pair with the central charge. So 12 pairs. Each is (2e)*(2e)/(2m) * k. So that would be 12 * (4 e² * k)/(2) ) = 12 * (2 k e²) ) = 24 k e².

Wait, let me compute that again. Each pair is (2e)(2e) =4 e². The distance is 2m. So each pair's U is (k *4 e²) / 2 = 2 k e². Then, 12 such pairs: 12 * 2 k e² =24 k e².

Then, U_surrounding is the potential energy between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges. Each of those pairs consists of two 2e charges separated by some distance. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that the 12 charges are fixed in position relative to each other—they're only constrained to stay at 2m from P. So they can move on the sphere, and the distance between any two of them can vary. So
