Okay, so I've got this pretty complex chemistry problem here. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms.

Hmm, let's start by figuring out what each part might represent.

First, the reaction of X with Y. I remember that one common violent reaction is when metals react with acids. But Y is a liquid—could it be something like sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid? Or maybe another liquid like water?

Wait, the gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases. For example, H2 gas (hydrogen) has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), but that's maybe a stretch. Another option is CO2, but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe NH3? No, that's a gas but not sure about the protons and neutrons.

Wait, wait. Let me think of the molecular weight. Same number of protons and neutrons. So each atom in the molecule has that. Let's see. For example, in O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the common isotope. So the molecule O2 would have 8+8 =16 each, so same number. But O2 is a gas, but would that fit the reaction?

Alternatively, maybe H2 gas. Each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium), but that's a bit tricky. Or maybe CO2? No, that's more complex.

Wait, another thought. If W is H2 gas, then each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (protium), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe if it's a heavier isotope, like deuterium. Then each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule H2 (or D2) would have 2 atoms each with 1 and 1. So same number of protons and neutrons. That could fit.

Let me move on to the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius. That's close to the melting point of water ice (which is 273 K). But 277 is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe B is another substance.

Wait, if G is a precipitate, perhaps it's a metal hydroxide. When heated, it might decompose. For example, if X is a metal reacting with an acid (Y), the precipitate could be the metal hydroxide, but that doesn't make much sense because metals typically form cations. Alternatively, maybe the precipitate is a sulfide or carbonate.

Wait, another angle: the product of X reacting with a keto acid gives something with 2 oxygen atoms. Keto acids are like ketones, so maybe the reaction is some kind of esterification or something else. But perhaps X is a base, like NaOH, reacting with a keto acid—like a saponification reaction. But wait, the product would have 2 oxygen atoms—maybe an ester or something else. Hmm, not sure yet.

Back to the initial reaction. Let me think about W. If W is CO2, each C is 6 protons, 8 neutrons (since C-12 is most common). So 6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's C-12? Wait, no, CO2 has two O atoms. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So each O has 8 of each. Then the molecule CO2 would have 6 (from C) + 16 (from each O) in terms of protons and neutrons. But wait, for W, the molecule's protons and neutrons are same. So for CO2, the molecule would have 12 protons (6 from C, 6 from O's 8, but wait no, CO2 is C with 6 protons and each O has 8. So total protons in CO2 is 6 + 8*2=22. Neutrons: C is 6 (12-6), each O is 8 (16-8). So total neutrons:6 + 8*2=22. So same as protons. Yes, that fits. So W is CO2.

Wait, but CO2 is a gas when released. So that's a possibility. So the reaction between
