Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax and distance are inversely related. Oh right, parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Wait, so if plx is 1/d, then d is 1/plx. So maybe I can express N in terms of d instead of plx.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/d. So N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Because plx is 1/d, replacing it gives (1/d)^5 in the denominator, which is d^5. So 1/(1/d)^5 = d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is about how the number changes with distance. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the question is about the number per unit range of distance, r. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, the number of stars in a region is given as N ∝ 1/plx^5. So plx is 1/d, so N = k * d^5, where k is a constant.

But wait, the question is about the change with distance, per unit range. So perhaps it's about how the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r (with thickness dr) varies with r.

Wait, in other words, the number of stars in a spherical shell at a distance r with a small thickness dr would be proportional to the surface area of the shell multiplied by the volume density (if stars are distributed in space).

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's go back. The problem states that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N ∝ d^5.

But wait, the number of stars in a region... Wait, perhaps this is considering a volume. Because the number of stars in a volume would depend on how many are in that volume, which depends on the density.

Wait, but this varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So in the problem, when parallax increases (so plx is larger), N is smaller. Because 1/plx^5 would be smaller when plx is larger.

Wait, but the question is asking about the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm. Or per unit range. So maybe it's about the differential number of stars with distance.

Wait, so maybe N is the number of stars in some range of distance. So if we have a thin shell between r and r + dr, the number of stars in that shell would be the surface area times the volume density.

Wait, but how does this relate to parallax? Let's think.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the number of stars in terms of distance. So N = k * (1/plx)^5, since 1/plx is d. So N = k * d^5.

Wait, but wait, that would imply that as d increases, N increases as d^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But that doesn't make much sense because stars are more concentrated in the galactic plane and perhaps more common closer by. Wait, but maybe in this specific region, the number depends inversely on parallax to the fifth.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about how the number of stars in a thin shell (per unit distance) would depend on r.

Wait, the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is given by N = 4π r² * (number density at radius r) * dr.

So if the number density (stars per unit volume) is n(r), then N = 4π r² n(r) dr.

Now, the problem says that the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/d, which we can write as 1/r (if r is the distance). So 1/plx^5 is r^5. So number of stars N is proportional to r^5. But that's the total number up to a certain distance. Wait, no, perhaps it's the number density that depends on 1/plx^5.

Wait, maybe if I model it correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem statement says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, this becomes N ∝ r^5.

But N is the total number of stars in a region. So, if I imagine a sphere of radius r, the number of stars within that sphere is N = k r^5.

But wait, the number of stars in a thin shell (dN) at radius r would be the derivative of N with respect to r, because dN/dr would give the rate of change with r. So dN/dr would be 5 k r^4.

Wait, so the number of stars per unit distance (per dr) would be proportional to r^4. Because dN/dr = 5k r^4, so dN = 5k r^4 dr.

Wait, but the options don't have 5; they're about the dependence, not the coefficient. So the number in a thin shell depends on r^4. Which would correspond to option C, which is ~r^4.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)?" So per unit distance, it's r^4.

So looking at the options:

Option C is ~r^4.

Is that correct? Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: Maybe the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, 1/plx^5 = r^5. So number density n(r) = stars per unit volume = k r^5. So per volume, the number is r^5.

The volume element is 4/3 π r³ dr, so the number of stars in the shell would be n(r) * 4π r² dr = (k r^5) * 4 π r² dr = 4 π k r^7 dr. Wait, that's different. Wait, that's not matching my previous result.

Hmm, so this approach suggests that the number of stars in a shell is proportional to r^7. But wait, that's conflicting with my earlier calculation where dN/dr is proportional to r^4.

Wait, then I must have made a mistake in my assumptions.

Let me clarify. The problem states that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps N = k * (1/plx^5) = k r^5. So N is the total number of stars within a sphere of radius r. So dN/dr = 5k r^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars added is proportional to r^4.

But if the number density is proportional to 1/plx^5, then number density n = k r^5. So the number of stars in a shell would be n(r) * 4π r² dr = (k r^5) * 4 π r² dr = 4 π k r^7 dr. So dN = 4 π k r^7 dr. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^7. Which doesn't match any of the options.

Wait, but that's a problem. So perhaps I'm getting the initial relation wrong.

Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx = 1/r, N = k (1/(1/r))^5 ) = k r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But if N is the total number of stars up to distance r, then the number of stars at a thin shell dr would be dN = 5 k r^4 dr. So per unit distance, dN/dr = 5 k r^4. So it's proportional to r^4.

Which would make option C the correct choice, r^4.

But in the other approach, when I considered number density being proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5, the shell's number would be proportional to r^7. But that's not one of the options, so perhaps that's not the right way to model it.

So which approach is correct? The problem says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So that's N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is N ∝ r^5.

So the number of stars within a distance r is N = k r^5. Therefore, the number of stars in a thin shell at radius r is dN = dN/dr * dr = 5 k r^4 dr. So per unit distance, it's proportional to r^4.

So the answer should be option C, ~r^4.


The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely related to distance (\( r \)) as \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), substituting this relationship gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the total number of stars within a sphere of radius \( r \) is proportional to \( r^5 \).

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range, we consider the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at radius \( r \) with thickness \( dr \). The total number of stars within a sphere of radius \( r \) is \( N(r) \propto r^5 \), so the number of stars in the shell is given by the derivative:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} = \frac{d}{dr} \left( k r^5 \right) = 5k r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance (\( dr \)) is proportional to \( r^4 \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( \sim r^3 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^3 \).
- **B) \( \sim r^5 \):** Incorrect, as this represents the total number of stars within a sphere, not the number per unit distance.
- **C) \( \sim r^4 \):** Correct, as shown by the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4 \).
- **D) \( \sim r^2 \):** Incorrect, as the dependence is \( r^4 \), not \( r^2 \).

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance in the region of the sky changes as \( \sim r^4 \).

Answer: C
