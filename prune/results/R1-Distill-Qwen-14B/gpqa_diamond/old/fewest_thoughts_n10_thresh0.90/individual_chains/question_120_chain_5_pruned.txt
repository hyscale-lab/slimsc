Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me think this through. The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various power laws, so it's about the dependence on plx.

Wait, parallax is a measure of distance. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, right? So a star with a larger parallax is closer to us. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is actually measured in arcseconds, and the formula is distance (in parsecs) = 1 / parallax. So the closer the star, the larger the parallax value.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So like, how many stars do you find in a range of parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx. I think I'm being asked about the number density N as a function of plx.

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their number density in space is uniform. So n(r) is constant. But wait, we're observing them, so we have to consider how that translates into the parallax distribution.

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a shell between distance r and r + dr would be n * 4π r² dr, where n is the number per unit volume. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area (4πr²) times dr.

But parallax is related to distance as plx = 1/r. So r = 1/plx. Let me change variables from r to plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx, because dr/dr = -1/(plx)^2. Wait, because plx = 1/r, so dplx = - dr / r². So dr = - r² dplx. Since r is 1/plx, dr = - (1/plx)^2 dplx. Wait, but when plx increases, r decreases. So when plx is increasing, r is decreasing. So perhaps I should be careful about the limits. But for this calculation, maybe I can just express the number of stars in terms of plx.

The number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is proportional to r² dr. Because surface area is 4πr², and the thickness is dr. So the number is proportional to r² dr.

But since dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx, substituting that in, the number becomes proportional to r² * (-1/plx^2) dplx. Since r is 1/plx, r² is (1/plx)^2. So substituting, r² dr becomes (1/plx^2) * (-1/plx^2 dplx) = -1/(pl x^4) dplx.

Wait, but the number of stars can't be negative, so the negative sign probably comes from the direction of integration. So maybe I should take the absolute value, so the number is proportional to 1/(plx^4) dplx.

So for a given range of plx (from plx to plx + dplx), the number of stars is proportional to 1/(plx^4) dplx. Therefore, the number per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be option A, which is ~1/plx^4.

Wait, but let me think again. Alternatively, could it be a different dependency? Let's see. If the number of stars in a volume element is uniform, then the number per unit volume is n. The volume element in spherical coordinates is r² sinθ dθ dφ dr. But when you integrate over angles, you get 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in that volume is n * 4π r^2 dr.

So when you change variables to plx, since plx = 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. Substituting, the number is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx^2) dplx. Again, the negative is about the direction of integration, so taking the positive, it's n * 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

Thus, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but another angle: the question says 'number of stars per unit range of parallax'. So it's the number density in plx space. So for each dplx, how many stars are there. So yeah, from the calculation, that's proportional to 1/plx^4.

I think that's the correct approach. So the answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance to the star in parsecs. The question assumes stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars, \( n \), is constant.

The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi r^2 dr \). Since \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), we can express \( r \) as \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). Substituting these into the expression for the number of stars in the shell gives:

\[
\text{Number of stars} \propto r^2 dr = \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx}\right) = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} d\text{plx}.
\]

The negative sign indicates the direction of integration, but the magnitude is of interest. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

This analysis confirms that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
