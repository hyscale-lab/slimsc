Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. Let's see what I remember about this topic.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, the main structure is a cyclohexene ring, right? Cyclohex-3-ene means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group), and at position 5, there's a vinyl group (a CH₂CH₂ group but actually, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–). Oh wait, no, vinyl is CH₂=CH-, but in this case, it's attached to the cyclohexene ring. So, 5-vinyl would mean the vinyl group is attached at carbon 5 of the cyclohexene ring.

So the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (which already has one double bond), a formyl group, a vinyl group (which has another double bond), and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 3? No, wait, the -enecarboxylic acid part suggests that the carboxylic acid group is at a certain position. Let me think: cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. The carboxylic acid is attached at position 3? Or does the numbering go such that the carboxylic acid is position 1? Maybe I'm getting confused, but perhaps that's not too important right now.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, that sounds familiar. I remember that red phosphorus is used in the Hinsberg reaction, but wait, no, the Hinsberg reaction uses benzene sulfonyl chloride and then NaOH. Alternatively, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction? Or wait, perhaps it's the hydrolysis of nitriles? No, wait, no. Alternatively, I think when you have a carbonyl group, like a ketone or aldehyde, reacting with HI in the presence of red phosphorus. Oh, wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the reduction of carbonyl groups with HI and red phosphorus... Oh, right! I think that it's the example of the reduction of ketones to alkanes. The reaction is: ketone + HI (excess) + red phosphorus → alcohol? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to recall. The Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg) and HCl. The Wolff-Kishner converts ketones to alkanes using hydrazine and then strong base, like NaOH, with heat. But the reaction with HI and red phosphorus—oh, that's the example of the reduction of carbonyl groups to alkanes through a halogenation step. So, for example, a ketone reacting with HI and red phosphorus would form an alkane. Similarly, an aldehyde would be similarly reduced.

So, in the given compound, there are two carbonyl groups: the formyl group (CHO) and the cyclohexene ring's double bond. Wait, no, the cyclohexene has a double bond, which is a different kind of functional group. The formyl group is a carbonyl (C=O), and the vinyl group is another double bond (C=C).

So the reactant has two carbonyl groups: the formyl group and the cyclohexene's double bond (but that's an alkene, not a carbonyl). Wait, no. The cyclohexene is a ring with a double bond, so that's one double bond. The formyl group is a carbonyl (C=O), and the vinyl group is a double bond (C=C). So the starting molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene's, the formyl's, and the vinyl's. Wait, no: the vinyl is a substituent, so its structure is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. So that's another double bond.

So the reactant has three double bonds: the cyclohexene (1), the formyl (2), and the vinyl (3). Wait, but the formyl is a carbonyl (C=O), which is a double bond, and the vinyl is another C=C. So three double bonds in total.

But when we react this with HI and red phosphorus, what happens? Let's think about each group. The red phosphorus and HI are typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. So the formyl group (CHO) will be reduced. How? The aldehyde group (CHO) upon reaction with HI and red phosphorus would be converted into CH₂OH. Wait, no, wait, I think when you reduce an aldehyde with this method, it becomes a primary alcohol. Because Clemmensen would give CH3, but wait, Clemmensen uses HCl and Zn-Hg. Alternatively, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus—maybe it's a more drastic reduction. Let me think again. Oh, wait, this might be the example of the reduction of a carbonyl group (like ketone or aldehyde) to a methylene group. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, I remember that when a carbonyl group is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to perform a halogenation. For example, the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a bromine or iodine. Wait, no, perhaps not. Another thought: the reaction might be a hydride transfer. Red phosphorus with HI can act as a reducing agent. So, the aldehyde is reduced to a primary alcohol, and the ketone to a secondary alcohol. But wait, in this molecule, is there a ketone group? No, the only carbonyl is the formyl group (CHO) and the cyclohexene's double bond (C=C), and the vinyl group's double bond.

Wait, the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a double bond at position 3-4. At position 2 is the formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is the vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–, so it's attached as CH₂CH₂– but with a double bond, so perhaps the substituent is CH₂CH₂– but that can't be right. Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. So that's another double bond.

So in the starting molecule, the functional groups are:

1. The cyclohexene ring (C=C, so 1 double bond)

2. The formyl group (CHO, another double bond)

3. The vinyl group (CH₂=CH–, another double bond)

So three double bonds in the starting material. Additionally, the carboxylic acid group is present, but that's a single bond.

So when this reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, what happens to each of these groups?

The formyl group (CHO) is an aldehyde. Aldehydes under such conditions (with red phosphorus and HI) are typically reduced. Wait, how? Let me think about the mechanism. Red phosphorus and HI can act as a source of H- (hydride ions). The aldehyde group (CHO) would be reduced to CH₂OH. Wait, no, wait. If it's HI, perhaps it's adding iodide. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into an alcohol. So the CHO group becomes CH₂OH.

Wait, but another thought: in the presence of HI, maybe the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by iodine. For example, the aldehyde could undergo a substitution, replacing O with I. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is reduced to a primary alcohol. Let's think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the reduction of carbonyl groups. Let's think about what each does. HI provides H+ and I- ions. Red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. So perhaps the aldehyde group is reduced to a primary alcohol.

But wait, another possibility: the aldehyde group is first converted to a geminal diiodide. Wait, that's a process where a carbonyl group is treated with HI to form an iodo compound. For example, in the presence of excess HI and a base, ketones can form iodo derivatives. But I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is converted into an alcohol via reduction. So, the CHO group becomes CH₂OH.

Similarly, the vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) is a double bond. How does that react? If the reaction is a reduction, perhaps the double bond is hydrogenated. But the reaction conditions are with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, I don't think that's a typical hydrogenation condition. Hydrogenation usually requires H2 and a catalyst like Pt or Pd. Without that, perhaps the vinyl group remains as is.

Wait, but let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI: perhaps another reaction occurs. Alternatively, the vinyl group might not react under these conditions. Because the main reagent is HI and red phosphorus, which is more likely to attack carbonyl groups.

So the cyclohexene ring's double bond is another functional group. Would that react? Well, cyclohexene is an alkene, which could undergo addition reactions. Again, without a catalyst, perhaps it won't react. So, the alkene may remain unchanged.

Wait, but wait. The reaction is with excess HI. So perhaps the alkyne or alkene could undergo addition. But if the reaction is with HI, maybe the cyclohexene would undergo an electrophilic addition. For example, HI could add across the double bond, leading to a diiodide. But I'm not certain about that.

But wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring, which is an alkene. When treated with HI, alkenes can undergo addition reactions. So, cyclohexene plus HI would add HI across the double bond, forming a diastereomeric diiodide. But the question is, does HI in the presence of red phosphorus do that? Or is the red phosphorus's role different?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the reduction of the carbonyl groups. So, the aldehyde group (CHO) would be reduced to CH₂OH, and perhaps the cyclohexene's double bond would stay the same, or maybe it's reduced as well.

Wait, but the cyclohexene has a double bond. If it's not being reduced, it remains as a double bond. So in the product, how many double bonds would there be?

Let me re-express the problem. The starting material has:

- One double bond in the cyclohexene ring.

- One double bond in the formyl group (C=O).

- One double bond in the vinyl group (C=C).

So three double bonds. Now, after reaction with red phosphorus and excess HI, what changes?

Assuming that the aldehyde (CHO) is reduced to CH₂OH, that would eliminate one double bond (the C=O). The formyl group's double bond is gone.

The vinyl group's double bond would remain, unless something else happens. Does the reaction affect the vinyl group? Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond is also reduced. Because in the reaction conditions, if the aldehyde is being reduced, perhaps other double bonds are also being reduced.

Wait, but red phosphorus is typically used in the reduction of carbonyl groups, not alkenes. So perhaps the alkenes (like the vinyl group and cyclohexene) don't react under these conditions. So they remain as is.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexene ring's double bond is also being reduced. Suppose that the reaction reduces all the double bonds except perhaps the vinyl one, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the alkenes, only the carbony
