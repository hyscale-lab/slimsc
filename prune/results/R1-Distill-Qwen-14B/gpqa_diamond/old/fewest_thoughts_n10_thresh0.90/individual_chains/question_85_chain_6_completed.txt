Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

First, the question gives me a bunch of data about the star and the two planets. The star is more massive and bigger than the Sun, with 1.5 solar masses and a radius of 1.2 solar radii. Its effective temperature is 6300 K. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods, which probably means their masses and orbital periods are known.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular. The RV method detects shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. The problem mentions specific shifts in the [OI] line: Planet1 causes a 0.03 Å shift and Planet2 a 0.04 Å shift. But wait, does this affect the temperature calculation? Maybe not directly. The equilibrium temperature depends on the planet's distance from the star, right?

The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is given by the formula:

Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) 

Wait, no, another way I remember: the equilibrium temperature for a planet is based on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I think is:

Te = T_star * (R_star / (2a))^(1/2)

Because the star's luminosity is proportional to T^4 * R^2, and the planet reflects some of that. So the planet's equilibrium temperature would be based on the stellar flux it receives.

But wait, another approach is using the inverse square law. The flux from the star at a distance 'a' is F = L / (4πa²). The planet absorbs this as a blackbody (assuming albedo is same), so its equilibrium temperature is determined by F = σ Te^4. But L is also related to the star's properties.

So L = 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4. Substituting into F: F = (4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4) / (4π a²) ) = (R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / a² * σ.

Then, setting F = σ Te^4:

(R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / a² * σ = σ Te^4

Cancel σ from both sides, take square roots:

Te = T_star * ( R_star / (a * sqrt(4)) ) ) ?

Wait, no, let me re-derive this correctly. From F = σ Te^4,

Te^4 = F / σ = (L / (4π a²)) / σ

But L is 4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4.

So F = (4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4) / (4π a²) ) 

Simplify: F = (R_star^2 σ T_star^4) / a²

So F = σ T_e^4 => T_e^4 = (R_star^2 T_star^4)/a²

Take the fourth root:

Te = T_star * (R_star / (a))^(1/2) * (1/(2^{1/2})) )

Wait, wait. Let me write it step by step.

F = L / (4π a²) = [4π R_star^2 σ T_star^4 ] / (4π a² ) 

Simplify F: [ R_star^2 σ T_star^4 ] / a² 

So F = σ Te^4, so:

Te^4 = (R_star^2 T_star^4 ) / a² 

Take square root twice: Te = T_star * (R_star / a )^(1/2) * (1/ sqrt(2)) )

Ah, so Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) )

Wait, that's the formula I thought earlier. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's temperature, the star's radius, and the planet's orbital distance a.

But wait, the problem doesn't give the orbital distances. Hmm. Oh, but wait, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the mass and the orbital period and the distance. So from the RV data, perhaps I can find the semi-major axis (a) for each planet.

The RV method measures the star's velocity. The amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) / (2π c )

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the velocity semi-amplitude formula. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )

But since the planets are Earth-like in mass, their mass is much smaller than the star's. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So this simplifies to:

K ≈ [ (2π G) / (c P ) ]^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / M_star^(2/3)

But wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the formula is:

K = (v_planet) * (M_planet / M_star) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, maybe I should recall that the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P * c))^(1/3) )

But I'm not very confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the relation between the RV shift and the Doppler velocity.

Wait, the problem says that the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å (which is the same as the star's Teff, so probably in the star's spectrum) is shifted by 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. The Doppler shift is due to the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The Doppler shift formula is:

Δλ / λ = v / c

But wait, the shift given is the maximum shift. So the maximum velocity is v = c * (Δλ / λ )

But wait, the RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet. So for each planet, K is equal to the maximum Doppler shift velocity.

So for Planet1: 0.03 Å shift on 6300 Å. So Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å. So v = c * (Δλ / λ )

But what's the speed of light c in units where λ is in Angstroms? Hmm. Let me think: c is approximately 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. But in terms of Angstroms per second: 1 m = 1e10 Angstroms, so c = 3e8 m/s = 3e18 Angstroms/s. Wait, no: 1 m = 1e10 angstroms, so 3e8 m/s = 3e8 * 1e10 angstroms/s = 3e18 angstroms/s.

But wait, that seems high. Let me check: 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m. So 1 m is 1e10 angstroms. So 3e8 m/s = 3e8 * 1e10 angstrom/s = 3e18 angstrom/s. Correct.

So v = c * (Δλ / λ )

For Planet1: Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å.

v = (3e18 Å/s) * (0.03 / 6300) ≈ (3e18) * (5e-6) ≈ 1.5e13 Å/s.

Wait, that's 1.5e13 angstroms per second. Let me convert that to km/s. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 1e-13 meters per second. Wait wait, no: 1 angstrom/s = 1e-10 m/s = 1e-13 km/s (since 1 km=1e5 m).

So 1.5e13 angstrom/s = 1.5e13 * 1e-13 km/s = 1.5 km/s.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.03/6300 is about 4.76e-6. So 3e18 * 4.76e-6 = 1.428e13 ang/s. Then, 1 ang/s is 1e-10 m/s, which is 1e-13 km/s. So 1.428e13 * 1e-13 km/s = approximately 1.428 km/s.

So K for Planet1 is about 1.428 km/s. Similarly, for Planet2, Δλ is 0.04 Å.

v = (3e18 Å/s) * (0.04 / 6300)

0.04 / 6300 ≈ 6.349e-6.

3e18 * 6.349e-6 ≈ 1.905e13 ang/s.

Convert to km/s: 1.905e13 ang/s * 1e-13 km/s = ~1.905 km/s.

So K1 ≈ 1.428 km/s, K2 ≈ 1.905 km/s.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v_star) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) / (P * 2π )

But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so (1-e²)^(1/2)=1.

Assuming that P is the orbital period, and M_star >> M_planet, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

Then, K ≈ (G * M_planet )^(1/3) / ( ( M_star )^(1/3) * ( P )^(1/3) ) ) * ( 1 / (2π c) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula:

K = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P c)) )^(1/3) )

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should use a simplified version since M_planet << M_star.

Another approach: the star's velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's orbital velocity v_planet by the mass ratio.

K = (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet

But wait, that's only true if the planet's orbit is much smaller than the star's. Alternatively, the star and planet orbit their mutual center of mass, but since M_star >> M_planet, the star's orbit is much smaller. So the velocity of the star K is related to the planet's velocity v by K = (M_planet / M_star) * v.

But more accurately, the star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is (M_star / M_planet) * K.

Because the center of mass requires M_star * K = M_planet * v_planet.

So, v_planet = (M_star / M_planet) * K.

But the planet's velocity in orbit is v_planet = 2π a / P, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star) and P is the orbital period.

Wait, but Kepler's third law relates P^2 = (4π² a^3) / (G(M_star + M_planet)).

Again, since M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star )

So, a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² )

But we also have v_planet = 2π a / P

So, substituting a from above:

a = [ (G M_star P²) / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

So v_planet = 2 π / P * [ (G M_star P² / (4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 )

= 2 π / P * ( G M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Simplify exponents:

P^(2/3 - 1) = P^(-1/3 )

So,

v_planet = 2 π ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) P^(-1/3 ) / (4 π² )^(1/3 )

Let me compute the constants: 4^(1/3) is about 1.5874, π^(2/3) is about (3.1416)^(2/3) ≈ 2.145.

So 2 π / (4 π² )^(1/3 ) = 2 π / [ (2^2 π² )^(1/3) ) ] = 2 π / [ 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) ]

Which is 2 / 2^(2/3) ) * π / π^(2/3 ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) * π^(1 - 2/3 ) = 2^(1/3) * π^(1/3 )

So v_planet = (2^(1/3) π^(1/3 )) * (G M_star )^(1/3 ) P^(-1/3 )

Which can be written as [ (2 π G M_star ) / P ]^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps another approach would be better. Since K = (v_planet) * (M_planet / M_star )

From earlier, v_planet = (2 π a ) / P.

And from Kepler's law, a³ = G M_star P² / (4 π² ), so a = [ G M_star (P/2π )² ]^(1/3 )

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's think about the ratio of the planets' semi-major axes.

We have K1 and K2, which we calculated as approximately 1.428 km/s and 1.905 km/s, respectively.

From the formula: K = (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet )^(1/3) ) * (1/(P c ))^(1/3 )

But assuming i=90 degrees (edge-on orbit, which is necessary for the transit method to detect the planet), so sin i=1.

And since M_planet << M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ (2 π G )^(1/3) * (M_planet ) / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1/(P c ))^(1/3 )

We can rearrange this to solve for P:

K^3 = (2 π G ) / (c^3 ) * (M_planet³ ) / (M_star ) * (1 / P )

So,

P = (2 π G ) / (c^3 ) * (M_planet³ ) / (K^3 M_star )

Hmm, perhaps instead of solving for P, I should find a relationship between the semi-major axes of the two planets.

Let me denote a1 and a2 as the semi-major axes of Planet1 and Planet2.

From Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G M_star )

Thus, a^3 = G M_star P² / (4 π² )

So, for each planet:

a1³ = ( G M_star P1² ) / (4 π² )

a2³ = ( G M_star P2² ) / (4 π² )

Taking the ratio:

(a1/a2)^3 = ( P1² / P2² )

So,

a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3 )

But I don't know P1 and P2. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate K1 and K2 to P1 and P2.

Wait, from the K equation:

K = ( (G M_planet ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P c ))^(1/3 )

Wait, let me write K as proportional to (M_planet )^(1/3 ) / ( P^(1/3) )

Because K is proportional to (M_planet / P )^(1/3 )

So,

K1/K2 = ( (M1 / P1 ) / (M2 / P2 ) )^(1/3 )

=> (K1/K2)^3 = ( (M1 P2 ) ) / ( (M2 P1 ) )

Hmm, but I have two unknowns: P1 and P2. So perhaps I can't find the exact ratio of a1 and a2 this way.

Alternatively, perhaps from the Doppler shift data, I can find the ratio of their velocities, which relates to their orbital periods.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet )^(1/3 ) / ( P^(1/3) )

So, K ∝ (M/P )^(1/3 )

So, K1/K2 = ( (M1/P1 ) / (M2/P2 ) )^(1/3 )

But I'm stuck because I don't know P1 and P2.

Wait, but from Kepler's law, the square of the period is proportional to a^3 / M_star.

So, P² ∝ a³ / M_star → P ∝ a^(3/2) / sqrt(M_star )

Hmm, perhaps I can find a1 in terms of a2, then substitute into the K ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express a in terms of K.

Wait, from the formula for K, and using Kepler's law, perhaps I can find a relation between a and K.

I think I need another approach. Let me think about the equilibrium temperature ratio.

The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) )

So, the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) )

Simplify:

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, the ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the semi-major axis ratio.

So if I can find a1/a2, I can find the temperature ratio.

But to find a1/a2, I need to use the RV data. Let's think about what K tells us.

From the RV method, K is proportional to (M_planet / a )^(1/3 )

Wait, let me think. The star's velocity is K, which is due to the planet's orbital motion. The star's velocity is related to the planet's velocity by the mass ratio.

So, K = (M_planet / M_star ) * v_planet

But v_planet is the planet's orbital speed, which is 2π a / P.

So,

K = (M_planet / M_star ) * (2 π a / P )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G M_star )

So,

P = 2 π ( a^3 / ( G M_star ) )^(1/2 )

Substitute P into K:

K = (M_planet / M_star ) * ( 2 π a ) / ( 2 π (a^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) )

Simplify:

The 2 π terms cancel.

K = (M_planet / M_star ) * a / ( (a^3 / ( G M_star ))^(1/2 ) )

Which is K = [ M_planet / M_star ] * a / [ a^(3/2) / ( G M_star )^(1/2) ) ]

Simplify the denominator:

a^(3/2) = a^(1) * a^(1/2) → denominator is a^(3/2) → so when dividing by a^(3/2), you subtract exponents:

a / a^(3/2) = a^(-1/2) = 1 / sqrt(a )

So,

K = [ M_planet / M_star ] * [ ( G M_star )^(1/2 ) / a^(1/2) ) ]

= ( M_planet ) / ( M_star^(1/2) ) ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / sqrt(a )

= M_planet * sqrt( G M_star ) / ( M_star^(1/2) sqrt(a) )

= M_planet * sqrt( G ) / sqrt( a )

So,

K = M_planet * sqrt( G ) / sqrt( a )

Rearranged,

a = ( G M_planet² ) / ( K² )

Wait, let me square both sides:

K² = ( G M_planet² ) / a

→ a = G M_planet² / K²

Wait, that can't be right, because units-wise, K is velocity, which is m/s. G is in m³/(kg s²).

Hmm.

Wait, let's check the units.

K has units of m/s.

M_planet is in kg.

a is in meters.

So,

K² has units (m²/s²).

G has units m³/(kg s²).

So,

G M_planet² has units (m³/(kg s²)) * kg² = m³ kg / s².

Then, G M_planet² / K² → (m³ kg / s² ) / ( m²/s² ) ) = m kg.

Hmm, which is not the same as meters (a). So perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me re-derive this step.

We had:

K = (M_planet / M_star ) * (2 π a / P )

But from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star )

So,

P = sqrt( (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) )

So,

2 π a / P = 2 π a / sqrt( (4 π² a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) )

= 2 π a * sqrt( G M_star ) / ( sqrt(4 π² a^3 ) )

= 2 π a * sqrt( G M_star ) / ( 2 π a^(3/2) )

The 2 π cancels.

= a * sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(3/2 )

= sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(1/2 )

So,

K = (M_planet / M_star ) * sqrt( G M_star ) / a^(1/2 )

= M_planet * sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( a ) * sqrt( M_star ) )

Because sqrt( M_star ) is from M_star^(1/2).

So,

K = M_planet * sqrt( G ) / sqrt( a M_star )

Square both sides:

K² = ( M_planet² G ) / ( a M_star )

Multiply both sides by a M_star:

K² a M_star = M_planet² G

So,

a = ( M_planet² G ) / ( K² M_star )

Thus,

a ∝ ( M_planet² ) / ( K² )

Because G and M_star are constants for both planets.

So, a1/a2 = ( (M1² / K1² ) ) / ( (M2² / K2² ) ) )

= ( M1² K2² ) / ( M2² K1² )

= ( (M1/M2 )² (K2/K1 )² )

So,

a1/a2 = ( (M1/M2 ) * ( K2/K1 ) ) )²

Wait, but wait, (M1² / M2² ) * ( K2² / K1² ) = ( (M1/M2) * (K2/K1) ) )^2.

Yes.

So, the ratio a1/a2 is [ (M1/M2) * (K2/K1) ] squared.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (0.04/0.03) ]^2

Wait, because K2 is 0.04 and K1 is 0.03.

So,

(7/5) = 1.4, (0.04/0.03) ≈ 1.3333.

So,

(1.4) * (1.3333) ≈ 1.86667.

Then, square is (1.86667)^2 ≈ ~3.484.

So, a1/a2 ≈ 3.484.

Wait, but wait: K for Planet2 is 0.04, and for Planet1 is 0.03. So K2/K1 = 0.04/0.03 = 4/3 ≈1.333.

So,

a1/a2 = [ (7/5) * (4/3) ) ]^2.

Wait, (7/5) is 1.4, (4/3) is ~1.333, so 1.4 *1.333 = about 1.8667.

So, 1.8667 squared is approximately 3.483.

So, a1/a2 ≈ 3.483.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it exactly.

7/5 = 1.4, 4/3≈1.333333.

1.4 *4/3 = (14/10) * (4/3) )= (56/30 )= 28/15 ≈1.866667.

So, (28/15 )^2 = 784/225 ≈3.4844.

So, a1/a2 ≈3.4844.

Which means a1 is about 3.4844 times a2.

But wait, earlier we thought a1/a2 is 3.4844. So a1 is larger than a2, which makes sense if K1 is smaller than K2, because for the same mass, a larger planet would have a larger a, but since K is higher for Planet2, perhaps that implies a closer orbit.

Wait, but K is higher for Planet2. Let me think: K depends on (M_planet )^2 / a.

If M_planet is larger (like Planet1 has 7, Planet2 has 5), but K for Planet2 is larger (1.905 vs 1.428), so for Planet2, even though M is less, K is higher.

The formula a1/a2 = [ (M1/M2) * (K2/K1) ]^2.

So, substituting M1=7, M2=5, K2=0.04, K1=0.03.

(7/5) * (0.04/0.03) = (1.4) * (1.3333) = 1.866666.

So, a1/a2 = (1.866666)^2 ≈3.4844.

So a1 is larger than a2, meaning Planet1 is further from the star than Planet2.

So, the semi-major axis of Planet1 is about 3.48 times that of Planet2.

Now, equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) )

So,

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) 

= sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) 

Because R_star and 2 are common factors and cancel out.

So,

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

Since a1/a2 ≈3.4844, a2/a1 = 1/3.4844≈0.287.

So, sqrt(0.287) ≈0.535.

So, Te1/Te2 ≈0.535.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is approximately 0.535.

Looking at the options: option C is ~0.53.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{star}}\) is the star's effective temperature, \(R_{\text{star}}\) is the star's radius, and \(a\) is the planet's orbital distance. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is given by:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Thus, the key is to find the ratio of the semi-major axes \(a_1/a_2\), which can be derived from the radial velocity (RV) data. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is related to the planet's mass \(M_{\text{planet}}\), orbital distance \(a\), and the star's mass \(M_{\text{star}}\). Using the simplified relationship for \(K\):

\[
K \propto \frac{M_{\text{planet}}}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

we find that:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1 / \sqrt{a_1}}{M_2 / \sqrt{a_2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_1}{M_2} \cdot \frac{K_2}{K_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_1 = 7\) Earth masses, \(M_2 = 5\) Earth masses,
- \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\), \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\),

we calculate:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{7}{5} \cdot \frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^2 = \left(1.4 \cdot 1.333\right)^2 \approx (1.8667)^2 \approx 3.484
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 3.484 \cdot a_2\), meaning Planet1 orbits farther from the star than Planet2.

Now, substituting \(a_1/a_2 \approx 3.484\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3.484}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.535
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to option C.

**Answer: C**
