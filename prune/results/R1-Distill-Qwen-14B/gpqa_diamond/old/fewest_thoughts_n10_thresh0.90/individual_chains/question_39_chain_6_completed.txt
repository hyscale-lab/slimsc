Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to understand what's going on. Hmm, the question says we have a large number of identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. Each particle's wave function is given, and when we measure their positions, all the particles are found between x=1 and x=3. We need to find the value of 'a' in the wave function.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, and since i is the square root of -1, this must be a complex wave function. But when we measure position, the probability is related to the square of the absolute value of the wave function, right?

So, the wave function Ψ(x) is (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The probability density is |Ψ|², which is [ (a / sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 ].

But wait, the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this region. Or maybe the wave function is zero except between 1 and 3. Hmm, but the given expression is only for a part of space where the particle can exist. Oh, right, the wave function is zero elsewhere, but the given part is in the region between 1 and 3.

Wait, the question says the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i in the part where it can exist. So the particle is only found between x=1 and x=3. That makes sense because when they measured, none were found outside that.

So the wave function is Ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i for 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, that can't be correct because a wave function can't have an imaginary component without a real part if it's supposed to be a valid, normalizable wave function. Or can it?

Wait, no, the wave function can be complex, but it must be square-integrable and satisfy certain conditions. But in the given expression, Ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5.

Hmm, but the probability density is the sum of the squares of real and imaginary parts. So |Ψ|² = (a²)/(1 + x) + (0.5)^2.

But for the wave function to be normalized, the integral of |Ψ|² dx from x=1 to x=3 must equal 1.

So the integral becomes ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from 1 to 3. Let's compute this.

Breaking it into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

The first integral, a² * ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to 3. So a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). Because 4 is 2^2, ln(4)=2ln2, and ln(2) is subtracted, so 2ln2 - ln2 = ln2.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that. Wait, 1+x from 1 to 3: when x=1, 1+x=2; x=3, 1+x=4. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2)=ln(2). So the first part is a² ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5. And we know this must equal 1 because the wave function is normalized.

So set up the equation: a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Let me compute ln(2). I remember it's approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. Then a squared is about 0.7213, so a is the square root of that.

Compute sqrt(0.7213). Hmm, sqrt(0.72) is about 0.8485, since 0.85^2 is about 0.7225. So a is approximately 0.8485, which is close to 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start with the given wave function:

\[
\Psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i, \quad \text{for } 1 \leq x \leq 3.
\]

The probability density is given by \( |\Psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 \). Since the wave function is normalized, the integral of \( |\Psi(x)|^2 \) over the region \( x \in [1, 3] \) must equal 1:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. **First term**: \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \).  
   The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so:

   \[
   \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[\ln(1+x)\right]_1^3 = a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
   \]

2. **Second term**: \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \).  
   This is straightforward:

   \[
   \int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
   \]

Adding these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Subtracting \( 0.5 \) from both sides:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.8485.
\]

This value is closest to \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
