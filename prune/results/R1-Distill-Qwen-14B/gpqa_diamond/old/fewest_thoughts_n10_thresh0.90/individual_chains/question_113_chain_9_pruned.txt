Okay, so I've got this question about identifying a compound based on its spectra. Let's see, I remember that different spectroscopic techniques give different kinds of information. Let's break down each clue one by one and see what they tell us.

First, the FTIR shows a very broad peak at around 3000 cm⁻¹. Oh wait, that broad peak is probably from O-H stretching. I think alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids have those broad peaks. But wait, the question says it's very broad, which makes me think of a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are broader than alcohols. Or maybe it's a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. So, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, the 1700 is a strong peak, which is typical for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the 1650 is a bit lower. Wait, in IR, a carbonyl in a conjugated system, like in a conjugated ester or maybe an acid, would have lower wavenumbers. For example, a ketone is around 1700-1750, while an acid might be a bit lower, maybe around 1700 but could go lower if conjugated. Or maybe it's an ester or something else. Also, maybe 1650 is from another functional group, like an aromatic ring or an amide, but the question doesn't mention NMR peaks that suggest amides. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyls? Or maybe one is a carbonyl and another is something else. Wait, could it be a conjugated system like a ketone and another group? Like a conjugated carbonyl and maybe an aromatic ring. Or maybe it's an ester with some conjugation.

Looking at the NMR spectrum, it says there are peaks corresponding to vinyl-hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. Also, since NMR detects protons, the presence of vinyl protons suggests either an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring, but since it's specifically vinyl, probably a double bond.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. Hmm, 45 is an interesting mass. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a (CH3)2O group, but wait, (CH3)2O has a molecular weight of 31 (15 for O, 12*2 for the two CH3s, plus 6 for the hydrogens, so 12*2 + 6 +16= 30? Wait, maybe I should calculate it properly. CH3-O-CH3 (dimethyl ether) is 12*2 + 6 +16 = 44? Hmm, that's 44. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment with a methyl group and something else. Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH(OH) group? No, not sure. Or perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. Let me think about the possible formulas.

The options are:
A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

Wait, let's think about molecular formulas. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option. Degrees of unsaturation are (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since there's no X or N in any of these, it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12. So (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1. So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond. But wait, wait, if the compound has both a ring and a double bond, that's two degrees. Hmm, but maybe O's affect? Wait, no, O doesn't affect degrees of unsaturation. So 1 from A.

Option B: C6H10O. (2*6 +2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. So two degrees. Could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. (2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2 degrees. So same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. (2*6+2 -12)/2= (14-12)/2=1. So same as A, one degree.

Wait, but from the NMR, we have vinyl hydrogens, implying a double bond. So the compound must have a double bond. So that accounts for at least one degree.

Looking at the IR, the 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ peaks. If there's a carbonyl group, that's another double bond, so that would add another degree. So what about the options?

Option A: 1 degree: so either a double bond and no rings, or a ring and no double bonds. But we have a double bond from the NMR, so A must have one double bond (possibly a ring and a double bond? Wait, that would be two degrees, but A only has one). Wait, if A has a double bond and a ring, that would be two degrees. But according to the calculation, A has only 1. So that can't be. Then A cannot have both a ring and a double bond. So perhaps it's a single ring or a single double bond.

Wait, but looking again, maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl, so that's a double bond. Then the vinyl in the NMR is another double bond. So that would be two double bonds, which would require two degrees of unsaturation.

So which options have at least two degrees of unsaturation? Let's see:

Option B: 2 degrees. So could have a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Option C: 2 degrees.

Option D: 1 degree. So not enough because we have two double bonds.

Option A: 1 degree, which is only enough for one double bond or one ring.

Wait, but wait. If the compound has a carbonyl (double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), that's two double bonds, which is two degrees. So the compound must have at least two degrees. So options with two degrees are B and C.

So, the molecular formula must be either B (C6H10O) or C (C6H10O2).

Now, looking back at the IR data. The 1700 and 1650 cm-1. 1700 is likely a carbonyl. 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps conjugated. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) stretch. But wait, the NMR has vinyl protons, which suggests a double bond, maybe an alkene. So perhaps the 1650 is an alkene's C=C stretch. But wait, C=C in alkenes typically appears around 1650-1600 cm⁻¹. So if there are two double bonds, one is a carbonyl (1700) and the other is an alkene (1650), that fits.

So that suggests that the compound has both a carbonyl group and an alkene. So that's two double bonds, so two degrees of unsaturation. So the formula must have two degrees, which points to B or C.

Next, the FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹. As I thought earlier, that's likely O-H. So the compound has an O-H group. So which of B or C has O?

Option B is C6H10O. So one O. That could be an alcohol or another O-containing group.

Option C is C6H10O2. Two O's, so maybe two hydroxyl groups, an ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid.

Wait, since the FTIR broad peak is at 3000, which is O-H, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that would also show a broad peak. Also, carboxylic acids have O-H and a carbonyl. But let's think about the possible functional groups.

If the compound is a carboxylic acid, then it would have a COOH group, which includes a carbonyl (1700) and an -OH. The 1650 peak could be from the conjugated -COOH. Wait, but carboxylic acids typically have a broad O-H peak, which fits the IR. So if the formula is C6H10O2, that's option C. Because a carboxylic acid would have two O's: one in the COOH.

Wait, a carboxylic acid has formula RCOOH, which is RCO-OH. So the formula would be CnH2nO2. Let's see, for n=3, it's C3H6O2. So for a six-carbon, n=5 would be C6H10O2? Wait, no. Wait, R is (n-1) carbons. So for a six-carbon acid, it's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, that would be C6H12O2, but that's one of the options (option A). Hmm.

Wait, molecular formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. So for n=5: C5H10O2. For n=6: C6H12O2 (option A). Our options for B and C are C6H10O and C6H10O2.

But wait, earlier we thought the compound has a double bond (from NMR), which would reduce the number of hydrogens. So for a six-carbon carboxylic acid, the formula is C6H12O2. But if it has a double bond, the formula would have fewer hydrogens. For example, a six-carbon carboxylic acid with a double bond would have the formula C6H10O2, which is option C. So that could fit.

So the IR shows a broad O-H, which would be from the carboxylic acid. The 1700 cm⁻¹ is the carbonyl (C=O) of the acid, and the 1650 could be from conjugation, perhaps. The NMR shows vinyl H, which would be from a double bond. So the structure would be a substituted carboxylic acid with a double bond somewhere.

But wait, could the compound be an ester instead? Esters have O and a carbonyl. So, for an ester, the formula would have more oxygen. But if the compound is an ester with a double bond, the oxygen count would depend on the ester. For example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2, which fits the O2. But we're talking about a six-carbon compound here.

Alternatively, if the compound is a diol, but then the IR wouldn't necessarily show a 1700 cm⁻¹ peak. So probably not.

So, if it's a carboxylic acid, which would fit the O-H, carbonyl, and perhaps the double bond. Let me think about the mass spec. The fragment at m/z 45.

Hmm, 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me think about what fragments could have 45. One possibility is the (CH3)CO+ ion. Wait, CH3CO+ is 43 (12*2 +3*1 +16= (24+3+16)=43). But 45 is 43 plus 2, so maybe CH2CH2CO+? No, probably not. Alternatively, maybe a pentyl group or something else.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. The molecular weight would be (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114 g/mol.

In mass spec, the M+ is usually the molecular ion. So the M+ would be at 114. But the question says the fragment is at 45. So that's a fragment that breaks off from the molecule.

What would give a fragment of 45? Let's think about possible neutral losses. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, perhaps losing CO2 would give a 45? Wait, CO2 is 44, but 45 is one more than that. Hmm, not quite.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If it's an ester, maybe it's something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH2CH3 or something similar. Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester like a lactone, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a substituted benzene ring, but the molecular formula doesn't include a benzene ring—wait, no. The options are all six carbons, but without aromatic rings (since the question doesn't mention any specific aromatic peaks except for possible conjugation). Alternatively, maybe it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid.

Wait, let me think about the possible fragments. 45 could be a CH2CH2CO+ group, but the molecular formula for that would be 45? Let me compute. CH2CH2CO+ would be (12*3)+(1*4)+16 O= 36 +4 +16=56? No, that's way over. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CH2O+ group? But 12*2 + 6 +16= 24+6+16=46. Hmm, that's close but not 45.

Wait, another thought: 45 could be the loss of something. For example, if the molecule is a diester or has an ester group, maybe it could lose a fragment. Wait, maybe a methyl group (15) plus something else, but that doesn't add up. Alternatively, if the molecule has a ketone group, maybe a cleavage occurs.

Wait, another approach is to think about the possible molecular formula. Let me consider the molecular ion. For option C, the molecular weight is 6*12 +10 +32=72+10+32=114. So M+ would be at 114. Then the fragment at 45 is 114-69=45. Hmm, but I don't know what 69 is. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from another part.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a (CH2)2O group. Wait, that's 12*2 + 6 +16=46. But 45 is one less. Not quite.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is due to a loss of a larger group. Suppose the molecule is something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. The molecular formula would be C6H10O2. When it breaks, it might lose the ester part, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the vinyl group. Wait, vinyl groups are CH2=CH-. If the molecule breaks into a CH2=CH-O- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the FTIR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. So, another thing that could have two peaks in that region is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Such as an enone (conjugated ketone). So the structure could be something like CH2=CH-CO-R, which would have a conjugated system. This would show a carbonyl peak at lower wavenumbers because of conjugation.

In that case, the IR at 1700 could be the carbonyl, and 1650 the conjugated C=C.

So, considering that, the compound has a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond.

If the formula is C6H10O2, for example, that could fit. Let's think about a structure like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's more than six carbons. Alternatively, perhaps a cyclic ester.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted cyclohexene with a carboxylic acid group. But that's more complex.

Now, the mass spec fragment at 45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 could be a (CH3)2O group. Wait, (CH3)2O is 31, not 45. Hmm, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group, which is 45? Let me calculate: (CH2)2O is (2*12) + (4*1) +16=24+4+16=44. Oh, almost. 44 is the molecular weight of (CH2)2O, which is ethylene glycol. But 45 is one more, so perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is from the cleavage of the carbonyl group. For example, if the molecule breaks at the carbonyl, giving a fragment with the carbonyl and something else. But I'm not sure.

Another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. If the compound is a diester, or maybe an ester with a double bond. Let's think of a possible structure. Suppose it's methyl vinyl acetate, but that's more O's. Alternatively, perhaps it's an unsaturated ester like CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that's C4H6O2, which doesn't match.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Let's count the carbons: 2 from CH2=CH, 2 from CH2COO, and 2 from CH2CH3. That's 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2. Yes, that fits option C.

So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. In this case, the NMR would show vinyl protons (the CH2=CH part), which matches the question.

In the mass spec, when this molecule breaks apart, perhaps the ester group (COOCH2CH3) breaks off, leaving the CH2=CHCH2- part. The molecular weight of CH2=CHCH2- would be 42 (12*3 + 6=42). But the fragment is at 45, which is higher. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is the (OCH2CH3) part plus something else. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule undergoes a McLafferty rearrangement, which is common in esters or ketones with adjacent double bonds. McLafferty rearrangement would produce a fragment with a characteristic mass. Let me recall, the McLafferty rearrangement typically gives a fragment where a gamma hydrogen is lost, and it forms a new double bond. The mass of the fragment would be the molecular ion minus the mass of a small fragment like H2O or CO.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the fragment at 45 could be the (CH2CH2CO+) group. Let me calculate: CH2CH2CO+ is (12*3) + (2*5) + 16= 36 +10 +16=62. No, that's not it.

Wait, another approach: The molecular formula is C6H10O2. If it's an ester, say RCOOR', then the formula would be (CnH2nO2) for R being (n-1) carbons and R' being m carbons, such that n + m + 2 =6? Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, which is a lactone. For example, a six-membered ring would have a lactone with the formula C5H8O2. Hmm, but that's not matching C6H10O2.

Wait, perhaps the compound isn't an ester but a ketone with a double bond. But then the O count would be one, so that would point to option B (C6H10O). But earlier we thought the O is part of a carbonyl, so perhaps it's a ketone. But if it's a ketone and an alkene, that's two double bonds, so two degrees, which fits.

Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which would suggest an O-H group, not a ketone. So if it's a ketone, the O wouldn't be from an O-H. So that would suggest that the broad peak isn't from a ketone but from an O-H group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

So, going back, the O is probably from an -OH group. If the compound is a diol with a carbonyl, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's an alcohol with a conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a beta-keto alcohol. Structure like CH2=C(OH)CH2COOH. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cinnamic acid derivative. Cinnamic acid is C9H8O2, which doesn't fit the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted acrylic acid. For example, CH2=CHCOOH. That's C3H4O2. But the option C is C6H10O2, which is a six-carbon compound. So perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, let's think about the molecular formula C6H10O2. That's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, 2 oxygens. So the degree of unsaturation is 2, which could be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds.

Earlier, we thought the compound has a carbonyl (double bond) and a vinyl group (another double bond), so two double bonds. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH2COOCH2CH3. Wait, that would have the ester group and the vinyl group. So, in that case, the IR would show the ester carbonyl around 1700 and maybe an alkene around 1650. The O-H would be absent because it's an ester, so then the FTIR wouldn't show a broad peak at 3000. But in the question, the FTIR does show a broad peak at 3000, which suggests an O-H group.

Hmm, that complicates things. So if the compound has an O-H group, then maybe it's a β-keto acid or something with both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl.

Wait, another option: maybe it's a cyclohexene ring with a substituent that has a carbonyl and an OH group. But again, the exact structure is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is an allyl alcohol with a carbonyl group. For instance, a structure like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. But that would have a carboxylic acid group (so O-H), a carbonyl, and a vinyl group. So that fits the IR and NMR data.

The molecular formula for this would be C6H10O2, which is option C. So let's calculate:

CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH: that's 6 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 2 oxygens. Yes, C6H10O2.

So, the IR would show O-H (broad peak) from the carboxylic acid, the carbonyl (1700), and the alkene (1650). The NMR would show vinyl protons. The mass spec would have a fragment at 45. Let's think about that.

In the mass spectrum, when the molecule breaks, perhaps the COOH group loses or forms a fragment. Alternatively, maybe a McLafferty rearrangement occurs. Wait, McLafferty rearrangement is common in ketones with gamma hydrogens, but in this case, it's a carboxylic acid. Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule breaks between the vinyl and the rest, giving a fragment of CH2=CHCH2+ which has a molecular weight of 42 (12*3 + 6=42), but the fragment is at 45, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The molecular ion is at 114. If a fragment is at 45, that would suggest the loss of 69 (114-45=69). What's a fragment with 69? Maybe a (CH2)3COOH group? No, that's more than 69. Wait, 69 is the molecular weight of something like (CH2)2COOH (but that's 60). Alternatively, perhaps a benzene ring is involved, but the options don't include aromatic hydrocarbons.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible options again.

Option C: C6H10O2. If the compound has a carboxylic acid group, the O-H would explain the IR peak, and the NMR has vinyl groups. The degrees of unsaturation fit with two double bonds (carbonyl and alkene). The mass spec fragment at 45 must come from somewhere.

Wait, what's the molecular formula of the fragment at 45? Let's think of possible ions. 45 is 16 (O) + 29 (something). 29 is the molecular weight of
