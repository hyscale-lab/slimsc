Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

So, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't look right. Oh wait, no, I think I misread. Wait, the state is a column matrix, which means it's a vector. So, it's a 3-element vector because the operators are 3x3 matrices. The elements are (-1, 2, 1), but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by vectors in a Hilbert space, so the components should be complex numbers, but these are real. Hmm, but maybe that's okay. Let me not get stuck on that yet.

The problem involves two observables, P and Q, each represented by a 3x3 matrix. The question is about finding the probability of getting a specific outcome when measuring P first, then Q. Specifically, the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

I remember that when you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of P and Q.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the measurement of P will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then the measurement of Q will be done on this new state. But wait, the problem says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." Oh, but wait: the problem is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the measurement of P gives 0, and then Q gives -1. So, the steps are: measure P, state collapses to an eigenstate of P corresponding to 0, then measure Q on that state, and see the probability of getting -1. Or wait, no: the problem just gives two measurements, but does it imply that the measurements are made in sequence? Because without knowing the state after P is measured, you can't directly compute the probability for Q.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So the joint probability that P is 0 and Q is -1.

Hmm. Wait, but how are these measurements done? If the first measurement is P, then the state collapses to an eigenstate of P, and then the second measurement is of Q on that state. So the probability of the first measurement being 0 and the second being -1 would be the product of the probability of getting 0 in P and then the probability of getting -1 in Q given that the state is in the eigenstate of P (for eigenvalue 0).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a single measurement process where both observables are measured, but that's not how it's phrased. No, the question says someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the process is sequential: first measure P, then measure Q on the resulting state.

But to find the probability of both events happening, it's the probability that P is 0, multiplied by the probability that Q is -1 given
