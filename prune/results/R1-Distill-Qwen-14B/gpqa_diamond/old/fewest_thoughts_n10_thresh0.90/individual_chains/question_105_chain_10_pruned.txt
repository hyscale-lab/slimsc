Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of that hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is about photometric observations, which measure brightness over time. Because the star is rotating, these spots will cause brightness variations as they come into and out of view. The interesting part is that this situation can mimic the presence of an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of such a planet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spots, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

So, I need to calculate the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius (Rpl/Rstar) such that when the planet transits in front of the star, it blocks the same amount of light as the spots do.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that the spots cause periodic brightness variations, which are being mistaken for a planet. So normally, a planet transiting the star would block some light, causing a dip in brightness. Similarly, the star's spots would make the observed brightness dip when they're on the side facing us. But in this case, the problem is phrased a bit differently: it's asking what planet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as the spotted star. So, the amplitude here refers to the change in brightness.

Hmm. So, we're comparing two scenarios:

1. The star with spots causing a brightness variation.
2. A planet transiting the star causing a brightness variation.

We need to find Rpl such that the dip caused by the planet is equal in amplitude to the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but no. The question says, "if the star was not covered by spots, what would be the radius of a planet to produce the same amplitude." So, the situation is that the star's spots are causing a certain signal, and the planet's transit would cause another. The question is, what planet size would make both signals have the same amplitude.

Wait, no. The question is: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e. Rpl/Rstar)?" So, the star without spots would have a planet transit creating a certain dip. The spotted star without the planet would have a different dip. The question is to have the same amplitude.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, the star is currently observed to have spots, which create a certain variation. The problem says this can "closely resemble" the presence of an exoplanet. So, the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would cause.

But the question is phrased as: "To produce the same amplitude signal [...] what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet?" So, if the star wasn't spotted, what planet size would cause the same dip as the spots currently do.

Wait, no. The problem says, the situation can closely resemble an exoplanet. So the variation from the spots is similar to a planet's transit. They want to find the Rpl such that the transit would cause the same change in brightness as the spots. So, the dip from the planet is the same as the dip from the spots.

So, I need to compute the amplitude of the dip caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about how the spots affect the brightness. So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. Let's call Rstar = R_sun.

The dark spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%. Wait, wait: the filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots on that hemisphere. So, one hemisphere is 20% spots. So, the area covered is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface area.

But wait, the star's surface is a sphere, so the total surface area is 4π R^2. Each hemisphere is 2π R^2. So, area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So, the spots cover 10% (0.1) of the total surface area.

But wait, the problem says one hemisphere is covered with 20% filling factor. So, each hemisphere is 50% of the surface. The filling factor is 20%, so the area is 0.2 * 50% = 10% of the total surface area. So
