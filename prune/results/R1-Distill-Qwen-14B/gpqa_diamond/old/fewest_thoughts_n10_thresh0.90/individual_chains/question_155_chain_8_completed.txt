Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the standard deviation, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

Alright, the setup: we have a system in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, I need to calculate the uncertainty of P_z in this state.

Wait, so the state is already expressed in the basis of P_z, right? Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the state's components are the coefficients in that basis. That simplifies things because I don't need to change the basis; I can directly compute the expectation values.

The formula for uncertainty is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). So I need to find both <P_z> and <P_z²>.

Let me write down the matrix for P_z. The problem states that P_z has a matrix with first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), and third row (0,0,-ħ). So in matrix form:

P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

The state vector is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

First, calculate <P_z>. This is the expectation value, so ψ† P_z ψ.

Breaking it down:

Each component of ψ multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, then summed.

So:
(-1/2)*ħ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ħ) 
= (-ħ/2) + 0 + (ħ/2) 
= (-ħ/2 + ħ/2) = 0

So <P_z> is zero.

Next, calculate <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared will just have the squares of the diagonal elements.

P_z² = [ [ħ², 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, ħ²] ]

So <P_z²> is the same as ψ† P_z² ψ.

Same calculation:
(-1/2)^2 * ħ² + (1/√2)^2 * 0 + (-1/2)^2 * ħ²
= (1/4) ħ² + 0 + (1/4) ħ²
= (1/4 +1/4) ħ²
= (1/2) ħ²

So now, the uncertainty is sqrt( <P_z²> - (<P_z>)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The state is in the eigenbasis of P_z, so each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. The first component is -1/2, but the P_z matrix has eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. So the state can be written as a combination of |+> (eigenvalue ħ), |0>, and |-> (eigenvalue -ħ).

The state vector is [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2]. Let me square the components to find probabilities. The squared magnitudes are (1/4), (1/2), (1/4). So the probabilities are 25%, 50%, 25%.

So the expectation value of P_z is ( (-1/2) * ħ ) * 25% + (0) *50% + ( (-1/2) * (-ħ) ) *25% = (-ħ/2)(1/4) + 0 + (ħ/2)(1/4). Wait, no, wait: the state components are the amplitudes, so the expectation value is sum of |amplitude|^2 * eigenvalue.

Wait, no, the expectation value is sum( |c_i|^2 * p_i ), where p_i is the eigenvalue for each basis state.

So for the first component (c1 = -1/2), |c1|^2 = 1/4, eigenvalue for P_z is ħ. So contribution: (1/4) * ħ.

Second component: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, eigenvalue 0. So 1/2 *0=0.

Third component: |c3|^2 = (1/2), eigenvalue -ħ. So (1/2)*(-ħ) = -ħ/2.

Total expectation: (ħ/4) + 0 + (-ħ/2) ) = (ħ/4 - 2ħ/4) = (- ħ/4 ). Wait, that's different from what I got earlier. Oh wait, no, wait a second, I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, no. Because the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z, each basis vector is |±> and |0>. So the components of the state are coefficients in that basis. So when I compute <P_z>, it's the sum of |c_i|^2 * eigenvalue for each i.

So for each component in the state vector, the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements of P_z.

So the first component is -1/2, so |c1|^2 is ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4. The eigenvalue of the first basis vector (which is |+z> ) is ħ. So contribution is 1/4 * ħ.

Second component is 1/sqrt(2), |c2|^2 is 1/2. The eigenvalue is 0, so contribution is 0.

Third component is -1/2, |c3|^2 is 1/4. The eigenvalue is -ħ, so contribution is 1/4 * (-ħ) = - ħ/4.

So total < P_z > = ( ħ/4 ) + (0) + ( -ħ/4 ) = 0. Oh, same as before. So that's correct. So <P_z> is zero.

What about <P_z²>? The eigenvalues for P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0, ( -ħ )^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So each component's contribution is |c_i|^2 multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

So first component: (1/4) * ħ².

Second component: (1/2)*0.

Third component: (1/4)* ħ².

Total <P_z²> = (1/4 +1/4 ) * ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So the uncertainty is sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( ħ² / 2 ) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Looking at the options, option B is ħ/√2. So the answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ for the given system, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal, with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot (-\hbar).
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$.

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$, with eigenvalues $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + \left| \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 \cdot 0 + \left| -\frac{1}{2} \right|^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

Thus, $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}$.

### Step 3: Compute the Uncertainty
The uncertainty is:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
