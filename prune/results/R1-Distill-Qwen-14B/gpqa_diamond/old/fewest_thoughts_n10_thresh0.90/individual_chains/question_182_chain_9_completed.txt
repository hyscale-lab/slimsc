Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The Mott-Gurney equation is for the dark current in a semiconductor device, right? And it applies when the current is space-charge-limited. Oh right, space-charge-limited means that the electric field is so strong that the space charge (the accumulation of charge near the electrodes) is what's limiting the current, not other factors like thermal emission or something else.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V² / L³). So J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the applied voltage, and L is the device length.

Now, the question is about the conditions under which this equation is valid. I remember that the derivation of the Mott-Gurney equation assumes certain things. Let's break down the options.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps (like impurities or defects) would complicate the current by causing carrier trapping, which isn't part of the simple SCLC model. Single-carrier means only electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact implies that the contact doesn't create a barrier for carriers, so it's easy for them to move into the device. But wait, the equation is usually for cases where the current is due to injection from the contacts, so maybe Ohmic contacts are a part of it.

Wait, but the Mott-Gurney equation is more about when the current is limited by the space charge, so the electric field is so strong that it's the dominant factor. So what about drift vs. diffusion?

In the derivation, I think the assumption is that the current is due to the electric field, so drift current is important, but diffusion is negligible. Because in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the space charge, which creates a strong field, leading to drift-dominated transport. So if the equation is valid under negligible diffusion, then that's an important condition.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion. No injection barrier implies Ohmic contact, I suppose. So this sounds plausible. Because if there's no injection barrier, the carriers can move easily into the device, so the current is limited by how many can be injected under the space charge condition.

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact. Schottky contacts have barriers, so they would affect the current. Oh wait, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes the contacts are such that the carriers can easily inject, so perhaps a Schottky contact, which has a barrier, would mean that the current is limited by the barrier, not the space charge. So maybe the equation isn't valid there. Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Schottky barriers are for metal-semiconductor contacts, and they have a barrier height. If the barrier is high, it might limit the current, but in SCLC, the space charge is the limiting factor. So whether the contact is Ohmic or Schottky might matter if the barrier affects the number of carriers that can be injected. But the Mott-Gurney model assumes a certain way of carrier injection, perhaps with no barrier (Ohmic contact) or that the barrier is negligible compared to the voltage applied. So maybe C is not correct because a Schottky contact would have a significant barrier, which might not be compatible with the assumptions.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion. The equation is for a single-carrier device, right? Because when both electrons and holes are present, the current would be more complicated. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices because it's based on the idea that only one type of carrier is contributing to the current. So D is probably wrong because it's a two-carrier device.

Back to the options. So the correct scenario is a single carrier, trap-free, and the current is mainly due to drift. So the equation assumes negligible diffusion current. Because in SCLC, the current is mainly drift, and diffusion is not the main factor.

Wait, the options: which one says negligible diffusion?

Option B says "no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion." So that would fit. Because if the injection barrier is zero (Ohmic contact), then all applied voltage goes into creating the space charge. And since diffusion is negligible, it's drift-dominated.

Option A says "Ohmic contact and negligible drift." Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if drift is negligible, then the current isn't due to the electric field. But in SCLC, drift is dominant. So Option A is probably incorrect because it says negligible drift.

So Option B seems to be the correct condition. Let me recap: Mott-Gurney applies when the current is limited by space charge, which happens when the device is single-carrier, trap-free, with no injection barrier (so Ohmic contact), and the current is dominated by drift (so diffusion is negligible).

Wait, but in the given options, option B says "no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." So no injection barrier implies Ohmic contact (they're the same thing), and negligible diffusion means drift is dominant, which fits the SCLC condition.

So the correct answer should be B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current density \( J \) in a semiconductor device operating in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is valid under specific conditions, which include the following assumptions:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The current is dominated by either electrons or holes, not both.
2. **Trap-free material**: There are no impurities or defects that trap charge carriers, ensuring smooth transport.
3. **Negligible diffusion current**: The current is primarily drift-dominated, as the strong electric field in the SCLC regime limits the current to drift effects.
4. **No carrier injection barrier**: This implies an Ohmic contact, where carriers can easily inject into the device without significant barrier effects.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This states "trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current." However, the SCLC regime requires drift to be dominant, not negligible. Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: This states "trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation, as it describes a single-carrier device with no injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion, consistent with drift-dominated transport in the SCLC regime. This option is correct.
- **Option C**: This states "single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current." A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which would limit the current due to injection rather than space charge. This does not satisfy the conditions for the Mott-Gurney equation. Thus, this option is incorrect.
- **Option D**: This states "two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current." The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, not two-carrier devices. Thus, this option is incorrect.

The correct answer is **Option B**, as it satisfies all the conditions required for the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation.

Answer: B
