Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about measuring observables P and Q in a system, and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring P first and then Q. 

Wait, the system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, but wait a second, in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Let me check the norm. The vector is (-1, 2, 1), so the norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so it's not normalized. Maybe the actual state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1). Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must have a length of 1. So probably that's the case here, but the question just gives it as (-1,2,1), so perhaps we need to normalize it ourselves before proceeding.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. Let's write them down. 

Operator P's matrix is:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, so it looks like it's a symmetric matrix. Hmm, not sure if that's important. 

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal, right? First row: 1,0,0; second: 0,0,0; third: 0,0,-1. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is: If we measure P first and then Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but how does this process work? When you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So first, we measure P, and get 0. Then, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, we measure Q on this new state, looking for eigenvalue -1. The probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, right? Or wait, is it the product because each step depends on the previous? Let me think.

Wait, no. The first measurement (P) gives a certain probability of getting 0, and upon getting 0, the state becomes the corresponding eigenvector. Then, the second measurement (Q) is done on this new state, which gives another probability for -1. So the combined probability is the product of the two probabilities only if the measurements are independent, but in this case, the second measurement depends on the outcome of the first. So perhaps I need to compute the probability of getting 0 in P, then the probability of getting -1 in Q given that P was 0. Then multiply those two probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the probabilities step by step.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P, because the possible outcomes when measuring P are its eigenvalues, and the state after measurement is the corresponding eigenvector.

So, operator P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Hmm. The eigenvalues are the solutions to the equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[-λ, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, -λ]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix:

I can expand it along the first row.

-λ * det[ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ] - (1/√2) * det[ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ] + 0 * ... 

Wait, let's compute this.

The determinant is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0.

Simplify each part.

First term: -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ].

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] = -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ) / 2.

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + λ/2 = 0.

Expanding the first term:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Wait, because (-λ)(λ²) is -λ^3, and (-λ)(-1/2) is + (λ)/2.

So,

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0.

Combine the terms:

-λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor this:

λ (-λ² + 1) ) = 0.

So the solutions are λ = 0, and λ² =1 → λ=1, λ=-1.

Wait, wait. So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation because that seems a bit off. Let me calculate the determinant again more carefully.

Wait, the determinant expansion for a 3x3 matrix is a bit more involved. Let me try expanding again.

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix:

| a b c |
| d e f |
| g h i |

is a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).

So applying this to (P - λ I):

a = -λ, b=1/√2, c=0
d=1/√2, e=-λ, f=1/√2
g=0, h=1/√2, i=-λ

So determinant is:

(-λ)[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
- (1/√2)[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

First term: (-λ)[ λ² - (1/2) ) ] → -λ (λ² - 1/2 )

Second term: -(1/√2) [ (-λ/√2) - 0 ] → -(1/√2)(-λ/√2) = (λ) / 2

So determinant = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2 ) + λ/2.

Expanding the first product:

-λ^3 + (λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

So yes, the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ ( -λ^2 + 1 ) = 0 → λ = 0, λ = ±1.

So eigenvalues for P are 0, 1, -1.

So when we measure P, possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

But the question is about measuring 0 for P. So let's find the eigenvectors for P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

For P, when λ=0, the matrix P - 0 I = P is:

[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]

We can write the system (P) v = 0.

So, the equations are:

1) (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 =0.

2) (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

3) (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

So from equation 1 and 3, v2 is 0.

From equation 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form (a, 0, -a), where a is any scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so we can take the eigenvector as (1, 0, -1), normalized. The norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2. So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

But wait, let me double-check. Because P matrix had a zero in the first element, leading to v2=0. Then, equation two gives v1 + v3 =0. So yes, the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of (1,0,-1). So normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstate for P=0 is |ψ_p0> = [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T / sqrt(6) because the norm is sqrt(6). Wait, the question gives the state as (-1,2,1), but I think in quantum mechanics it's a column vector. So the initial state is |ψ> = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Now, the probability of getting 0 when measuring P is the square of the amplitude of the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector |ψ_p0>.

So the amplitude is the inner product of |ψ> and |ψ_p0>:

<ψ_p0 | ψ> = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0 * (2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) + ( -1 )/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ (-1 -1 ) / (sqrt(12)) ) ] → [ (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) ) ] → (-1) / sqrt(3).

So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(3). So the probability is the square of the magnitude: (1/3).

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

Now, if we measure P and get 0, the state collapses to |ψ_p0> = (1,0,-1)^T / sqrt(2).

Next, we measure Q on this new state. What's the probability of getting -1?

Operator Q is diagonal: diag(1,0,-1).

So Q's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So, the eigenstate for Q=-1 is |q-1> = (0, 0, 1)^T.

So the state after measuring P=0 is |ψ_p0> = (1, 0, -1)^T / sqrt(2).

We need the component of |ψ_p0> in the |q-1> direction.

The amplitude is < q-1 | ψ_p0 >.

|q-1> is (0,0,1).

So the inner product is (0 * 1/sqrt(2)) ) + (0 * 0) + (1 * (-1/sqrt(2))) ) = -1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the magnitude: (1/2).

So the probability of measuring Q=-1 after getting P=0 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait. The state after P measurement is |ψ_p0>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). Let me see if this state is an eigenstate of Q. Q is diagonal, so it's easy to compute Q acting on |ψ_p0>.

Q |ψ_p0> = [ [1,0,0], [0,0,0], [0,0,-1] ] * [1, 0, -1]^T / sqrt(2).

So, first component: 1 * (1/sqrt(2)) → 1/sqrt(2)
Second component: 0
Third component: (-1)*(-1/sqrt(2)) → 1/sqrt(2)

So Q|ψ_p0> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Hmm, that's not a scalar multiple of |ψ_p0>, so |ψ_p0> is not an eigenstate of Q. So when we measure Q, the state will collapse into one of the eigenstates of Q.

The eigenstates of Q are |q1> = (1,0,0), |q0>=(0,1,0), |q-1>=(0,0,1).

So the probabilities are the square of the inner products.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is | < q-1 | ψ_p0 > |².

Which is | (0, 0, 1) · (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) ) |² = | (-1)/sqrt(2) |² = 1/2.

So the probability is 1/2.

So the combined probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given P=0.

So total probability is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 1/6. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, the initial state is (-1, 2, 1)/sqrt(6), correct?

The eigenvector corresponding to P=0 is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2). The inner product is (-1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) → (-1)/(sqrt(12)) -1/(sqrt(12)) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3). The square is 1/3. So correct.

Then, in the state |ψ_p0>, the probability of measuring Q=-1 is 1/2. So 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So the answer is D.

But wait, another approach is to compute the combined probability using the projectors.

Alternatively, perhaps the state after P=0 is |ψ_p0>, and then projecting onto Q=-1. So the overall probability is | <q-1| P0 |ψ> |².

Wait, let's compute that.

Wait, |ψ> = (-1, 2,1)/sqrt(6).

Projector onto P=0 is |ψ_p0> <ψ_p0|.

So P0 = |ψ_p0><ψ_p0|.

Then, the projector for Q=-1 is |q-1><q-1|.

So the combined probability is <ψ | P0 |q-1><q-1| P0 |ψ> ?

Wait, maybe another way. The overall probability is the square of the amplitude <q-1 | P0 | ψ>.

Because, after measuring P=0, the state is |ψ_p0>, then the amplitude for Q=-1 is <q-1 | ψ_p0>.

So the combined probability is | <q-1 | ψ_p0> |² * | <ψ_p0 | ψ> |².

Wait, no. The total probability is the probability of first getting P=0 and then getting Q=-1 in that state. So that's |<ψ_p0 | ψ>|² * |<q-1 | ψ_p0>|².

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6. So yes, same result.


To solve the problem, we analyze the system's state and the observables \( P \) and \( Q \). The system's initial state is given as \( |\psi\rangle = (-1, 2, 1)^T / \sqrt{6} \), normalized to ensure it has unit length. The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\]

and \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \), which yields \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is found to be \( | \psi_{P=0} \rangle = (1, 0, -1)^T / \sqrt{2} \).

### Step 2: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of the initial state \( |\psi\rangle \) in the direction of \( | \psi_{P=0} \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle \psi_{P=0} | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle \psi_{P=0} | \psi \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses to the eigenstate \( | \psi_{P=0} \rangle = (1, 0, -1)^T / \sqrt{2} \).

### Step 4: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The eigenstates of \( Q \) are the standard basis vectors \( | q_1 \rangle = (1, 0, 0)^T \), \( | q_0 \rangle = (0, 1, 0)^T \), and \( | q_{-1} \rangle = (0, 0, 1)^T \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of \( | \psi_{P=0} \rangle \) in the direction of \( | q_{-1} \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle q_{-1} | \psi_{P=0} \rangle = 0 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \langle q_{-1} | \psi_{P=0} \rangle \right|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Combined probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is the product of the two probabilities:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
