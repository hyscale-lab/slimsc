Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I should think about what I know. The question talks about an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it should emit radiation. The problem is asking about the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle theta (30 degrees) and the form of the radiated power function f.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the angle theta from the axis of symmetry. The radiation pattern is probably symmetric in some way. For a dipole radiator, the radiation is maximum at the equator, which is 90 degrees from the axis. But wait, this is a spheroid, so maybe it's a dipole-like radiation pattern?

Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is such that the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So the maximum intensity is along the equator (θ=90 degrees), and minimal along the poles (θ=0 or 180). But wait, in this problem, the oscillating charge distribution is spheroidal. So perhaps it's similar to a dipole but with a different angular dependence? Or maybe it's a quadrupole? Hmm, no, I think the main point is that the radiation pattern depends on the angle in a specific way.

The question states that the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. And the maximum power is A. We need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the form of f.

So first, I should figure out the form of f. For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated in a particular direction is proportional to (sinθ)^2, and inversely proportional to some power of wavelength. The power per unit solid angle (like the radiation intensity) for a dipole is given by the formula something like (p^2 sin^2θ)/(c^3 epsilon_0) * (1/(4π)) * something else. Wait, wait, more accurately, the formula for the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is ( (μ₀ p₀² ω^4 sin²θ
