Okay, so I have this question about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry in molecules, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, what's C3h symmetry? I remember that C3h is a type of molecular symmetry. The 'C3' part refers to a three-fold rotation axis, and the 'h' means there's a horizontal mirror plane involved. So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone.

Option C: triisopropyl borate.

Option D: quinuclidine.

I'll go one by one.

Starting with option C, triisopropyl borate. I think that's a borane compound with three isopropyl groups attached to boron. The structure is something like B with three isopropyl substituents. Isopropyl groups are CH(CH3)2. So each substituent is the same. So the molecule is probably symmetric. Boron is the central atom with three identical substituents. Wait, but symmetry-wise, if all substituents are the same, maybe it has a higher symmetry.

Boron is in the center, so the structure might have a trigonal planar geometry. If all three substituents are the same, that would give it at least C3 symmetry. But does it have a mirror plane? Wait, for C3h, you need a horizontal mirror plane. So if the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees and has a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis, that would be C3h.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the mirror plane. Triisopropyl borate—if I imagine the molecule, each isopropyl group is attached to B. So if I rotate the molecule 120 degrees around the B atom, each group moves to the next position, which would look the same. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Let's think. If I imagine a plane that's perpendicular to the axis going through B (the C3 axis) and cutting through the middle, would the molecule mirror on either side? Each isopropyl is symmetric, so maybe yes. So it might have C3h symmetry.

But wait, maybe I'm confusing it with another symmetry. Alternatively, could it have higher symmetry, like D3h? Because if the molecule has a horizontal mirror plane and also other planes, perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate is more symmetric. Wait, but I'm not positive. Let's move on and think about another option.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic amine. It's known for having a bridged structure, like a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system with an amine group. Its structure is quite symmetric. I'm trying to remember its symmetry. Quinuclidine has a central nitrogen, and the molecule has a three-fold rotation axis, right? Because the three bridges are equal. So for quinuclidine, when you rotate it 120 degrees about the three-fold axis (which goes through the nitrogen and the center of the molecule), it should look the same. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, quinuclidine is a convex molecule. So if you imagine a plane cutting through the middle, perpendicular to the C3 axis, would the top and bottom halves mirror each other? I think so. So that horizontal mirror plane would be present.

So quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. Because it has a three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror. So that would make option D a correct answer.

But wait, let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. That's a complex name. Trifuran suggests three furan rings. The substituents are benzene rings attached. So the numbering and substituents are such that there are three benzene rings attached to the furan system.

I'm trying to visualize this structure. Benzo rings are attached to the furan in a way that each substitution is symmetric. So perhaps the compound has a C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, if it's a tricyclic system with three substituents, perhaps it's symmetric. For C3h symmetry, the molecule should look the same when rotated 120 degrees and have a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis.

In benzo-trifuran systems, the substituents might be arranged symmetrically, but I'm not sure if they have a mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's more like a C3v symmetry without the h, meaning without the horizontal mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric in such a way that it has a mirror plane. If the three benzene rings are equally spaced, then maybe a mirror plane exists. But I'm not certain. Maybe it's better to think about the other options.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Similar to option B, but with triphenylene substituents. Triphenylene is a larger substituent. So perhaps the arrangement is such that the three substituents are symmetric. Again, perhaps it has a C3h symmetry. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the structures. Quinuclidine is a well-known molecule with C3h symmetry. Triisopropyl borate—each isopropyl is the same, so maybe C3v symmetry, which doesn't have the mirror plane. Or maybe higher symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps it's D3h, which includes a horizontal mirror.

Wait, wait. Let me recall: the 'h' in C3h means that there's a horizontal mirror plane. So the mirror plane is perpendicular to the rotation axis. If the molecule has this, then C3h is present.

Looking back at triisopropyl borate: It's a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So when you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Now, does it have a mirror plane? Well, in such a molecule, there are multiple planes of symmetry. For a trigonal planar molecule, each substituent is in a plane. Wait, perhaps the molecule has D3h symmetry, which includes a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about symmetry elements. C3h is a point group. The elements are a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So if a molecule has both, it's C3h.

D3h has more symmetry elements, including a horizontal mirror plane and other planes, but it's a higher symmetry group.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate may belong to C3v symmetry, which has a three-fold rotation and vertical mirror planes but no horizontal mirror. So without the h.

But I'm not certain. Quinuclidine, on the other hand, I'm pretty sure has C3h symmetry. So let me think again. Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane derivative. The molecule has three identical bridgehead substituents (the methyl groups in the case of quinuclidine is actually a bridge with CH2 groups, but the main point is the nitrogen and the symmetric bridges). So rotating the molecule 120 degrees around the axis through N brings it back to itself.

Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If I imagine cutting through the middle of the molecule, perpendicular to the three-fold axis, would the top and bottom halves mirror each other? Yes, I think so, because the structure is symmetric on that plane.

So option D, quinuclidine, has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I should also consider the other options.

Option B: benzo... It's a trifuran with benzene substituents. Let's think about the structure. The core is a trifuran, which is a tricyclic system of three fused furan rings. The substituents are benzene rings attached to positions c, c', etc.

Assuming that the benzene rings are attached in a symmetric way, perhaps at three symmetric positions. So the molecule has a three-fold rotation symmetry. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Maybe. Alternatively, the substituents could be arranged such that the mirror plane passes through the center and reflects each benzene ring.

But wait, in some cases, when substituents are attached in a symmetric fashion, a horizontal mirror plane exists. So perhaps this molecule has C3h symmetry as well.

Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me think of another approach. Maybe looking at the number of substituents and their arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A or B, but I'm more confident about D.

Wait, I recall that quinuclidine is a common example of a molecule with C3h symmetry. So I think that's the correct answer.

So the answer should be D) quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h** symmetry, we analyze the symmetry elements required for this point group: a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h). Let us evaluate each option:

### Option A: **Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
This molecule is a tricyclic system with three fused furan rings and triphenylene substituents. The substituents are attached symmetrically, suggesting a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, the arrangement of the substituents does not clearly indicate the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h). Without definitive evidence of a horizontal mirror plane, this molecule likely does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option B: **Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
This molecule is also a tricyclic system with three fused furan rings and benzene substituents. The substituents are attached symmetrically, indicating a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, similar to Option A, the presence of a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h) is unclear. Without a definitive horizontal mirror plane, this molecule likely does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option C: **Triisopropyl borate**
This molecule has a central boron atom bonded to three identical isopropyl groups. The molecule is symmetric, and the three identical substituents suggest a three-fold rotation axis (C₃). However, the molecule lacks a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h), as the substituents are not arranged to satisfy this symmetry requirement. Thus, it does not have **C₃h** symmetry.

### Option D: **Quinuclidine**
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane system and a nitrogen atom at the bridgehead. The molecule has a three-fold rotation axis (C₃) due to the symmetry of the three equivalent bridges. Additionally, it has a horizontal mirror plane (σ_h) that passes through the nitrogen atom and the center of the molecule. Since it satisfies both the C₃ and σ_h symmetry elements, quinuclidine has **C₃h** symmetry.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, **quinuclidine** (Option D) is the only molecule that exhibits **C₃h** symmetry.

**Answer: D**
