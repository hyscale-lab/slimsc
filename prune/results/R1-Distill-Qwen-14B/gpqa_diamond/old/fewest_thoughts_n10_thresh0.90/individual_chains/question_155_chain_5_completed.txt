Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the Pz operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it.

The question says that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz, which is the standard deviation of Pz in this state.

Wait, right, the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the expectation values. The formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). So I need to compute these two expectation values.

First, let me recall that the state is a column vector ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. But wait, I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of its elements: (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 + 1)/4 = 4/4 = 1. Oh, okay, so it's already normalized. Good, no need to normalize it.

Now, to find ⟨Pz⟩, I compute ψ† Pz ψ. And ⟨Pz²⟩ is ψ† Pz² ψ. But wait, Pz is already a diagonal matrix, so Pz squared will just have the squares of the diagonal elements. Let me write down the matrices to make it clear.

The Pz matrix is given as:
[ ħ   0   0 ]
[ 0   0   0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, -ħ. So Pz squared is diag( ħ², 0, ħ² ), since (-ħ)^2 is ħ².

Wait, but maybe I should think more carefully. Let me write this out. Pz is a 3x3 matrix. So each diagonal element in Pz is the eigenvalue corresponding to that basis state. Since the basis vectors are eigenvectors of Pz, that makes things easier.

The state ψ is expressed in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors, which are the basis vectors here. So each component of ψ corresponds to the amplitude in each eigenstate of Pz.

So the first component is -1/2, which is the amplitude for the eigenvalue ħ. The second component is 1/√2, amplitude for eigenvalue 0. The third component is -1/2, amplitude for eigenvalue -ħ.

Wait, no. Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So each basis vector |i> corresponds to the ith row and column of Pz. So the first basis vector has eigenvalue ħ, the second has 0, and the third has -ħ.

Now, the state ψ is a linear combination of these. So the state can be written as ψ = (-1/2)|1> + (1/√2)|2> + (-1/2)|3>, where |1> has Pz eigenvalue ħ, |2> has 0, and |3> has -ħ.

So the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ would be the sum of the probabilities times their eigenvalues. Because, for an eigenstate, if the state is |i>, then ⟨Pz⟩ is just the eigenvalue. But when the state is a superposition, it's the weighted sum.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = |c1|² * (ħ) + |c2|² * 0 + |c3|² * (-ħ).

Plugging in the coefficients:

c1 = -1/2 → |c1|² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

c2 = 1/√2 → |c2|² = 1/2.

c3 = -1/2 → |c3|² = 1/4.

So:

⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)*ħ + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ) - (1/4 ħ) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. The expectation of Pz is zero.

Now, what about ⟨Pz²⟩? Let's compute that. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz² will have the squares of the eigenvalues. So each |ci|² multiplied by (eigenvalue)^2.

So eigenvalues: ħ, 0, -ħ. Their squares are ħ², 0, ħ².

So:

⟨Pz²⟩ = |c1|²*(ħ²) + |c2|²*(0) + |c3|²*(ħ²) = (1/4)ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, putting it into the uncertainty formula:

ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²) = sqrt( (1/2)ħ² - 0² ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches this.

So the uncertainty is ħ divided by the square root of 2.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me just double-check the calculations. Did I make any mistake in calculating the expectations?

Let me recompute ⟨Pz⟩. The state is ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So when I compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's ψ† Pz ψ.

But since Pz is diagonal, it's just the sum of |ci|² times the diagonal element.

So for the first component: ( (-1/2) * ħ ) * (1/4) → wait, no. Wait, the amplitude is c1 = -1/2. So |c1|² is (1/2)^2=1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue ħ: 1/4 * ħ.

c3 has |c3|² = 1/4. Multiply by eigenvalue -ħ: 1/4 * (-ħ). So sum is 1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ = 0. Correct.

For ⟨Pz²⟩, each eigenvalue squared is ħ², 0, and ħ². So |c1|² * ħ² = (1/4) ħ². Similarly for c3, (1/4) ħ². Sum is (1/4 +1/4 ) ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So yes, square root of that is (ħ)/√2.

So the answer should be option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix $P_z$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i,
\]

where $|c_i|^2$ are the probabilities (squared magnitudes of the components of $\psi$), and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $P_z$. From $\psi$, the components are:

- $c_1 = -1/2 \implies |c_1|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$,
- $c_2 = 1/\sqrt{2} \implies |c_2|^2 = (1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 1/2$,
- $c_3 = -1/2 \implies |c_3|^2 = (-1/2)^2 = 1/4$.

The eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (1/4)(\hbar) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-\hbar) = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ has eigenvalues that are the squares of the eigenvalues of $P_z$. Thus, the eigenvalues of $P_z^2$ are $\hbar^2$, $0$, and $\hbar^2$. Using the same probabilities $|c_i|^2$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \sum_{i} |c_i|^2 \cdot \lambda_i^2,
\]

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (1/4)(\hbar^2) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(\hbar^2) = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \hbar^2/2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar/\sqrt{2}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
