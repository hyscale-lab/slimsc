Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet, Planet_1 or Planet_2, has a higher probability of transiting. The researchers want to choose the one with the highest probability because they have limited observing time.

Let me start by recalling what factors influence the probability of a planet transiting its host star. I remember that the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. Oh wait, but I think the main factors are the orbital distance and the star's size. Oh, wait, more specifically, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to us, but how does that translate into the actual probability?

Wait, I remember a formula for the probability. The transit probability P is approximately (R_p / a) / (1/(2a)) ) * something. Wait, maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance and the star's size? Or perhaps it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius. Hmm, no, maybe it's more about how likely the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective.

Wait, I think the probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it's approximated as R_star / a. But wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because the probability isn't directly that; it's more like the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can block when it's in the right position. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance to the star's radius, but scaled in a certain way.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P = (R_*/a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) )) but wait, no, that's the Doppler semi-amplitude. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing things here.

Alternatively, I remember that the transit probability can be approximated as the ratio of the planet's orbital radius compared to the star's radius. No, wait, maybe it's (R_star / (a)), but that can't be right because as a increases, the probability decreases, which makes sense.

Wait, no. Let me think. The transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it crosses in front of the star from our point of view. The probability is higher when the star is larger relative to the planet's orbital distance. Because a planet in a closer orbit (small a) is more likely to have its orbital plane aligned in a way that causes a transit. So if a is smaller, the probability is higher.

Wait, another approach: The probability of transit is given by the formula P ≈ (R_* / a) * (some constant). But I'm not exactly sure. Wait, I think the exact formula is P = (R_star / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) )) but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relative sizes. The probability depends on the ratio between the size of the star and the orbital distance of the planet. So, P is proportional to (R_star / a). Because a planet closer to the star (small a) would have a higher chance of transiting since the orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on relative to us.

But wait, there's also the inclination of the orbit. The transit occurs only when the inclination i is near 90 degrees. The probability of that is related to the solid angle. The probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2, because the area where the planet can transit is a circle on the star's disk. But wait, the actual probability calculation for a randomly oriented orbit is ( (R_* + R_p) / a )^2, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it approximates to (R_* / a)^2. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Alternatively, the probability is (R_* / a) multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is:

P = (R_* / a) * (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) )

But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (something involving the planet's mass and the star's mass). Hmm.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is approximately (R_* / a) multiplied by (1 / (1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) ). But since both planets have the same mass, M_p is the same for both, so the (M_p / M_*) term would be different for each star.

Wait, but wait. The RV method gives us the minimum mass of the planet, but I'm not sure how that ties into the transit probability. Because for the RV method, the observed velocity depends on the mass and the inclination, but for transit probability, it's more about the inclination and the orbital distance.

Wait, but the transit probability is just the geometric probability, which depends on the size of the star and the distance of the planet from the star. But I think it's more precise to say that the transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is approximately (R_*/a) * (1/sqrt(1 - e^2)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so sqrt(1)=1. So that term is 1, so P ≈ R_*/a.

Wait, but that can't be right because if a is smaller, R_*/a is larger, so P is higher. So that would mean closer planets have higher transit probability. But wait, let's think about it. If a planet is closer, its orbital plane is more likely to be edge-on because the Hill sphere is smaller, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the transit probability is given by P = (R_* + R_p) / a * (something else). Alternatively, the exact formula varies, but for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can assume that the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a), since the stars have the same radius and the planets have the same mass.

Wait, the problem says that both host stars have the same radii. So R_1 = R_2.

But wait, the host stars have the same radii, but different masses. Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star.

So, given that, what else affects the transit probability.

Wait, the RV method detects planets based on their mass and the star's motion. But we're given that both planets have the same mass, so M_p1 = M_p2.

So, the transit probability depends on R_*, a, and the inclination. But since the inclination is random, the probability is a geometric probability, which is (R_* / a), multiplied by something else.

Wait, I think the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) )^2. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that for the transit method, the probability of transit is roughly (R_* + R_p) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_*, it's approximately R_*/a. But then, if all else is equal, a planet with a smaller a (closer to the star) has a higher transit probability.

But in this problem, both planets have different a's. Because the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2. So, using Kepler's third law, we can find the ratio of their orbital distances.

Wait, Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_* + M_p)/(4π²). But M_p is much smaller than M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So, a^3 is proportional to M_* * P^2.

So, for each planet, a1^3 = (G M_*1 P1^2)/(4π²)
a2^3 = (G M_*2 P2^2)/(4π²)

Since P1 = P2 / 3, because Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's.

So, P1 = (1/3) P2.

So, a1^3 = (G (2 M_*) ( (P2/3) )^2 ) / (4π²) )

a2^3 = (G (M_*) (P2^2) ) / (4π² )

Dividing a1^3 by a2^3:

(a1/a2)^3 = [ (2 M_*) ( (P2^2/9) ) ] / [ M_* P2^2 ] )

Simplify:

( (2) * (1/9) ) / 1 ) = (2/9)

So, (a1/a2)^3 = (2/9) → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ cube root of (0.222) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that again:

a1^3 / a2^3 = [ (2 M_*) ( (P2/3)^2 ) ] / [ M_* (P2^2) ) ]

Which simplifies to (2) * (1/9) / 1 = 2/9.

So a1^3 = (2/9) a2^3 → a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3).

Calculating (2/9)^(1/3) → 2^(1/3) is about 1.26, 9^(1/3) is about 2.08, so 1.26 / 2.08 ≈ 0.606.

So a1 ≈ 0.606 a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2 is.

But wait, because Planet_1's period is shorter, it's closer. Makes sense.

Now, the transit probability is proportional to (R_* / a), and since both stars have the same radius, R_*1 = R_*2.

So P1 is proportional to (R_*/a1), P2 is proportional to (R_*/a2).

So P1/P2 = (R_*/a1) / (R_*/a2) ) = a2/a1.

Since a1 = 0.606 a2, a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈ 1.65.

So P1/P2 ≈ 1.65 → P1 is about 1.65 times higher than P2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if a1 is smaller, then R_*/a1 is larger, so P1 is higher. So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher.

So the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1 because it has a higher probability of transiting.

Looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability. Option D is 2.7 times, which seems too high.

Wait, but wait, I thought transit probability is proportional to (R_*/a). But I might be missing some other factor. Earlier, I thought about the (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) term. Let me think about that.

The transit probability formula I thought of earlier: P = (R_*/a) * (1/(1 + (M_p / M_* )^(1/3)) )

Since M_p is the same for both planets, but the host stars have different masses.

For Planet_1: M_*1 = 2 M_*2.

So (M_p / M_*1 )^(1/3) = (M_p/(2 M_*2 ))^(1/3) = [ (M_p / M_*2 ) ]^(1/3) * (1/2)^(1/3) )

= (M_p/(M_*2 ))^(1/3) * (0.5^(1/3)).

Similarly, for Planet_2: (M_p/M_*2 )^(1/3).

So for Planet_1, the factor is (0.5^(1/3)) times the same term as Planet_2.

Thus, the denominator in the transit probability formula for Planet_1 is (1 + (M_p/(2 M_* ))^(1/3) ), and for Planet_2, it's (1 + (M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

So, let's compute for each planet:

Let x = (M_p / M_*2 )^(1/3)

Then, for Planet_1, (M_p/M_*1 )^(1/3) = x / (2^(1/3)) )

So, the denominator for Planet_1 is 1 + (x / 2^(1/3)).

Denominator for Planet_2 is 1 + x.

So, the probability for Planet_1 is (R_*/a1) * [1 / (1 + x/(2^(1/3)) ) ]

And for Planet_2 is (R_*/a2) * [1 / (1 + x ) ]

So, the ratio P1/P2 is (a2/a1) * [ (1 + x ) / (1 + x/(2^(1/3)) ) ]

Earlier, a1 ≈ 0.606 a2 → a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So (a2/a1) is 1.65.

Now let's compute the second term: [ (1 + x ) / (1 + x/(2^(1/3)) ) ].

But what's x? x is (M_p / M_*2 )^(1/3).

But wait, we don't know the actual mass of the planet or the star. But since both planets have the same mass, and the host stars have different masses, perhaps x is different for each.

Wait, but wait, x is (M_p / M_*2 )^(1/3). And for Planet_1, M_*1 is 2 M_*2.

So for Planet_1's x, it's (M_p/(2 M_*2 ))^(1/3) = x/(2^(1/3)).

Hmm. So in the denominator for Planet_1, we have 1 + (x/(2^(1/3))).

So, let's let 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

So, the denominator for Planet_1 is 1 + (x/1.26).

The denominator for Planet_2 is 1 + x.

So, the ratio [ (1 + x ) / (1 + x/1.26 ) ].

Let me compute this ratio.

Let me factor out x:

= [ (1 + x) ] / [ 1 + (x / 1.26) ) ]

= [ (1 + x) ] / [ (1.26 + x) / 1.26 ) ]

= (1 + x) * (1.26) / (1.26 + x )

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let's plug in some numbers.

Suppose M_*2 is much larger than M_p. Let's say M_*2 >> M_p, so x is small.

Then, 1 + x ≈1, and 1.26 + x ≈1.26.

So, the ratio becomes approximately (1) * 1.26 / 1.26 = 1.

So, if x is small, the ratio [ (1 + x ) / (1 + x/(2^(1/3)) ) ] ≈ 1.

But if x is not negligible, then this term changes.

Wait, but without knowing the actual values of M_p and M_*, we can't compute this exactly. So perhaps this factor is negligible, and we can ignore it, especially since the problem gives that the planets have the same mass and the stars have different masses but same radius.

Wait, but the problem states that the planets have the same mass, but the host stars have different masses. Wait, but in the transit probability formula, the M_* in the denominator is the mass of the star, not the planet.

So, perhaps the transit probability is more significantly influenced by (R_* / a). Since both stars have the same radius, and a is smaller for Planet_1, its transit probability is higher.

Thus, the main factor is (R_*/a), which for Planet_1 is larger, so the probability is higher.

So, the ratio (R_*/a1)/(R_*/a2) = a2/a1 ≈ 1.65.

So, Planet_1 has about 1.65 times higher probability than Planet_2.

So, the researchers would prefer to observe Planet_1, and the probability is about 1.65 times higher. So, looking at the options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

But wait, the options are:

Option C) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D) Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but earlier I thought that a2/a1 is approximately 1.65, which is the ratio of their probabilities, leading to Planet_1 being higher.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation of (a1/a2).

We have:

a1^3 / a2^3 = (M1 * P1^2) / (M2 * P2^2 )

But M1 = 2 M2, P1 = P2 /3.

So,

a1^3 = [ (2 M2) * (P2/3)^2 ] / K,

a2^3 = [ M2 * P2^2 ] / K,

So, a1^3 / a2^3 = [2 M2 (P2^2 /9 ) ] / [ M2 P2^2 ] = (2/9) → a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

Thus, a1 ≈0.606 a2 → a2/a1 ≈1.65.

So, R_*/a1 = R_*/(0.606 a2) = (R_* / a2 ) * (1/0.606) ≈ 1.65 (R_* / a2 )

Thus, the transit probability for Planet_1 is 1.65 times that of Planet_2.

So, option C is correct.

But wait, I thought earlier about the RV method's effect on the transit probability. But perhaps that's not relevant here, as the RV method has already detected the planets, and the question is about the transit probability.

So, conclusion: Planet_1 has a transit probability about 1.65 times higher than Planet_2. So the researchers prefer Planet_1. So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability \( P \) is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \), where \( R_* \) is the radius of the host star and \( a \) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the key factor is the ratio of their orbital distances (\( a \)).

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) and the mass of the host star \( M_* \) by:

\[
a^3 \propto M_* \cdot P^2
\]

For Planet_1 and Planet_2:
- \( M_{*,1} = 2 \cdot M_{*,2} \) (Planet_1's host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star).
- \( P_1 = \frac{P_2}{3} \) (Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's).

Substituting into the proportionality:

\[
\frac{a_1^3}{a_2^3} = \frac{M_{*,1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2}{M_{*,2} \cdot P_2^2} = \frac{2}{9}
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.606 \cdot a_2 \), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its host star than Planet_2 is to its host star.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \( \frac{R_*}{a} \). Since both stars have the same radius (\( R_* \)), the probability ratio is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{\frac{R_*}{a_1}}{\frac{R_*}{a_2}} = \frac{a_2}{a_1}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 1.65 \):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} \approx 1.65
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.65 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers prefer to observe the planet with the higher transit probability. Since Planet_1 has a transit probability approximately 1.65 times higher than Planet_2, the correct choice is:

**Answer: C**
