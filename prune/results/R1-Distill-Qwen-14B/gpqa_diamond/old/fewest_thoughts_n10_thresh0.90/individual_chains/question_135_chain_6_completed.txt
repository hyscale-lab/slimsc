Okay, I've got this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

So, the question is about the allowed decays of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given, but I'm not entirely sure how to interpret it. The Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm. Wait, maybe I should parse that again.

Wait, the Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f (y). So, this looks like it's describing the interaction between the boson X and some fermion ψ_f. The term is quadratic in ψ_f, so it's a Yukawa coupling maybe? So, the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f with coupling λ f. 

But wait, Yukawa interactions typically have the form L ∝ g \bar{ψ} ψ X, but here it seems like the mass term is (v + X), so when X is zero, the mass would be v. But maybe that's just part of the model.

The key thing is to find out which fermions ψ_f the boson X can interact with. Because if X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion. So, the allowed decays are limited by the available energy (mass of X) and the rest mass of the fermions.

So the first step is to figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV because X is 6 GeV, and each fermion would need to be at most 3 GeV. Because 2m ≤ M_X → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Wait, but what are the masses of the known fermions? Let's think. The elementary fermions include quarks and leptons. The masses of the quarks (current masses):

- Up and down: around a few MeV, like 2.2 MeV and 4.7 MeV. So way below 3 GeV.
- Strange: about 100 MeV or so, so also way under.
- Charm: around 1.5 GeV. That's under 3 GeV.
- Bottom: around 4.5 GeV. Wait, that's above 3 GeV. So a bottom quark can't be produced because 2m would be about 9 GeV. But our X is only 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar.

Wait, wait. Let me get the current masses right. I'm a bit confused. Current masses for quarks:

- Up: ~2.2 MeV
- Down: ~4.7 MeV
- Strange: ~100 MeV
- Charm: ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom: ~4.5 GeV
- Top: ~173 GeV

Leptons are:

- Electron: ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon: ~0.1 GeV
- Tau: ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible (like <<1 MeV)

Wait, so for X (6 GeV) to decay into a fermion pair, the fermion's mass must be m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list all the fermions with m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

For quarks:

- u, d, s, c. Because their masses are way below 3 GeV. Even bottom is too heavy (4.5 GeV, which is above 3).

Wait, but wait. The top is way too heavy, but the others are okay. So X can decay into u, d, s, c quark pairs. Because their masses are under 3 GeV.

But wait, how about the tau? Its mass is about 1.78 GeV, which is under 3. So tau can be produced. Same for muon (0.1 GeV) and electron (0.0005 GeV). So X can decay into any of those leptons as well.

But wait, can X decay into b quarks? Because 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So no, it can't decay into b quarks.

So possible decays would include u, d, s, c quarks and e, mu, tau leptons. But wait, what about the top quark? Oh, top is way too heavy, so no.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. But wait, since b is too heavy, this can't be right. So A is out.

Option B: X→ c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. That includes all the light quarks (c is 1.5 GeV, so 2c is 3 GeV, which is okay), and the leptons. So this seems possible.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Wait, t is top quark, which is 173 GeV. So 2m_t is way over X's 6 GeV. So C is incorrect.

Option D: X→ b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Again, b is too heavy, so D can't be correct.

Wait, but looking back at the question, the Lagrangian includes ψ_f. So what fermions are allowed? The Lagrangian probably couples X to certain fermions.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is L = -λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So the interaction term is λ f \bar{ψ}_f X ψ_f, and the mass term is λ f v. So the coupling is between X and ψ_f.

Which fermions does this X interact with? Because if X only couples to certain fermions, those are the only decay channels possible.

So, for example, if X only couples to up-type quarks, then only u, c, t would be possible. But in reality, the question doesn't specify which fermions ψ_f are. Hmm, but the Lagrangian is written as λ f \bar{ψ}_f (v + X) ψ_f. So perhaps ψ_f is a specific fermion field. But the question says "the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions is given by L(y)".

Wait, maybe the X couples to all fermions. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that X can interact with any fermion where the mass is allowed.

Wait, but the problem is about what is kinematically allowed. So regardless of the couplings, if the fermion's mass is less than 3 GeV, the decay is allowed. But if X doesn't couple to a particular fermion, that decay isn't possible.

Wait, but the question is about the lowest-order decays. So, the possible decays would depend on the available fermions that X couples to and have masses below 3 GeV.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify any restrictions on which fermions X couples to. It just gives the general form of the interaction. So perhaps X can interact with all the fermions, but the decay is only possible if their mass is less than 3 GeV.

So, in that case, the possible fermion pairs are u, d, s, c, tau, mu, e. So all the fermions except for b and t quarks (and maybe others if their masses are above 3 GeV).

Wait, the tau's mass is about 1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV, so decay into tau pairs is allowed. Same for mu and e.

So looking back at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d quarks and tau, mu, e. So that's correct.

Option D includes b, which can't be, so D is wrong. Option C includes t, which is wrong. So the correct option is B.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option B: X→c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

That's all the fermions with m < 3 GeV.

Yes, so the correct answer is option B.


The question involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f(y),
\]

which describes the coupling between the boson \( X \) and fermions \( \psi_f \). For a decay \( X \to f \bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the mass of \( X \) must be at least twice the mass of the fermion \( f \), i.e., \( m_f \leq \frac{M_X}{2} = 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

The masses of known fermions are as follows:

- **Quarks**:
  - Up (\( u \)): \( \sim 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Down (\( d \)): \( \sim 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Strange (\( s \)): \( \sim 100 \, \text{MeV} \)
  - Charm (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Bottom (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Top (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

- **Leptons**:
  - Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \)
  - Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these masses, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are \( u, d, s, c, \tau, \mu, e \). The bottom quark (\( b \)) and top quark (\( t \)) are too heavy for \( X \) to decay into their pairs, as \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+\) and \( e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). **Incorrect**.

Thus, the kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order are given in **Option B**.

Answer: B
