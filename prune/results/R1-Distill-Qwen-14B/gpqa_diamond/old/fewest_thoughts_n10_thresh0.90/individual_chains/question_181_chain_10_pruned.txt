Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this neutrino flux question. Let's see what I remember about neutrinos and the Sun's energy production. Hmm, the question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping in the Sun's core, and how that affects the neutrino flux in two specific energy bands.

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain, right? So the pp chain is the main way the Sun generates energy. The pp-I branch produces helium-4, and I think the pp-II and pp-III are variations or maybe different stages. Oh wait, no, the pp chain might have different branches under different conditions, like varying densities or temperatures. I remember that the pp-III branch is less dominant, maybe because it requires more energy or specific conditions.

Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through several processes. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. But neutrinos also come from other processes like the decay of helium-3 maybe? Or wait, the primary neutrinos come from the beta decay steps in these fusion processes.

So, when the pp-III branch stops, what happens? Well, the pp-III could be one of the fusion pathways for generating helium. If that stops, the other branches might take over. But the question says all other reactions remain as they were, so I think only the pp-III production stops. So other branches like pp-I and pp-II continue unaffected.

Wait, but how does that affect neutrino production? Neutrinos are produced in the beta decay steps. So in the pp chain, during the fusion of protons into helium-4, there are steps where a proton captures a positively charged p (like a proton) to become a deuteron, which then captures another proton to become helium-3. Then the helium-3 can either combine with another helium-3 to make helium-4, or undergo other reactions. Oh right, in the pp chain, the dominant process is the pp-I branch, but when temperatures are higher or densities are different, other branches might contribute.

Wait, the pp-III branch... I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. So the pp chain has different branches. The main one, pp-I, combines two helium-3 nuclei to form helium-4 and two protons. The pp-II branch involves a different reaction, maybe where a helium-3 captures a proton to form carbon-12, which then undergoes further reactions. The pp-III branch... I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, I think pp-III might involve a different path, perhaps leading to higher energy neutrinos.

But regardless, the question is that the pp-III branch stops. So if that's the case, the production of neutrinos from that particular branch would stop. But neutrinos are produced in several energy ranges depending on the process. So let's think about the energy bands given: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2).

In the Sun, the dominant neutrino flux comes from the pp chain, which produces neutrinos in the energy range of about 100â€“200 keV, but wait, no, actually, wait. The
