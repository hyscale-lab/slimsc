Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully and think through the steps.

The question is about two reactions performed by an organic chemist. After each reaction, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns. I need to determine how many peaks the chemist will observe in each case.

First, let's break down the reactions.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

I need to figure out the products of each reaction, then see how many compounds are there in total when combined. Then, think about how they would separate on normal-phase HPLC and on a chiral stationary phase HPLC.

Starting with Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH (lithium aluminum hydride). LAH is a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols.

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is: It's a six-carbon chain. The ketone is on carbon 3, so structure is CH2CH2CO-C-OCH3, but wait, let me draw the structure:

Hexan-3-one: CH2CH2CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, maybe I should number the carbons.

Hexan-3-one: Carbon 1: CH3, Carbon 2: CH2, Carbon 3: C=O, Carbon 4: CH2, Carbon 5: CH2, Carbon 6: CH3? No, wait, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3. So the molecule is: 

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait no, actually, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2-OCH3
