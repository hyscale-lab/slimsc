Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on several factors, mainly the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh, and also albedo, but the question says both have the same albedo, so that cancels out.

Wait, the question gives me some data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii; Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have circular orbits.

The RV method gives info about the Doppler shift, which relates to the planet's mass and the star's velocity. But maybe that's more for determining mass and distance, which I don't think I need here. The transit method gives radius because it's about the dip in brightness when the planet passes in front.

But for equilibrium temperature, I think the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) / (epsilon) )^(1/4), but I'm probably mixing some terms. Wait, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σTeff⁴. So the star's luminosity L is proportional to R² Teff^4.

The planet's equilibrium temperature would be T_p = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4), where A is albedo. Oh wait, A is the same for both planets, so that factor would cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the ratio T1/T2 would depend on sqrt(R*/(2a1)) / sqrt(R*/(2a2)) ) = sqrt( a2/a1 ). Because R* is the same in both, and 2 is a constant, so it's sqrt(a2/a1).

Wait, but how do I find a1 and a2, the orbital distances of each planet? I don't have them directly. Hmm. Oh, perhaps the Doppler shifts can help. Because the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The shift in the forbidden line [OI] is given for each planet. Wait, the shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

But wait, the Doppler shift (radial velocity) is given by the formula: v = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero. And if the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on), sin i is 1. But I don't know the inclination, but maybe for both planets, i is same, so it cancels out.

Wait, but actually, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * (1 day in seconds) ) )^(1/3) ) * (P/(2pi)) )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the semi-amplitude of the RV method. The formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since e is zero and assuming sin i = 1 (edge-on), which is likely because the transit method requires edge-on orbits, this simplifies. So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but the problem gives the Doppler shifts in terms of angstroms, not velocity. Oh, but the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is proportional to velocity. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c. So 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2.

So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly, v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c.

Wait, but wait, for the same spectral line, the Doppler shift Δλ is proportional to the velocity of the star. So K1 = 0.03 / 6300 * c, and K2 = 0.04 /6300 * c.

But K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by K = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) ) ) / c * something? Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i ) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / ( ( ( (M_star + M_p) * P ) / (2 pi) )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think of it this way: for a circular orbit (e=0), the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2 * pi * c) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So approximately, K ≈ ( ( G * P )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) ) / ( 2 pi c )^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to express it in terms of orbital period P. But I don't have P. Hmm.

Alternatively, using Kepler's third law: the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by (P^2) = (4 pi² a³) / ( G (M_star + M_p) ) ). Since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So P² ≈ (4 pi² a³) / ( G M_star )

So a³ = ( G M_star P² )/(4 pi² )

Hmm. Let me see. So from Kepler's law, a is proportional to ( M_star P² )^(1/3 )

But K is proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Wait, let's plug a into K. Let's see.

From Kepler's law: P² = (4 pi² a³)/(G M_star), so a^3 = (G M_star P²)/(4 pi² ). So a = [ G M_star P² / (4 pi²) ]^(1/3)

Now, K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * [ 1 / (c (2 pi / (P (1 - e²)) )^(1/3) ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact formula for K. I recall that K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * [ (1) / (c * ( (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) ) ] * [ 1 / ( ( 2 pi )/( P ) )^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, that's getting complicated. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, perhaps we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes a1 and a2 from their RV data.

Since K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's law, for a circular orbit, P² = (4 pi² a³)/(G M_star )

So P = (4 pi² a³/(G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3) = [ (4 pi² a³/(G M_star ))^(1/2) ]^(1/3) ) = (4 pi² a³/( G M_star ))^(1/6 )

So P^(1/3) = a^(1/2) * (4 pi²/( G M_star ))^(1/6 )

Putting this back into K: 

K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/2) * (4 pi²/(G M_star ))^(1/6) ) )

Hmm, perhaps simplifying the exponents. Let me compute each part:

Denominator terms:

M_star^(2/3) * a^(1/2) * (4 pi²/(G M_star ))^(1/6 )

= M_star^(2/3) * [ (4 pi²)^(1/6) (G^(-1/6) ) (
