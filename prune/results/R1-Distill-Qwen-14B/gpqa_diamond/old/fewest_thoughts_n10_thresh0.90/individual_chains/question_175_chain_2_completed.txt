Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about oscillating charges and the radiation they produce. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The question mentions an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle depends on lambda and the angle theta from the z-axis. They're asking about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f.

Wait, I remember that in antenna radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle is related to the radiation pattern. For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is a function of theta. The maximum power is usually along the equator, I think. Or wait, no, wait. Dipole radiation has a maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole. So if the dipole is along the z-axis, the maximum is in the equatorial plane, meaning theta = 90 degrees. Wait, but the dipole's radiation pattern for the far field is given by (sin theta)^2, I think. So the radiation intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin^2(theta). 

Wait, but wait, that's for a dipole's radiation in the far field. So the maximum intensity would be at theta=90 degrees, and zero at theta=0 and 180. So if the question's setup is similar, the function f would depend on sin(theta)^2.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A. So if the function f is proportional to sin^2(theta), then the maximum would be at theta=90 degrees, which would be f_max = A. But the question is about the fraction at theta=30 degrees. So that would be f(theta=30) / A.

Wait, let's think again. Suppose the function f is the power per unit solid angle, so it's proportional to sin^2(theta). Then the maximum is when sin^2(theta) is maximum, which is 1, so f_max = k * 1, where k is a constant. The total power radiated would be the integral of f over all solid angles. So integrating sin^2(theta) * dOmega, which is 4 pi times the integral from 0 to pi of sin^2(theta) * sin(theta) dtheta. Wait, actually, dOmega is sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the integral becomes 2 pi times the integral from 0 to pi of sin^2(theta) * sin(theta) dtheta. 

Wait, the integral of sin^3(theta) dtheta from 0 to pi. Let's compute that:

∫ sin^3(theta) d theta from 0 to pi. Let's split it as sin(theta)(1 - cos^2(theta)). Let u = cos(theta), du = -sin(theta) d theta. So the integral becomes ∫ (1 - u^2) (-du) from u=1 to u=-1. Which is ∫ (1 - u²) du from -1 to 1. 

1 - u² is even function, so the integral from -1 to 1 is 2 times integral from 0 to 1. So 2 [ (u - (u^3)/3 ) evaluated from 0 to 1 ].

That gives 2 [ (1 - 1/3) - 0 ] = 2*(2/3) = 4/3.

So the total integral is 4/3, multiplied by 2 pi? Wait, no, no. Wait, I think I might have confused the steps. Let me double-check.

Wait, the integral of sin^2(theta) over the solid angle... Let me think again.

The radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta). So f(theta) = k sin^2(theta). The total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. So total_power = ∫ f dΩ = k ∫ sin^2(theta) * sin(theta) d theta d phi.

The phi integral is from 0 to 2pi, giving 2pi. The theta integral is from 0 to pi of sin^3(theta) d theta.

So as before, the theta integral is (4/3) as calculated above. So total_power = k * 2 pi * (4/3) = (8 pi k)/3.

But wait, the maximum power radiated per unit solid angle is A. So the maximum of f(theta) is at theta=90 degrees, so f(90) = k * sin^2(90) = k*1 = A. So k = A.

So the total_power is (8 pi A)/3. But wait, the problem states that A is the maximum power radiated. So the total power is all the power, but the question is about the fraction of A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees. Wait, no, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, so the total power would be the integral of f over all solid angles, but the question says the maximum power is A. So A is the maximum value of f.

Wait, no. Wait, the way the problem is phrased, the maximum power is A. So when theta is 90 degrees, f(theta)=A. So for any other theta, f(theta) is less than or equal to A.

So the fraction of A that is radiated at theta=30 degrees is f(30)/A. Since f(theta) = A sin^2(theta), then f(30) = A * (sin 30)^2 = A * (1/2)^2 = A * (1/4). So the fraction is 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4 of the maximum A.

So first part: the fraction is 1/4.

Now about the possible form of f. The question says that f is a function of lambda and theta. For an oscillating charge, the radiated power (intensity) is proportional to 1/lambda^4, I think. Because, the radiation from an accelerating charge (as in dipole radiation) depends on the second derivative of the charge distribution, and the resulting power is proportional to (1/(c^3))^2 times some terms, but when considering the far field, the intensity is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Wait, wait, let's recall. The intensity (power per unit area) in radiation is proportional to the square of the electric field. For dipole radiation, the E-field is proportional to (p0 sin(kr - ωt + ...))/(r k^2), where p0 is the dipole moment. The intensity is proportional to E squared, so (p0^2)/(r^2 k^4). But k is 2pi/lambda, so k^4 is (2pi)^4 / lambda^4. So the intensity is proportional to 1/(lambda^4).

So f(theta) would be proportional to (1/lambda^4) times sin^2(theta), perhaps. Or wait, in the problem, the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So since the power is in the form of f(theta) * dP = f(theta) * (dA * cos(theta)), but wait no, actually, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle is the radiation intensity. The intensity (in Watts per steradian) is given by I. For dipole radiation, I is proportional to (sin^2 theta) / lambda^4. So function f is proportional to sin^2(theta) and 1/lambda^4. So the form of f is lambda^-4.

Putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and f is proportional to lambda^-4.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) 1/2, λ^(-4)
B) 1/4, λ^(-3)
C) 1/4, λ^(-4)
D) 3/4, λ^(-6)

So the first part is 1/4, which matches option C or B. The form is λ^-4, so option C: 1/4 and λ^-4.


The problem involves an oscillating charge distribution, which radiates power in the radiation zone. The power radiated per unit solid angle is given as a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( \theta \) is the angle from the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f \).

For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \), and the maximum power \( A \) occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \). The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is given by \( f(30^\circ)/A \). Substituting \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \), the fraction is \( 1/4 \).

The function \( f \) also depends on \( \lambda \). For oscillating charges, the radiated power per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to \( 1/\lambda^4 \). Therefore, \( f \propto \sin^2(\theta) / \lambda^4 \).

From the options:
- Option A: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), not \( 1/2 \).
- Option B: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-3} \).
- Option C: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as both the fraction and the form of \( f \) match.
- Option D: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( 1/4 \), and the dependence on \( \lambda \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \), not \( \lambda^{-6} \).

Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the function \( f \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \).
