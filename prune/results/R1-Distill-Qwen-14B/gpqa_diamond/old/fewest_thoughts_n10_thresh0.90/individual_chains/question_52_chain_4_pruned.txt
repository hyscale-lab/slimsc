Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and figure out what it's asking.

The question is about a star that has some characteristics, and when it has spots, its effective temperature changes. Then, they're looking at the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the number of atoms in different energy levels depends on temperature. Oh right, it's the Boltzmann distribution that tells us the ratio.

So, the star's Teff is 6000 K without spots and 5500 K with spots. But wait, when it has spots, 40% of its surface is covered. Does that affect the overall flux or the temperature of the photosphere? Oh, the question says the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when spots cover 40% of the surface. So the overall photosphere is cooler.

They're looking at the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is n1/n2, I think. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when the temperature is lower, the ratio goes down. We need to find the factor by which the ratio changes—so the ratio without spots divided by the ratio with spots.

Wait, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). And since the transition wavelength is given (1448 Å), which is in the near UV or maybe visible. Oh, wait, 1448Å is actually in the near UV. That's around where Ti lines are, maybe in the blue?

But since the problem states it's in LTE, we can apply the Boltzmann equation. Let me think: the energy difference between the levels is related to the photon energy. E = hc/λ. So E2 - E1 = hc/(λ).

The ratio n1/n2 would be (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Wait, no, because in the Boltzmann factor, it's (E2 - E1)/(k*T). So when E2 > E1, then higher energy level, the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as temperature increases because the exponential gets smaller.

But wait, wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So when the star has spots, T is 5500 K, and without spots, it's 6000 K. So the ratio n1/n2 (without spots) compared to (with spots) is n1,nos/n2,nos divided by (n1,spot/n2,spot) ?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The ratio is n1/n2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So n1/n2 (with spots) is lower than n1/n2 (without spots). So the factor is (n1/n2)_nos / (n1/n2)_spot.

Let me model that. Let’s denote T1 as 6000 K, T2 as 5500 K.

So the ratio without spots is (g1/g2) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T1) ), and with spots, it's (g1/g2) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T2) ). So the factor is [exp( -(ΔE)/(k T1) )] / [exp( -(ΔE)/(k T2) )].

Which simplifies to exp( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, that's correct. Because the exponentials are divided, so subtract exponents.

Alternatively, let me compute the exponents. Let's compute the exponent term: [ΔE/(k T2)] - [ΔE/(k T1)] ? Wait, no. Let me think again.

The ratio without spots is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

The ratio with spots is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So the factor is R1 / R2 = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )] 

Which is exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] )

Factor out ΔE/(k): exp( ΔE/(k) [ 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ] )

But wait, the exponents are negative, so let me compute that.

ΔE is (E2 - E1) = hc/λ. Let me compute the value.

But maybe I can compute the exponent as (E2-E1)/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)).

Wait, no, the factor is R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE)/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

ΔE = hc/λ. Let me plug in the numbers. h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is 3e8 m/s. Lambda is 1448 Angstroms, which is 1.448e-7 meters.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) = approximately 1.373e-18 J.

But I might need this in terms of eV or something else. Alternatively, since we're working in exponents involving k*T, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV.

Wait, k (Boltzmann constant) is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So let me compute ΔE in eV.

ΔE (eV) = (hc)/λ [in eV·Å] / λ (Å).

I remember that hc is approximately 12400 eV·Å. So 12400 eV·Å divided by 1448 Å is about 8.56 eV.

So ΔE is about 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems high for a transition. But let's go with that.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute hc in eV·m. Because hc = 1240 eV·nm. So 1448 Angstroms is 144.8 nm. So hc/λ = 1240 / 144.8 ≈ 8.56 eV. Yes, that's correct.

So ΔE is 8.56 eV.

Now, the exponent factor in the ratio R1/R2 is ΔE [eV] / (k*T) [eV/K * K] ) → dimensionless.

So the exponent is (8.56 eV) / (k T) → 8.56 / (8.617e-5 eV/K * T) ) → 8.56 / (8.617e-5 * T) )

Wait, no, the exponent is [ (ΔE)/(k T2) ) - (ΔE)/(k T1) ) ] → [ (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ]

So, let's compute (ΔE/k) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

ΔE is 8.56 eV.

k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/k = 8.56 / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ approx 99335 K.

So (ΔE/k) ≈ 99,335 K.

Then (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) 1/K.

Compute that: 1/5500 ≈ 0.0001818 K^-1; 1/6000≈ 0.0001667 K^-1.

Difference is 0.0000151 K^-1.

So the exponent is 99335 K * 0.0000151 K^-1 ≈ 99335 * 0.0000151 ≈ 1.501 (approx 1.5).

So the exponent is about 1.5.

So the factor is exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48. Hmm, exp(1) is about 2.718, exp(1.5) is about 4.48. So the factor is approximately 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5. So the ratio without spots is about 4.5 times higher than when it has spots. So the factor is ~4.5.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes, I might have made a mistake in the exponents. Let me re-calculate the exponent.

Wait, wait, the exponent is [ (ΔE)/(k) ) * (1/T2 - 1/T1) ]

Wait, because ΔE is E2 - E1, which is positive. So as temperature decreases, the denominator in the exponent becomes (1/5500 - 1/6000) which is positive.

So the exponent is positive, leading to a factor of exp(1.5) ≈ 4.48.

But wait, the ratio is R1/R2. R1 is when T is higher (6000K), R2 when T is lower (5500K). So if R1 is higher than R2, then R1/R2 is greater than 1. Which matches the factor of ~4.5.

So the factor is about 4.5, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of the number of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels, \( n_1/n_2 \), using the Boltzmann distribution. The ratio is given by:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the two levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. When the star has spots, its effective temperature decreases from \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) to \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The ratio \( n_1/n_2 \) decreases with temperature, and we are tasked with finding the factor by which the ratio changes: \( \text{Factor} = \frac{(n_1/n_2)_{\text{nos}}}{(n_1/n_2)_{\text{spot}}} \).

### Step 1: Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \))
The energy difference is related to the wavelength of the transition by \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( c \) is the speed of light, and \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Using \( hc = 1240 \, \text{eV·Å} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E =
