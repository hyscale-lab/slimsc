Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember in our universe, magnets always have both a North and South pole; you can't isolate them. So if in this other universe they can, how would that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws that describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. Right. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∫E·dA = Q_enc / ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∫B·dA = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∫E·dl = -dΦ_B/dt
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∫B·dl = μ₀ I_enc + μ₀ ε₀ dΦ_E/dt

In our universe, the second equation says that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero everywhere. That's because there are no isolated magnetic charges, right? So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, like magnetic monopoles, that would mean that the magnetic field can have sources and sinks. So Gauss's Law for Magnetism must change.

In our case, ∇·B = 0. If there are magnetic monopoles, then the divergence of B would not be zero. Instead, it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how ∇·E is proportional to electric charge density.

So the second equation, Gauss's Law for Magnetism, would change. But wait, the question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would look different. So equation 2 would change, but what about the others?

Let me think about the other equations. Faraday's Law (equation 3) deals with the curl of the electric field and the time derivative of the magnetic flux. If magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect this equation? Well, Faraday's Law as we know it comes from the idea that changing magnetic fields produce electric fields. I'm not sure if the presence of magnetic monopoles would change the form of Faraday's Law. Maybe not directly. Faraday's Law would still relate the induced E fields to the changing B fields.

Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition (equation 4) involves the curl of the magnetic field and relates it to the current plus the displacement current. If magnetic monopoles exist, then perhaps the form of Ampère's Law might change. Because Ampère's Law in our universe is ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. But if there are magnetic currents, maybe there's an additional term here?

Wait, wait. Let me remember. When magnetic monopoles exist, both the divergence and the curl of B would be non-zero. Because normally, ∇·B = 0 and ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But with monopoles, ∇·B would equal something like rho_m (magnetic charge density) multiplied by a constant. Similarly, would there be a term in Faraday's Law or Ampère's Law that includes the magnetic current?

Alternatively, I think that when magnetic monopoles are present, the Maxwell equations get modified in two places. Let me think: the equations become symmetric in a way. In the usual case, electric and magnetic fields are treated somewhat asymmetrically because magnetic monopoles don't exist. So if they do, Maxwell's equations would have terms that make them more symmetric.

So, in the usual case, the four equations are:

1. ∇·E = rho_electric / epsilon_0
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = mu_0 (J + epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t)

With magnetic monopoles, equation 2 becomes ∇·B = rho_magnetic / some constant. Similarly, perhaps equation 3 would have a term for the time derivative of the electric flux? Or wait, maybe equation 4 would have an additional term for the magnetic current.
