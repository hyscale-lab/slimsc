Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different capabilities in terms of the brightness of the stars they can observe.

The question gives me some information about each star, like their RA, DEC, magnitudes, distances, and some extinction values. Oh wait, extinction is about interstellar dust affecting the light, right? So I think I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star, considering any extinction, to see if it's bright enough for the spectrographs.

Let me start by recalling what each spectrograph can handle. ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes up to 17 mag. HIRES can go up to 16 mag. So a star must be brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO and brighter than 16 mag for HIRES. Wait, no, wait. The question says "brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO" and "brighter than 16 for HIRES." So that means the apparent magnitude (V) must be less than or equal to 17 for ESPRESSO and less than or equal to 16 for HIRES. Because lower numbers are brighter. So any star with apparent magnitude ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO, and ≤16 by HIRES.

But wait, the question is about which stars can be detected with both. So the star's apparent V magnitude must be ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond that. Because if a star is too faint for HIRES, it won't be detected by both.

Wait no, no. Wait, the question is which stars can be detected by both. So the star must be observable by both. So the apparent magnitude must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) AND ≤16 (for HIRES). So the maximum apparent magnitude would be 16. So stars with V ≤16 can be observed by both. Wait, no, because HIRES can't observe beyond 16, so any star that's detectable by both must have V ≤16. But wait, the other way: for a star to be detected by both, it must be bright enough for both. So the apparent V must be ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So the stricter condition is the apparent V must be ≤16. So any star that's brighter than 16 in V can't be seen by HIRES, so they can't be in both. So we need stars with V ≤16.

But wait, let me re-read the question. It says, "stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO." Wait, brightness is inverse; higher magnitude means fainter. So "brighter than 17" would mean apparent V less than 17. Because higher magnitude is dimmer. So stars with V <17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES: stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed, which means V <16.

So to be detectable by both, the star's apparent V must be less than 16. Because if it's V=16.5, for example, it's not detectable by HIRES.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The way it's phrased is "stars with apparent V mag brighter than 17 can be observed with ESPRESSO." So if a star's V is brighter (i.e., less than 17), it can be observed. So for ESPRESSO, V <17. For HIRES, V <16. So to be observed by both, V must be <16. Because if a star's V is 16.5, it's less than 17 (so can be seen by ESPRESSO), but more than 16 (so not seen by HIRES). So that star would only be seen by ESPRESSO, not both. So only stars with V <16 can be seen by both.

But wait, let me double-check: the question says, "stars with apparent V brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO". So V must be less than 17. Similarly, for HIRES, V must be less than 16. So if a star has V=15, it's fine for both. If V=16, it's also fine for both (since 16 is less than 17, and less than 16 is not, wait no: 16 is not less than 16, it's equal. Wait, depends on the exact wording. Maybe it's "brighter than or equal to" but the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO. So for ESPRESSO, apparent V must be <17. For HIRES, apparent V must be <16.

So to be detectable by both, apparent V must be <16. So any star with V <16 can be seen by both. So let's look at each star.

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, located at 10 pc. So apparent V is: M = 15.5, distance d =10 pc. The formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So 5 log10(10/10)=5*0=0. So m=15.5. So m=15.5. That's less than 16. So for Star1, V=15.5. So it's detectable by both. Because 15.5 <16, so HIRES can see it. And 15.5<17, so ESPRESSO can see it.

Star2: Apparent V is 16.5. So m=16.5. That's above 16, so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can, since m=16.5 <17. But wait, the question is about which stars can be seen by both. So Star2 can't be seen by both. So Star2 is out.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5 mag. But wait, it has E(B-V) =0.6. So extinction affects the apparent magnitude. The total absorption in V is related to color excess. The formula I think is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag. So the extinction in V is adding to the apparent magnitude. So the observed V magnitude is m_observed = m_true + Av. Because extinction makes stars appear fainter (higher magnitude).

Wait, wait. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5 mag, but that's before extinction. So the actual observed V would be 15.5 +1.86 = 17.36 mag. Because Av is the extinction. Wait, or is the given apparent V already in the V band, which includes extinction. Hmm, the question says: apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag. So that's what we observe. But wait, no. Because if the star is affected by extinction, the apparent magnitude would be higher (since more extinction makes it dimmer). So wait, the given apparent V is 15.5. But wait, is that the observed V, or the intrinsic V? Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is E(B-V) = (B-V) observed - (B-V) intrinsic. So the extinction in V band (Av) is 3.1 * E(B-V). So the star's light is dimmed by Av. So the observed apparent V magnitude is m_obs = m_true + Av.

Wait, but the question says Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5 mag. So I think that's the observed magnitude, which includes the extinction. Because if it's given as observed, then that's what we should use. Alternatively, if it's given as the intrinsic (without extinction), then we have to add Av to get the observed.

Wait, the problem statement says: For Star3, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V)=0.6 mag." So I think the apparent magnitude given is the observed (what we measure), which already includes the extinction. Because E(B-V) is the color excess, which is the difference between observed and intrinsic. So if the apparent V is 15.5, that's after the extinction. So perhaps I don't need to adjust it. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

When a star is observed through interstellar medium, its light is absorbed and scattered, making it dimmer. So the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the intrinsic. So the observed V = intrinsic V + Av. So if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and they've given E(B-V)=0.6, then Av is 3.1 *0.6=1.86. But wait, that would mean the intrinsic V is 15.5 -1.86=13.64 mag. But that's perhaps not relevant for this problem.

Wait, but the problem is about the apparent magnitude, which the spectrographs observe. So Star3's apparent V is 15.5. But wait, that's the observed value, right? So if that's the case, then the apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is less than 16. So it's detectable by both spectrographs. Because 15.5 is less than 16, so HIRES can see it. And it's also less than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. So Star3 is a candidate.

Wait, but wait! The apparent V magnitude of 15.5 is given. But does that include the extinction? Or is that the star's V without considering the extinction? Hmm, I think I need to clarify that. Because sometimes, when people mention "apparent magnitude", they may refer to the observed value, which includes extinction. Alternatively, sometimes they give the intrinsic magnitude and you have to compute the observed. The question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc". So I think that the 15.5 mag is the apparent (observed) magnitude. So the extinction is already factored into that. Because the star's light is dimmed by the interstellar medium, so the observed V is 15.5. So no need to adjust it.

So for Star3, m_obs=15.5, which is <16, so detectable by both.

Star4: Absolute V mag is 15.5. Located at 10 pc.

So m = M +5 log10(d/10) = 15.5 +5 *0=15.5. So apparent V is 15.5. Now, E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed apparent V is m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av. Wait, but wait: the problem states that Star4's apparent V is 15.5 mag. So if the intrinsic (without extinction) is m_intrinsic =15.5, then the observed would be 15.5 +1.24 =16.74. So the observed V is 16.74, which is higher than 16. So that's m_obs=16.74.

Wait, but wait, the question says Star4's apparent V is 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.4. So wait, that's conflicting. Because if the apparent V is 15.5, which includes the extinction, then the intrinsic would be 15.5 - Av =15.5 -1.24=14.26. But another way, perhaps the given apparent V is the intrinsic, and we have to compute the observed. But that's not clear.

Wait, the problem says for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." So for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but that's without considering extinction? Or is it the observed magnitude? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should model how the apparent magnitude is calculated. The formula for apparent magnitude includes extinction. So m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av.

So let's consider for each star:

Star1: m_intrinsic (absolute) is 15.5. Distance is 10 pc. So m_intrinsic (apparent) would be 15.5 (since M = m if d=10 pc). Then, Star1's extinction is E(B-V) = 0? Because the question doesn't mention it. So Av=0. So m_obs=15.5. So that's within both spectrographs.

Star2: The apparent V is 16.5, which is after considering extinction? Or is that the intrinsic? The question doesn't mention any extinction for Star2, so I think E(B-V)=0. So m_obs=16.5. So Star2 can't be seen by HIRES (needs V <16) but can be seen by ESPRESSO (V <17). So Star2 is only detected by ESPRESSO.

Star3: Apparent V is 15.5. But it has E(B-V)=0.6. So if the given apparent V is the observed (after extinction), then we don't need to add Av. But wait, that doesn't make sense, because the m_obs is already 15.5. So if E(B-V)=0.6, then Av=3.1 *0.6=1.86. So the intrinsic would be m_intrinsic = m_obs - Av =15.5-1.86=13.64. But that's not relevant for our case because the apparent magnitude is given as 15.5. So the observed V is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

Wait, but that can't be right because the extinction would make the star appear fainter. So if a star's intrinsic V is 13.64, and extinction adds 1.86, the observed V would be 15.5. So in that case, the observed V is indeed 15.5, which is within both spectrographs.

So Star3: m_obs=15.5, which is under 16. So detectable by both.

Star4: Absolute V mag is 15.5. Distance is 10 pc. So m_intrinsic =15.5. E(B-V)=0.4. So Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24. So the observed V is m_intrinsic + Av =15.5 +1.24=16.74. So m_obs=16.74.

So Star4's apparent V is 16.74, which is higher than 16, so HIRES can't detect it. But ESPRESSO can, because 16.74 <17. So Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star5: Absolute V is 16.5, located at 5 pc. So m = M +5 log (d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10) =16.5 +5 log(0.5) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) ≈ 16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0 mag. So apparent V is 15.0. But does it have any extinction? The question says nothing about E(B-V) for Star5, so I assume E(B-V)=0. So m_obs=15.0. So V=15.0, which is less than both 16 and 17. So Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but wait: Star5's m=15.0. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it. So Star5 is a candidate.

Wait, but let's go back to each star.

So let's list each star's apparent V and whether they are detectable by both.

Star1: m=15.5, no extinction (as no E(B-V) given). So m_obs=15.5.

HIRES can see it (15.5<16), ESPRESSO can (15.5<17). So both.

Star2: m_obs=16.5. HIRES can't (16.5>16), but ESPRESSO can. So not detected by both.

Star3: m_obs=15.5, but with E(B-V)=0.6. So Av=1.86. So the m_obs is 15.5 (already including Av?), or is the given m_obs the intrinsic? Hmm, this is a point I'm stuck on.

Wait, the question says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" for Star3. But then it says "E(B-V)=0.6 mag". So I think that Star3's apparent V is the observed (i.e., includes extinction). Because the extinction would cause the apparent magnitude to be higher (more positive). So if the observed V is 15.5, but extinction is 1.86, that would imply the intrinsic V is 15.5 -1.86=13.64, which is much brighter. But that's probably not relevant here because the question provides the apparent V as 15.5. So Star3's m_obs=15.5, which is acceptable for both spectrographs.

Wait, but that can't be because extinction would cause m_obs to be higher. So if Star3's intrinsic m is 13.64, and Av=1.86, then m_obs=15.5, which is correct. So Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is under 16. So detectable by both.

Star4: m_intrinsic=15.5, distance=10 pc, so apparent m (without extinction) is 15.5. But E(B-V)=0.4, so Av=1.24. So m_obs=15.5 +1.24=16.74. Which is higher than 16, so HIRES can't see it. But ESPRESSO can (16.74<17). So detectable only by ESPRESSO.

Star5: m_intrinsic (absolute)=16.5, distance=5 pc. So m_intrinsic (apparent) is M +5 log(d/10). So d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)= -0.3010. So m_intrinsic=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995. So approx 15.0. E(B-V) not given, so Av=0. So m_obs=15.0, which is <16 and <17. So detectable by both.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Star1: yes.

Star3: yes.

Star5: yes.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because Star5's m_obs is 15.0, which is acceptable.

So stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5. But Star4 can't be detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. Both can be detected by both.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2 can't be.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star4 can't.

So the correct option would be B: Star3 and Star5.

But wait, let's confirm each:

Star3's m_obs is 15.5, which is acceptable for both.

Star5's m_obs is 15.0, which is acceptable for both.

So option B.

Wait, but wait the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5

B) Star3 and Star5

C) Star2 and Star3

D) Star1 and Star4

So the correct answer is B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait but earlier, I thought Star1's m_obs is 15.5, so it should be detectable by both. But looking again: Star1 has m_obs=15.5, without any extinction. So both can detect it. But Star1 is not in the options except option D.

So why is Star1 not in the options? Let me check the options again.

Option B is Star3 and Star5.

So in the given options, only Star3 and Star5 are the pair that can be detected by both spectrographs.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the brightness limits of the spectrographs and any extinction effects.

### Key Information:
1. **ESPRESSO (Paranal)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m < 17 \)).
2. **HIRES (Keck)**: Can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m < 16 \)).
3. For a star to be detectable by both spectrographs, its apparent V magnitude must satisfy \( m < 16 \), as this is the stricter condition.

### Analysis of Each Star:
#### **Star1**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \).
- Extinction: No extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).
- Observed \( m = 15.5 \), which is \( < 16 \) and \( < 17 \). Detectable by both spectrographs.

#### **Star2**:
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \).
- Extinction: No extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).
- Observed \( m = 16.5 \), which is \( > 16 \). Not detectable by HIRES, but detectable by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star3**:
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \), \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).
- Extinction in V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \).
- Observed \( m = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 \), which is \( > 16 \). Not detectable by HIRES, but detectable by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star4**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \), Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \).
- Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \).
- Observed \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \), which is \( > 16 \). Not detectable by HIRES, but detectable by ESPRESSO.

#### **Star5**:
- Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \), Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).
- Apparent V magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0 \).
- Extinction: No extinction (\( E(B-V) = 0 \)).
- Observed \( m = 15.0 \), which is \( < 16 \) and \( < 17 \). Detectable by both spectrographs.

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both.
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star3**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star5**: Detectable by both.

From the options provided, the stars **Star3 and Star5** are the only pair detectable by both spectrographs.

ANSWER: B
