Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is given by f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. So the main steps here would involve finding the divergence of the vector field and then integrating it over the volume of the sphere. I remember that the divergence theorem might come into play here because it relates the volume integral of the divergence to the flux through the surface.

Let me think about the vector field. It's radial, so in spherical coordinates, the vector field can be written as f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the unit radial vector. Because it's only radial, the other components (like theta and phi directions) are zero.

To find the divergence of f, I need to use the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. I think the general formula for the divergence of a vector field A = A_r er + A_θ eθ + A_φ eφ is:

∇·A = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (A_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dφ (A_φ)/sinθ.

But in this case, A_θ and A_φ are zero, so the divergence simplifies. Let me write that down.

Since A_θ = 0 and A_φ = 0, their corresponding terms drop out. So,

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r).

And A_r is 1/r². So substituting,

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Wait, let's compute the term inside the derivative first. r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So,

d/dr (1) = 0.

So that would make ∇·f = 0.

Wait, but that's strange. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin, then the volume integral would be zero. But wait, there's a point at r=0, which is inside the sphere of radius R. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait a second, but what if the divergence is zero except at r=0? Then integrating over any volume that doesn't include the origin would give zero. But our sphere is including the origin, so we might have a delta function here.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the field itself is 1/r². I think that the divergence of a 1/r² radial field might actually involve a delta function at the origin.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, when you have a vector field that's radial
