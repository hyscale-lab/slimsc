Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that's not good for food because it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and looked at the mutations in the target gene. The question is about which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene and the four mutants are given. I need to figure out which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough to make it non-functional.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing to intact, in the first part, I see that the intact has TTTCTC, and Mutant1 has TTCTAC. Wait, so the third and fourth nucleotides might have changed. Let me write it out:

Intact: positions 1-10: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ATG T TCT ACG TGG TAC T...

Wait, maybe it's a substitution in the third and fourth positions. Like, the original is TTTCTC, and mutant is TTCTAC. Hmm, that's a single substitution maybe? Or multiple? Wait, maybe it's a substitution at position 3?

Wait, perhaps I should look for changes that would cause a frameshift or an early stop codon. Frameshifts are usually caused by insertions or deletions, but looking at the sequences, it seems like point mutations because the length is the same. So, it's substitutions.

Looking for stop codons in the mutant sequences. The original ends with TGA, which is a stop. So if any mutation creates a new in-frame stop codon earlier, that would truncate the protein.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Sequence is 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, let's write the first part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 

Wait, wait, no—mutant1's first part is ATGTTCTACG... So the first part is ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT... So the original was TTTCTC... (positions 3-8: TTCTC?), and mutant1's sequence is TTC TAC.

Wait, perhaps the third codon in the original is TTT, and in mutant1 it's TTC, so a change from TTT to TTC. TTT is Phe, TTC is also Phe. So that's same amino acid. Then the next codon in original was CTC (Leu), and in mutant1, it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change from Leu to Tyr. So that's a substitution, but not a frameshift or stop.

Mutant1 doesn't introduce a new stop in the early part, because the next codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So probably not causing a stop.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the first part is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT ... So the changes are:

Original: after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant2: TTT changed to TTC, then CTC becomes TAA.

Wait, the original after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant2: ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the first change is TTT to TTC (same amino acid, Phe). The next codon is CTC in intact, which is Leu, and in mutant2, it's TAA, which is stop. Oh wait! TAA is a stop codon. So in mutant2, after the first few codons, there's a stop codon introduced.

That would mean the protein is truncated early. So the gene product would be shorter, perhaps nonfunctional. So that would disrupt the anti-nutritional compound.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at the sequence:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...
Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, first, the third codon in original is TTT (Phe), same as in mutant3. The fourth codon in original is CTC (Leu), and in mutant3, it's TAC (Tyr). Then the fifth codon in original is GCT (Ala), and in mutant3, it's GCT (Ala). Then, the next codon in original is GGT (Gly), and in mutant3, it's GGT (Gly). But then, after that, the original is ACT (Thr), and in mutant3, it's GTC (Val). Wait, let me get the exact positions.

Wait, maybe I should look for any new stop codons. The last part in the given sequences for each mutant is the same up to a point.

Wait, in the intact gene, after the part shown, it continues to ...TGA, which is a stop. So in mutant3's sequence, I don't see any new in-frame stops. The changes are in amino acids, like Leu to Tyr, maybe others, but no stop introduced. So likely, the protein is altered but not truncated. So the gene might still produce a functional (but altered) protein.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Let's compare:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, the third codon in original was CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). The fifth codon in original is GCT (Ala), which is same. The sixth codon in original is GGT (Gly), in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So, this causes some amino acid changes. But do any of these changes introduce a stop codon?

In the middle, the original has ACT (Thr) at sixth position. Mutant4 changes that to ACT as well? Wait, maybe I'm getting the positions wrong. Let me think.

Wait, the intact gene's sequence after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4's sequence: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So, the third codon is same (TTT). Fourth codon in original is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). The fifth codon in original is GCT (Ala), in mutant4 it's GCT (same). Sixth codon in original is GGT (Gly), in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So, not introducing any stop codons. So the protein may have some changes but not be truncated.

So, looking for which mutations introduce a premature stop codon. Only Mutant2 does that. Because in Mutant2, the second codon after ATG is TTC (Phe), then TAA, which is a stop. So the mRNA would have ATG TTC TAA..., so the first two codons are Phe, then stop. So the protein would be just two amino acids long, which is way too short and nonfunctional.

Therefore, the desired mutation is Mutant2, which would disrupt the gene function by introducing a premature stop codon.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify the mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can happen if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, significantly altering or truncating the protein product.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Intact Gene**:  
   The sequence provided is wild-type, with no mutations. It ends with a stop codon (`TGA`), and the full-length protein is functional.

2. **Mutant 1**:  
   Comparing the sequences, the first codon remains the same (`ATG`), and the second codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TTC` (Phe), which is the same amino acid. The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TAC` (Tyr). No premature stop codon is introduced, so the protein remains functional but with an altered amino acid sequence.

3. **Mutant 2**:  
   The first codon remains `ATG`, and the second codon changes from `TTT` (Phe) to `TTC` (Phe
