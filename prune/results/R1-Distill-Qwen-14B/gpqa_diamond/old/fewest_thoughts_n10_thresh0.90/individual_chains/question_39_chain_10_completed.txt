Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step.

So the problem says we've got 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is along the x-axis. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when measuring their positions, none were found outside the range x=1 to x=3. So all the particles are between 1 and 3. We need to find the value of 'a'.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus (probability density) must integrate to 1 over all space because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere is 1. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Also, since no particles are found outside 1 and 3, the wave function must be zero outside that interval. Wait, but the wave function isn't zero in our given expression. Oh wait, perhaps the wave function is zero outside 1 and 3, but the given expression is the part where it's non-zero.

Wait, maybe the wave function is defined as (a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i between x=1 and x=3, and zero elsewhere. But the problem states that the wave function is described as that in the part where the particle can exist, which is between 1 and 3. So the wave function is zero outside. So we don't need to consider x <1 or x>3 for the calculation.

So first, I need to find the normalization constant 'a' such that the integral of |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 equals 1.

The wave function ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. But wait, that's a complex function. The modulus squared would be the product of ψ and its complex conjugate.

So, let me compute |ψ(x)|². ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate of ψ(x) would be (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So the product ψ*(x) * ψ(x) is [(a / sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary terms multiply to give a real positive number. Because (a/sqrt(1+x))² is the first term, and (0.5i)(-0.5i) = 0.25, since i squared is -1, but we have negative signs, so wait, let's compute that.

Wait, wait. Let me recast that. ψ = A + B i, where A is a/sqrt(1+x), and B is -0.5. So ψ* is A - B i. Then ψ*ψ = (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B². So the modulus squared is A² + B².

So here, A is a/sqrt(1+x), so A² is a²/(1+x). B is -0.5, so B² is 0.25. So |ψ(x)|² = a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = a²/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx should equal 1.

Let me write the integral: ∫ (a²/(1+x) + 0.25) dx from x=1 to x=3.

We can split this into two integrals: a² ∫ 1/(1+x) dx + 0.25 ∫ dx, both from 1 to 3.

Compute each part:

The first integral, ∫1/(1+x) dx from 1 to3 is ln(1+x) evaluated from 1 to3. So ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

The second integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So putting them together, the entire integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5.

Set this equal to 1 because the probability must be 1. So:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides:

a² * ln(2) = 0.5.

So solve for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2). I remember ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

Taking the square root: a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations. Did I make any mistake?

Wait, the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|², it's (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2 because the imaginary parts are (0.5i)²? Wait, no. Wait, the wave function is ψ = a/(sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the complex conjugate is a/(sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i. So when you multiply them:

(a/(√(1+x)) )^2 + (a/(√(1+x)))(0.5i) - (0.5i)(a/(√(1+x))) ) + ( -0.5i * 0.5i )

Wait, no, that's more complicated. Alternatively, as I did earlier, since it's a+ib multiplied by a-ib, it's a² + b². Because (a + ib)(a - ib) = a² + b².

So I think that part is correct.

So a²/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 is the integrand.

So the integral is correct. Then the calculation for a² leads to 0.5/(ln2) ≈ 0.721, a≈0.849 → 0.85, which is option B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), and the normalization condition requires that the total probability is 1:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The modulus squared of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

\[
a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx + 0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 1.
\]

The first integral is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} dx = \ln(1+x) \Big|_{1}^{3} = \ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

The second integral is:

\[
0.25 \int_{1}^{3} dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Substituting these results into the normalization condition:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

Thus, \( a \approx 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
