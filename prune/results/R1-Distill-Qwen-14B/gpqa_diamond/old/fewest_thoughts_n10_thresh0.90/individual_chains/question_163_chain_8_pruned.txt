Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of calculations. But let's try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, so it's a base. When you add a strong acid to a base, they should react. The reaction should produce water and the corresponding salt. 

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how much 0.1 M strong monobasic acid is needed to dissolve it, and then find the pH of the resulting solution. 

First, I think I should find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3 to convert the mass into moles. Iron has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, each OH group is 17 (16 +1), and there are three of them. So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 +51= 106.85 g/mol. 

So, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Yeah, let me calculate that more accurately: 0.1 divided by 106.85. Hmm, 106.85 goes into 0.1 about 0.000936 times. 

The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid (like HCl, HNO3) would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles of H+ ions. 

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles. 

The acid solution is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter. Wait, 100 cm³ is 0.1 liters, but I think I need to find the volume of acid solution that provides the required moles of H+. 

Wait, wait. The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So I'm adding the acid to the solution, but the total volume after mixing is 100 cm³? Or is the acid volume the only one contributing? Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me read the question again. 

It says, "what is the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid that is needed to prepare the solution." Oh, so the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid (V_acid) plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (assuming it's in solution already) equals 100 cm³. But wait, the Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved, so maybe the initial solution volume is part of the 100 cm³. Or perhaps the acid is being added to a solution that's already 100 cm³. Hmm, not entirely clear. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the reaction occurs in a solution, and the total volume after mixing is 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid solution plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (which is probably in a small volume, negligible compared to 100 cm³) is roughly 100 cm³. So maybe the volume of acid solution is close to 100 cm³. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is being added to a 100 cm³ solution of Fe(OH)3. 

Wait, maybe I should model the problem more simply. The acid is being added to a 100 cm³ solution containing Fe(OH)3. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the final solution's total volume is 100 cm³, so the volume of the acid (V) plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (which is maybe 100 cm³, but no, that's the total). Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. 

Wait, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the total solution volume after the reaction. So the volume of the acid solution (V) plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution (which is maybe negligible, but I'm not sure) equals 100 cm³. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution, and the acid is added to that. So the acid's volume is part of the 100 cm³. 

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the moles. The Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 grams, which is 0.000936 moles. The reaction requires 3 times that in moles of H+ (H+ from the acid). So 0.002808 moles of H+. 

Since the acid is 0.1 M, then the volume (in liters)
