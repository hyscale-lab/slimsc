Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully.

The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which are pericyclic reactions. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. These reactions are usually thermodynamically favored because they form more stable products, like conjugated dienes or aromatic compounds.

The problem has three separate reactions, A, B, and C, and I need to match each with the correct product from the given options. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with Reaction 1:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A

Hmm. So the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The reaction conditions are H+ and heat, so I'm thinking this might be some kind of acid-catalyzed rearrangement.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine structure: it's an amine where the nitrogen is attached to two methoxy groups and an ethyl group. So, the structure is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no. Wait, wait. 1,1-dimethoxy ethan-1-amine would be H2N-C(CH2OCH3)2? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2CH3? Wait no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would have two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, that's not possible because the amine is on ethane. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be replacing two hydrogens on the same carbon as the amine. So it's (CH3
