Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where ψ is the spin state vector and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-direction.

Wait, the spin state given is (3i, 4). So that means the vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the spin states are usually column vectors. So ψ is a two-component vector here.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]
Right, that's the matrix representation. So to compute the expectation value, I need to do the matrix multiplication. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I think I should compute ψ†, which is the conjugate transpose of ψ. So since ψ is [3i, 4]^T, the conjugate would be [-3i, 4]^T because the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i (wait no, wait, wait. Wait, 3i's complex conjugate is -3i? No, wait, no. Wait, the complex conjugate of a + ib is a - ib. So 3i is 0 + i3, so its conjugate is 0 - i3, which is -3i. Wait, yes, correct. So ψ† is [ -3i 4 ] as a row vector.

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, to compute ψ† σ_y ψ, I need to multiply ψ† with σ_y and then multiply that result with ψ.

Let me compute σ_y ψ first. Because matrix multiplication is associative, so (ψ† σ_y) ψ = ψ† (σ_y ψ). Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute σ_y ψ first.

So σ_y is 2x2 matrix:
Row 1: 0, -i
Row 2: i, 0

Multiplying σ_y by ψ, which is [3i,4]^T.

So σ_y ψ = [
(0 * 3i) + (-i) * 4,
(i * 3i) + (0 *4)
]

Let me compute each component.

First component:
0*(3i) is 0. (-i)*4 is -4i. So first component is 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component:
i*(3i) is 3i^2. i squared is -1, so 3*(-1)= -3. Plus 0*4 is 0. So total is -3 + 0 = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, I need to compute ψ† multiplied by this result. ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the product is:
(-3i) * (-4i) + 4 * (-3)

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = (12)(i^2) because i * i is i². But i² is -1. So 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

Adding both terms: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the expectation value for spin should be in terms of ħ. Because I remember that spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ, so maybe I need to account for that. Oh wait, in this case, the matrix σ_y is the Pauli matrix, which represents 2S_y/ħ. Or wait, no: S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the expectation value <S_y> would be (ħ/2) times <σ_y>, which is (ħ/2) multiplied by the value I just found.

Wait, let me clarify. The Pauli matrices σ are such that S = (ħ/2) σ. So the operator for S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So when I compute <σ_y>, it's the expectation value of the Pauli matrix, and then I multiply by ħ/2 to get the expectation value of S_y.

Wait, in the problem, the question is about S_y, not σ_y. So the expectation value is <S_y> = (ħ/2) * <σ_y>.

So the calculation I did gave me <σ_y> = (-24), but wait, no. Wait, let me recheck my calculation.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me go back to the matrix multiplication step.

Wait, σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], and ψ is [3i,4]^T.

So σ_y ψ is:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i² +0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i, -3 ].

Then ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† (σ_y ψ) is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ].

So the dot product is (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24.

So <σ_y> is -24?

Wait, but wait, that seems too big. Because the possible eigenvalues of σ_y are ±1, so the expectation value should be between -1 and 1. But here, I got -24. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, maybe I messed up the dimensions. Oh wait, ψ is a two-component vector, so maybe I should normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning ψ†ψ = 1.

Let me check the norm of ψ. ψ is [3i,4]. So ψ†ψ is (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = 9*(-i²) + 16. Wait, i squared is -1, so -i² is 1. So 9*1 + 16 = 25. So the norm squared is 25, which means the state is not normalized. So to get the normalized state, we should divide by the square root of 25, which is 5.

Ah, right! So ψ is [3i,4]^T, but its norm is 5. So the actual state is (1/5)[3i,4]^T.

So I should have used the normalized ψ for the calculation. So ψ = [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

That changes things. So let me recalculate.

So ψ = [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

Compute σ_y ψ.

σ_y is:
0  -i
i   0

So σ_y ψ = [ (0 * (3i/5)) + (-i)*(4/5), (i*(3i/5)) + (0*(4/5)) ].

Compute each component:

First component: 0 + (-i)*(4/5) = -4i/5.

Second component: (i*(3i/5)) = 3i²/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y ψ is [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T.

Now, ψ† is [ (3i/5)*, (4/5)* ].

Wait, ψ is [3i/5,4/5], so ψ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] * [ -4i/5, -3/5 ].

Compute this dot product:

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = (-12)/25.

Adding both terms: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So <σ_y> is (-24/25).

But wait, this is the expectation value of σ_y. Since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24/25).

Wait, that would be (-24 ħ)/(2 * 25) ) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25, which matches this result.

So the correct answer is A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle,
\]

where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Normalize the spin state
The given spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:

\[
\|\psi\|^2 = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = 9(-i^2) + 16 = 9(1) + 16 = 25.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\psi = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \sigma_y \psi \)
Using \( \sigma_y \) and the normalized \( \psi \), we calculate:

\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

- First component:
\[
(0)(\frac{3i}{5}) + (-i)(\frac{4}{5}) = -\frac{4i}{5}.
\]

- Second component:
\[
(i)(\frac{3i}{5}) + (0)(\frac{4}{5}) = \frac{3i^2}{5} = \frac{3(-1)}{5} = -\frac{3}{5}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)
The conjugate transpose of \( \psi \) is:

\[
\psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

- First term:
\[
\left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{12(-1)}{25} = -\frac{12}{25}.
\]

- Second term:
\[
\left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) = -\frac{12}{25}.
\]

Adding these terms:

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
