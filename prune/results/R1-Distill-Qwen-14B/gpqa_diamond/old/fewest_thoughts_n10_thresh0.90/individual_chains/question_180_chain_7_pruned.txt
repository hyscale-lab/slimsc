Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system involving charges. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is twice that. And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—just potential energy, I think.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that the potential energy in an electric system is calculated based on the configuration of the charges. Since the system is isolated, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges.

Wait, but since the charges are identical and all are 2e, how do I calculate the potential energy? Oh right, the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But since all the charges are the same, each pair contributes the same amount of energy.

Wait, but in this setup, how many pairs are there? Let me think. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the fixed charge.

But wait, the potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So I need to consider all possible pairs.

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at the same distance from the fixed charge. So each of those 12 contributes the same U when interacting with the fixed charge. So for each of the 12, the potential energy is U = (k)*(2e)*(2e)/(2m). But wait, what's 'r' here? The distance between each pair.

Wait, the 12 charges are all at 2m from P, but are they all at the same distance from each other? Hmm, that depends on their arrangement. If they're all fixed at 2m from P, their positions form a sphere around P. But how are they arranged? If they're all at the same distance from P, but perhaps arranged in a way that they're on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m.

However, if the 12 charges are all fixed at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other might vary. Wait, but the problem states that it's an isolated system, and we're to find the minimum energy. Hmm, so perhaps the charges are arranged in such a way that the potential energy is minimized.

Wait, but wait a minute. For a system of charges, the potential energy is minimized when the charges are as close as possible, right? Because the potential energy between two like charges is positive, so bringing them closer would increase the energy. Wait no, wait: the potential energy between two positive charges is positive, and if they repel each other, the system's potential energy is higher when they are closer. So to minimize the potential energy, you'd have them as far apart as possible.

Wait, but in this problem, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed—they can't move closer to P. But what about their distance from each other? If they are all on a sphere of radius 2m, perhaps they can arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible from each other. But the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P, but their mutual distances can vary. Wait, but how?

Hmm, maybe the 12 charges are placed on a spherical shell with radius 2m around P. But in that case, their mutual distances depend on their arrangement. To minimize the potential energy, the charges would arrange themselves as far apart as possible, which would be equally spaced on a sphere. But wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, so perhaps we're to assume that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other as well. Hmm, but that's not necessarily the case unless they're arranged in a regular polyhedron.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplified, and the mutual distances between the 12 charges are not considered because they are fixed at a distance of 2m from P, but their mutual distances are varying, and perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy from their interaction with the fixed charge and not with each other. But that can't be right because the problem is about the total potential energy of the system.

Wait, the total potential energy U of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. So each pair contributes U = k*(q1*q2)/r
