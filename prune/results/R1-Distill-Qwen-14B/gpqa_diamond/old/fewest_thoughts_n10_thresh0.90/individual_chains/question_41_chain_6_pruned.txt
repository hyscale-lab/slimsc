Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light relative to the observer in the lab.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving, it affects how light propagates through it. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact principles here. Oh right, this probably involves the concept of relative velocity and maybe even special relativity, but wait, the speed of light is always c in a vacuum according to Einstein, but here we're dealing with a medium with an index of refraction.

So normally, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But the glass is moving, so I need to consider how that affects the observed speed. Let me think: if the medium is moving towards the observer at speed v, how does that influence the light's speed in the medium as seen from the lab frame.

Wait, maybe I can model this using the relativistic velocity addition formula. Or is that overcomplicating things? Because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²), but wait, that's for when the frame is moving at velocity v relative to the first. Hmm.

But wait, no, because the medium itself is moving, and light's speed in that medium is v = c/n. So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v = c/n. Now, the lab frame is moving relative to the glass. Wait, no: the glass is moving towards the observer at v. So from the lab's perspective, the glass is moving, so we need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Wait, no—the light is moving through the glass. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at speed v towards the observer. The light inside the glass has a speed of c/n in the glass's frame. So I need to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

Ah, right, so we're dealing with a scenario where the glass is moving, and the light is moving within it. So perhaps I should apply the velocity addition formula from special relativity here.

Let me recall the velocity addition formula. If an object has velocity u in the frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S along the same axis, then the velocity u' of the object in S' is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Wait, or is it (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²) when S' is moving at v relative to S?

Wait, no, the formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²) when S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Wait, actually, I think the formula depends on the direction. Suppose S is the lab frame, and S' is the rest frame of the glass. Then in S', the light is moving at speed u' = c/n. The glass is moving at speed v relative to the lab, so the lab sees
