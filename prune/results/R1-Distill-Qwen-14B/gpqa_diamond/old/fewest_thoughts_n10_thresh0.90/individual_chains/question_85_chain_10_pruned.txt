Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, the question gives me a lot of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The two planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, and radii of 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii. They both have the same albedo, which probably means their reflectivity is the same, so that won't affect the temperature ratio.

The question mentions transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, transit method measures the drop in brightness when a planet passes in front, which relates to the planet's radius. Radial velocity looks at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum, which is more about the planet's mass and orbital period.

But for equilibrium temperature, I remember the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Oh wait, but wait, no, the formula should account for the planet's distance from the star (a) and the star's luminosity. Because equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance.

Right, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_star * (L_star/(16πσ a² (1 - albedo)))^(1/4). Wait, no, maybe a better way to think about it is using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The star emits energy, which spreads out over the area of a sphere with radius a (the planet's orbital distance). The planet absorbs that and emits as a blackbody.

So the flux at the planet's location is F = L_star / (4π a²). The planet's cross-section is π R_p², but for equilibrium temperature, it's the energy balance where the planet absorbs F * (1 - albedo) and then radiates as a blackbody with area 4π R_p².

So the equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_p = [ (L_star (1 - albedo)) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4)

But L_star is the star's luminosity, which can be calculated from the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R_star² σ T_eff^4.

So substituting L into T_p:

T_p = [ ( (4π R_star² σ T_eff^4) (1 - albedo) ) / (16 π σ a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify that:

Simplify numerator: 4π R² σ T^4 (1 - a)
Denominator: 16 π σ a²

So when we divide, 4/16 is 1/4, π cancels, σ cancels, so we have:

(R² T^4 (1 - a) )/(4 a² )

So the term inside the square root is: [ R_star^2 T_eff^4 (1 - albedo) / (4 a^2) ] 

Wait, no, the entire thing is inside a 1/4 power, so:

T_p = [ (R_star² T_eff^4 (1 - a)) / (4 a²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Breaking that down:

= (R_star^2 / 4 a² )^(1/4) * (T_eff^4 (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Which becomes:

= (R_star / (2 a))^0.5 * T_eff * (1 - a)^0.25

Wait, wait, let me double-check the exponents. Because when you take the 1/4 power of R², it's R^(2*(1/4)) = R^0.5. Similarly, a^-2 * (1/4) is a^-0.5. So, the first part is R_star/(2 a) )^0.5.

And the second part: T_eff^4 * (1 - a) under 1/4 power becomes T_eff * (1 - a)^0.25.

So overall,

T_p = T_eff * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * (1 - a)^0.25 

But wait, another way to write that might be:

T_p = T_eff * sqrt( R_star/(2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25

Hmm, yeah, that's correct.

But since both planets orbit the same star, T_eff and (1 - albedo) are the same for both. So when taking the ratio T1/T2, the (1 - albedo) terms cancel, as well as T_eff.

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (
