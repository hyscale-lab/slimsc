Okay, so I've got this problem about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on vector calculus, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. We need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, divergence... right. The divergence of a vector field gives a measure of its sources or sinks. So if I compute the divergence of f(r), and then integrate that over the volume of the sphere, that should give me something.

But wait, I remember something about the divergence theorem. Oh yeah! The divergence theorem relates the flux through a closed surface to the volume integral of the divergence. So, the volume integral of the divergence of f over the sphere is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

So instead of computing the integral directly, maybe I can calculate the flux through the surface, which is a sphere of radius R.

If the vector field is only radial, then the flux through the sphere is just the surface integral of f(r) times the area element. Because the field is radial, the dot product simplifies.

So the flux Φ is the integral of f(r) multiplied by the area of the sphere. Since f(r) is 1/r² and for the sphere of radius R, r is R. So f(R) is 1/R².

Wait, but the area of the sphere is 4πR². So the flux would be f(R) multiplied by the area.

That would be (1/R²) * (4πR²) = 4π. So the flux is 4π.

But wait, according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. So the integral is 4π.

Looking at the options, option A is 4π. So I think the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The vector field is f(r) = (something) * r hat. Since it's only radial, the divergence in spherical coordinates might be different.

Oh right, in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A(r)), where A(r) is the radial component.

So f(r) is (1/r²) * r hat. So the radial component A(r) is 1/r². Plugging into divergence formula:

div f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought the flux was 4π. That would imply the divergence is zero and the integral is zero, which conflicts with the flux result.

Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, let me recalculate the divergence. The vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r hat.

So A(r) = 1/r².

div f = [1/(r²)] d/dr (r² * A(r)).

r² * A(r) = r² * (1/r²) = 1.

So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So div f = 0.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, perhaps?

But wait, the divergence is zero outside the origin. But if the divergence is zero, then the volume integral would be zero. But earlier, using the flux, I thought it was 4π. So there's a contradiction.

Ah, I think I see the confusion. The vector field given is similar to the electric field of a point charge. The divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, which is non-zero only at the origin where the charge is. So in the region outside the origin (like our sphere of radius R), the divergence is zero. But wait, in this problem, the vector field is defined everywhere, including the origin, but perhaps it's not defined correctly at the origin.

Wait, the problem says the vector field has non-zero component only along the radial direction and falls off as 1/r². So the field is f(r) = (1/r²) r hat. So for r not equal to zero, that's fine. But at r=0, it's singular.

So in the region we're integrating, which is the volume of the sphere, but r=0 is included. So the divergence is zero except at r=0.

Wait, but in the volume integral, would any point contribute except the origin? Because the divergence is zero everywhere else. So the integral would be zero? But that can't be right, because when I applied the divergence theorem, I got 4π.

Wait, but wait. The divergence theorem says that the flux through the boundary (the sphere) equals the integral of the divergence over the volume. But if the divergence is zero except at a point (the origin), then the integral itself is zero. But then, how does that reconcile with the flux being 4π?

Ah! Because the divergence theorem requires that the vector field is differentiable everywhere inside the volume. If there's a point where the field isn't differentiable (like r=0 here), then the divergence theorem might not apply directly.

Wait, perhaps the field is actually a delta function at the origin. Let me think. The divergence of f(r) is zero except at r=0. So the volume integral is the same as the value at r=0, which could be a delta function.

Wait, no, the divergence in the region r≠0 is zero, but at r=0, let's compute the divergence again.

Wait, when r approaches zero, the expression for f(r) is (1/r²) r hat. So the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) * d/dr (1) = 0. So even as r approaches zero, the divergence is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for a field like E = (k/r²) r hat, the divergence at r=0 is a delta function. Oh wait, no, in reality, the divergence of E is rho/epsilon0, which is a delta function at the origin because rho is a point charge.

So what's the divergence of our f(r) here?

Wait, let's compute it correctly.

f(r) = (1/r²) r hat.

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a purely radial vector field A(r) r hat is:

div A = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A(r)).

So for A(r) = 1/r²,

div f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * 1/r² ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But how can this be?

Ah, perhaps because the function is not differentiable at r=0. So the divergence in the mathematical sense is zero, but physically, the divergence is not zero because the field behaves like a point source.

Wait, but wait. The flux through a closed surface enclosing the origin is 4π for this field, similar to Gauss's law for a point charge. So according to the divergence theorem, the integral of divergence over the volume should equal the flux, which is 4π. But our computation shows the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, so the integral would be zero. That's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something in the mathematics. Wait, the divergence theorem applies to vector fields that are continuously differentiable in the region enclosed by the surface. If the field has a singularity at the origin, then the divergence theorem may not hold in the usual way.

Alternatively, maybe the divergence is not zero; perhaps I made a mistake in computing it.

Wait, let me re-do the divergence calculation.

f(r) = (1/r²) r hat.

So, the radial component is A(r) = 1/r².

The divergence in spherical coordinates for a purely radial field is:

div f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² A(r)).

So r² A(r) = r² (1/r²) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0.

So div f = 0.

So divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. Hence, the integral over any volume not containing the origin would be zero. But the integral over a volume that does include the origin would require considering the behavior at r=0.

Wait, but the divergence is zero except perhaps at a point. The integral of zero over the volume would be zero, but the divergence theorem suggests it should be 4π.

This is confusing. How can both be true?

Wait, maybe the field isn't properly defined at the origin, so the divergence isn't zero but includes a Dirac delta function. Let me think about that.

In electromagnetism, for a point charge, the electric field is E = (k e / r²) r hat. The divergence of E is rho / epsilon_0, which is a delta function at the origin. So, perhaps for our field f(r), which is similar to E, the divergence is a delta function at the origin.

So if that's the case, the divergence of f(r) is 4π delta(r), because in three dimensions, the divergence of (1/r²) r hat is 4π delta(r). So when we integrate the divergence over the volume, we get 4π times the volume enclosed by the sphere, but wait no, the delta function is zero everywhere except at r=0. So the integral would be 4π times the volume that includes the origin? No, wait, the integral of delta(r) over any volume that includes the origin is 1. So the integral of divergence f(r) would be 4π.

So the volume integral is 4π.

But wait, in our case, the divergence is zero except at origin, but the field behaves in such a way that the flux is 4π. So the volume integral must be 4π, which would be the same as the flux, because of the divergence theorem, despite the divergence being zero elsewhere.

Wait, but mathematically, the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, which is a single point. So the integral of zero over a volume (which is a 3D region) is zero. But the divergence theorem says the integral equals the flux, which is 4π. So how do we reconcile this?

Ah, I think the key is that the vector field isn't differentiable at the origin, so the divergence isn't just zero; it's a distribution. The divergence is 4π delta(r). So the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4π times the integral of delta(r) over the volume, which is 4π times 1 (since the sphere of radius R contains the origin, the delta function is 1 there). So the integral is 4π.

So the volume integral is 4π, which matches the flux.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) 4 π.

Wait, but wait, earlier I thought the divergence was zero, so the integral would be zero. But that's under the assumption that the divergence is zero in the conventional sense. But when the field has a point source, the divergence is a delta function, which is a distribution. So in that case, the integral over any volume containing the origin is 4π.

So the answer is 4π, which is option A.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The vector field is purely radial and has a magnitude \( f(r) = 1/r^2 \). To solve this, we use the divergence theorem, which relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux of the field through the closed surface enclosing the volume.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence of the Vector Field**:  
   The vector field is \( \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{\mathbf{r}} \), where \( \hat{\mathbf{r}} \) is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates. For a purely radial vector field, the divergence in spherical coordinates is given by:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 A(r) \right),
   \]
   where \( A(r) \) is the radial component of the field. Substituting \( A(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0.
   \]
   Thus, the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field is singular.

2. **Flux Through the Surface**:  
   Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \) is equal to the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through the surface of the sphere. The flux is calculated as:
   \[
   \Phi = \int \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A},
   \]
   where \( d\mathbf{A} \) is the area element on the sphere. Since \( \mathbf{f} \) is radial, the dot product simplifies, and the flux becomes:
   \[
   \Phi = f(R) \cdot 4\pi R^2 = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi.
   \]

3. **Reconciling the Results**:  
   While the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) is zero everywhere except at the origin, the field behaves like a point source at \( r = 0 \). In such cases, the divergence can be interpreted as a Dirac delta function \( \delta(\mathbf{r}) \), scaled by \( 4\pi \). Thus, the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere is:
   \[
   \int \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = 4\pi \int \delta(\mathbf{r}) \, dV = 4\pi,
   \]
   since the delta function contributes 1 at the origin, which is inside the sphere.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \). This matches the flux calculation and aligns with the behavior of the field as a point source.
