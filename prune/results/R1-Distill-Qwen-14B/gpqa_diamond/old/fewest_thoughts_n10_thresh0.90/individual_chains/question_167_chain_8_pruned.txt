Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|−α>]/N. N is the normalization constant, N = sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(−2α²)). The parameters are φ = -π/4 and α=0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity, nG, which is the relative entropy between the state's density matrix ρ and a reference Gaussian state τ. The formula provided is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) − trace(tau ln tau)].

Wait a second, relative entropy is also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, right? So it's measuring how different ρ is from τ. But the question is about non-Gaussianity, which I think refers to how non-Gaussian the state is. Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix corresponding to a Gaussian distribution in phase space, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc.

So, the problem is asking me to find del_b. But what's τ here? Oh, wait, the problem says τ is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So I'm guessing τ could be the closest Gaussian state to ρ in terms of relative entropy. Or perhaps it's a specific Gaussian state, like a coherent state or something else.

Wait, but the problem states that the relative entropy is given as that expression, which is the difference between the entropy of ρ and the entropy of τ. So, to compute del_b, I need to calculate the entropy of ρ and subtract the entropy of τ.

But how do I do that? Let's break it down.

First, let's find N. Given φ = -π/4, so let's compute sin(2φ). 2φ is -π/2, sin(-π/2) is -1. So sin(2φ) = -1. Also, exp(−2α²) with α=0.5 is exp(-2*(0.25))=exp(-0.5). The value of exp(-0.5) is about 0.6065. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) which is approximately 0.6275.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.3935's square root is about 0.6275? Let me compute 0.6275^2: 0.6275 * 0.6275. Let's see, 0.6*0.6=0.36, 0.6*0.0275=0.0165, 0.0275*0.6=0.0165, 0.0275^2≈0.000756. So adding up, (0.6+0.0275)^2 is 0.36 + 2*(0.6*0.0275) + 0.000756 ≈ 0.36 + 0.033 + 0.000756 ≈ 0.393756. Oh, so yes, N is approximately 0.6275.

So the state |ψ> is [cos(-π/4)|0.5> + sin(-π/4)|-0.5> ] / N.

Compute cos(-pi/4) and sin(-pi/4). Cos is even, so cos(pi/4)=√2/2≈0.7071. Sin(-pi/4)= -√2/2 ≈-0.7071.

So |ψ> = [0.7071 |0.5> -0.7071 |−0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Wait, but what are |α> and |−α>? These are coherent states, right? Or maybe Fock states? No, I think |α> is a coherent state with amplitude α. So the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases.

Now, the density matrix ρ is |ψ><ψ|. So ρ is a pure state, because |ψ> is a pure state. The entropy of a pure state is zero. Wait, no—wait, wait. The von Neumann entropy is S(ρ) = - Tr(ρ ln ρ). For a pure state, ρ is a projector, so Tr(ρ²) =1, and S(ρ) =0.

Wait, no, that's correct. Because for a pure state, ρ is idempotent (ρ²=ρ), so Tr(ρ ln ρ) = Tr(ρ) ln Tr(ρ) - Tr(ρ ln ρ) ??? Wait, no, wait, von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(ρ ln ρ). For a pure state, Tr(ρ ln ρ) is -S. But if ρ is pure, then S=0. So the entropy of ρ is zero.

But wait, the relative entropy del_b is S(ρ) - S(τ). So if S(ρ) is zero, then del_b = - S(τ). But wait, that would make del_b negative, which doesn't make sense because relative entropy is always non-negative. Oh, wait, no, because del_b is defined as [S(ρ) - S(τ)], which is the same as the relative entropy between ρ and τ, right? Wait, the standard relative entropy D(ρ || τ) is Tr(ρ ln ρ) - Tr(ρ ln τ) ) = S(τ) - S(ρ) - Tr( (I - τ) ln τ ), no, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Alternatively, the relative entropy is defined as D(ρ||τ) = Tr(ρ ln ρ) - Tr(ρ ln τ) ). Alternatively, it can also be written as S(τ) - S(ρ) + Tr(ρ ln τ) - Tr(τ ln τ) ??? Hmm, perhaps I should double-check.

Wait, the formula given
