Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime of τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. The question asks about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm. Right, so in particle physics, when a particle decays, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when observed in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. The formula for time dilation is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is given by gamma = E / m, where E is the total energy of the particle and m is its rest mass.

Wait, wait. Oh right, for a particle moving at relativistic speeds, the energy E is much larger than its rest mass, so gamma would be E divided by m. So for X⁰, E is 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let me see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 * 8 is about 27.28, which is a bit over 27. So approximately 7.9. Let me get more precise.

3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 - 23.87 is 3.13. So 3.13 / 3.41 ≈ 0.917. So gamma is approximately 7.917.

So τ = gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So τ = 7.917 * 8e-16. Let me compute that. 7.917 *8 is around 63.336e-16 seconds. So τ = 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Now, the lifetime determines how far the particle travels before decaying. The distance is L = v * tau. But wait, v is the velocity of the particle. Since it's moving at a high speed, v is approximately c, the speed of light. So v ≈ c = 3e8 m/s.

So L = c * tau = 3e8 m/s * 6.3336e-15 s. Let me calculate that. 3e8 times 6.3336e-15 is (3 *6.3336) * 1e-7. 3 *6 is 18, 3*0.3336 is ~1, so total around 19. So 19e-7 meters. Wait, 3e8 *6.3336e-15 = 3 *6.3336 = 18.999, so approx 19e-7 m, which is 1.9e-6 meters or 1.9 micrometers.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Oh, right, because not all the particles will decay within the chamber. So the number of decays depends on the length the particle travels compared to the chamber's dimensions. But wait, the chamber's size is fixed, but the question is about the resolution. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm confusing things. The problem is probably about the minimum resolution (like the minimum detectable separation) so that we can observe the decay products. But
