Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation for a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a rather complex molecule with multiple substituents and double bonds. I think the formula involves using bond energies because the question provides those values.

Wait, enthalpy of formation usually involves the energy change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But here, they're giving bond energies, so maybe I should approach this using Hess's Law or the bond enthalpy method.

So, the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔH°f = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, no, actually, the formula is:

ΔH°f = [sum of bond energies broken (products)] - [sum of bond energies formed (reactants)]

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think again. Oh, right! The correct approach is to calculate the total energy required to break all bonds in the reactants and subtract the energy released when forming bonds in the products. So,

ΔH°f = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of products)]

But wait, wait. No, that's not quite right. Because enthalpy of formation is the energy change when forming the molecule from its elements, so the elements are in their standard states, which are atoms. So, I think the correct method is to calculate the enthalpy using the atomization approach.

So, another approach: the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by imagining the process of breaking all bonds in the elements (like H2 and C) and then forming the bonds in the target molecule.

The steps would be:
1. Calculate the total enthalpy required to break all bonds in the reactants (which are the elements, H2 and C).
2. Calculate the total enthalpy released when forming all bonds in the product (the given molecule).
3. The difference between these two will give the enthalpy of formation.

Wait, but the formula I remember is:

ΔH°f = (ΣH of products) - (ΣH of reactants)

But in this case
