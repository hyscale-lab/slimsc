Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed, meaning they're spread out evenly. I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Wait, I remember parallax is related to distance. Parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift in position of a star due to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The formula for distance is something like distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So, d = 1/plx. Right.

Now, stars are uniformly distributed. That probably means their density is uniform. But how does that translate to the number of stars per unit parallax? Hmm.

Let me think about density in space. If the density of stars is uniform, then the number of stars would depend on the volume of space we're looking at. But parallax relates to distance, so we need to find how the number of stars in a shell with a certain parallax range compares to others.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d would be the volume of that shell multiplied by the density. Since the question is about per unit range of parallax, I'm guessing it's a thin shell.

The volume of a thin spherical shell with radius d and thickness dr is approximately 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so the derivative with respect to r is 4πr² dr. Right.

Density is number per unit volume. So the number of stars in that shell would be density multiplied by 4πd² dr. But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax range. So I need to express this in terms of parallax, not distance.

Since d = 1/plx, plx = 1/d. Let me substitute d in terms of plx. So d = 1/(plx). So, d squared is 1/(plx)^2. Then 4πd² dr becomes 4π (1/plx²) dr. But wait, I need to change dr into a change in plx, dplx.

Since d = 1/plx, then dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because if plx increases, d decreases. So dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Hmm, but when plx increases, the distance decreases, so the shell is getting closer. 

So the number of stars per unit plx (dN/dplx) is density multiplied by the volume element per unit plx. The volume element is 4πd² dr, which in terms of plx is 4π (1/plx²) * (-1/plx² dplx). Wait, but the negative just indicates the direction of change, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, perhaps we can ignore the sign and focus on the magnitude.

So substituting, dN = density * 4π (1/plx²) * (1/plx² dplx) )? Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, dr is the change in distance, which is - (dplx)/(plx²). So dr = - dplx / plx².

So the volume element is 4π d² dr = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-dplx/plx²) )

Which simplifies to 4π (1/plx^4) (-dplx).

So the number of stars in a shell is density multiplied by this volume. But the question is about the number per unit plx range. So dN = density * 4π (1/plx^4) * (-dplx) )

But since dN is the number of stars, the negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, so the number of stars is decreasing. But since the question is about the magnitude of the number per unit plx, perhaps we can ignore the negative sign.

So, the number of stars per unit plx is proportional to 1/(plx^4). Because 1/plx^4 times dplx.

Wait, but the options are options. So looking back, option A is 1/plx^4, option D is 1/plx^3.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think again.

The number of stars in a shell with a certain parallax (plx) is proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume is 4πd² dr, and since d is 1/plx, that becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr.

But dr is the change in distance. Since plx is inversely proportional to d, a change in plx dplx would correspond to a change in d dr = - (1/plx²) dplx.

Substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx²) * ( - dplx / plx² ) ) = -4π dplx / plx^4.
