Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves an electron's spin state and some operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think this through.

Alright, the state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors, and the coefficients tell us about the probabilities when measured in a certain basis. Since |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-component of spin, the state is already in that basis.

Wait, but the state is proportional, so I need to normalize it. To find the probabilities, I should compute the squared magnitudes of the coefficients. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let's calculate their moduli.

The modulus of (1+i) is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). Similarly, the modulus of (2-i) is sqrt(2^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(4+1)=sqrt(5). So the squared moduli would be 2 and 5, respectively. Wait, but that's not normalized yet. The total squared modulus is 2 + 5 =7. So the probabilities are 2/7 and 5/7 for up and down states, respectively. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). So the state is |alpha> = a*(1+i)|up> + a*(2-i)|down>, where a is the normalization constant. The normalization condition is |a|^2 [ |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 ] =1. So |1+i|^2 is (1^2 +1^2)=2. |2-i|^2 is (2^2 + (-1)^2)=4+1=5. So sum is 7. So a^2 *7=1 → a=1/sqrt(7). So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2-i)/sqrt(7).

Therefore, the probability of measuring up is |(1+i)/sqrt(7)|^2. Let's compute that. The modulus squared of (1+i) is (1^2 +1^2) =2. So 2/(7) ≈ 0.2857. Similarly for the down state: |2-i|^2 is 4+1=5 →5/7≈0.7143. Wait, but looking at the options, the first numbers are like 0.64, 0.54, etc. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right approach. Wait, wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, the question isn't about measuring the z-projection. Oh no, the question is about measuring with respect to another operator. Oh right, the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So this isn't the z-projection operator; it's a different operator.

Wait, so the operator is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it down. Since it's 2x2, the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2    0  ]

So the operator is (ħ/2)(|up><down| + |down><up|). Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2, because the Pauli X is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So this operator is (ħ/2) σ_x.

Now, when you measure a state in the basis of this operator, you'll get eigenvalues ± ħ/2, because σ_x has eigenvalues ±1, multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, but what's the eigenbasis of this operator? The eigenstates are the states where measuring this operator gives a definite value. So the eigenstates are the same as those of σ_x, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

So to find the probabilities when measuring the operator, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenbasis of this operator.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the expectation value and the probabilities directly.

Wait, but the question is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator. Let me think. So the operator has two eigenvalues, each with their own eigenstates. The eigenvalues are plus and minus ħ/2. The probabilities are the squared amplitudes of the state |alpha> when expressed in terms of these eigenstates.

So step by step: first, find the eigenstates of the operator. As I thought, the eigenstates are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2, respectively.

So let's denote |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |−x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). These are the eigenstates.

Now, our state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So first, let's write |alpha> as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, multiplied by 1/sqrt(7).

We can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>:

|alpha> = c_+ |+x> + c_- |−x>

To find c_+ and c_-, we can take the inner product of |alpha> with |+x> and |−x>.

So c_+ = < +x | alpha >, and similarly for c_-.

Let me compute c_+ first.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> = 1, <down|down> =1, and <up|down>=0.

So this simplifies to (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(0) + (1+i)(0) + (2 -i)(1) ]

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express it correctly. The inner product is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] times (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Which equals (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 - i) <down|down> ]

Which is (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(0) + (1+i)(0) + (2 -i)(1) ]

So (1+i) + (2 -i) = [1 +2] + [i -i] = 3 +0i =3.

So c_+ is 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, c_- is < -x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] times (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Which is (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (2 -i) <down|up> + (1+i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Wait, no. Let me re-calculate this carefully.

Compute < -x | alpha >:

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| - <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Which equals (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> - (1+i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ]

Again, <up|down> and <down|up> are zero.

So this becomes (1/(sqrt(14))) [ (1+i)(1) + (2 -i)(0) - (1+i)(0) - (2 -i)(1) ]

So (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that calculation.

Wait, let me expand it again.

c_- = (1/sqrt(14)) [ (1+i)*1 + 0 - 0 - (2-i)*1 ]

So that's (1+i - 2 + i) = ( (1-2) ) + (i +i ) = (-1) + 2i. So yes, that's correct.

So c_+ is 3/sqrt(14), and c_- is (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2: (3)^2 /14= 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, option A has 0.64 and 0.36, but let's compute |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_-|^2: [ (-1 + 2i) ] [ (-1 -2i) ] / 14.

Compute numerator: (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i) ?

Wait, no, the product is (-1)(
