Okay, so I've got this problem here about spins and the partition function. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says there are three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). And we're supposed to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so maybe after figuring it out, I can match it to one of them.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each state contributes a term based on its energy.

So each spin has two possible states: +1 and -1. So for three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Right, that's manageable. I can list all possible states and compute their energies.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way instead of enumerating all possibilities. Let me think about the symmetries or the possible values of the energy.

The energy is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me simplify that. Let's compute each term:

Each S_i S_j is either (+1)(+1)=1, (+1)(-1)=-1, etc. So S_i S_j can be +1 or -1.

But since all three terms are summed, the total sum can vary. Let's think about what the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be.

Wait, perhaps I can find the number of possible states for each possible value of the sum. Because each state has a specific sum, and if multiple states have the same sum, their contributions can be grouped.

So, let me denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H.

So for each possible value of H, the energy is E = -J H. And the partition function will have a term for each H multiplied by the number of states that have that H.

So step one: find all possible values of H and how many states have each H.

Let me consider all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the possible values of H.

Each of the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be +1 or -1. So the sum H can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Wait, let me check.

Wait, what's the maximum and minimum possible sum? Each term is ±1, so for three terms, the maximum sum is 3 (all +1) and the minimum is -3 (all -1). But what about the possible sums in between?

Wait, let's think. For three terms, each +1 or -1, their sum can be:

If all three are +1: 1+1+1=3.

If two are +1, one -1: 1+1-1=1.

If one +1, two -1: 1-1-1=-1.

If all three are -1: -1-1-1=-3.

So possible H values are 3, 1, -1, -3. Are there other possibilities? Let me check.

Wait, wait: Let me list all possible combinations.

Wait, H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

But maybe instead of enumerating all 8 states, I can think in terms of how many states have H=3, H=1, etc.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute H for each state.

Let me list all the possible states as (S1, S2, S3), each being ±1.

1. (1,1,1):

H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 +1 =3.

E = -J *3.

2. (1,1,-1):

H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

E= -J*(-1)= J.

3. (1,-1,1):

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

E=J.

4. (1,-1,-1):

H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

E=J.

5. (-1,1,1):

H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

E=J.

6. (-1,1,-1):

H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

E=J.

7. (-1,-1,1):

H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) =1 -1 -1 =-1.

E=J.

8. (-1,-1,-1):

H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1 +1 +1 =3.

E= -J*3.

Wait, so let me tabulate the states and their H and E.

State          H    E= -J H
1: 1,1,1       3   -3J
2: 1,1,-1     -1    J
3: 1,-1,1     -1    J
4:1,-1,-1     -1    J
5:-1,1,1      -1    J
6:-1,1,-1     -1    J
7:-1,-1,1     -1    J
8:-1,-1,-1    3   -3J

Wait, but looking at the above, states 2,3,4,5,6,7 all have H=-1. So that's 6 states with H=-1. And states 1 and 8 have H=3. So that's 2 states.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when I look at state 2: (1,1,-1), H is (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1-1-1= -1. Correct. And state 3: (1,-1,1): H is (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1= -1. Correct. Similarly for others, they all have H=-1 except the first and last.

So, the number of states with H=3 is 2 (state 1 and 8), and the number of states with H=-1 is 6 (states 2-7).

Wait, no. Wait, states 2,3,4,5,6,7: that's six states. H=3 occurs in two states.

So, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E), which is exp(β H J), because E = -J H. So exp(-β E) = exp( β J H ). Alternatively, since E = -J H, then -β E = β J H.

So each state contributes exp( β J H ), multiplied by the number of states that share that H.

So, for H=3, 2 states: each contributes exp(3 β J). So 2 * exp(3 β J).

For H=-1, 6 states: each contributes exp( (-1) β J ). So 6 * exp( (-1) β J ).

Thus, Z = 2 e^{3 β J} + 6 e^{ - β J }.

Wait, but looking at the options. Let's check the options:

Option A) Z= 2e^{-3Jβ} +6e^{Jβ}

Option B) Z= 2 e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}

Hmm, so according to my calculation, the answer is 2e^{3Jβ} + 6e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.

Wait, but wait
