Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy questions. But I'll take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used to form the ylide, which is a strong nucleophile. This sounds like a Staudinger reaction, which is used to convert alkenes into amines, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh wait, another possibility: when you have a carbonyl compound reacting with red phosphorus and HI, it might undergo a reaction that converts the carbonyl into something else. Oh yeah! It's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So if the starting material is a ketone, the product would be an alkane after this reaction.

But let me confirm that. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Wait, no, that's another one—maybe the Wolbach reduction? Wait, no, wait. Oh, I think I might be mixing things up. Red phosphorus and HI are used in another reaction—maybe the Wittig reaction? No, the Wittig uses triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm. Wait, when you have a carbonyl group reacting with red phosphorus and HI, is it the formation of a phosphorus ylide? No, I think in the Wittig reaction, you have aldehydes or ketones reacting with ylides to form alkenes. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait, maybe it's the Hoffman degradation? No, that's for amides. Or maybe it's a different kind of reduction.

Wait, another thought: the reaction of a carbonyl group (like a ketone) with red phosphorus and HI could lead to the formation of a phosphonate, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think that the reaction of ketones with HI and red phosphorus actually leads to the conversion into an alkane via a two-electron transfer mechanism. So, for example, a ketone would lose the O and form a methylene group. So, if the starting compound has a ketone, this reaction would reduce it to a CH2 group.

Wait, but let me think about the starting compound. The question gives IR and NMR data for Compound X, so I need to figure out what X is first. Then, knowing X, I can predict the product after reacting with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: 

IR peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ suggests O-H or N-H stretch. The broadness might suggest an acidic proton. The 1720 cm⁻¹ peak is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 cm⁻¹ regions are around where aromatic C=C stretching occurs, so the compound has a benzene ring. The 1720 is probably a ketone or maybe an ester. But the 3400-2500 suggests it's an O-H (maybe a carboxylic acid) because that's a broad peak. Wait, but a carboxylic acid has two O-H stretches, but in the IR, a broad peak around 2500-3000 is usually O-H. Wait, but 3400–2500 is a broad range, which might include both an O-H and possibly an N-H, but I don't see any info about amides here. So perhaps it's a carboxylic acid or an alcohol.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:

10.5 ppm (bs, 1H) → likely a carboxylic acid proton, since that's a strong deshielded proton. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm as a singlet, but in this case, it's a
