Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that these spots cause brightness variations when the star rotates, mimicking the effect of an exoplanet. The task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm, right. So I need to compare the brightness changes caused by the spots to those caused by a planet.

First, I remember that the brightness variation (the change in flux) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula:

ΔF/F = (R_planet / R_star)^2

Because the planet blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the area ratio. So the fractional change is the square of the radius ratio.

But here, the star has spots. So the variation caused by the spots isn't a simple transit; instead, as the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since they're cooler, when a spot is facing us, the star's brightness decreases. But wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variations are similar to those from a planet. So we want the amplitude of this variation to match that caused by a planet.

Wait, but the question is a bit different. It says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)"—wait, no, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. Let me read again.

Wait, the setup: when the star is observed, because of the spots, the brightness varies. This variation can "closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet." So, if the star wasn't spotted, what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude?

Wait, no, actually, the question is: to produce the same amplitude as the spotted star, if the star was not spotted, what planet radius would cause the same ΔF/F.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. The problem is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is being mistaken for a planet. So when actually, the star isn't transited by a planet, but the spots make it look like there is. But the question is, if the star wasn't spotted, and instead had a planet, what planet radius would cause the same brightness variation.

Alternatively, perhaps the scenario is that the star's spot-induced variation has the same amplitude as the planet's transit. So we need to compute the planet's radius that would give the same ΔF/F as the spots do.

So first, I need to find the amplitude caused by the spots on the star.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, R_star = R_sun.

One hemisphere is covered with spots. The filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the area covered is 20% of the hemisphere. But wait, the star's surface area is 4π R^2. But each hemisphere is 2π R². So if one hemisphere is covered 20% with spots, the total area covered is 0.2 * 2π R².

Wait, no. Let me think. The total surface area of a sphere is 4π R². Each hemisphere is 2π R². The filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, so spots cover 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

But when the star rotates, as viewed from Earth, the spots will come into and out of view. So the maximum change in brightness would be when the spots are fully visible (i.e., the side of the star with spots is facing us). Let me model the brightness variation.

The star's total flux is F = σ T_eff^4 * (4π R²) / (4π D²) ) = σ T_eff^4 (R²/D²). Wait, but considering it's a star, the flux is proportional to its surface area and the temperature to the fourth power.

So the star's normal flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (R_star^2 / D^2) * 4π / (4π) ) = σ T_eff^4 (R_star^2/D²) * (4π/(4π)) )? Wait, perhaps more accurately, the flux from the star is F = (Luminosity)/(4π D²), and the luminosity L = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

So F = (4π R² σ T_eff^4) / (4π D²) ) = (R² σ T_eff^4) / D².

But when part of the star's surface is cooler, the observed flux decreases. The spots have a temperature of T_eff - 1000 K = 5000 K.

So the total flux when the spots are on the visible side would be F = F0 - (fraction of area blocked) * (difference in flux per unit area).

Each spot's flux is less than the surrounding. So the spots contribute less flux. So the change in flux due to the spots is the difference between the normal flux and the flux when the spots are visible.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total area of spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1 or 10% of the entire star's surface.

Wait, because one hemisphere is 2π R², and 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the spots cover (0.4 π R²) of the star's total surface (4 π R²). So 0.4 π / 4 π = 0.1, which is 10% of the star's surface.

Wait, but wait, because the spots are on only one hemisphere. So when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are all visible. When it rotates, that hemisphere is away, so spots are not seen.

So the maximum change in flux occurs when the spots are all on the side facing us. The flux when the spots are visible is F_visible = F0 - (area_fraction) * (ΔF per area).

Wait, more accurately, the change in flux is the difference between the normal flux and the flux with spots. The normal flux is F0 = σ T_eff^4 * (4 π R^2) / (4 π D²) ), but that's L/(4π D²). Alternatively, the flux per unit area from the star's surface is σ T_eff^4.

When spots are present, the flux is lower in those areas. So the total flux is F = F0 - (area of spots) * (σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 )) / (4π D²) )

But wait, the area of spots is 0.4 π R², so:

ΔF = (0.4 π R²) * σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / (4 π D² )

Wait, let me reorganize. The change in flux is the area of the spots multiplied by the difference in flux per unit area.

So ΔF = (area of spots) * [σ (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4 ) ] / (4 π D² )

But F0 is (4 π R²) σ T_eff^4 / (4 π D² ) ) = σ T_eff^4 R² / D².

Wait, perhaps better to express ΔF as a fraction of F0.

So ΔF = (area fraction) * (ΔT^4 term)

The area fraction is (0.4 π R²) / (4 π R²) ) = 0.1.

The temperature difference term is T_eff^4 - T_spot^4. Wait, no, the spots are cooler. The flux from the spots is σ T_spot^4 per unit area, so the change is (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4). So per unit area, the difference is this.

So the fractional change in flux is (ΔF / F0) = (0.1) * (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4) / T_eff^4.

Because F0 is the total flux without spots. So when we have spots, the flux is F0 minus ΔF. So the change in flux is ΔF = F0 * (0.1) (T_eff^4 - T_spot^4)/T_eff^4.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The area fraction is 0.1. The flux from the area without spots is σ T_eff^4 for each unit area, and the spots contribute σ T_spot^4.

So the change in flux is (0.1) * (σ T_eff^4 - σ T_spot^4) per unit area? Wait, no, the area is part of the star's surface.

Wait, perhaps better to compute the fractional change as:

The total flux F = F0 when no spots are visible. When the spots are visible, the flux is F_spot = F0 - (area_fraction) * (F0 per unit area) * [ 1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ]

Because each spot's flux is (T_spot / T_eff )^4 of the normal flux per unit area. So the change is (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 ) per unit area.

So putting it all together, the fractional change is:

ΔF/F0 = (area_fraction) * (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 )

So area_fraction is 0.1, T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

So plugging in the numbers:

ΔF/F0 = 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Compute (5000/6000)^4: 5/6 is about 0.8333. (0.8333)^2 is ~0.6944, so squared again is about 0.4823.

So 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈
