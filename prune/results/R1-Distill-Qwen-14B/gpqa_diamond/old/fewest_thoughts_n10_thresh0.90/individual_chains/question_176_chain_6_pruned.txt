Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized. Let me check the length. The vector has components (-1, 2, 1), so the squared magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is probably (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1). But I'll proceed with the given vector and perhaps normalize it when necessary.

The problem mentions two observables, P and Q, with their respective matrix representations. The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/√2, 0
Second row: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Third row: 0, 1/√2, 0

And Q's matrix is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, that's interesting. So Q's matrix is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1. The diagonal also implies that the eigenstates are the basis vectors. So if we measure Q, the possible results are 1, 0, or -1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are |1> (column [1,0,0]), |0> (column [0,1,0]), and |-1> (column [0,0,1]).

The question asks: If someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, no, the order is: first measure P, then measure Q. So the probabilities are for P being 0 and Q being -1 in that order.

Wait, no, the question says, "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So maybe it's the joint probability of first measuring P=0 and then Q=-1. Alternatively, perhaps it's the probabilities for each?

Wait, no. No, the question is about the probability that P is measured to be 0 and Q is measured to be -1, happening in sequence: first P, then Q.

In quantum mechanics, when you perform a measurement, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the measured observable. So if P is measured first, and the outcome is 0, the system's state collapses into the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 of P. Then, when Q is measured on this new state, the probability of getting -1 is calculated based on that state.

So to find the probability, I think I should:

1. Find the eigenvalues and
