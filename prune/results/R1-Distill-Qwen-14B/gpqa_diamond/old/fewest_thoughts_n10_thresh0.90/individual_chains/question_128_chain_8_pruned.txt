Okay, so I've just started this new job at a structural biology lab, and the first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein using E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence, and now I have four plasmids to choose from. I need to figure out which one has the correct DNA sequence to express this protein.

Hmm, I remember that when cloning a gene into a plasmid for expression in E. coli, the plasmid must have the correct reading frame and appropriate promoters, plus the gene should be under a suitable ribosome binding site. Also, E. coli uses a different genetic code slightly, but in this case, the sequence is for human P53, so I think the plasmid should include appropriate codon optimization for E. coli.

Wait, the options are all DNA sequences. I need to look for the start and end codons, and see if the coding sequence (CDS) matches the given amino acid sequence. Oh, right, the plasmid should have the ATG start codon and then the correct coding sequence, ending with a stop codon, probably TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATG, which is good. Now, the given amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSDPS... which translates from the DNA sequence.

Wait, I should think about how the DNA sequence translates into the amino acids. The DNA is in the 5' to 3' direction, and the mRNA is complementary to the DNA's template strand. So the coding (sense) strand is the same as mRNA except Tâ†’U.

The amino acid sequence given is the sequence of the protein, which is synthesized from the mRNA. So the mRNA is made from the template DNA strand, which is complementary to the coding DNA strand.

So, the plasmid's DNA sequence should have the coding strand matching the mRNA, except that the mRNA starts with AUG (from ATG in DNA). Let's think about the first part.

The given amino acid sequence starts with M (which is methionine), so the DNA's start should be ATG.

Looking at the options, all start with ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAG... Wait, that doesn't look like it starts with ATG followed by the correct sequence. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the options are the DNA sequences. Each starts with ATG, then some nucleotides. So the next few codons after ATG in the DNA would determine the first few amino acids.

The amino acids start with M, E, E, P, Q, S, D, P, S, V... So the first codons in DNA should be ATG (M), then GAG (E), GAG (E), etc.

Wait, the DNA is in the same direction as the coding strand. So the first codon is ATG, which codes for M. Next codon in DNA is GAG, which is E in mRNA, so the second amino acid is E. Then another GAG (another E). Then GGC, which is G in DNA. Wait, GGC is G in DNA? No, wait, DNA is read in triplets as codons.

Wait, no, DNA's coding strand is read directly into mRNA. So the DNA sequence is the same as mRNA except T for U.

So for the DNA sequence:

ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG C...

This translates to:

AUG GAG GAG CCG CAG UCA GAT CCA GCU GCA G... which would be the mRNA.

Wait, but mRNA is read in the 5' to 3' direction, so the codons are AUG (M), GAG (E), GAG (E), CCG (Pro), CAG (Q), TCA (Ser), etc.

So the amino acids would be M, E, E, P, Q, S, D, etc., which matches the given sequence.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence starts with MEEPQSDPS..., which would correspond to ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC ... in the DNA.

Looking at each option's beginning:

Option A: ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCAGATCCTAGCGTCGAGCCGCCTCTGAGTCAGGAAACATTTTCAGACCTATGGAAACTACTTCCTGAAAACAACGTTCTGTCCCCGTTGCCGTCCCAAGCAATGGATGATTTGATGCTGTCCCCGGACGATATTGAACAATGGTTCACTGAAGACCCAGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCCGCATGCCAGAGGCTGCTCCCCCCGTGGCCCCTGCACCAGCAGCTCCTACACCGGCGGCCCCTGCACCAGCCCCCTCCTGGCCCCTGTCATCTTCTGTCCCTTCCCAGAAAACCTACCAGGGCAGCTACGGTTTCCGTCTGGGCTTCTTGCATTCTGGGACAGCCAAGTCTGTGACTTGCACGTACTCCCCTGCCCTCAACAAGATGTTTTGCCAACTGGCCAAGACCTGCCCTGTGCAGCTGTGGGTTGATTCCACACCCCCGCCCGGCACCCGCGTCCGCGCCATGGCCATCTACAAGCAGTCACAGCACATGACGGAGGTTGTGAGGCGCTGCCCCCACCATGAGCGCTGCTCAGATAGCGATGGTCTGGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCTTATCCGCGTGGAAGGAAATTTGCGTGTGGAGTATTTGGATGACAGAAACACTTTTCGACATAGTGTGGTGGTGCCCTATGAGCCGCCTGAGGTTGGCTCTGACTGTACCACCATCCACTACAACTACATGTGTAACAGTTCCTGCATGGGCGGCATGAACCGGAGGCCCATCCTCACCATCATCACACTGGAAGACTCCAGTGGTAATCTACTGGGACGGAACAGCTTTGAGGTGCGTGTTTGTGCCTGTCCTGGGCGCGACCGGCGCACAGAGGAAGAGAATCTCCGCAAGAAAGGGGAGCCTCACCACGAGCTGCCGCCAGGGAGCACTAAGCGAGCACTGCCCAACAACACCAGCTCCTCTCCCCAGCCAAAGAAGAAACCACTGGATGGAGAATATTTCACCCTTCAGATCCGTGGGCGTGAGCGCTTCGAGATGTTCCGAGAGCTGAATGAGGCCTTGGAACTCAAGGATGCCCAGGCTGGGAAGGAGCCAGGGGGGAGCAGGGCTCACTCCAGCCACCTGAAGTCCAAAAAGGGTCAGTCTACCTCCCGCCATAAAAAACTCATGTTCAAGACAGAAGGGCCTGACTCAGACTGA

So the first part is ATG GAG GAG CCG CAG TCA GAT CCT AGC GTC GAG CCG C. So the codons are ATG (M), GAG (E), GAG (E), CCG (P), CAG (Q), TCA (S), GAT (D), CCT (P), AGC (S), GTC (V)... Wait, wait, wait. Let me parse each triplet.

ATG is M.
GAG is E.
GAG is E.
CCG is Proline (P).
CAG is Glutamine (Q).
TCA is Serine (S).
GAT is Aspartic Acid (D).
CCT is Proline (P).
AGC is Serine (S).
GTC is Valine (V).

Wait, but the given amino acid sequence is MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQ... Hmm. So according to the sequence:

MEEPQSDPSVEPPLSQ...

So the second amino acid is E, third E, fourth P, fifth Q, sixth S, seventh D, etc.

But from the DNA in option A, the first few codons (after ATG) are GAG (E), GAG (E), CCG (P), CAG (Q), TCA (S), GAT (D), etc.

Wait, that would translate to M E E P Q S D P S V... which matches the given sequence MEEPQSDPS...

So the first few codons in the DNA are correct. So option A seems to have the correct start.

Wait, but I need to check if the entire sequence aligns. Alternatively, perhaps the stop codon is present.

Looking at the end of the options, each ends
