Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember from my solid-state devices class that this equation describes the current-voltage behavior in a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. Let me think about what that means.

The equation given is J equals (9/8) times epsilon, mu, V squared divided by L cubed. So J is proportional to V squared over L cubed. I think the Mott-Gurney equation applies to a specific kind of semiconductor device configuration.

From what I recall, the SCLC regime occurs when the space charge is so high that it significantly affects the electric field in the device. This is often in the case of very thin devices or very high applied voltages. But the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid must be specific.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: The equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate the current, leading to more complex behavior. Single-carrier means only electrons or holes are involved, not both. Ohmic contact implies that the contacts are such that there's no barrier for carriers, so the injection is easy. But negligible drift current? Wait, in the SCLC regime, the current is mainly due to the space-charge effect, which I think is more about the electric field and the velocity of the carriers. Drift current is due to the electric field, so if it's negligible, that might not fit. Or does the equation assume drift dominates? Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Option B: Valid for trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. So no injection barrier—so Ohmic contacts, same as A. And negligible diffusion current. Oh, right, in the Mott-Gurney equation, the assumption is that the current is space-charge limited, and the dominant transport is drift, not diffusion. So if diffusion is negligible, that makes sense. Because in SCLC, the current is determined by the space charge, not by the carrier density gradient due to diffusion. So this option seems promising.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact has a barrier, so it's a different kind of contact. The Mott-Gurney equation is usually applied to devices with Ohmic contacts, I think, because in Schottky barriers, the current would be limited by the injection, not the space-charge. So this might not be the case.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Two-carrier would imply both electrons and holes are involved, which might complicate things. The Mott-Gurney equation is for single-carrier because when both carriers are present, the behavior could be different, maybe leading to a different current dependence. So D might not be correct.

So narrowing it down, options B and A are possibilities. Let me think about the drift and diffusion aspects. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the current is dominated by the space-charge effect. In this case, the space charge creates an electric field that accelerates the carriers. The derivation usually assumes that the current is due to the drift of carriers, not the diffusion. So when the space charge is dominant, the drift current is what matters.

So the equation assumes negligible diffusion current because the carrier concentration doesn't vary much—instead, it's the electric field from the space charge that drives the carriers. So in the equation, the presence of the space charge implies that the carriers are being accelerated, so drift is significant, but diffusion is negligible because the concentration gradient is not the main factor.

Looking back at the options, option B says "negligible diffusion current." That makes sense because if diffusion were significant, the current would depend more on the concentration gradients, which is not the case in SCLC.

Option A says "negligible drift current." That can't be right because the current is driven by the drift due to the electric field. So if drift were negligible, the equation wouldn't hold. So A is incorrect.

So the correct statement should be option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion current.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), assumes specific conditions for its validity. Let us analyze the options:

- **Option A**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation relies on drift current being significant, as the space charge creates an electric field that drives the carriers. Therefore, the assumption of negligible drift current contradicts the conditions under which the equation is derived, making this option incorrect.

- **Option B**: This states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. The equation assumes that diffusion current is negligible because the current is dominated by the space-charge effect, which is driven by drift. This aligns with the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is derived, making this option correct.

- **Option C**: This states that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier, which complicates the current behavior and is not consistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This states that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices, as the inclusion of both electrons and holes introduces complexities that are not accounted for in the equation. Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

The correct statement is **Option B**, as it accurately reflects the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid: a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current.

Answer: B
