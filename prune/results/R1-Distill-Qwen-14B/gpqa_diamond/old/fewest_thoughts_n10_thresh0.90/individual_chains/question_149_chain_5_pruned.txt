Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a peptidic compound that was synthesized. The 1H NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and their integrals add up to one proton. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks with the same mass. What's going on here?

Alright, let's break down the NMR part first. So, the same alpha-proton appearing as two peaks. Since they integrate to 1H together, it's not a coupling issue because each would have their own integral. But wait, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin. So maybe it's not a splitting due to adjacent protons. What else can cause multiple peaks for the same proton?

Isotopic peaks? Like, maybe something with deuterium or something, but I don't think that would cause two peaks for the same proton. Or maybe exchange broadening? No, that usually causes a peak to broaden, not split into two.

Oh wait, maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. Because in that case, the same proton would have two environments: R and S configurations. But in racemates, the NMR would show a single peak if the protons are equivalent. Wait, but if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then the protons would be equivalent, but maybe in some cases, they aren't. Wait, in enantiomers, the alpha protons would be non-equivalent only if the molecule is not symmetric around the alpha carbon. So if the molecule is asymmetric around that carbon, then each enantiomer's alpha proton would be a different environment. So in an NMR, you'd see two separate peaks. But wait, wouldn't that be the case for diastereomers as well?

Wait, but the question says that the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. So if it's enantiomers, their chemical shifts should be the same because enantiomers have identical physical properties except for optical activity. So the chemical shifts would be almost same, but maybe in some cases, like when there's a chiral environment, the shifts might slightly differ. But in most cases, for the same proton in enantiomers, the shifts would be identical. Oh wait, no, in reality, the shifts would be the same because the molecule is a mirror image. So the NMR wouldn't see a difference, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, but the problem says the NMR shows two peaks with similar shifts. So if the two peaks are from the same proton in different diastereomers, that could cause a split. Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR shifts would be different. But wait, diastereomers have different coupling constants and shifts, so their alpha protons would have different shifts. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts, not very different. So maybe that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers. But wait, diastereomers would have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts for each set of protons. So perhaps the two peaks correspond to the same type of proton but in different diastereomers.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So that suggests that the same proton in two different environments. If the molecule is a diastereomer mixture, each diastereomer would have the same alpha-proton, but in a different environment. So their shifts would be different, but maybe not too far apart. So that could explain the two peaks.

Alternatively, what about the situation where the compound forms a mixture of tautomers? But tautomers are usually in different environments, but I don't think it's the case here. Also, the question is about a peptide, so maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: double bonds. If the molecule has an alpha,beta-unsaturated group, maybe there's some coupling or something else. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so it's not that.

Another thought: the problem mentions that the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of the same mass. Wait, but same mass? So both have the same molecular weight. So that would suggest that they are either enantiomers or diastereomers. Because if they were different compounds with the same molecular weight, that's possible, but the NMR would show more differences.

Wait, but in the NMR, the same alpha-proton is showing two peaks. If the two LC-MS peaks are the same mass, perhaps they're enantiomers. Because enantiomers have the same mass. So then why would the NMR show two separate peaks?

Wait, but for enantiomers, in a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak for that proton because the two enantiomers are mirror images, so the environment for the proton is the same. So the shifts would be the same. So why two peaks?

Hmm, maybe the issue is that the compound has some sort of dynamic process or slow exchange, like if there's an interconversion that's fast on the NMR timescale. But if the exchange is slow, like if the molecule is in a mixture that doesn't interconvert quickly, then each enantiomer would give a separate peak. But in that case, the integrals would add up, which they do. But for enantiomers, because they're mirror images, the shifts would be the same. So the two peaks would have the same chemical shift, but that's not the case here. The question says they have similar shifts, but maybe just a little different.

Wait, but if the two peaks are due to different diastereomers, then the shifts would be different. But the problem states that the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So perhaps in each diastereomer, that same proton is present, but in different environments, causing the shifts to be similar but not the same.

Wait, diastereomers can have the same number of protons, but different environments. So, for example, if the molecule has two stereocenters, and each has a different configuration, leading to diastereomers. If the alpha-proton is adjacent to that stereocenter, then in each diastereomer, the environment for that proton would be different, leading to different chemical shifts. So the NMR would show two separate peaks for the same proton in each diastereomer.

But in that case, if the mixture is of diastereomers, the LC-MS would show two peaks with the same mass because the molecular weight is the same. Because diastereomers have the same molecular formula, so same mass. So that fits. So the question is, which option refers to diastereomers. Let's look at the options.

Option B says the compound is a mixture of enantiomers. Option D says a mixture of diastereoisomers.

So, going back to the NMR. If it's a mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would show a single peak for that proton because the two enantiomers have the same shift. But the question says two peaks with similar shifts. So that doesn't fit. So the enantiomer scenario probably isn't the right answer.

If it's a mixture of diastereomers, then the shifts would be different. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So why would diastereomers cause two peaks with similar shifts?

Wait, maybe the diastereomers have the same or very similar environments for that particular alpha-proton. For instance, if the stereochemistry is elsewhere, and that particular proton's environment is not much affected. But that would be unusual. Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of epimers. Epimers are diastereomers that differ in the configuration of a single stereocenter. If the alpha-proton is adjacent to that stereocenter, then the shift would be different. But the shifts might be close enough to be considered similar. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is with the LC-MS part. The LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of same mass. So the molecular weight is the same, which suggests they are the same compound or enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So that suggests that the same proton is split into two, but the coupling isn't the issue. So what else can cause a single proton to split into two?

Wait, think about double bonds. No, that's for coupling. They ruled out spin-spin coupling.

Wait, another possibility is that the proton is part of a system with coupling to more than one proton. But that usually leads to more complex splitting, like a triplet or something, not two separate peaks.

Wait, perhaps the problem is due to a double bond or some other situation where the proton is experiencing different environments in a way that's not spin-spin coupling. Alternatively, maybe there's some kind of conformational issue, where the proton is in two different conformations with slightly different shifts. That would cause two peaks. But in that case, the integral would be one, but here it's adding to one.

Wait, the integrals add up to 1H. So each peak is integrating to roughly the same, about 0.5 each. So perhaps the molecule is present in two different forms, each having the same proton, but in different environments.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is with the synthesis. So during the synthesis, an amide bond was formed, and double coupling occurred. What's 'double coupling' here?

Wait, option C says 'double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction. I'm not entirely sure what that term refers to. Maybe it's a case where two different bonds formed, leading to byproducts? Or perhaps a situation where two different substituents are attached due to some reaction issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound underwent a side reaction where another group was added, leading to a diastereomer. But that's more about stereochemistry, which would lead to diastereomers.

Wait, going back to the question, the LC-MS shows
