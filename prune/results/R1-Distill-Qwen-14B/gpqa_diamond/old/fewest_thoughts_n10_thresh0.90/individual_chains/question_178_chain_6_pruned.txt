Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the Lagrangian L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices, right? So σ_{μν} = (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. 

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constants determines whether a theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories have couplings with positive mass dimension, I think. Or wait, no, maybe the opposite. Let me get this straight. The renormalizability depends on the superficial degree of divergence. If the coupling has a positive mass dimension, the theory might be non-renormalizable because higher-order terms can't be ignored. Wait, no: the opposite. Because for a renormalizable interaction, the interaction term must have mass dimension ≤4. Because in four dimensions, the action is dimensionless, so each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian should be dimension 4.

Wait, okay, the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action S is dimensionless and S = ∫ d^4x L, so [L] = 4. So each term in L must be dimension 4.

So the term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So each field in there has a certain dimension. Let me think about the fields.

The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order, so ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. So ψ̄ is the same, right? Because it's the adjoint.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. Since the gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), [σ_{μν}] = 0. Because it's a product of gammas and their commutators, which are all dimensionless.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor from electromagnetism, I think. Wait, no, but F is a tensor, so each index is a derivative or something. Wait, F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. So each derivative ∂ has mass dimension 1. So F^{μν} has mass dimension [F] = 2, since each derivative contributes 1, and A^ν is a gauge field which has dimension 1. So F^{μν} is 2 in mass dimension.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate. The gauge field A^ν has mass dimension 1, right? Because in the Maxwell term, the Lagrangian has (∂A)^2, so A has to have dimension 1 to make [∂A]^2 have dimension 4. So F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. Each term is ∂A, so dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So [F^{μν}] = 2.

So putting it all together: the term is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ times F.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3. Then F is 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 =5.

But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So the whole term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ] = -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is κ multiplied by those fields. So the dimension of the term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] +5. Because each field contributes their dimension.

But since the Lagrangian must be dimension 4, [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

So that gives me that [κ]_M =-1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizable theories have couplings with mass dimension ≥0. Wait no, wait. The renormalizability condition is based on the superficial degree of divergence. A term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its mass dimension is ≤4. Because higher than that would lead to non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, but in this case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. So the interaction term is of dimension [L] = [κ] + [ψ]^2 [F] = (-1) + (3/2 * 2) + 2. Wait, no, that's not the right approach. Alternatively, each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So, the dimension of the term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = (-1) +5=4, which is correct.

But the question is about renormalizability. The theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Because that way, the perturbative expansion doesn't lead to divergent terms beyond a certain point. Or wait, another way: a coupling with negative mass dimension implies that the interaction becomes stronger at higher energies (UV), which suggests non-renormalizable.

Wait, another approach: the general rule is that for a theory to be renormalizable, all coupling constants must have a mass dimension greater than or equal to zero. Because in the ε expansion (for say, dimensional regularization), the divergent terms can be absorbed into the existing terms in the Lagrangian. If the coupling has negative mass dimension, it implies that the term is non-renormalizable.

So, if [κ] =-1, which is less than zero, this would imply that the interaction is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together, κ has dimension -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options:

Option C: [κ]=-1. Theory is not renormalizable.

Option A: [κ]=-1. Theory is renormalizable. So no.

Option C is the correct one.
