Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see. The question is about the energy difference between two quantum states so that they can be clearly distinguished. Hmm.

So, the problem states that there are two states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. Wait, the lifetimes... I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle relates the energy of a particle to the precision of its measurement. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle! It says that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is on the order of ħ/2, but often approximated as ΔEΔt ≈ ħ. 

So, the uncertainty in energy depends on the lifetime of the state because the lifetime is the time over which the energy is measured. The longer the lifetime, the more precisely the energy can be measured because there's more time to observe it, leading to a smaller uncertainty. Alternatively, a shorter lifetime means a larger uncertainty in energy.

The question is asking for the energy difference that allows us to clearly resolve the two states. That means the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state, right? Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, we wouldn't be able to distinguish them.

Wait, but each state has its own lifetime. So the uncertainty in energy for each state would be based on their respective lifetimes. Let me think: for state E1 with a lifetime τ1 = 1e-9 seconds, the uncertainty ΔE1 ≈ ħ/(τ1). Similarly, ΔE2 ≈ ħ/(τ2), where τ2 is 1e-8 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. So we need the difference |E2 - E1| to be greater than the sum of their uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe each's uncertainty? Or maybe the maximum of the two uncertainties?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy resolution is determined by the shorter lifetime. Because the state with the shorter lifetime has a larger uncertainty. So if the difference is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, we can resolve them. Let me think more.

Suppose the two states have different uncertainties. The state with the shorter lifetime (E1) has a larger uncertainty (since ΔE ≈ ħ/τ, so shorter τ means larger ΔE). So if the energy difference is larger than the larger uncertainty, then the two states can be distinguished. Because even the state with the larger uncertainty would have a width that's less than the energy difference.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime. Because the uncertainty is larger for the shorter-lived state. So, if the energy difference is bigger than ΔE1, which is bigger than ΔE2, then the two states can be resolved.

So, let's compute the uncertainties. I'll need the value of ħ. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But wait, we need the uncertainty in energy in eV, not joules. Let me remember the conversion factors. 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 joules. So, to convert from J to eV, we divide by 1.602e-19.

So, for E1: τ1 = 1e-9 seconds.

ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 ≈ (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) ) = 1.0545718e-25 J.

Convert to eV: 1.05457e-25 J / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ (1.05457e-25) / (1.602e-19) ≈ approximately 6.58e-7 eV. So about 6.58e-7 eV.

Similarly for τ2 = 1e-8 s:

ΔE2 = ħ/(1e-8) = 1.05457e-26 J. Converting to eV: 1.05457e-26 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.58e-8 eV.

So, ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is about 6.58e-8 eV.

The energy difference between E2 and E1 needs to be larger than the larger uncertainty, which is ΔE1. Because if the difference is less than ΔE1, even though it's larger than ΔE2, the broader line (ΔE1) would overlap, making it hard to distinguish. So the difference has to be bigger than the maximum of the two uncertainties, which is ΔE1 = ~6.58e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) 1e-9 eV → 0.001 n eV. Way smaller than 6.58e-7 eV. So no.

B) 1e-11 eV → Even smaller. No way.

C) 1e-4 eV → That's 0.0001 eV. Wait, 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 1e-4 eV. That's way bigger than 6.58e-7. Because 6.58e-7 is 0.000000658 eV. So 1e-4 is 0.0001, which is 168 times larger. So yes, that would be sufficient.

D) 1e-8 eV → That's 0.00000001 eV, which is about 15 times smaller than ΔE1 (6.58e-7 is about 6.58e-7). So 1e-8 is 0.00000001, which is smaller than 6.58e-7. So that would not be enough.

So the correct answer would be option C, 1e-4 eV. Because this is larger than the uncertainty of the state with the shorter lifetime, which is the larger uncertainty. So the energy difference is big enough that the two states can be resolved.


To determine the energy difference required to clearly distinguish two quantum states with energies \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), we use the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which relates the uncertainty in energy (\( \Delta E \)) to the lifetime (\( \tau \)) of the state as \( \Delta E \approx \hbar / \tau \). The energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the larger uncertainty to ensure the states can be resolved.

### Step 1: Calculate the uncertainties
- For \( \tau_1 = 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_1} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-9} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.60218 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
  \[
  \Delta E_1 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-25}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

- For \( \tau_2 = 10^{-8} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{\hbar}{\tau_2} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}}{10^{-8} \, \text{s}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
  \]
  Converting to electron volts:
  \[
  \Delta E_2 \approx \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-26}}{1.60218 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.58 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{eV}.
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the required energy difference
The energy difference \( |E_2 - E_1| \) must be greater than the larger uncertainty, which is \( \Delta E_1 = 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Evaluating the options:

- **A) \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.001 \, \text{n eV} \), which is much smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **B) \( 10^{-11} \, \text{eV} \):** This is even smaller than \( 10^{-9} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.
- **C) \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.0001 \, \text{eV} \), which is approximately 168 times larger than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Sufficient.
- **D) \( 10^{-8} \, \text{eV} \):** This is \( 0.00000001 \, \text{eV} \), which is about 15 times smaller than \( 6.58 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{eV} \). Not sufficient.

### Conclusion
The energy difference must be at least \( 10^{-4} \, \text{eV} \) to ensure the two states can be clearly resolved.
