Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and we need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, Sy. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula ⟨A⟩ = ψ† A ψ, where ψ is the state vector and A is the operator for the observable. So, in this case, A would be the spin operator Sy.

Wait, the spin operator for y is given as σy, which is a matrix. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The σy matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But wait, the spin operators Sx, Sy, Sz are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz. So for Sy, the operator would be (ħ/2) * σy. So I need to remember that factor of ħ/2.

So the state vector ψ is given as (3i, 4). Wait, that's a two-component vector, right? So ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

To compute the expectation value, I think I need to do ψ† multiplied by Sy multiplied by ψ. Let me write that out.

First, let's write out all the steps:

1. The state vector is ψ = [3i, 4]^T. Its conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3, 4* ] since the first component is 3i, the conjugate is -3, and the second component is 4, which is real, so it stays 4.

2. The operator Sy is (ħ/2) * σy. So σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So Sy would be (ħ/2) times that matrix.

So Sy = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So when I compute ψ† Sy ψ, that's ψ† multiplied by Sy multiplied by ψ.

Let me compute each part. Let me first compute Sy multiplied by ψ.

So Sy ψ is (ħ/2) * σy * ψ.

But let's compute σy * ψ first.

The vector ψ is [3i, 4]. Let's compute σy * ψ.

σy is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So matrix multiplication:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σy * ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, multiply by (ħ/2):

Sy ψ = (ħ/2) * [ -4i, -3 ].

So Sy ψ = [ (ħ/2)(-4i), (ħ/2)(-3) ].

Which simplifies to [ (-2ħ i), (-3ħ/2) ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3, 4 ].

So ψ† Sy ψ is [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by Sy ψ.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, ψ† is a row vector, and Sy ψ is a column vector, so the multiplication is [ -3, 4 ] * [ (-2ħ i), (-3ħ/2) ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: Sy ψ is a vector, and ψ† is a row vector.

So the calculation is [ -3, 4 ] multiplied by [ (-2ħ i), (-3ħ/2 ) ]^T.

Wait, but that's a dot product. So:

(-3) * (-2ħ i) + (4) * (-3ħ/2 )

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3) * (-2ħ i) = 6ħ i.

Second term: 4 * (-3ħ/2 ) = (4 * -3/2) * ħ = (-6) ħ.

So the sum is 6 ħ i -6 ħ.

Wait, but wait a second. That's the result of the expectation value, right? But that's a complex number. But the expectation value should be a real number because Sy is a Hermitian operator, and expectation values are real.

Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake in the calculation somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the state vector was given as (3i, 4). Let me make sure I wrote the matrix multiplication correctly.

Wait, σy is:

[0  -i]
[i   0]

So the first component of σy * ψ is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = (-i)(4) = -4i. Correct.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i * 3i = 3i^2 = 3*(-1) = -3. Correct.

So Sy ψ = (ħ/2) * (-4i, -3) = (-2 ħ i, -1.5 ħ )

Then ψ† is [ -3, 4 ], since the original ψ is (3i,4). The conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is real, so it's 4.

So when I do ψ† * Sy ψ, it's:

(-3) * (-2 ħ i) + 4 * (-1.5 ħ )

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3) * (-2 ħ i) = 6 ħ i.

Second term: 4 * (-1.5 ħ ) = -6 ħ.

So sum is 6 ħ i -6 ħ.

Wait, that's 6 ħ (i -1). That's a complex number, which can't be right for an expectation value. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the matrix multiplication or the operator. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the expectation value is real, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute Sy as (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix, and then compute the expectation
