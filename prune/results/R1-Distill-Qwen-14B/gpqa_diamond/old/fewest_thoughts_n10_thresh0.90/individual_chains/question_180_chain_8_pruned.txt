Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it again.

The question says: There's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible. Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules.

Wait, right. So, the system consists of charges, and I'm supposed to find the minimum energy. I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them. But since the system is isolated, perhaps the energy is the sum of all pairwise potentials?

Wait, but when you have multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. For a system of n charges, each pair contributes once. So for 13 charges, how many pairs? Hmm, 13 choose 2, which is (13*12)/2 = 78 pairs.

But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is stationary, and the others are arranged around it, each at a distance of 2 meters. So, the configuration is a central charge with 12 others equally distant from it.

Wait, but maybe the problem is considering the potential energy between the central charge and the 12 surrounding ones, plus the potential energy among the 12 themselves.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum of two parts: U1 is the energy due to the central charge and the 12 surrounding, and U2 is the energy due to the interactions among the 12 themselves.

Let me think: Each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from P, where the 13th charge is fixed. So, each of those 12 charges is a distance of 2m from the fixed charge at P.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So, the distance between the 13th (fixed) and each of the 12 is 2 meters. What about the distance between any two of the 12? Are they all at the same distance from each other? Because if they're all on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the distance between two on the sphere would depend on their positions. But wait, maybe the problem is abstracting that and considering that the 12 are arranged in a way that each of their mutual distances is the same. Hmm, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, but perhaps we can model this as a point where each of the 12 charges is at a distance R from each other. Oh wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is simplified, and we just consider the potential between the central charge and the 12 others, but not their mutual interactions. But that doesn't seem right because the problem says it's an isolated system, so all interactions contribute.

Wait, the question asks for the minimum energy. So perhaps arranging the 12 other charges as far apart as possible would minimize the potential energy, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait: in terms of potential energy, the system would have higher potential energy when the charges are close together because the potential energy is positive for repulsive charges. Since all charges are positive (each has 2e, so same sign), they repel each other. So to minimize the potential energy, we need to maximize the distances between them. But how?

Wait, but in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So the distance from P is fixed, but what about their mutual distances? If they are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters, the maximum possible distance between any two would be the diameter, 4 meters. But that's only if they're diametrically opposite. But for 12 points on a sphere, their mutual distances would vary.
