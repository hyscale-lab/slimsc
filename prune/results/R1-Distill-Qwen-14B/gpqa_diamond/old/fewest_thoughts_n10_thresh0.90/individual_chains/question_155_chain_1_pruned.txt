Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmmm.

First, let's recap what I know about uncertainties and operators. The uncertainty in an observable, say ΔP_z, is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, let me write that down to clarify. The state vector ψ is:

ψ = [ -1/2 ]
    [1/√2 ]
    [ -1/2 ]

Wait, but wait a second, wait. I think I should check if this state is correctly normalized. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component. 

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good, so the state is properly normalized.

Next, I need to find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is given, I can compute this by ψ† P_z ψ. Let me write out the matrix for P_z.

P_z matrix:
Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [ 0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So, to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I can perform the matrix multiplication. Let me write ψ as a column vector, then P_z ψ would be:

First component: (ħ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2.

Second component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) +0*(-1/2)= 0.

Third component: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/√2) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) )= ħ/2.

So P_z ψ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, the expectation value is ψ† times this vector. Let me compute it:

ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So the dot product is:

(-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2 * ħ/2 ) = ħ/4.

Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

Adding them: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is 0. That's straightforward.

Now, I need ⟨P_z²⟩. That's ψ† P_z² ψ.

But wait, since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So P_z² would have:

Row 1: (ħ)^2, 0, 0.

Row 2: 0, 0, 0.

Row 3: 0, 0, (-ħ)^2.

So, P_z² is:

[ ħ² , 0, 0 ]

[ 0, 0, 0 ]

[ 0, 0, ħ² ]

Wait no, wait. Because (-ħ)^2 is same as (ħ)^2, so the third diagonal element is ħ².

So, when I compute P_z² ψ, it's:

First component: ħ² * (-1/2) + 0 + 0 = -ħ²/2.

Second component: 0.

Third component: ħ² * (-1/2) = -ħ²/2.

So P_z² ψ is [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ].

Now, compute ψ† times this vector:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2).

Each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Third term: (1/2)(ħ²/2 ) = ħ²/4.

Adding them: ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²) = sqrt( ħ²/2 - 0 ) = sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check this. Because when I computed P_z ψ, I found ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so the variance is just ⟨P_z²⟩.

Yes, because in this case, ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, so the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩).

But let me think again. Because P_z is diagonal in the given basis, which are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state ψ is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Hmm, but wait, no, because ψ is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, so the state ψ is expressed in the P_z basis. Therefore, the components of ψ are the coefficients when expressed in
