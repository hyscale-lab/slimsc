Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see what I can figure out.

First, the IR data. The strong bands at around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, ester, or amide. Hmm, but looking at the options, some have amides, some esters, etc.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH3 group attached to something, like an ethyl group. The triplet with 3H makes me think CH2CH3 where the CH3 is next to the CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could be an N-H or maybe an OCH2 group. But OCH2 usually is a triplet if it's attached to another CH2. Wait, but if it's a methylene group next to an electronegative atom, maybe OCH2, but why a singlet? Alternatively, maybe it's an NH2 group. But wait, in the molecular formula, there's only one N. So maybe it's an NH group as in an amide or something.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H suggests a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl ester, maybe. Because ethyl esters typically have a quartet for the OCH2 that's next to the CH3. Wait, but the quartet is at 4.5. Let me think. The triplet at 1.20 (3H) is likely the ethyl group's CH3, so the quartet at 4.5 would be the OCH2 in an ester group. So that would fit with an ester functional group.
- The aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). Two doublets each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the protons are usually split into a doublet each. So the ring has two substituents opposite each other.

Putting this together, the molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring attached to some groups. Let's consider the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, but the substituents would be OCH2CH3 and a CONH2 group. But the NMR shows aromatic protons as two doublets, which in para substitution. If the substituents are at positions 3 and another, maybe para? Not sure. But wait, 3-ethoxy would mean another substituent may be in position 3 as well? Hmm, maybe the amide is at position 1 and ethoxy at 3, making them meta to each other. But then the aromatic protons would not be just two doublets, perhaps. Or perhaps I'm wrong. Let me think again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure would be formamide where the amide N is attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the benzene ring has an ethoxy group at para position, and the formamide group (which is HCONH-R). Wait, formamide has R-NH-C(O)-H. So in this case, the benzene ring is attached to the NH, which is part of the formamide. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate that. Benzene (6 C), ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (2 O, but wait, the formamide adds another O). Wait, the molecular formula: let's count.

N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be C8H9NO2? Let me see: The benzene ring is C6H5. The ethoxy is OCH2CH3 (adds 2 carbons, so total C8). The formamide is HCONH- attached. So the molecule would be C8H9NO2? Wait, no. Let me count carefully. The benzene ring (6 C), one ethoxy (2 C), formamide is HCONH- which is another O and N. Wait, the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 would be C8H9O2. Then adding the formamide part: HCONH- attached to the benzene. So the entire molecule would be C6H5-OCH2CH2-NH-C(O)H. Wait, that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the molecular formula. C6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 2 (formamide: HCONH-) gives C10? Wait no, formamide is HCONH-R, where R is the aryl group. So the formula would be:

C6 (benzene) + C2 (ethoxy) + C1 (formamide: HCONH-) plus the rest. Wait, maybe I should calculate it properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula for option B is C9H11NO2. Let me see: Benzene (6 C) + ethoxy (2 C) + formamide group (which is HCONH-). So 6 + 2 + 1 (from formamide) = 9 C. So that fits. The H: benzene is 5 H (since one position is taken by OCH2CH3 and another by the NH group?), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should come back to that.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-, but attached to the benzene ring. So the structure is benzene with NH2 at para position and a propionoate group (CH2CH2COO-) as an ester or something? Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute: benzene (6 C) + NH2 (1N) + propionate (3 C) + O2. So 6+3=9 C. That fits. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 and an ethyl ester group (like OCH2CH3) at position 4? Wait, but the NMR shows an ethyl group (the triplet at 1.20). If it's an ester, like ethyl propionate, the OCH2CH3 would be in the NMR as a quartet around 4.5 (since the ethyl ester's OCH2 is a quartet). Which matches the NMR. But let's think about the aromatic protons. If the substituents are 4-aminophenyl and the propionate group, but wait, the substituents would be in the same position or different? Wait, in 4-aminophenyl propionate, the ester group is attached to the benzene ring. So if the amine is at position 4, and the ester is also at position 4, that would be the same position, but that's not possible. Oh wait, no, the propionate is attached as an ester. So the benzene has an amino group and a COOEt group in the para positions. Because the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which implies the amino is at position 4, and the propionate is attached at position 1? Or maybe the ester is attached to the phenyl as a COOEt group. But regardless, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, which is what the NMR shows. So that could fit.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That's the structure where the benzene has an amino group at position 4 and a benzoate ester, so the ester is attached at position 1. So the structure would be OEt attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene. So the benzoate would be O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, which also has an NH2 group in the para position. So the aromatic ring would have substituents in positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2), so they're para to each other. That makes sense for the NMR showing two doublets in the aromatic region. So the two doublets would be the protons adjacent to the substituents. So that fits.

Now, looking at the NMR data again. The triplet at 1.20 ppm is the CH3 in an ethyl group attached to an oxygen (as in OCH2CH3). The quartet at 4.5 ppm is the OCH2 in the ethyl ester. That would fit with option D, where the OCH2CH3 is part of the ester group. 

The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is 2H. That might be the NH2 group in the 4-aminobenzoate. Wait, but an NH2 group would typically show up as a broad peak, but usually around 2-5 ppm. Alternatively, could it be an OCH2 that's not split? Wait, in option D, the ester is OCH2CH3, which is a quartet at 4.5. So what about the 4.0 ppm peak? Maybe it's the NH group. Wait, in option D, the amine is NH2. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H. Wait, that doesn't make sense because NH2 would be a broad peak, maybe as a singlet, but integrating for 2 H. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the amine. 

Wait, but looking back, the 1H NMR shows:

- 1.20 (t, 3H)
- 4.0 (bs, 2H)
- 4.5 (q, 2H)
- 7.0 (d, 2H)
- 8.0 (d, 2H)

So the quartet at 4.5 is the OCH2 from the ethyl ester (as that's characteristic). The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of the ethyl group. So that fits with an ethyl ester. 

What about the 4.0 ppm peak? It's a broad singlet (bs). If the compound is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amine would be an NH2 group. But in the NMR, the 4.0 would be 2H, which doesn't fit NH2, which is a singlet but integrating for 2 H. Or maybe it's a different group. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an NH group. Wait, but in option D, the substituent is NH2. So that would be a broad peak, but I'm not sure if it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe there's another group.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again. Let me think about each option's structure and their expected NMR.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. So the substituents are ethoxy at 3 and CONH2. The aromatic protons would be in the meta positions. Wait, but the NMR shows two doublets, so the substituents are para. So this might not fit because if ethoxy is at 3 and the amide at 1, the substituents are meta, leading to more complex splitting in the aromatic region. So I think A is less likely.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Here, the formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene ring which has an ethoxy group at para. So the substituents on the benzene are OCH2CH3 and NHCOH. The aromatic protons would be adjacent to these substituents. So the ring would have two substituents in para positions, leading to two doublets in NMR. That would fit. Now, the NMR for the ethyl group would have the quartet and triplet as we have. What about the formamide group? The formamide has an NH. Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. Let me think: the formamide's NH would be a broad peak, but where? It would probably be around 8-9 ppm, but the 4.0 is a singlet for 2H. So perhaps that's not it.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is benzene with NH2 and propionate ester groups. But the propionate would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester group would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. Or perhaps it's a different structure. Wait, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be PhNH2 where Ph is benzene with NH2 and propionoate group. So the propionoate would be CH2CH2COO- attached. So the ester group would be OCH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. But then, in that case, the ethyl group (from the ester) would be OCH2CH2COO-Ph-NH2. Wait, but the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me compute: benzene (6 C) + NH2 (1 N) + propionate (3 C, including the COO-) plus an ethyl group (2 C). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is the acid and the ester is ethyl. So the structure is PhNH2-COOEt. So that would be benzene with NH2 and COOEt groups. But then, in the NMR, we have the ethyl group as quartet, which would fit. The NH2 would appear as a broad peak, maybe around 1-5 ppm. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet for 2H, which might not fit. Also, the 4.0 could be the OCH2 from the ethyl ester? No, wait, the ethyl ester's OCH2 is a quartet at 4.5. So the 4.0 ppm is a separate group. Hmm.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with NH2 and COOEt groups in para positions. The amine is NH2 attached to benzene, and the ester is COOEt. So the NMR would have the ethyl group as quartet (OCH2) at 4.5, triplet (CH3) at 1.2. The amine is NH2; in the NMR, it's broad, but the integration is 2H. But in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet (bs) for 2H. So that doesn't add up because the amine would be a broad peak but probably at a higher ppm, maybe around 5 ppm or so. Alternatively, maybe the NH2 is deprotonated, but that's unlikely in the given conditions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about the NMR data. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That could be an NH group, but in which option is there an NH group? Looking at the options:

- A: Benzamide has NH2. So the amide protons would be around 6-8 ppm, maybe as a broad peak. But the NMR doesn't show that.

- B: Formamide has an NH. It would show up as a singlet around 8 ppm maybe, but the 4.0 is lower.

- C: 4-aminophenyl propionate has NH2. So the amine would be a broad peak around 1-5 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 is a singlet for 2H. So maybe this is the amine?

Wait, but the integration is 2H. So in that case
