Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think aloud.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then, it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I have to determine the final product from the options given.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's break this down. Carbon is 8, hydrogen is 9, nitrogen is 1, oxygen is 1. Hmm, molecular weight-wise, that's okay. I'll try to figure out the structure from the NMR data.

The 1H NMR data provided is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm: triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton or something deshielded like an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe this is an aldehyde group (-CHO). But wait, looking at the coupling: it's a triplet. Aldehydes usually have a singlet because they're at the end of the chain with no adjacent protons. So maybe it's not an aldehyde then. Could it be an aromatic group with adjacent protons, like in a conjugated system? Or maybe an acidic proton like from a phenol, but phenol protons are around 5-7 ppm, so maybe not. Hmm, perhaps it's a triplet because it's coupling with two other protons. Like maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like an enal (alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde). Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and don't have much splitting. Hmm, maybe I'll put a pin in that.

Next peak: 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests two equivalent protons, maybe on adjacent carbons. So maybe two protons on ortho positions of a ring. Alternatively, perhaps part of a conjugated system like an enal.

Then 6.51 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Also aromatic. Another set of two protons, perhaps para to each other or part of another group.

6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Hmm, broad suggests maybe some exchange, like an alcohol proton. Or maybe it's a triplet or something else. But 2H as a singlet... Maybe two equivalent protons in a di-substituted aromatic ring, but not sure yet. Wait, another possibility: maybe these are the protons on a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like part of an enol or something. Or perhaps they're adjacent to an electronegative group.

Then 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This is a medium chemical shift, perhaps for some CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2, like an ether or ester. But the split is a doublet, so maybe adjacent to another CH2 or perhaps adjacent to something else.

Let me try to piece this together. The molecule probably has an aromatic ring, perhaps two of them. The 6.98 and 6.51 peaks could be from two different aromatic rings. For example, maybe two benzene rings where each has two substituents. Alternatively, maybe each ring is para-substituted with another group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. Each ring is one, each double bond or triple bond is another. So probably one ring (benzene, 3 degrees) plus another ring or double bonds. Wait, wait: Benzene is three degrees, so if there are two benzene rings, that's 6 degrees. But the molecule only has five. So that can't be. So maybe one benzene ring (three degrees) and a double bond (one degree) and another ring? Or perhaps another structure.

Wait, maybe it's not two benzene rings. Let me think. Another possibility: a benzene ring (3), a double bond (1), and a ring or another double bond. But 3+1+1=5, so that works. So perhaps a benzene ring, a double bond, and another ring, like a cyclopropane? Or perhaps a carbonyl group.

Wait, the aldehyde group would be a double
