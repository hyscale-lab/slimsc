Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that an organic chemist does two reactions. Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH, followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and then an acidic workup. After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each will show.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out what each reaction produces first.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure is a six-carbon chain with a ketone at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So, the compound is (S) configuration at the chiral center, I guess, since it's a ketone.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, I think Reaction I would reduce the ketone. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, the ketone (at C3) becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, but wait. LAH is a strong reducing agent. Does it affect the methoxy group? Methoxy is an electron-rich group, but I don't think LAH typically reduces ethers. Ethers usually require stronger conditions than LAH, like maybe something with more acidic protons or more vigorous conditions. So I think the methoxy group stays as is.

So Reaction I's product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a secondary alcohol with a methoxy group on carbon 5. Is that a chiral center? Let's see. Carbon 5: attached groups are CH2CH2OH (no, wait. Wait, the structure is hexan-3-one, which is CH2CH2CO.... Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, maybe it's CH3CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3. So carbon 3 is the ketone. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the 5-methoxy group is on carbon 5, which is the fifth carbon. So numbering from the ketone (position 3), the chain is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH-OCH3
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3. So positions 1 through 6: 1 is CH3, 2 is CH2, 3 is C=O, 4 is CH2, 5 is CH2, 6 is CH3. But in this case, it's 5-methoxy, so the fifth carbon (CH2) becomes CH-OCH3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right because hexan-3-one only has 6 carbons. Let me clarify.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3? That's not correct. Let me think: For hexan-3-one, the carbonyl is on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's seven carbons. Oh wait, no, hexan means six carbons. So it's:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O (so, (CH2)2CO)
Then, carbons 4,5,6: so perhaps it's (CH2)2CO-(CH2)2-CH3.

But wait, in 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the fifth carbon has a methoxy group. So in carbon 5, which is a CH2 in the original hexan-3-one, it's substituted with OCH3.

So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O
