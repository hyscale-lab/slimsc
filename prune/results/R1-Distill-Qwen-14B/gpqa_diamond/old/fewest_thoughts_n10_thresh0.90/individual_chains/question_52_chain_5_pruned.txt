Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

Alright, the problem says that there's a star with certain characteristics. The radius is 1.5 solar radii and the mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without any dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Hmm, wait, so the spots are making the star cooler overall. I guess that's because the spots are darker, meaning they emit less light, so when a significant portion of the surface is spotted, the average temperature drops. Okay.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. So when the star has spots, the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases. The question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when there are no spots compared to when there are.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. And it's noted that the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which means we can use the Boltzmann equation for this calculation.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula I remember is:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number of atoms in the two energy levels,
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of each level,
- E2 and E1 are the energies of the levels,
- k is Boltzmann's constant,
- T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but the problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when there are no spots, the temperature is higher (6000 K), and when there are spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So, higher temperature leads to a higher ratio?

Wait, let me think again. The ratio n1/n2 depends on temperature. Because the energy difference ΔE = E2 - E1. If ΔE is positive (E2 higher), then as T increases, exp(-ΔE/(kT)) decreases, so n2/n1 increases. So as T increases, n2/n1 increases, meaning n1/n2 decreases. So when the star has spots, the Teff is lower (5500 K), so the ratio n1/n2 would be higher compared to when the star is spotless.

Wait, but the problem says that when there are spots, the observed ratio decreases. Hmm, so let me re-express the ratio. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2. So that's n1/n2.
