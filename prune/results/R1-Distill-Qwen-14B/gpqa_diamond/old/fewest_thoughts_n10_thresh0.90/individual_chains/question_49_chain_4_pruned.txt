Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. So, I think these reactions involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. Wait, the question says that in sigmatropic rearrangements, the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Oh right, like the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. Those are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts, I think.

The problem has three parts (A, B, C), each involving a reaction under heat and sometimes H+. I need to figure out the products for each and match them with the options given.

Let me start with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A.

Hmm, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2OH. Oh, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be: the structure would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, the but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but but has four carbons, so but-3-en-2-ol should be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me write it out. But-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is at position 3, so the structure is CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would be: CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, but but is four carbons, so positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond between C3 and C4 is not possible for a butene. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? No, wait, the OH is on C2. So structure: CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, no, but but-3-en-2-ol should be CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, that can't be because but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond at position 3, which would be between C3 and C4. But but has only
