Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And they're asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r. The options are A to D, each a different power of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the inverse of distance in parsecs, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if I have a function that depends on 1/plx^5, that would be plx^(-5), which is (1/d)^(-5) = d^5. Wait, but wait, the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5. So number of stars N is proportional to d^5?

But wait, the question is about how the number changes per unit distance. So they're probably asking about the derivative, like the rate of change with respect to r. Because per unit range of distance r, so it's the change in N for a small change in r.

So if N is proportional to d^5, then the derivative dN/dr is 5*d^4. But wait, I should double-check the relationship between parallax and distance.

Parallax plx is in arcseconds. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases. So when they say N varies as 1/plx^5, that's the same as N ∝ plx^(-5). Substituting plx = 1/d, N becomes proportional to (1/d)^-5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. 

Now, the number of stars per unit distance. So if N is the total number of stars in a region up to distance d, then the number of stars per unit distance would be dN/dr. Let me think about that.

Wait, wait a second. If N is the number of stars within a distance d, then dN/dr is the number of stars in the thin shell between d and d+dr. So dN/dr is the rate of stars per unit distance. So if N ∝ d^5, then dN/dr = 5 d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance would be proportional
