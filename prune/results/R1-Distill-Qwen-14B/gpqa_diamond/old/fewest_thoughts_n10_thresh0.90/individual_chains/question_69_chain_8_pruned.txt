Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. I need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. Oh right, time dilation from special relativity. So the observed lifetime τ is γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So first, I need to calculate γ. But to find γ, I need the velocity or the Lorentz factor. The Lorentz factor γ is equal to E/(m c²), right? Because the total energy E is γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²).

Wait, but let's make sure. The energy given is 27 GeV. The mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So E = 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So γ = E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that.

27 divided by 3.41. Hmm, 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is about 27.28. Oh, wait, 27 is a little less than 3.41 * 8. So 27 /3.41 ≈ 7.91. So approximately 7.91. So γ is about 7.91.

But wait, is E the total energy or just the kinetic energy? Oh, the problem says the energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV. I think in particle physics, when they say the energy of the particle, it's usually the total energy, not just kinetic. So yeah, E is 27 GeV, so γ is 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91.

So the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. Let's compute that. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 = approx 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is longer because of time dilation. So the particles live longer in the lab frame, which means they can travel a longer distance before decaying.

The next part is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So the question is about the minimum detectable length, I think. Because the particles move, and if they decay, the decay products will show up at a certain position in the bubble chamber. If the chamber can't resolve positions closer than a certain length, you won't see the decay correctly.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So the lifetime determines how far the particle can travel before decaying. The average lifetime in lab frame is τ. So the average distance the particle moves before decaying is c * τ. But wait, actually, the mean distance L is c * τ. Because distance is speed times time, and the speed is close to c for high-energy particles.

But wait, in reality, the lifetime is τ, so the average distance is L = β c τ. Oh right! Because the particle is moving at velocity v ≈ c, but β = v/c. So the proper formula is L = β c τ.

Wait, but I have γ and I have E. I can find β in terms of γ as well. Because γ = 1/sqrt(1 - β²). So β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)}. Let me calculate that.

Given γ is about 7.91, so 1/γ² is about 1/(62.56) = approx 0.016. So 1 - 0.016 = 0.984. sqrt(0.984) is about 0.992. So β is approximately 0.992. Close to 1, which makes sense because the energy is much higher than the rest mass.

So L = β c τ = (0.992) * (3e8 m/s) * (6.328e-15 s).

Let me compute that: 0.992 * 3e8 = approx 2.976e8 m/s. Multiply by 6.328e-15 s:

2.976e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s = 2.976 * 6.328e-7 m.

Compute 2.976 * 6.328: 3 * 6 is 18, 0.976 *6≈5.856, so 3*6.328 is 18.984, and 0.976 * 6.328 is about 6.17. So total is about 25.154. Multiply by 1e-7: 25.154e-7 m = 2.5154e-6 meters.

Wait, but wait, the problem is asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, so perhaps that means we need to capture the decay points so that the track can be distinguished. So perhaps we need to have a detection system that can resolve a distance equal to about 30% of the average decay length? Or perhaps a different approach.

Wait, maybe another way. The decay probability is given by the exponential decay formula: N(t) = N0 e^{-t/τ}. The probability of decaying before time t is 1 - e^{-t/τ}.

But in this case, the question is about the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the minimum distance the detector can resolve. So perhaps the decay length should be at least some multiple of the resolution for the decay to be observed.

Wait, perhaps the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying is the mean decay length. But to observe the decay, the detector must be able to see the displacement. So the minimum resolution should be such that the particle's decay is detected; perhaps the resolution needs to be less than the average decay length so that the decay can be observed.

Wait, but if the resolution is the smallest detectable displacement, then if the decay length is longer than the resolution, you can see the decay. So perhaps the minimum resolution is equal to the decay length, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the concept is about the proper lifetime and time resolution. Wait, but the question is about spatial resolution.

Wait, perhaps the proper approach is to calculate the average decay length, and then determine what fraction of that length is needed for the detector to resolve at least 30% of the decays.

Wait, no, the question is about the minimum resolution (spatial) so that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So maybe it's about the time it takes for the particle to decay, and the time resolution of the detector.

Wait, but no, the question is about spatial resolution. I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, the decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So if the detector can resolve particles that decayed at least a certain distance away, then the minimum resolution is such that particles have to decay beyond that point to be detected.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps we need to find the length where 30% of the particles have decayed beyond that length. Alternatively, maybe the minimum resolution R is such that
