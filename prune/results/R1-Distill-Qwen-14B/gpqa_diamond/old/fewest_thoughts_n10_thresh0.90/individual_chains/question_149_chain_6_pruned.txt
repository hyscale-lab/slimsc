Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question here about a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, I need to figure out what's going on with the observations made.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum has two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Wait, if it's the same alpha-proton but two peaks, maybe it's because of some kind of splitting. But the coupling is ruled out, so it's not about neighboring protons. Maybe it's about the environment of the proton. Like, maybe there's some kind of exchange happening or the molecule is in different conformations. But exchange would usually lead to a singlet or broad peaks, I think, not two distinct peaks.

Oh, the options are given. Let me read the options again. Option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling sounds like maybe some kind of isomerization where the proton has two different coupling partners, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Hmm, not sure about that.

Another option is B: enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so their NMR spectra would be the same, right? Because the environment is the same, so the protons would have the same shift. So if it's a racemic mixture, you wouldn't see two separate peaks for the same proton because they're identical in the NMR. So that might not explain the two peaks. Unless... wait, maybe it's not about the same proton. No, wait, the question says both peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So in the case of enantiomers, each would have the same protons, so the NMR would look the same. So maybe that's not the answer.

Option D: mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. So in the NMR, their protons would have different shifts. So if the alpha-proton is in different environments, you might get two peaks. But the chemical shifts are similar, so maybe the diastereomers are similar. Like, maybe the diastereomers are enantiomers? No, wait, enantiomers are a type of diastereomer when there are stereocenters. So if the molecule has multiple stereocenters, some might be wrong. But the question says the NMR has two peaks for the same proton. If the molecule exists as a mixture of diastereomers, each with a different environment for that alpha-proton, their shifts would be slightly different. So maybe that's it.

But wait, the integrals are equal and add up to 1H. So each peak is integrating to 0.5H each. So maybe each diastereomer has one alpha proton, but because of the mixture, each contributes equally. Or perhaps each diastereomer has the same number of protons, but different shifts.

Alternatively, the LC-MS shows two peaks with same mass. So same molecular weight. So the same molecular formula? So the same compound, but in different forms. Maybe different diastereomers, which would have different retention times but same mass.

So, if the NMR shows two different peaks for the same proton, but same integration, that suggests two different environments but same number of protons. So that's pointing towards diastereomers. Because enantiomers would not cause different shifts for the same proton; their shifts would be same in NMR.

Wait, but another thought: maybe it's due to tautomerism. Like, the compound can exist in two different tautomeric forms, each with the same mass, but different proton environments. But in that case, the shifts would be different, and the integrals would add to 1H if each form has one proton. But I'm not sure if that's more likely than diastereomers.

Looking back at the options, D is diastereoisomers. So which is more likely?

Also, the 1H NMR shows same integration but two peaks. So each is 0.5H, which suggests each is present in equal amounts. So if you have a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers, each would contribute 0.5H to the integral. But why would the same alpha-proton have two different shifts in diastereomers? Because the diastereomers have different spatial arrangements, so the environment around that proton is different.

So for example, if the molecule has two stereocenters, and the wrong configuration at one, that would lead to diastereomers. The same alpha-proton would be in different environments, leading to different shifts.

So the NMR would show two peaks, same integral, similar shifts. And the LC-MS would show two peaks, same mass, because same molecular weight. So that fits.

Another thought: Option A says precursor contamination. If the compound is contaminated with its precursor, the peaks would have different masses. But the question says LC-MS shows same mass. So that's not it.

Option C: double coupling during amide formation. I'm not too familiar with that term. Maybe it's about the amide coupling leading to some kind of isomer? Or perhaps if two different amide bonds formed, but that seems less likely. Or maybe it's about some kind of coupling leading to a double bond. But not sure. Also, the question rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause, so it's probably not that.

So putting it all together, the most likely explanation is that the compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. So answer D.


The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts, equal integrals (
