Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating, so it's radiating. The maximum power is A, and I need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees. Also, the function f's form is part of the options.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The power radiated depends on the solid angle and the frequency or wavelength. Oh, and for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is typically a certain shape.

So, the spheroidal shape probably means it's a dipole antenna or something similar. Dipole radiation has a maximum at θ = 90 degrees, I think, because the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the axis. So the maximum power would be along the equator, so at θ=90, the power is maximum. But wait, the question says the maximum power is A, so maybe A is the maximum value of the function f.

Wait, the function f is the radiated power per unit solid angle. So f is a function of λ and θ. So f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle, and A is the maximum of f. So the total power would be the integral of f over all solid angles, but the question isn't about that.

We need the fraction of A that is radiated at θ=30 degrees. So we're looking for f(30)/A.

Hmm, what's the form of f? I think for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern in the far zone (radiation zone) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) depends on the angle θ. The formula I remember is something like:

I(θ) = (something) * (1/(λ²)) * sin²θ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Because for a dipole, the radiation is maximum at θ=90 degrees (sinθ=1), and minimum at θ=0 and 180 (sinθ=0). So the intensity is maximum there.

So then, the function f would be proportional to sin²θ, but multiplied by some function of λ. Wait, but the problem says f is a function of λ and θ. So the form of f would probably include some λ dependence.

Wait, the power radiated is also dependent on the frequency or wavelength. Since the oscillation is at a wavelength λ, I think the power per unit solid angle would have a dependence on 1/λ^something.

Wait, let's recall the formula for the radiated power from an oscillating dipole. The average power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by P = ( (μ₀ μ₀) (e² a² ω^4) )/(12π c³) ), or something like that. But I might be mixing up the exact formula.

Alternatively, the power radiated per unit solid angle (intensity) is given by I(θ) = ( (μ₀ μ₀) (e² a² ω^4 sin²θ) ) )/(12π c³) ), but I'm not certain about the exact factors.

Wait, but I know that the intensity (power per unit area per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, and the amplitude depends on the frequency (ω, which is related to λ).

The intensity I is proportional to (ω²) (something with λ?), but wait, ω is 2πc/λ, so ω² would be (4π²c²)/λ². Wait, but the intensity also depends on the frequency's square.

Hmm, but the problem is about the form of f. The options give possible forms for f, with some λ dependence.

Wait, the question says "the function f of λ and θ" and the options give forms like λ^(-4) or λ^(-3), so I need to figure out what the dependence is.

Wait, for an electric dipole radiator, the radiated electric field in the far zone is E ~ (e^{i(kr - ωt)} ) / r, and the intensity (which is proportional to E^2) would go as (1/r)^2. But the exact dependence on λ would come from the dependence on ω. Since ω = 2πc/λ, so ω is inversely proportional to λ.

Wait, but the intensity also depends on the square of the dipole moment and the square of the frequency.

Wait, the formula for the intensity (power per unit area) from a dipole is I(θ) = ( (μ₀ μ₀) (p₀² ω^4 sin²θ) ) / (12π c³) ), where p₀ is the dipole moment amplitude.

Since ω = 2π c / λ, ω^4 is (2π c)^4 / λ^4. So, substituting in, I(θ) is proportional to (1/λ^4) * sin²θ.

So, the function f would have a form like f(θ) = k * sin²θ / λ^4, where k is some constant. So the function f would be proportional to sin²θ multiplied by λ^(-4). So looking at the options, the form should be λ^(-4), which appears in options A and C.

Now, the question is, what is the fraction of the maximum power (A) that is radiated at θ=30 degrees.

The maximum power occurs when sinθ is maximum. Since sinθ is maximum at θ=90°, which is 1. So the maximum f would be when sinθ is 1, so f_max = k * 1 / λ^4, which is A. Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A, so A = f(θ=90°).

We need to find f(θ=30°) / A.

Well, f(30°) would be k * sin^2(30°) / λ^4. Sin(30) is 0.5, so sin² is 0.25. So f(30) = 0.25 k / λ^4.

But A = f(90) = k / λ^4.

So the fraction is f(30)/A = (0.25 k / λ^4) / (k / λ^4) ) = 0.25. So 25% of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees.

Wait, but wait a minute. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. To find the fraction of the total power, you have to integrate over all solid angles. Oh wait, no, the question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30°". So it's the fraction of the maximum power that is at that angle. So it's f(30) compared to the maximum f.

So, if the maximum f is A, then the fraction is (f(30)/A) = 0.25.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^(-4).

Looking back at the options:

Option C says 1/4 and λ^-4. Option B has 1/4 but λ^-3. So the form is λ^-4, which matches option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. The function f is the power per unit solid angle. The maximum is at θ=90°, which would be f_max = A. So when we look at f(θ=30°), it's (1/4) of A.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the form is λ^-4. So the correct answer would be option C.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution that radiates power, with the maximum power denoted as \( A \). The goal is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and identify the form of the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), which represents the radiated power per unit solid angle.

For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far zone is well-known. The power radiated per unit solid angle (intensity) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \), with additional dependence on the wavelength \( \lambda \). Specifically, the intensity \( I(\theta) \) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta / \lambda^4 \), where the \( \lambda^{-4} \) dependence arises from the relationship between frequency \( \omega \) and wavelength \( \lambda \) (\( \omega = 2\pi c / \lambda \)).

The maximum power \( A \) occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin\theta = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2\theta = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is:

\[
\frac{f(30^\circ)}{A} = \frac{0.25}{1} = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

The form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta / \lambda^4 \), which matches the \( \lambda^{-4} \) dependence in the options. Therefore, the correct answer combines a fraction of \( 1/4 \) and a \( \lambda^{-4} \) dependence.

From the given options:
- Option A: \( 1/2, \lambda^{-4} \) (incorrect fraction)
- Option B: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-3} \) (incorrect \( \lambda \) dependence)
- Option C: \( 1/4, \lambda^{-4} \) (correct)
- Option D: \( 3/4, \lambda^{-6} \) (incorrect fraction and \( \lambda \) dependence)

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
