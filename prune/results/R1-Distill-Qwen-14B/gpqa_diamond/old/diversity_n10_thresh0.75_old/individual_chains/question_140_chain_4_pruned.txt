Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. A precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. X is a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a very close analog.

Hmm. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29. So the sum of the lightest and heaviest elements in X's composition.

Alright, breaking this down. Let's start with what each part could mean.

First, the reaction of X with Y. Violent reaction usually suggests something like a metal reacting with an acid, maybe? Or another strong reaction like a carbonate reacting with acid. But Y is a liquid, so maybe it's an acid like HCl or something else.

The gas W released has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule of W has equal protons and neutrons. That makes me think of H2O or something else. Wait, wait. Let's think about the possible gases. If W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, each molecule. So for a molecule, the total protons are the sum of protons of each atom in it, same with neutrons. So if it's H2O, each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (assuming lightest isotopes), O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So H2O would have 2*1 + 8 = 10 protons and 2*0 + 8 =8 neutrons. Oh, not equal. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe it's CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, O has 8. So CO2 would have 6 + 2*8 =22 protons. Neutrons: Carbon's isotope would have 6, oxygen has 8 each, so 6 + 2*8 =22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. Wait, that would make it 22 each. But wait, that's only if the isotopes are specific. For example, if the oxygen is ^16O, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So in CO2, each O is ^16O. Then, total protons: 6 + 8*2=22. Total neutrons: 6 (from ^12C?) Wait, no, wait. Carbon is usually ^12C (6 protons, 6 neutrons), so each O is ^16O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O)=22. Oh! So yes,
