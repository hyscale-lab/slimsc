Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on some quantum numbers. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the question says we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state, and they emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm not entirely sure I understand that equation. Oh right, T is the isospin, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So T has to equal S + L plus 1, modulo 2. So if T is 0, then 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. That simplifies to S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity; one even, the other odd.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So for that state, S and L must add up to 1 mod 2, meaning their sum is odd. So either S is even and L is odd, or S is odd and L is even.

The problem gives four options, each representing a transition from the initial state 1S0 to a different state plus a particle. The options are labeled A to D, each ending with a letter (p, s, f, etc.) which denotes the angular momentum state of X. I think p stands for l=1 (P state), s for l=0 (S), d for l=2 (D), f for l=3 (F), etc.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would have S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L=0 (since it's S), and J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the NN pair goes into a new state with some T, S, L, and so on. But according to the question, the final NN state has T=0, so as per the equation, S + L must be odd.

Additionally, parity must be conserved. Parity for the NN system: well, the initial parity is for the 1S0 state. Parity is given by (-1)^(L) for orbital angular momentum. But wait, what about the isospin? Hmm, isospin might affect parity, but I'm not too sure. Wait, the intrinsic parity of the emitted particle is given as -1. So the parity of the entire system should be considered.

Wait, parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The overall parity of the system after emission would be the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X. But wait, the initial state has a parity as well. Let me think: the initial parity is from the 1S0 state. Since L=0, the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

After emitting X, the system's parity P' is equal to the initial parity multiplied by the parity of X. Because when a particle is emitted, the parity of the new system (the two nucleons) would have to consider X's parity. Or is it the parity of the entire three-particle system? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, the problem says that the parity is conserved. Oh wait, no. Because when a particle is emitted, the parity might change. The initial parity is the parity of the NN system, and the final state would be the parity of the NN plus X. So parity conservation would require that the product of the initial parity and the parity of X equals the final parity of the NN system. Wait, not sure.

Wait, the problem
