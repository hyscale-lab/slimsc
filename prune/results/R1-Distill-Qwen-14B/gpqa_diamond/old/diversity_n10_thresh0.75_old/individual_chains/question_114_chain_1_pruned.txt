Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully. Let's read the question again.

The problem has two reaction steps. The first reaction uses butan-2-one (which is methylacetone, I think) with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction takes 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, adds reagent B (which is H2O), and forms 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

The question is about choosing the correct reagents A and B from the given options. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing different reagents.

First, I'll tackle the first reaction. The starting material is butan-2-one. Structure-wise, that's (CH3)2CO. So it's a ketone. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is CN. The molecule is something like CH2CH(CN)CH2OH? Wait, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, butanenitrile would be CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN is added, it's probably a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN with reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, but wait, when you add a nitrile group to a ketone, typically, it would be a nucleophilic addition. So the mechanism would be: the ketone (butan-2-one) reacts with a cyanide ion (from NaCN) in a nucleophilic addition.

But then, after addition, how does the product form? Let me think. The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a hydroxy nitrile. 

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. Because in
