Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

First, let's break down the information. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The ring is 6-membered, so benzene is the base structure.

The total number of carbons is 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents add up to 2 carbons. Wait, but wait, no. Wait, di-substituted benzene: benzene (6) plus two substituents, each with some carbons. So the substituents together contribute 2 carbons? Or is that a miscalculation.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The compound's molecular formula isn't given, but the total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents have 2 carbons in total. But wait, maybe each substituent has one carbon. Because di-substituted usually has two groups attached to the ring.

So each substituent is probably a single carbon group. Hmm. But the substituent could be a carbonyl (like
