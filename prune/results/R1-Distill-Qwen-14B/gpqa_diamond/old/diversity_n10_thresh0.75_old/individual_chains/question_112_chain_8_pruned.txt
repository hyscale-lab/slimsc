Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that we have an electron in a state |alpha⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think means they're the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis. So, the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator whose matrix has elements A_ij. The matrix A is such that A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of this operator.

Hmm. Okay, so I need to break this down into steps. Let's tackle each part step by step.

First, the state |alpha⟩ is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, maybe I should normalize this state first. Because when we're dealing with quantum states, they need to be normalized so that the probabilities add up to 1.

So, the state can be written as |alpha⟩ = a|up> + b|down>, where a = (1+i) and b = (2-i). To normalize, I need to find the normalization factor, which is 1/sqrt(|a|² + |b|²). Let's compute |a|² and |b|².

|a|² is |1+i|². The magnitude squared of a complex number (x + iy) is x² + y². So, (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Similarly, |b|² is |2 - i|². That's (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(2+5) = 1/sqrt(7). Thus, the actual state |alpha⟩ is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2-i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the problem says it's proportional to that, so we don't have to worry about the normalization for the probabilities since probabilities are based on squared magnitudes regardless of the overall factor. Or wait, no, because the actual state has to be normalized. So, perhaps I should calculate the probabilities without the normalization, but probably the question expects us to normalize first.

Wait, but when you measure in a certain basis, the probability is the squared magnitude of the coefficient of that basis state. So for the z-basis (|up> and |down>), the probabilities would be |a|² and |b|², but scaled by the normalization factor.

Wait, let me think. The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, but it's proportional to that. The actual state must be normalized, so perhaps |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> divided by sqrt(2 +5) = sqrt(7). So the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2-i)/sqrt(7). So the probabilities for measuring up and down are |a|^2 and |b|^2, respectively. 

So let's compute that. |a|^2 is (1+i)(1-i)/7 = (1 +1)/7 = 2/7. Similarly, |b|² is (2-i)(2+i)/7 = (4 +1)/7 =5/7. So the probabilities are 2/7 ≈ 0.2857 and 5/7 ≈ 0.7143. These numbers are approximately 0.28 and 0.72, which I see in option C as 0.28 and 0.72. But wait, the question is about another operator, not the z-spin. So I can't directly use these probabilities. Oh wait, no, the first part of the question is about the probability of measuring the eigenstates of the operator A.

Ah, right. So the first part is to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of the operator A. Then, the second part is to find the average value of A.

So, operator A has a
