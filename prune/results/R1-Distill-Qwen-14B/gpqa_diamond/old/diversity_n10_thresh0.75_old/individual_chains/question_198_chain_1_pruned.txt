Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-) ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, okay, so I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable because it's more product-favored. The complexes here are Co(SCN)_n^2−n, I think. So n can be 1 to 4.

Wait, the blue dithiocyanato complex is probably Co(SCN)₂^0, but I'm not entirely sure. Or maybe it's a different charge. Wait, the complexes are Co(n) with n SCN- ligands. So the general formula would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2-n), because each SCN- is -1, and Co^2+.

So for n=1: [Co(SCN)]^+ (charge 2+ + (-1) = +1)
n=2: [Co(SCN)_2]^0
n=3: [Co(SCN)_3]^-
n=4: [Co(SCN)_4]^2-

The stability constants β are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, so β1 is for the first complex, which would be [Co(SCN)]^+. β2 is for the second, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, and so on.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing because β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. So the most stable complex is β3=63, which is the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex, right? So that would be the major species if everything else is equal, but in this problem, we have to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the n=2 case, right?

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complex. I think in some cases, the different complexes have different colors. For example, the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- is usually blue, but I'm not entirely certain. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^0, which is the dithiocyanato. Or maybe [Co(SCN)_3]^- is another color. Hmm. But regardless, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I'll take as n=2, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

So, I think the approach here is to calculate
