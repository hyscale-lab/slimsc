Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. Alright, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and figuring out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm.

Let me read the problem again. So, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Options are given for relative speed and total energy.

Wait, the first thing I need to find is the relative speed between the two astronauts. I remember that when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, we can't just subtract their velocities like we do in classical mechanics. We need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, because in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly.

So the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the relative velocity of astronaut A (2m, speed v1=0.6c) as seen from astronaut B (3m, speed v2=0.5c) would be (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/c²). But wait, since both are moving in the same direction, from B's frame, A's velocity is v1 - v2, but divided by that relativistic factor.

Let me plug in the numbers. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So their difference is 0.1c. But the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²). Let me compute that denominator. 0.6*0.5 is 0.3, multiplied by c²/c² is 0.3. So denominator is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So v_rel is 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Which is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, option C and D have 0.14c as the relative velocity. So that's a start.

Next, the total energy of the system. I need to calculate the total relativistic energy of both astronauts and sum them
