Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. I remember that e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, the problem says the charges are 2e, so each is 3.2e-19 C.

So, there are 12 charges constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electrostatic potential energy. Right, because these are charges interacting with each other. For a system of charges, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them one by one, bringing each from infinity to their final positions.

But wait, in this case, all the 12 charges are at a fixed distance from point P, which is where the 13th charge is. So, maybe I need to calculate the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge, and then maybe the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. Hmm, but the way the question is phrased, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2m from P. So, the 12 are all at 2m from P, which is where the 13th is located. So, each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th.

So, the total potential energy of the system would be the sum of the potential energies between each of the 12 charges and the 13th charge, plus the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. The 12 charges are all at the same point (they're constrained to stay at 2m from P but maybe all at the same point, or maybe in a spherical shell? Or maybe each located at 2m from P but arranged in some way. Wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but it doesn't specify their positions relative to each other. Hmm, but for
