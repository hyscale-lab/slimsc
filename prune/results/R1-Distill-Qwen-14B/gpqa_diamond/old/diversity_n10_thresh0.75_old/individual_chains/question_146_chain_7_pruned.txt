Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again: 5-fluorocyclopenta-1,3-diene is reacted with maleic anhydride. What's the major product?

Hmm, I remember that when dienes react with maleic anhydride, it's usually a Diels-Alder reaction. Oh wait, wait, Diels-Alder is between a diene and a dienophile. So the diene here is cyclopenta-1,3-diene, and the dienophile is maleic anhydride. 

But wait, the cyclopentadiene is substituted with a fluorine at position 5. Let me draw the structure. The cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No wait, wait, cyclopenta-1,3-diene has two double bonds? No, wait, no: 1,3-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. Wait, but cyclopentadiene is usually 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring. So that's the diene part.

So the structure is a cyclopentene ring with two double bonds, but wait no, wait, cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait,
