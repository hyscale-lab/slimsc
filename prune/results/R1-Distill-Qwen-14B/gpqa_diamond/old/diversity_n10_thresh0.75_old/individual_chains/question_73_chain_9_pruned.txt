Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds and figuring out their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at relativistic speeds, you can't just add them normally like you would in classical mechanics. Instead, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, right, the formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, I should make sure about the directions. Both astronauts are moving in the positive x-direction, so if I want to find the relative speed of one from the other's frame, I think I subtract the smaller velocity from the larger one. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from B's frame, A's speed should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c*0.5c)/(c²)). Let me calculate that denominator first.

Wait, the denominator becomes 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. The numerator is 0.1c. So 0.1c / 0.7 = approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So the relative speed is around 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel=0.14c, so I can narrow down to those.

Next, I need to find the total energy of the system. The total energy in relativity includes both kinetic and rest mass energy. Each astronaut has their own rest mass, and their energies would be their relativistic energies.

Wait, the problem says their masses are 2m and 3m. So each has a rest mass, and their total energy is gamma * m c². So for astronaut A, his energy is gamma_A * (2m) * c², and astronaut B is gamma_B * (3m) * c².

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute gamma for each.

For A: v = 0.6c. So v²/c² = 0.36. 1 -
