Okay, so I've got this science question here about the redshift of hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. It's the transition from the first energy level to the second, right? So it's in the ultraviolet range.

But wait, quasars emit a lot of light, and if there's hydrogen in front of them, the hydrogen absorbs certain wavelengths. So when we observe quasars, sometimes we see absorption lines where certain wavelengths are missing because they were absorbed by intervening material. In this case, the hydrogen clouds are causing absorption at 1216 Angstroms.

Now the question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right, redshift (z) affects the wavelength we observe. The formula I remember is observed wavelength lambda_obs = lambda_emit * (1 + z). 

So if the emitted wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and we're trying to see this absorption in the optical range. Wait, optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, which is roughly 400-700 nm, or 4000-7000 Angstroms. So the absorbed light must shift into this range.

But wait, the original Lyman alpha is in the UV, so for ground-based telescopes, which can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it, they can't observe 1216 Angstroms directly. So the absorption must shift into the optical. Therefore, the quasar's light must be redshifted such that the 1216 Angstrom absorption line moves into the optical.

So, I can set up the equation: lambda_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). And lambda_obs has to be within the optical range, say around 4000 Angstroms or higher (since 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is violet, and optical goes up to 7000 Angstroms, which is red).

Wait, but what's the minimum redshift needed
