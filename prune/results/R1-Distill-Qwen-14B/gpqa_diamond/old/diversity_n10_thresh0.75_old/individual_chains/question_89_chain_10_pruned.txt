Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step. I've studied some reaction mechanisms and spectroscopy, so maybe I can piece this together.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down what each step does and what the products might be.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) are treated with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically forming an alkene via an E2 mechanism. But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't a vicinal dihalide; the bromines are on carbons 1 and 3. Oh wait, wait—adamantane is a diamondoid structure, right? So each carbon is connected in a way that's very rigid. So 1 and 3 are not adjacent; perhaps the structure is such that each Br is on a bridgehead. Hmm, maybe the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene between the two bridgehead carbons. But wait, can that happen? Bridgehead alkenes are not very stable due to Bredt's rule, which says that alkenes can't be on bridgehead positions in bicyclic systems unless the ring is large enough. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane structure, so a bridgehead double bond might not be possible. So maybe instead, the reaction forms a ketone?

Wait, no. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base, so maybe it's an elimination reaction trying to form a double bond. But if that's not possible due to Bredt's rule, perhaps it would instead go through a different pathway. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but if the double bond isn't possible, maybe some kind of rearrangement happens. Oh wait, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but that's more about amides. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 mechanism where the hydrogen is removed from a position that allows the double bond to form elsewhere, but I'm not so sure.

Wait, the product is a light yellow solid. The NMR data for product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which is likely an -OH group or perhaps an ether. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), like a ketone or ester. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide? Or a ketone. Alternatively, if KOH is a base, perhaps it's dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene? But wait, the IR peak is at 1720 cm-1, which is more like a carbonyl, so maybe it's a ketone.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane when heated with KOH could be undergoing a double elimination, but perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead. Wait, perhaps each bromide is on a bridgehead carbon, so when KOH abstracts a β-hydrogen, perhaps it leads to the formation of an exocyclic double bond. But bridgehead double bonds are not allowed. Oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure with four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So maybe the elimination leads to a conjugated diene outside the bridge, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide. But I'm not sure if that's possible here. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ring-opening. Wait, but the product spectrum has a carbonyl, so maybe the KOH is causing an oxidation. Wait, no, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps elimination is not possible, so it's a substitution. Wait, but dibromides can undergo substitution if there's a good leaving group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that each Br is on adjacent carbons, but no, the question says 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Hmm. Maybe the heating causes the two Br atoms to leave, leading to a molecule that's missing two substituents. But that would form a diradical, perhaps, which isn't likely. Alternatively, think about possible elimination products.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the initial product. The NMR has 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a high chemical shift, which is usually indicative of a CH₂ group attached to something electronegative, like O. But wait, another possibility is an epoxide. In an epoxide, the protons are typically around δ 3-4, so 4.79 is a bit high. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol adjacent to a carbonyl group. Alternatively, maybe it's a diol, but the IR shows a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR peak at 1720cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How? If the base causes elimination, but if elimination isn't possible due to bridgehead constraints, maybe the reaction is some kind of dehydrohalogenation leading to a carbonyl group. Wait, another possibility: Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to a Br, leading to the formation of a carbonyl via a keto-enol tautomerism or some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but elimination usually leads to alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a peroxide formation, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization, but that's for esters. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo a double elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that's not possible due to the structure. Alternatively, perhaps each Br leaves, but since KOH is a base, maybe it's not a good nucleophile here. Wait, perhaps it's a double E2 elimination, forming a ring contraction. But I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. KOH can cause elimination, but if elimination isn't possible, maybe it undergoes a substitution. Wait, but the molecule is symmetric, so substitution of two Brs might give something else.

Wait, another thought: When 1,3-dibromocyclohexane is treated with KOH, it eliminates to form cyclohexene. But in the case of
