Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, A to D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with a high yield.

Let me first sketch out what the target molecule looks like. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, actually, the numbering might be a bit different. Let me confirm. The structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has ethoxy, position 2 has tert-butyl, and position 3 has nitro. So it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, but wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the numbering is such that the substituents are on adjacent carbons. Let me visualize this: ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So they are all meta to each other? Or perhaps adjacent? Let me think about the numbering. If it's 1,2,3, they are adjacent in a row. So the substituents are in positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring. So, like, the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.

But wait, considering the substituents, the ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating group), while nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. The tert-butyl is a bulky activating group, since it's an alkyl group, also ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but when you have multiple substituents on benzene, the directing effect depends on their positions. So in the target molecule, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about how to add these groups in the correct order, considering the directing effects.

So, the synthesis starts with benzene. We need to add these three substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

I think the key here is the order of adding the substituents. Since nitro groups are meta-directing and deactivating, it's better to add them later in the synthesis because once added, they deactivate the ring, making further substitutions harder. Alternatively, maybe that's not the case. Let's think: adding nitro early would make the ring less reactive, but if other substituents are added before that, they might be influenced by it.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps it's better to add the strongest activating groups first so that subsequent deactivating groups can be added in the correct position. So, perhaps ethoxy and tert-butyl (both activating) are added first, and then nitro is added last.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group, so it's usually added after the activating groups because otherwise, the ring would become deactivating, making it hard to add other groups. Alternatively, sometimes nitro groups are added via diazonium salt reactions, which require activating groups to form the diazonium intermediate.

Wait, the nitro group can be introduced via nitration, which can be directed by the existing substituents. So the order is crucial.

Let me think about each step of the options. Each option lists a series of reactions. Each reaction is a step in the synthesis.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy
