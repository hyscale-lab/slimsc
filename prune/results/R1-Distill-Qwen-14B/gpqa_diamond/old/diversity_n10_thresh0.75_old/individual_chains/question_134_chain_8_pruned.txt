Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy change when mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. The volumes and concentrations are given, so I need to figure out how they react with each other.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But wait, this is a problem with different acids and a base, so I need to calculate the moles involved.

Let's break down each solution:

1. HCl: It's a strong acid, monoprotic. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.
   Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. So moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. So 0.1 moles of H+.

2. H2SO4: This is sulfuric acid, a strong diprotic acid. Each mole gives two H+ ions.
   Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

3. Ba(OH)2: This is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.
   Volume is 200 mL = 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, when these are mixed, the H+ from acids will react with OH- from the base. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. The enthalpy change for this is about -57 kJ per mole of H2O formed.

But wait, I need to find out which is the limiting reagent here because the total H+ and OH- might not be in a 1:1 ratio.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent here because it's less. Once all OH- is used up, some H+ will remain.

The reaction will proceed until OH- is all consumed. So moles of water formed are equal to the moles of OH- available, which is 0.2 moles.

Now, the enthalpy change for this neutralization is -57 kJ per mole of H2O. So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but let me think again. Oh, wait! The problem is in kilocalories, I think. Because the options include kcal and kJ. Oh yes, the options are in kcal and kJ.

Wait, wait. Because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So to convert from kJ to kcal, I should divide by 4.184.

So if I calculate the enthalpy change as -11.4 kJ, converting to kcal would be -11.4 / 4.184 ≈ around -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but let me do that division more accurately.

11.4 divided by 4.184: Let me compute this.

4.184 * 2 = 8.368. Subtract that from 11.4: 11.4 -8.368=3.032.

3.032 /4.184 ≈ 0.725.

So total is approximately 2.725 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says enthalpy of neutralization. Oh, but wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So in neutralization, each mole can donate two H+.

So the calculation seems correct. Let me double-check the initial steps.

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 mol =0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 =0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5 =0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

Total H+ =0.28, OH- =0.2. So OH- is limiting. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react.

So, moles of H2O formed =0.2.

So the enthalpy of neutralization is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) =-11.4 kJ. Or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which would be about -3.82 kcal if converted, but that's not matching.

Wait, wait, wait. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a strong acid but maybe the second H+ doesn't release as much energy. Or perhaps in this problem, the enthalpy is calculated assuming each mole of H+ contributes -57 kJ.

Wait, but the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately -57 kJ per mole. So if I have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, that's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer should be option A, -2.72 kcal.

Alternatively, wait, but another thought: when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(O
