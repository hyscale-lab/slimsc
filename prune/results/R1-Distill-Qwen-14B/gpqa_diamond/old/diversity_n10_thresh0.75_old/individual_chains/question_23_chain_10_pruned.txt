Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the reaction of a specific compound with hydrogen bromide, and then determining the products based on the TLC results. 

First, the compound given is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, I need to draw its structure to visualize it better. So, the benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Let me break that down. But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (if I count from the end attached to the oxygen). Wait, but but has four carbons. So, numbering from the oxygen: position 1 is the one attached to O, then 2, 3, 4. So the double bond is between 3 and 4? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Because the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. Oh wait, but I might be getting confused. Let's think: for but-3-en-1-yl, the substituent is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at C3 (from the end attached to the main chain). Wait, I think I'm getting that wrong. Let me clarify.

But-3-en-1-yl structure: the chain is four carbons long. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2, but wait, that doesn't make sense because if the double bond is at 3, the substituent would be CH2CH2CH2-CH2, but that would imply the double bond is between C3 and C4, but in a four-carbon chain, that's the same as 1,3-diene? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between 3 and 4
