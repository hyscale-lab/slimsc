Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here, and I need to figure out the mass dimension of the coupling constant κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, the gamma matrices' commutator. So σ is antisymmetric, probably leading to terms involving the field strength tensor F, which is for electromagnetism or something like that.

Wait, but what's the structure here. The term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So each component would involve two spinors and two vector indices. Let's think about the dimensions.

In quantum field theory, the mass dimension is important because it tells us about renormalizability. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≥0. Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the mass dimension of the coupling should be ≥0 for a renormalizable theory. Because the dimension of the action needs to be dimensionless in natural units, which is 4 for spacetime dimensions.

Wait, the action S = ∫ d^4x L must be dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4. Because when you integrate, you multiply by d^4x, which has dimension [Mass]^{-4}.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So let's find the dimension of each part in L_int. The term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Let me recall the dimensions. The Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because ψ is in the Dirac Lagrangian, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ + ..., so each term must have dimension 4. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1, so the term ψ̄ ∂ ψ must have dimension 3 (since 3 = 3/2 + 1 + 3/2). So yes, ψ has dimension 3/2.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? It's made from gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. Because the gamma matrices are part of the spinor representation and don't carry mass dimensions themselves. So σ_{μν} is just a product of gamma matrices and is dimensionless. Similarly, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. F is built from two derivatives acting on a gauge field, so let's think about the gauge field A. The Maxwell term is like F^2, so F must have dimension 2. Because F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1 (since Maxwell term is (∂A)^2, which is (1)^2 = 1; but wait, the Maxwell Lagrangian is F^2, which has to have dimension 4. So F must have dimension 2, since (F)^2 has dimension
