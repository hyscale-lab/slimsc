Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, decay lifetimes and detection are important. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The problem asks for the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, so I think this has to do with the time a particle is moving before decaying and whether the detector can capture the decay products. Because particles moving at relativistic speeds have their lifetimes dilated, right? So the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, but when moving, it's longer.

So, first, I need to find the speed of the particle X⁰. Since it's moving at a high energy, I can use the energy and mass to find its velocity. The total energy E is given by E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. 

So, the energy E is 27 GeV, and the rest mass m is 3.41 GeV. So γ = E/(mc²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV) ≈ 7.91. Wait, but wait, the units for E and m are both in GeV, so when I take the ratio, the GeV cancels out. That makes sense.

Once I have γ, I can find the velocity. The γ factor is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so I can solve for v. Let's see, γ ≈7.91, so 1/γ ≈ 0.1264. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/γ → 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/(7.91)^2 ≈ 1 - (1/62.56) ≈ 1 - 0.016 ≈ 0.984. So v = sqrt(0.984) * c ≈ 0.992c. Wait, that seems a bit fast. Let me check that calculation again.

Wait, 7.91 squared is about 62.56? Let me compute 7.9^2: 7^2 is 49, 0.9^2 is 0.81, cross terms 2*7*0.9 = 12.6. So 49 +12.6 +0.81=62.41. Yeah, so 7.91 squared is about 62.56. So yeah, 1/62.56 is around 0.016. So 1 - 0.016 = 0.984, square root is about 0.992. So v ≈ 0.992c. That's pretty close to the speed of light. Okay.

Next, the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (the frame of the Bubble Chamber) is longer due to time dilation. The dilated lifetime τ is γ * τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s = approximately 6.33e-15 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 7.91 * 8 = 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s = 6.328e-15 s. Hmm.

Now, the particle moves a certain distance before decaying. The length it travels is L = v * τ. So L = 0.992c * 6.328e-15 s.

Wait, c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 0.992 * 3e8 ≈ 2.976e8 m/s. Multiply by 6.328e-15 s: 2.976e8 * 6.328e-15 = let's compute that.

2.976e8 is 2.976 x 10^8. 6.328e-15 is 6.328 x 10^-15. Multiply them: (2.976 *6.328) x 10^(8-15) → (approx 18.85) x 10^-7 → 1.885e-6 meters. So about 1.885e-6 meters. Hmm.

Wait, but the question says "at least 30% of the decays." Oh right, so perhaps the minimum number of decays observed corresponds to the case where the particle's lifetime is such that it has a certain probability of decaying within the detector's resolution.

Wait, maybe I should think about the decay probability. The probability that a particle decays within time t is 1 - exp(-t/τ), where τ is the mean lifetime. But wait, the mean lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. So the decay probability depends on how much time passes before the decay.

But wait, the problem is about the minimum resolution required. I think resolution refers to the precision of the detector in measuring the position of the decay. So, the particle must travel a certain minimum distance before decaying, and the detector must be able to resolve that.

Wait, perhaps it's about the minimum distance the particle travels so that the detector can see the decay. But how does that tie into 30% of the decays being observed?

Alternatively, perhaps I should model this as the probability that the particle decays within a certain time, which relates to the length it travels. The resolution (I think) refers to the minimum distance the detector can measure. So, the detector must have a resolution good enough to detect a decay if the particle travels a certain minimum distance.

Wait, another approach: the proper lifetime is τ0. The time observed in the lab is longer; and the particle's lifetime is longer, so the average path length is longer. But to observe a decay, the particle must decay within the detector's volume. Or, the decay products must be close enough for the
