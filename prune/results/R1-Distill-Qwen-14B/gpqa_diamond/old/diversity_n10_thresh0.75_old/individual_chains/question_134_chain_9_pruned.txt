Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D, with some kcal and kJ values.

Wait, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to produce water and salt. The enthalpy of neutralization is usually measured per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved. But wait, different acids and bases contribute different amounts of these ions.

So first, I think I need to find out how many moles of H+ and OH- are present in each solution. But wait, HCl and H2SO4 are acids; Ba(OH)2 is a base.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid and it dissociates completely. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's diprotic, the first dissociation is complete, but the second is partial? Or wait, no, I think in solutions, H2SO4 dissociates completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. Or is that correct? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think: H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, releasing 2 H+ per molecule? No, wait, actually, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid but in aqueous solution, it dissociates into H+ and HSO4^- first: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2- is not right. Because when you have a concentrated solution, the second dissociation (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is not complete. But in dilute solutions, it's often approximated that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid that donates two H+ ions. So for molar calculations, I can consider each mole of H2SO4 as giving two moles of H+.

Wait, but wait, the concentration given is
