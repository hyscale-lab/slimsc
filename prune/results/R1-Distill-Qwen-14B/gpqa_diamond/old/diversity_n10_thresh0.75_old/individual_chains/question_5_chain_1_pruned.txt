Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator along an arbitrary direction. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that for spin-1/2 particles like a muon, the spin operator components are given in terms of Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. The problem gives me the matrices for Px, Py, and Pz. So, the operator P in the direction n (which is in the x-z plane) would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines, I think. 

Wait, the operator for a direction n is P·n, right? Because the total operator for any direction is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So, n is in the x-z plane, which means the y-component is zero. So n can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but wait, no: wait, actually, in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis. So n would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ)? No, wait, sorry, I get confused. Oh wait, no. For a direction in the x-z plane, the angle φ is either 0 or π, because y is zero. So direction n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because when φ is 0, cosφ is 1 and sinφ is 0. So n is along the x-z plane, so its components are (sinθ, 0, cosθ). 

So the operator P·n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because the operator along n is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. 

Now, the problem says we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we have to find a normalized vector |v> such that (P·n) |v> = (ħ/2) |v>.

Let me write down the matrices for each component. 

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So P·n is (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix. 

The matrix part is:
[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Because:
sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] gives [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] gives [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together:
[ cosθ   sinθ
  sinθ  -cosθ ]

So the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
           [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2, so:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * |v> = |v>

So we're looking for eigenvectors of the matrix M = [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] with eigenvalue 1.

Wait, no. Wait, the eigenvalue equation is M |v> = λ |v>, right? So in this case, λ is 1 because the right-hand side is |v> (since (ħ/2) M |
