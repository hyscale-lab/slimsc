Okay, so I've got this problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state. The options are A to D, each with different values of momentum.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotor-vibrator model, a diatomic molecule's energy levels come from both rotational and vibrational movements. But wait, the question mentions the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, the non-rigid rotor is an extension where the bond length isn't fixed, so it can stretch a bit. But wait, I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Maybe it's about the energy transitions between rotational and vibrational states.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state of vibration is the lowest energy vibrational state, n=0. And for rotation, the fundamental state is the ground rotational state, which is J=0. Or wait, no—vibrational and rotational states are separate. So the fundamental state would be the combination where both are at their lowest, so n=0 and J=0.

But the problem says "the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the next higher energy state. Wait, but in the quantum model, the energy levels are quantized. The energy depends on both rotation (J) and vibration (n).

Wait, the question is about absorption of a photon causing the molecule to switch to the next state. So the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the current state and the next.

So the initial state is the ground state: n=0, J=0. The next lowest state would probably be the first excited state. But wait, which comes next? Vibrational or rotational? Because the vibrational energy levels are generally higher than the rotational ones. Because the vibrational energy is on the order of eV, while rotational is on the order of cm^-1, which is much smaller.

Wait, actually, for diatomic molecules, the vibrational energy levels are much higher. So the fundamental state is n=0, J=0. The next possible state could be either a higher vibration state or a higher rotation state. But the question says "the next state with the lowest possible energy," which would be the smallest possible energy increase. Since rotational transitions generally require less energy than vibrational, the next state would be J=1, n=0. Because moving from J=0 to J=1 is a lower energy jump than moving n from 0 to 1.

Wait, but wait, the problem says it's in the fundamental state, which I'm assuming is the lowest energy state overall. So the next state would be the next higher energy state, which would be the rotation state: J=1, n=0. Because increasing J gives a lower energy increase than increasing n.

So the energy change would be the difference between J=1 and J=0, with n=0. I think the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And the vibrational energy is E_vib = (n + 1/2) * h * w, where w is the angular frequency. But since the n doesn't change, the photon would need to provide the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but the photon's energy must match the difference between the two states. So, the initial state is J=0, n=0. The next state would be J=1, n=0. So the energy required is the energy difference between J=1 and J=0. That's the rotational energy for J=1 minus J=0.

So the energy difference ΔE = E_rot(J=1) - E_rot(J=0) = B*(1)(2) - B*(0)(1) = 2B. So the photon's energy must be 2B.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. What's the rotational constant B? Oh right, B is given by ħ²/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. Oh, and I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So first, I need to compute the reduced mass μ of the molecule. The two atoms are X and Y. The masses are given: Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) all in kg.

Wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So Mx = 20 amu = 20 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-26 kg. My = 2 * 1.66e-27 = 3.32e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2 amu^2) / (22 amu) = (40 amu^2) / (22 amu) ) = (40/22) amu ≈ 1.818 amu. So in kg, that's 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 2.999e-27 kg. Let me compute that exactly.

20 amu * 2 amu = 40 (amu^2)
20 +2 =22 amu, so denominator is 22 amu.

μ = 40/(22) amu = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

So converting to kg: 1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg.

1.66e-27 * 2 = 3.32e-27, so 1.818 is about 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = let me calculate that.

1.818 * 1.66 = approximately 3.014. So 3.014e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, let me compute more accurately:

1.818 * 1.66:

1 * 1.66 = 1.66,

0.8 * 1.66 = 1.328,

0.018 * 1.66 ≈ 0.02988.

Adding up: 1.66 + 1.328 = 2.988, plus 0.02988 is about 3.01788.

So μ ≈ 3.01788e-27 kg.

Now, I is the moment of inertia: I = μ r².

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r=2e-10 m.

So I = 3.01788e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01788e-27 *4e-20 = 1.20715e-46 kg m².

Then, the rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2I) where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.20715e-46) )

Calculate numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.05457)^2 = approx 1.112, times 1e-68, so 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 2 * 1.20715e-46 = 2.4143e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.4143e-46 ≈ (1.112 / 2.4143) * 1e-22.

1.112 / 2.4143 ≈ 0.46.

So B ≈ 0.46e-22 J.

Wait, that's 4.6e-23 J.

But wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's compute 1.05457e-34 squared.

(1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = 1.112 * 1e-68 = 1.112e-68.

Then, 2 * I = 2 * 1.20715e-46
