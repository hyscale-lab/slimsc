Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, the question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> through two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules.

Wait, so the state is given as |n, l, m> where n is the principal quantum number, l is the azimuthal (angular momentum) quantum number, and m is the magnetic quantum number. The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to n=1, l=0, m=0.

So the decay happens in two steps. Each step is a dipole transition. I think dipole transitions have specific selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are usually Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But for each transition, the change in l must be ±1, and m can change by 0 or ±1.

But wait, let's think about the first transition from |3,0,0>. The initial l is 0 (s orbital). So in the first transition, l can go to 1 (since Δl = ±1). So the possible states after first transition would have l=1. So the first step would be from l=0 to l=1. Then, in the next transition, l must decrease by 1 to reach l=0.

So the initial state is (n=3, l=0, m=0). First transition: l goes from 0 to 1. So possible states are |2,1,m> or |4,1,m>, but since the energy levels are lower, n probably goes from 3 to 2 because higher n would require more energy, but the atom is decaying, so it's emitting a photon, going to a lower energy state.

Wait, but wait, n can change by any integer as long as the energy is lower. But in dipole transitions, the rule is Δn can be ±1, but wait no, that's for the hydrogen atom's energy levels; actually, the selection rules for the principal quantum number n are that Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but in practice, the allowed transitions are determined by the l and m changes. But I'm a bit confused. Let me get back to the selection rules.

The key selection rules for electric dipole transitions are:
- Δl = ±1 (so l must change by 1)
- Δm = 0, ±1

So for the first transition from |3,0,0>, possible l is 1. So the possible states after transition are |n,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

But what about n? The initial n is 3. So after transition, n can decrease by 1 or increase by 1? Or is the change in n related to the photon emission or absorption? Since the atom is decaying, we're going from higher energy to lower, so n decreases. So from n=3, the next possible n is 2, because going to 4 would be higher energy, which wouldn't make sense for decay.

So the first transition is from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. Or wait, is that correct? Because sometimes the transition can have a change in n beyond ±1 if there are multiple possible l values. But in the case of 3→2, yes, that's a common transition.

So the first step is |3,0,0> → |2,1, m>, with m being -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, it goes from l=1 to l=0, and n from 2 to 1.

So the second transition must be from |2,1, m> → |1,0, m'>, where m' can be m, m±1. But wait, the initial m in the first transition is from 0, so possible m's after first transition are -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, m can change by 0 or ±1.

Wait, but the initial state after first transition is |2,1,m>, so when it decays again, the m can change.

But the final state is |1,0,0>, so m must go back to 0.

So for the first transition, starting at m=0, the possible m's after are -1, 0, +1. Then, in the second transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So how do the m's line up to get to m=0?

Let's consider the possible paths:

First transition: m → m1 (m1 = -1, 0, +1)
Second transition: m1 → m2 where m2 = m1 ±1 or m1.

We need m2
