Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and it's about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

First, I remember that when high-energy gamma-rays interact with the CMB photons, they can annihilate each other to produce electron-positron pairs. This process is called photon-photon annihilation, I think. The reaction is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. So, the gamma-rays in question are high-energy, and their interaction with the CMB is significant enough to limit their lifetime in the universe.

The lifetime limitation implies that the gamma-rays are being absorbed quickly by this process. So, the mean free time for this annihilation is important. If the mean free time is much shorter than the age of the universe, then the gamma-rays wouldn't be around for long, meaning their lifetime is limited by this interaction.

I need to find the energy where this annihilation becomes significant. So, I think this involves calculating the cross-section of the process and the number density of the CMB photons.

Wait, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation. I remember that the cross-section σ depends on the energy of the photons. At high energies, the cross-section for γγ→e+e- increases because it's a resonant process when the photon energies are around the electron mass. But wait, electrons are much lighter than the photons in the CMB, so maybe that's not exactly the case here.

Wait, the cross-section for two photons to annihilate into an electron-positron pair has a certain dependence on the photon energies. The threshold energy for this reaction is when the combined energy of the two photons is at least twice the electron mass (since each electron is about 0.511 MeV). But in this problem, the CMB photons are at 1e-3 eV, which is way below the electron mass. So, the gamma-rays must be high enough in energy to meet the threshold.

So, the threshold condition would be when the sum of the energies of the two photons is at least 2m_e c². But since the CMB photon is so low energy, the gamma-ray photon must have energy E such that E + E_CMB ≥ 2m_e c². Wait, no, actually, the threshold is E_gamma * E_CMB ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / 4, if I remember correctly. Because the center-of-mass energy needs to be at least 2m_e c². So, the condition for the reaction to occur is (E_gamma * E_CMB) ≥ (m_e c²/2)^2.

Wait, let me think. The center-of-mass energy squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. For photons, since they're massless, E = pc. So, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 )? Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, photons are moving in opposite directions, I think. So, their momenta are opposite. So, the total momentum is sqrt( (p1 - p2)^2 ) because they are moving in opposite directions.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of invariant quantities. The invariant squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)(-p2 c + p1 c). Wait, maybe I should recall that for two photons colliding head-on, the s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (2p1 c)^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for the threshold condition is when the combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2m_e c².

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to recall that the cross-section σ for γγ → e+e- is non-zero only when the photon energies satisfy E1 * E2 ≥ (m_e c²)^2 /4. So for a given γ-ray energy E and CMB photon energy ε, the condition is E * ε ≥ (m_e c²/2)^2.

So, solving for E, E ≥ (m_e c²)^2 / (4 ε).

Given that the average photon energy of the CMB is ε = 1e-3 eV. Let me compute m_e c². The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So m_e c² = 0.511e6 eV.

So, (m_e c²)^2 is (0.511e6)^2 eV². Let's compute that. (0.511e6)^2 = (0.511)^2 * 1e12 ≈ 0.261 * 1e12 = 2.61e11 eV².

Divide that by (4 * ε), where ε is 1e-3 eV. So denominator is 4 * 1e-3 = 4e-3 eV.

So, (2.61e11) / (4e-3) = (2.61e11) / (4e-3) ) = (2.61 /4 ) * 1e14 ≈ 0.6525 * 1e14 ≈ 6.525e13 eV.

Wait, but that's E in eV. Let's convert that to GeV. 6.525e13 eV is 6.525e4 Ge
