Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait a second, that seems a bit off. Oh wait, no, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, and their elements are complex numbers. But here, the given vector has real numbers. Maybe it's normalized, or perhaps I need to normalize it first? Let me check.

Wait, the state vector is a column matrix, so it's a 3x1 matrix. Let me write it out: it's [-1, 2, 1] transposed. So the components are a=-1, b=2, c=1. To find the probabilities, I might need the state vector to be normalized, so that the sum of the squares of the absolute values equals 1. So let me calculate the norm.

The norm squared is |a|² + |b|² + |c|². That would be (-1)² + 2² + 1² = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh wait, so the state isn't normalized yet. So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T. Because when you normalize, you divide each component by the norm.

So the state is |ψ> = (1/√6) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Got it.

Now, the problem is about measuring P and then Q. Wait, but the question says if someone measures Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. Oh, wait no, the
