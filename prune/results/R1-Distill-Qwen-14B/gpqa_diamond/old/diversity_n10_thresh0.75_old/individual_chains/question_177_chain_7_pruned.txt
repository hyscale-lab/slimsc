Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times bigger. Hmm, I remember that luminosity of stars depends on both their radius and temperature. Oh wait, right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law says L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Wait, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature.

Wait, but then if both stars are at the same temperature, their luminosities would depend on their radii squared. Since Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So L1 should be (1.5)^2 times L2, which is 2.25. So the luminosity of Star_1 is 2.25 times that of Star_2. But wait, the options have some other numbers, like 2.23 or 2.32, so maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Oh, so maybe this affects the observed wavelength? Because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift. Oh right, the Doppler effect for light. So the observed wavelength might be different from the rest wavelength.

Wait, but the question says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So their observed λ_max are the same. But the actual emission peak (the rest frame) could be different if they're moving.

So let's think. The actual temperature would determine the rest frame λ_max. But because of their velocities, the observed λ_max could be shifted.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, which I think refers to the observed wavelengths. So if Star_1 is not moving (radial velocity 0), its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. But Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. So, we need to calculate the Doppler shift for Star_2 and see whether that affects the temperature we compute.

Wait, but earlier I thought that since observed λ_max1 = observed λ_max2, then
