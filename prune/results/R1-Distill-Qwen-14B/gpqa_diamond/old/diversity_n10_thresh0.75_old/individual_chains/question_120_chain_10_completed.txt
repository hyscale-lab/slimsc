Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and I'm supposed to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me think about this.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance, where distance is in parsecs. So the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance. That makes sense because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed usually means that the number density is constant in space, right? So if I imagine space filled with stars, the number in a given volume doesn't depend on where you are.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So I need to relate this to the distribution of stars in terms of distance.

Let me think: if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density n is constant. So in a volume V, the number of stars N is n*V. Now, the volume depends on the distance. In spherical coordinates, the volume of a shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. So if I have a range of distances, the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π r² dr.

But I need to express this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/r (because d is in parsecs), then r = 1/plx. So dr = -d(plx)/(plx²) * d(plx). Wait, maybe I should express the volume in terms of plx.

Let me try substitution. r = 1/plx. So dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx). Hmm, but I'm dealing with ranges of plx. Let's say I have a small change in plx, dplx. Then the corresponding change in r is dr = - (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because dr/dr plx is -1/plx². So in terms of plx, the volume element becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * [ - (1/plx²) dplx ].

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The volume of a spherical shell at distance r is 4π r² dr. If I express r in terms of plx, which is 1/r, then r = 1/plx. So substituting, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But dr is in terms of r, which is 1/plx. So maybe I should change variables from r to plx.

Let me compute the volume element in terms of plx. Let me denote plx as p for simplicity.

So p = 1/r → r = 1/p.

The volume of a shell at r is 4π r² dr. Express this in terms of p.

So, dr = (dr/dp) dp. Since p = 1/r, dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So substituting into the volume:

4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp) = 4π (1/p^4) (-dp).

Wait, but since we are considering a small positive dp, the negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases. But for counting stars, we're more interested in the absolute value. So the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, because when p increases, r decreases, so the shell volume is 4π (r)^2 dr = 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp. So that becomes 4π (1/p^2) * (1/p^2) (-dp) → 4π (1/p^4) (-dp). The negative just indicates direction, so for the number of stars, we can take the absolute value, so the volume element is 4π (1/p^4) dp.

But wait, stars are uniformly distributed in space, so the number of stars in a volume element dV is n dV, where n is the number density.

So the number of stars in a shell of parallax p to p+dp is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, so that's the number per unit dp. So it's (number) / dp = 4π n (1/p^4).

But wait, the question says "number of stars per unit range of parallax", so that's the number per unit dp. So that is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but the options don't have 1/p^4. Let me check the options again.

Options are:
A) ~1/plx^4
B) ~1/plx^2
C) ~1/plx^1
D) ~1/plx^3

So option A is 1/p^4. That would be the case according to this calculation.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the substitution? Let me go through it again.

r = 1/p → dr = - (1/p²) dp.

So the volume of a thin shell is 4π r² dr = 4π (1/p)^2 * (-1/p²) dp.

Which is 4π (1/p^2) * (-1/p^2) dp = -4π (1/p^4) dp.

The negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases, so the volume element is positive when considering the shell, so we take the absolute value, making it 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So the number per unit dp is (n *4π) (1/p^4).

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of plx (p) is proportional to 1/p^4. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the confusion arises because the flux or the number density in terms of parallax. Let me think about the distribution.

If the number density is uniform, meaning that the number of stars in a volume is proportional to that volume. So for a given parallax, how many stars are there per unit parallax.

Alternatively, think in terms of distance. The number of stars per unit distance (dr) is n * 4π r².

But since plx p = 1/r, then r = 1/p. So the number of stars per unit distance dr is n *4π (1/p)^2.

But wait, dr is related to dp. So dr = -1/p² dp.

So the number of stars per unit dp would be (n *4π (1/p^2)) ) * (1/(dr/dp)).

Wait, maybe I should compute the derivative.

Number per unit dp is (dN/dp) = (dN/dr) * (dr/dp).

dN/dr = n *4π r².

dr/dp = -1/p².

So dN/dp = n *4π r² * (-1/p²).

But r=1/p, so r²=1/p². So:

dN/dp = n *4π (1/p²) * (-1/p²) ) = n *4π (-1/p^4).

The negative just indicates that as p increases, the number decreases, which makes sense. So the magnitude is 4π n / p^4.

So again, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/p^4.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we analyze the relationship between parallax, distance, and the distribution of stars in space. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, given by \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \), where \( r \) is the distance in parsecs. Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number density \( n \) is constant, and the number of stars in a volume \( V \) is proportional to \( n \cdot V \).

The volume of a spherical shell at distance \( r \) with thickness \( dr \) is \( 4\pi r^2 dr \). Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d(\text{plx}) \), the volume element becomes:

\[
dV = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2}\right) d(\text{plx}) = -\frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx}).
\]

The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases, \( r \) decreases, but for counting stars, we consider the absolute value. Thus, the number of stars in a shell of parallax \( \text{plx} \) to \( \text{plx} + d(\text{plx}) \) is:

\[
N = n \cdot dV = n \cdot \frac{4\pi}{\text{plx}^4} d(\text{plx}).
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is therefore proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \).

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^4 \):** Matches the derived result.
- **B) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^2 \):** Incorrect, as it does not account for the \( \text{plx}^{-4} \) dependence.
- **C) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^1 \):** Incorrect, as it underestimates the dependence.
- **D) \( \sim 1/\text{plx}^3 \):** Incorrect, as it overestimates the dependence.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
