Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, the pH of the solution increases because the acid is less concentrated, so the dissociation is a bit more. Then, when you titrate it with NaOH, which is a strong base, it will neutralize the acetic acid. 

First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. The initial volume is 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then adding 20 cm³ of water will double the volume, so the new concentration should be half of the initial, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, so the same moles in double the volume would be 0.025 M.

Wait, let me confirm that. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume = 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of water, the total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

So now, when this is titrated with 0.1 M NaOH, I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? It's when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present. So first, let's find how much NaOH is needed for equivalence.

The moles of acetic acid are 0.001, as calculated before. The reaction between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH is 1:1, so moles of NaOH needed are 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added, which is 0.1 M × 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 moles, the moles of acid neutralized are 0.00025, leaving 0.00075 moles of acetic acid. And the amount of acetate formed is 0.00025 moles.

Wait, but before adding any NaOH, the solution is a weak acid (diluted). After adding some NaOH, it's a buffer solution because you have both the weak acid and its conjugate base (acetate ions) present. So the pH can be calculated using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

So for the 25% titration point, let's think. So, before any NaOH is added, the solution is 0.025 M acetic acid. But when you add 25% of the required NaOH, you're adding some OH- which neutralizes some of the acid.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles, to avoid confusion due to
