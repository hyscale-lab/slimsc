Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and jot down the key points.

The problem talks about a substance X reacting violently with a liquid Y. When they react, they release a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Additionally, a precipitate G forms, and when G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B under normal conditions is close to 277 K. 

Another part mentions that the product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. The question is about finding the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Alright, let's break this down piece by piece.

First, the reaction: X reacts with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G, and maybe something else. The gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Hmm, so the molecular formula of W would have the same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases. For example, H2O: each molecule has 10 protons (since O is 8, H is 1 each) but neutrons? O has 8 neutrons, H has none. So each H2O molecule has 8 neutrons (from O) and 2 H, but wait, protons in the molecule would be 2 (from H) + 8 (from O) = 10. Neutrons: O has 8, H has 0. So W would have 8 neutrons and 10 protons. That doesn't match. Another option: maybe CO2? No, but wait CO2 has 22 protons (C:6 + 2 O:8 each). Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 16 =22. So each CO2 molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits! Or maybe something else.

Wait, another option is NH3. But NH3 has 14 protons (N:7, 3 H:1
