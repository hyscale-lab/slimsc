Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momenta, I think. The phase shifts are δ0=90 degrees, δ1=67, δ2=55, δ3=30, and δ4=13 degrees. The rest are ignored, so I guess I only consider these five. The energy is 50 MeV electrons.

Wait, the question is about calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ,φ) has a specific form when you include partial waves. The formula is something like f = (1/(k)) * sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl ] * ... Oh wait, no, perhaps I should recall the general expression.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is given by:

f(θ, φ) = (1/(k)) * sum_{l=0 to L} (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] * P_l(cosθ) 

But wait, when considering the imaginary part along the beam direction, that's when θ=0 degrees. Because along the beam direction, the scattering angle is 0, so cosθ =1, and P_l(1) is 1 for all l (since P_0(x)=1, P_1(1)=1, etc. Wait no, actually, P_l(1)=1 for all l. Because the Legendre polynomials evaluated at x=1 are all equal to 1. So, along θ=0, the sum simplifies a lot.

So, the imaginary part Im f(0,φ) would be (1/(k)) * sum_{l=0 to L} (2l+1) sin(δ_l) * P_l(1). Since P_l(1)=1, it's just sum (2l+1) sinδ_l.

Wait, because e^{2iδ} -1 = e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} - e^{-iδ}) = e^{iδ} (2i sinδ) ), so [e^{2iδ} -1] = 2i e^{iδ} sinδ.

So, f = (1/k) sum (2l +1) [2i e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ] P_l (cosθ)

So the imaginary part of f is (1/k) sum (2l+1) * 2 e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l * P_l(cosθ) * i/(i), wait perhaps I should re-examine.

Wait, the general expression for f is:

f = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ)

So, e^{2iδ_l} -1 = e^{i δ_l} (e^{i δ_l} - e^{-i δ_l}) ) = e^{i δ_l} * 2i sin δ_l.

So, [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] = 2i e^{i δ_l} sin
