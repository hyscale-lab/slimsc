Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is. 

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO and some NMR data. Then it's reacted through a series of reagents, and I need to find the final product. The options are A to D, each a different aldehyde or something similar with diphenyl groups.

First, I should analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's look at the 1H-NMR spectrum:

- 9.72 ppm: a triplet integrating for 1H. Hmm, that's a strong signal, probably an aldehyde proton because they usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, but an aldehyde is typically a singlet because it's only one proton. So maybe it's something else. Or perhaps I'm wrong about the aldehyde? Another possibility is an acidic proton, like an aromatic ring with substituents, but the triplet might come from splitting with two neighboring protons.

Wait, the triplet at 9.72 ppm. Maybe it's an aromatic proton? But then why a triplet? Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group? Because the aldehyde proton is usually a triplet if it's next to a CH2 that has two protons. Wait, but aldehydes are RCHO, so the aldehyde proton is directly attached to the carbonyl. If there's a CH2 next to it, like in RCH2CHO, then the aldehyde proton (CHO) would be a triplet due to coupling with the two protons on CH2. Oh, that makes sense. So the aldehyde is at the end of a CH2 group.

Moving on to other signals:

- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Maybe from a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Wait, in a para-substituted benzene, each proton is meta to two others, but I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a di-substituted ring. Alternatively, perhaps a coupling with adjacent protons in a substituent.

- 6.51 ppm: another doublet, 2H. Hmm, maybe another aromatic ring? Or perhaps part of a conjugated system.

- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests exchange with something, maybe an -OH group? Or perhaps it's an aldehyde but that doesn't fit here. Wait, but if it's 2H, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to something else. Or maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic with some coupling.

- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H. That's a CH2 group. The downfield shift suggests it's next to an electronegative atom or group. Like O maybe. So perhaps a CH2 attached to oxygen, like an OCH2 group or part of an ethyl group adjacent to an oxygen.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with substituents. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

So, the
