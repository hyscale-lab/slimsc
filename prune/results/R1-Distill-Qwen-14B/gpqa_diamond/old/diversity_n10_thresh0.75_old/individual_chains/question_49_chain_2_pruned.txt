Okay, so I've got this question about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a sigma bond along with a pi bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples of this. The question gives three reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C based on the options provided.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

I think this is a Claisen-like rearrangement. Wait, the Claisen rearrangement typically involves an allyl vinyl ether rearranging to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. But wait, the starting material here is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Oh wait, maybe it's a similar mechanism but with an amine group instead of a carbonyl.

Wait, so 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the ethanamine. So the structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2. No, wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be OCH3 groups on the first carbon. So the structure is (OCH3)2CH-NH2. Hmm, but but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2CH2CHOHCH2?), no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CHOH? Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but but-3-en-2-ol must have 4 carbons with the double bond starting at position 3. So structure is CH2CH2-CH(OH)-CH2? Wait,
