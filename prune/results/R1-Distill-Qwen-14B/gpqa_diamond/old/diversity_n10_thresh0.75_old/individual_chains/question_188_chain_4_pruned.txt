Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, a rhombohedral crystal with specific angles. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula involving the unit cell parameters. Oh right, the formula is d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ), but wait, is that correct? Or maybe it's slightly different.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula is d = (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2 (hk (cos gamma) + hl (cos beta) + kl (cos alpha)) )) divided by something. Wait, maybe I'm mixing some terms.

Or wait, perhaps it's better to use the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. Oh, right, for a rhombohedral crystal, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal (since it's a special case where a=b=c and all angles are equal as well). So in this case, a = b = c = 10 Angstroms, and alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees.

The formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) +
