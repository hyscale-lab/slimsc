Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem states that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Also, the energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. We're told to assume the photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I think that means we can use the Boltzmann equation here.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula I recall is (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the problem says the excitation level in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, n1_2/n1_1 = 2 (assuming n1_2 is the excited state population for star 1 and n1_1 is the lower state). Wait, no, wait. The question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the ratio of the excited to non-excited would be higher in star_1. But wait, the problem might be about the ratio of the populations. Or wait, perhaps it's the ratio of the excitation in each star. Let me think.

Wait, more accurately, the question says: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, I think that means the excitation (population) ratio is 2 for star_1 compared to star_2. Or perhaps the ratio of the excited state to the ground state is twice as high for star_1 as for star_2.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say for star_1, the ratio is n1^excited / n1^ground = r1. For star_2, it's r2. The problem states that r1 = 2 * r2.

Wait, no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_
