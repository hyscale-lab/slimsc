Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars, right, they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out the mass ratio between two systems, system_1 and system_2.

Okay, so the problem gives me some data. Both systems have eclipses with certain periods. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, there are radial velocity (RV) observations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Wait, I remember that in binary systems, the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. Oh right! The more massive star has a smaller velocity amplitude because it's orbiting closer to the center of mass. So, the mass is inversely proportional to the velocity amplitude. 

Let me think. The formula for the velocity amplitude (K) of a star in a binary system is given by K = (2Ï€ G / P)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ), but maybe that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, I remember that the ratio of the two masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes. So M1/M2 = K2/K1. Because M1 is more massive, K1 would be smaller than K2 if M1 is larger than M2.

Wait, let's see. For system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5 km/s. Let me denote them as K1 and K2 for system_1. So K1 is 10, K2 is 5. Then, the mass ratio M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2 in system_1. So the masses are M1 = 0.5 * M2.

Wait, no, the sum is the total mass. So wait, the total mass of
