Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question gives me the angular size of the event horizon as θ = 1e-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy.

Wait, entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula, right? So S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k), where A is the area of the event horizon. Oh wait, the formula is S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), but I might be mixing up the constants here. Oh, right, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 ħ G), where k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

So I need to find the area A of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so A = 4π r^2, where r is the Schwarzschild radius. But wait, how do I find r from the given information?

The angular size θ can be used to find the physical size. Oh, right, θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the size divided by the distance when θ is small. So θ ≈ d, but wait, no, θ is the angular size, so the actual size L is approximately θ * d. But wait, that's for small angles where θ (in radians) is approximately equal to L/(d). So L ≈ θ * d.

Wait, the Schwarzschild radius r_s is given by 2 G M / c^2. So if I can find the radius r of the event horizon, which is the Schwarzschild radius, then I can find the area A.

But wait, how do I get M, the mass of the black hole? Hmm. Maybe I can find the radius from the angular size. Let me think.

The angular size θ is given, so θ = (size)/(distance). The size here is the diameter of the event horizon, which is 2r_s. So θ = (2 r_s) / d. Therefore, r_s = (θ * d)/2. But wait, angle needs to be in radians for this approximation to work well.

So, first, I need to convert θ from degrees to radians. θ = 1e-17 degrees. To radians, multiply by π/180.

So θ_rad ≈ (1e-17) * (π/180) ≈ (1e-17) * 1.745e-3 ≈ 1.745e-20 radians.

So then, r_s = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, what's the distance d in meters? Since 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So r_s ≈ (1.745e-20 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2.

Calculating the numerator: 1.745e-20 * 3.086e26 = Let's see: 1.745 * 3.086 is about 5.375. Then, 1e-20 * 1e26 is 1e6. So 5.375e6 m. Then divide by 2: 2.6875e6 meters. So r_s ≈ 2.6875e6 meters.

Wait, that seems a bit big. Wait, supermassive black holes can have radii up to millions of kilometers or more. Wait, 2.68e6 meters is 2,687 kilometers. Hmm, that seems plausible for a supermassive black hole. But maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another approach: Let's redo the calculation.

θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) = 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me compute it again. Oh wait, 1e-17 * (π/180) = (1e-17) * (approximately 0.0174533) = 1.745e-19 radians. Oh, I think I messed up the exponent earlier; it's 1e-17 * 1e-2 ≈ 1e-19, right? Because 1 degree is about 0.01745 radians. So yes, θ_rad ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

So then, r_s = (θ_rad * d)/2 = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2.

Let's compute 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26:

Multiplying 1.745 * 3.086 ≈ 5.38.

Exponents: 1e-19 *1e26 = 1e7. So 5.38e7. Then divide by 2: 2.69e7 meters. So the Schwarzschild radius is about 2.69e7 meters, which is 26.9 million meters, or 26,900 kilometers. Hmm, that's a bit more than 13 Schwarzschild radii for the Earth, but for a supermassive black hole, that's a reasonable radius. So that seems okay.

Now, the area A is 4π r_s^2.

r_s = 2.69e7 m, so r_s squared is (2.69e7)^2 = (2.69)^2 * 1e14 = approx 7.23 * 1e14 = 7.23e14 m².

So A = 4 * π * 7.23e14 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 *7.23e14. Let's compute 4*3.1416 is about 12.566. Multiply by 7.23e14: 12.566 *7.23 ≈ 90.7. So A ≈ 90.7e14 m², which is 9.07e15 m².

Wait, that seems a bit small. Let me check: (2.69e7 m)^2 is (2.69)^2 = 7.23, so 7.23e14 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 *3.1416 is ~12.566. 12.
