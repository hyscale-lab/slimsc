Okay, so I have this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance. The formula is something like distance d = 1/plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. Right, so the parallax is inversely proportional to the distance.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Hmm, uniform distribution usually means that the number of stars is spread out evenly in some way. But how does this apply when considering the number per unit range of parallax?

Wait, the question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (like a slice in parallax) changes with the parallax. So, as plx changes, how does the count per unit plx change?

Let me think about the volume involved. Parallax is connected to distance, so a small change in parallax (Δplx) would correspond to a change in distance. But how?

Since d = 1/plx, if I increase plx a little, the distance decreases. But when I'm looking at a range of plx, like from plx to plx + Δplx, what's the corresponding distance range?

Wait, maybe I should consider the volume of space between two distances. The volume between d and d+Δd is 4πd² Δd, because it's a spherical shell. But how does Δd relate to Δplx? Let's see, since d = 1/plx, then Δd = (Δplx) / (plx)^2. Wait, let me double-check that derivative. Oh right, derivative of d with respect to plx is dd/dplx = -1/(plx)^2. So, a small change in plx, Δplx, would lead to a change in d of approximately Δd ≈ (Δplx) * (1/(plx)^2).

Wait, but Δd is negative because as plx increases, d decreases. But for the volume, the change in d is positive. Maybe I should take the absolute value, so Δd ≈ (Δplx) / (plx^2).

So the volume between d and d+Δd is 4πd² Δd. Substituting d = 1/plx and Δd = (Δplx) / (plx^2), the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (Δplx / plx^2) )= 4π (Δplx)/(plx^4).

Wait, but how does this relate to the number of stars? If stars are uniformly distributed, the number should be proportional to the volume. So the number of stars in a parallax range plx to plx + Δplx is proportional to the volume, which is 4π (Δplx)/(plx^4).

Alternatively, the number per unit parallax (Δplx=1) would be proportional to 1/(plx^4).

But wait, the question is about number per unit range of parallax. So the number N is proportional to 1/(plx^4). That would mean the number decreases as plx increases, which makes sense because further stars have smaller parallaxes, but if the distribution is uniform in space, fewer stars would be in a given parallax slice.

Wait, but wait another thought. The number of stars per unit volume is uniform, so N = n * volume, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume). So if the volume between two plx ranges is 4π (Δplx)/(plx^4), then the number is proportional to 1/(plx^4). That suggests that the number of stars per unit parallax decreases as plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but another way to think about it: Imagine you have a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume is 4π d² dd. Then d=1/plx, so d^2 is 1/(plx)^2. And dd = (Δplx) * (1/(plx)^2). So the volume is 4π (1/(plx)^2) * (Δplx)/(plx^2) ) = 4π Δplx/(plx^4).

So again, the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx (since Δplx is 1) is 1/plx^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). For a small change in parallax, \( \Delta \text{plx} \), the corresponding change in distance is \( \Delta d \approx \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \), derived from the derivative \( \frac{dd}{d\text{plx}} = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \).

The volume of a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \Delta d \) is given by:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi d^2 \Delta d.
\]

Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( \Delta d = \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \), the volume becomes:

\[
\text{Volume} = 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi \Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in this volume is proportional to the volume itself. Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax (\( \Delta \text{plx} = 1 \)) is proportional to:

\[
\text{Number of stars per unit plx} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

This indicates that the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^4 \). Among the given options, this corresponds to:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**

Answer: A
