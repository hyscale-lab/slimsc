Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics and approximations used in many-body calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the 'impulse approximation' in nuclear interactions. I remember that this approximation is used when dealing with interactions like electroweak, where the nucleus is treated in a certain simplified way. The key idea is that nucleons behave like free particles. So, the question is asking which assumptions together lead to this.

The options are four statements, and I need to pick which combination (1,2,4; etc.) implies the impulse approximation. Let's go through each statement.

Statement 1: The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. Oh right, in the impulse approximation, the interaction is considered to act on a single nucleon at a time. So each interaction is like a collision with one nucleon. So statement 1 seems to be part of the assumptions.

Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent meaning that other nucleons don't contribute much. So when a particle interacts, it's only the selected nucleon that matters, and the rest are sort of ignored. That makes sense because in the impulse approximation, other nucleons are treated as part of the background, not affecting the interaction of the selected one. So statement 2 is probably part of the assumptions.

Statement 3: The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. The impulse approximation is about treating the nucleon as free. If the quarks are non-relativistic, that would imply that they're in a regime where they can be treated with non-relativistic quantum mechanics. But I'm not sure how this directly ties into the impulse approximation. Alternatively, maybe this is a red herring. Or perhaps this is a condition that allows the nucleon to be treated as a point particle since the internal structure (quarks) isn't affecting the interaction much. Wait, but the impulse approximation is more about the treatment of the nucleon as free, not necessarily about their internal structure. So maybe statement 3 isn't part of the assumptions for the impulse approximation.

Statement 4: The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh right, because if the nucleon is bound, then its motion is affected by other nucleons. But in the impulse approximation, you treat the nucleon as if it's free, so it's as if it's not bound. So the interaction acts on a single free nucleon, not considering the binding. So statement 4 is definitely part of the assumptions.

So now, which statements are needed. Let's recap:

1. Yes, because interaction is individual.
2. Yes, nucleus is transparent, so others don't matter.
3. Not sure. Wait, the question is about the approximation leading to nucleons behaving as free. Does the internal structure of the nucleon (quarks being non-relativistic) matter here? I think statement 3 is about the internal state of the nucleon, but the impulse approximation is about external interactions. So perhaps statement 3 isn't required. Because the approximation is treating the nucleon as a whole, not its internal quarks. So maybe statement 3 is not part of it. 

Alternatively, maybe statement 3 is part of some other assumption, like the validity of certain models where quarks are treated in a non-relativistic way. But in the context of the impulse approximation, which is more about the interactions with the nucleon as a whole, statement 3 doesn't directly contribute. So statement 3 might not be part of the assumptions that lead to the impulse approximation.

So the necessary statements are 1, 2, and 4. Which option is that? Looking at the options:

Option A is 1,2,4. So that's the correct combination.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The question is which assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. So let's reevaluate each point.

Statement 3: Qu
