Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully and then think through what's going on.

The question involves two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Then, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns. I need to figure out how many peaks the chemist observes in each case.

First, let's break down what each reaction does.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

Wait, LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It's commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one is a ketone, right? So, when you reduce a ketone with LAH, you should get a secondary alcohol.

So the structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH3-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me draw this correctly. Hexan-3-one has the ketone group on carbon 3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a substituent on carbon 5. Oh wait, 5-methoxy, so the methoxy is on carbon 5.

So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Maybe not. Let me number it. The carbons are 1 to 6.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O (since it's 3-one)

Carbon 4: CH( OCH3 )

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2C(O)(CH2)2CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3.

So the structure is: CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's 3-pentanone. Oh, no, wait, hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3? No, wait, hexan-
