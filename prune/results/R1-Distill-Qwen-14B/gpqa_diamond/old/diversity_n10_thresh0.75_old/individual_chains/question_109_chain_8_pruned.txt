Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Oh right, particle parity. I remember that the parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parities of its components and the parity from the orbital angular momentum part.

Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, so T is the isospin, which for the NN system, I think for two nucleons, T can be 0 or 1. But the problem says T(NN) is 0 in the final state.

The initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term symbol. The general term is (2S+1)^L_J. So 1S0 means 2S+1=1 â†’ S=0. L is S, so L=0, and J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X. So the initial NN state has S=0, L=0, J=0. After emission, the NN state must have T=0, and the emitted particle X has certain properties.

The problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about the angular momentum state of X (the lowercase letters denote that). So each option gives a transition where the NN goes from 1S0 to some state plus X in a certain state. The options are A to D.

We need to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, but when a particle is emitted, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial state's angular momentum (J=0) must equal the sum of the final state's NN angular momentum (let's call it J') and the angular momentum of the emitted particle X (let's call it l, which is denoted by the lowercase letters in the options like s, p, d, f).

Wait, actually, the problem mentions that X is emitted, so the initial NN is in some state (J_initial) and then after emitting X, the NN is in another state (J_final). So the total angular momentum before and after must match. But the initial J_initial is 0, so the sum of J_final and the angular momentum of X should be 0. Oh wait, but angular momentum isn't just spin; it's the vector sum. So J_final + l (orbital part) = 0? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think in terms of combining angular momenta.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the parity conservation. Let's see. The parity of the initial state is determined by the parity of the NN system. Since the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, and parity is (-1)^
