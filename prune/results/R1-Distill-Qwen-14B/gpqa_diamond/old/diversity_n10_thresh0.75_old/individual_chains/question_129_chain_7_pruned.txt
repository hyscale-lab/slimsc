Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and leading through several steps to compound E, which I need to identify. There are also some hints provided, and I have four options to choose from. I'll take each step one by one.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Plus, there are two hints:

a) When compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, while compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me break this down.

Starting with compound A. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 is a strong absorption, which usually corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). So A might be a ketone or maybe an aldehyde, but aldehydes typically have a peak around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, but the carbonyl is also around 1720, sometimes a bit higher. Wait, but 1750 is a bit high for a regular ketone. Maybe it's an ester or an acid? But more likely, it's a ketone because the product after elimination (compound E) has a peak at 1715, which is typical for a ketone. So probably, A is a ketone, perhaps cyclohexanone or something similar.

Now, looking at the reaction of A with HCN to produce B. HCN is a nucleophile and can add to carbonyl groups. So this is likely a nucleophilic addition. For ketones, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. So compound B would be a cyanohydrinâ€”specifically, a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached.

Next, compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd, which is a catalyst for hydrogenation. The cyanide group (CN) would typically be reduced. Wait, but what's the structure of B? Let's think. HCN adds to the carbonyl, so B would have an -OH and a -CN group attached to the same carbon. So when B is hydrogenated, the -CN group would be reduced. The hydrogenation of a nitrile (CN) group with H2 and a catalyst usually gives an amine. Wait, no. Wait, H2 and Pd is for hydrogenation. For nitriles, hydrogenation under certain conditions can give amines. But for a cyanohydrin, which is R-OH and R-CN on adjacent carbons, perhaps the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to an amine?

Wait, maybe not. Let's think again. The cyanohydrin is R2C(OH)-CN. When we hydrogenate that, the nitrile (CN) group would be reduced. The reduction of a nitrile (R-CN) with H2 and Pd would typically yield an amine (R-CH2-NH2?), but wait, that's not correct. Wait, no, nitriles are usually hydrogenated to amines (R-CH2-NH2) under high pressure and with a catalyst like Raney Ni or Pt. But wait, the reaction conditions here are H2 and Pd. Alternatively, if it's a ketone-derived cyanohydrin, then reduction would affect both the hydroxyl and the nitrile. Wait, but the hydroxyl group is an alcohol (R-OH). So under hydrogenation with Pd, would that be reduced? Well, alcohols typically require a catalyst like Raney Ni or something else for reduction, but maybe in this case, the Pd is present and could facilitate the reduction of the nitrile group.

Wait, perhaps the nitrile group is converted into a methylene group (CH2) when hydrogenated. So, H2 and Pd would reduce the nitrile (R-CN) to R-CH2-NH2. But wait, no, I'm getting confused. Another possibility: when a nitrile is hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst like palladium on carbon, under certain conditions, it might be hydrogenated to an amine. But I think another common method is to convert the nitrile to an amine via a different pathway, perhaps using LiAlH4 or other reducing agents. Alternatively, maybe under H2 and a catalyst like Pt or Ni, the nitrile gets hydrogenated to an amine.
