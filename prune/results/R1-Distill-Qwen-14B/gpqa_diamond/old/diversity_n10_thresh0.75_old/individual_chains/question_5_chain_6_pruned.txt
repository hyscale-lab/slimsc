Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, I remember that eigenvectors are vectors that only change by a scalar factor when an operator is applied to them. The scalar is the eigenvalue. Right, the operator here is P, and it's for a muon, which is like a particle similar to an electron but heavier. The direction is along an arbitrary vector n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. 

The problem gives me the components of the operator P in terms of their matrix representations. So P_x, P_y, P_z are each 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so it's a vector in space made up of these components. The direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since it's in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or 90 degrees. Wait, no, actually, any direction in x-z would have φ=0 or φ=π/2, but since it's arbitrary, perhaps we can represent it as (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x² + n_z² =1. Alternatively, we can parameterize it as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), since in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle. So any direction in the x-z plane would fix φ=0, so the direction is given by θ, the angle from the z-axis.

So the operator P along direction n is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z). Wait, no, more accurately, the operator for the component in direction n would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in the x-z plane,
