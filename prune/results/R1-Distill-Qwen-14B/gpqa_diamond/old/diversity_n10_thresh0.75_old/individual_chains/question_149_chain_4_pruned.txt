Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to tackle. Hmm, let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude sample looks mostly like what they expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So each peak is integrating to about 0.5H, maybe? Also, the coupling pattern doesn't suggest spin-spin coupling as the reason. Oh wait, because if it were coupling, the peaks would split each other, right? But they've ruled that out, so it's not like one is split from the other.

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So the mass is the same, meaning same molecular weight, but they're separate peaks. So maybe it's not a degradation product because the mass is same.

Now, the options are A to D. Let's think about each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, if that were the case, the NMR would probably show peaks from the precursor as well. But the NMR is mostly matching except for the two peaks for the same alpha proton. Also, the LC-MS would have a peak with a lower mass than the expected one, because the precursor would have a higher molecular weight (like if you're making a peptide, the precursor could be the starting material before a cleavage step). Here, both LC-MS peaks have the same mass as expected. So I don't think it's A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, for prochiral centers, you might see different shifts. But if the alpha-proton is in a chiral environment, then each enantiomer would have a different shift for that proton. So in the NMR, you'd see two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H. Wait, but in the question, the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. Enantiomers usually lead to distinct peaks because of the different environments. Unless... maybe the compound is not chiral? Wait, if it's a mixture of enantiomers, you would see two different shifts. But if the shifts are similar, perhaps because they're in a symmetrical environment? Hmm, wait, if the molecule is symmetric, maybe the alpha protons are in similar environments even in enantiomers. Not sure. Also, in LC-MS, enantiomers would co-elute under normal conditions since the column might not separate them unless it's a chiral column. But the question mentions the LC-MS shows two peaks at elevated temperature. Wait, maybe the method is using a chiral stationary phase? But then why are the masses the same? Oh wait, same mass but different retention times. But the question says LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity with same mass. So maybe that's a racemic mixture. But wait, if it's a racemic mixture, the NMR would show each H for each enantiomer as two peaks, but perhaps they have the same shift if the environment is symmetric. Hmm, not sure. Or maybe not symmetric. Wait, but the question says the two peaks in the NMR have similar shifts. Enantiomers can cause that, but I'm a bit confused.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Double coupling... I'm not exactly sure what that refers to. Maybe it's an issue during synthesis where the amide bond forms in a way that creates two different coupling partners. Wait, coupling during amide formationâ€”maybe if the coupling reaction resulted in more than one product, or if there's some kind of double bond or something? Or perhaps it's an issue like forming an imine or something else. Alternatively, maybe there's an issue with the coupling causing some sort of splitting, but the question says coupling pattern rules out spin-spin
