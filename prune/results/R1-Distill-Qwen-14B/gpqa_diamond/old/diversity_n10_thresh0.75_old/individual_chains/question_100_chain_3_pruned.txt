Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, what's that? Oh, wait, C3H6 is either propene or propyne. But wait, propene is an alkene, and propyne is an alkyne. Oh, but another possibility is cyclopropane? No, wait, cyclopropane is C3H6 as well, but I think in this context, it's more likely an alkene or alkyne because the next step is bromination.

Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh, right, that's a typical bromination reaction for alkenes. So if A is an alkene, adding bromine in CCl4 would add across the double bond. So if A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), then adding bromine (Br2) would give 1,2-dibromopropane (that's what I think, but wait, maybe 3-bromo-1-propene? No, wait, dibromination would add two Brs. So for propene, adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No wait, no, propene is CH2=CH2-CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So when Br2 adds, it would be CH2Br-CH2-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Adding Br2 to propene (CH2=CHCH3) would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which would be CH2BrCH2BrCH3? Or wait, maybe it's CH2BrCHBrCH3. Oh, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so you get CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So that's compound
