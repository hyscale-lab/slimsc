Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and ratios. Hmm, let me try to work through it.

Alright, the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. They each have masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, maybe the masses aren't directly relevant here. The problem gives me some elemental abundance ratios, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Let me jot down the given data. For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Oh right, those square brackets mean it's a logarithmic abundance ratio. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [Si/Fe] is higher than solar by 0.3, meaning Si is more abundant relative to Fe compared to the Sun.

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So the iron abundance relative to hydrogen is the same as the Sun. H is hydrogen, so [Fe/H] tells us the overall metallicity. Since it's 0, Star_1 has the same [Fe/H] as the Sun.

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg relative to Si is higher by 0.3. More Mg compared to Si than the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. So Mg relative to H is the same as the Sun. So Star_2's Mg abundance is the same as the Sun's.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
Wait, but wait: the usual definition is that for the Sun, [X/H] = 0, so X has the same abundance as in the Sun. So for the Sun, [Fe/H] is zero, which aligns with the given [Fe/H] for Star_1.

Wait, the Sun's data says 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → n
