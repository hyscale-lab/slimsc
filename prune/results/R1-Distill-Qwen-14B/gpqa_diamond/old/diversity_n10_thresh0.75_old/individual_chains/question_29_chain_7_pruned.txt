Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. First, I'll read the question carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this compound by using EMS mutagenesis, which causes point mutations. They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon. We need to determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So, the intact gene and the mutants are given as DNA sequences. Let me look at each mutant's sequence and see what changes they have compared to the wild type.

The intact gene starts with:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing this to the intact gene:
Original: ...TTCTCGCTGGT...
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGT...
So, the changes are at the 4th and 5th positions in that segment. Let me count the letters. Wait, maybe I should write the original and mutant sequences side by side.

Original part (exon 1 area):
...TTTCTCGCTGGTA...
Mutant 1:
...TTTCTACGCTGGTA...
Wait, maybe it's easier to find where the mutations are. Let me align segments.

Looking at the initial sequences:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTA TTA GTC G T ... 

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CATA TTA TTA GTC GC ...

Wait, maybe let me line up the first few nucleotides.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
