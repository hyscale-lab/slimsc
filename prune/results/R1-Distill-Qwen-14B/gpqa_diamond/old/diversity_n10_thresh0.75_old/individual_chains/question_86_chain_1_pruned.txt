Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with my organic chemistry, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions with two unknown compounds, treating them separately with two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. Wait, no, actually, looking again, I think I misread. The first reaction gives the R isomer when treated with LiBH4 and H+, and the second gives the S isomer when treated with BH3 and H+. Or maybe I'm mixing up the reagents and the starting materials. Let me parse this correctly.

So, the first reaction is A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.
The second reaction is B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

Wait, no, the question says "select the proper starting material for both of the reactions." So each of A and B is a starting material treated with a reducing agent, each giving a specific enantiomer.

I think the key here is understanding what these reagents do. LiBH4 and BH3 are both borohydride reducing agents, but I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes, but also for esters under certain conditions, maybe. BH3 is another reducing agent, I think it's used in hydroboration reactions. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, wait, no—BH3 is a Lewis acid and is often involved in the reduction of esters or maybe in the formation of alcohols through hydroboration-oxidation. Hmm, perhaps I need to think about the specific reaction conditions here.

Wait, the products are tetrahydro-pyran-2-ones. So that's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Wait, no, pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. So the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. Oh wait, no, pyran is similar to pyrone. Wait, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2
