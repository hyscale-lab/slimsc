Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach. Let me read through it again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to determine the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished, and the options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle plays a role in the measurement of energy levels, especially when considering their lifetimes. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known, like energy and time.

The formula I think is ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's approximated as ΔE × Δt ≈ ħ, depending on the exact formulation. I should probably look up the exact expression but for the purpose of this problem, maybe the exact factor isn't crucial, just the order of magnitude.

So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is inversely proportional to the uncertainty in time Δt. Here, the lifetimes are given as 10^-9 and 10^-8 seconds. But wait, I'm not sure if the uncertainty in time here is the same as the lifetime of the state. I think when a state has a short lifetime, it's because it's unstable and quickly decays, which leads to a broader energy distribution (so a larger ΔE). So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE is inversely proportional to the lifetime τ.

I should write the formula properly. The uncertainty principle is often stated as ΔE × Δt ≥ ħ/2. So rearranging that, ΔE ≈ ħ / (2Δt). Alternatively, sometimes people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, but the factor might not matter for the order of magnitude.

So the minimum energy difference needed to be distinguishable would be on the order of the uncertainty. If the two states have different lifetimes, what's their corresponding ΔE?

Wait, but the problem is about distinguishing the two energy levels. So each state has its own uncertainty. For E1, the lifetime is 1e-9 sec, so ΔE1 would be about ħ/(2 * 1e-9). For E2, with 1e-8 sec lifetime, ΔE2 would be ħ/(2 * 1e-8). So the energy differences should be larger than these values to be resolved.

Wait, but the
