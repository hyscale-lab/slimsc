Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The reaction scheme goes like this:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form E.

And there are some hints provided. Let me start by looking at the hints and the options to see if I can piece things together.

Hint a) says that when compound A is reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction converts aldehydes or ketones into alkenes by reacting with ylides. So from this, I can infer that compound A must have a carbonyl group because that's what the Wittig reacts with. The product after the Wittig has a cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1,2, and 4. The substituents are methyl groups and a propan-2-ylidene group. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, I think. So the compound formed has a double bond somewhere.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is like CH2-C(CH3)=, but connected as a substituent. Oh wait, maybe it's more like a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a double bond attached. Let me draw this mentally. The cyclopentane ring has substituents:

- Position 1: methyl
- Position 2: methyl
- Position 4: a substituent that's propan-2-ylidene, which is CH2–C(=CH2)– something? Or maybe it's a substituent where the ylidene is attached. Wait, propan-2-ylidene is (CH2)2C=, so it's (CH2)C= where the CH2 is attached to the ring. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)= something, but in the structure, it's part of the ring? Or is it a side substituent.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclopentane ring with a double bond between carbons 4 and something else? No, the substituent is on position 4 as a propan-2-ylidene group. So maybe the structure is that at position 4, there's a CH2 group that is connected to a C that's double bonded. So, like:

cyclopentane ring:
- C1: CH2
- C2: CH2
- C3: CH2
- C4: CH–CH2–C(CH3)= ?

Hmm, not sure.
