Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas.

Alright, first, let's break down each piece of data given.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but wait—the question says "very broad." Carboxylic acids have very broad O-H stretches because they can hydrogen bond extensively. Alcohols also have broad O-H, but maybe less so than acids. So could it be a carboxylic acid?

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm. The 1700 is a strong peak, which probably indicates a carbonyl group. That could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, if the compound has a carboxylic acid, the O-H peak would be very broad, which matches the first part. So maybe the 1700 is the carbonyl from the carboxylic acid.

The 1650 peak is a bit lower than 1700. What could that be? Maybe an conjugated carbonyl group. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation. Wait, aromatic rings with conjugation can show peaks around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹, but that's usually for C=C stretching. Alternatively, if there's an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1730-1740 for esters, but this is 1700, which is more like a ketone or maybe a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, if the 1650 is from an amide or maybe another carbonyl group.

Wait, but the 1700 could be a ketone or an ester. Hmm, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad, and the carbonyl would be around 1700. So perhaps there's a carboxylic acid group and another carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester. Because esters have two carbonyl groups? No, wait, esters have one carbonyl. Oh, wait, perhaps the 1700 is the ester carbonyl, and the 1650 is something else, like an aromatic ring or conjugated double bonds.

Wait, the NMR part says that there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. Because in the 1H NMR, vinyl protons would show up typically around 4.5-6.5 ppm, as doublets or something more complex depending on substitution.

So the compound has an alkene, and maybe a carbonyl group.
