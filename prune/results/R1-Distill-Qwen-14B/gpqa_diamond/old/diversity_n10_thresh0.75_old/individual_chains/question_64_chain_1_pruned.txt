Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, but honestly, I'm a bit confused. Let me read through it again and see if I can break it down step by step.

So, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases formed, and without cooling, these gases passed through three tubes. 

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. So Mg(ClO4)2 is magnesium perchlorate, which is a strong desiccant. I think it's used to absorb water from gases. So any moisture in the gas would be absorbed here. The weight of tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. That suggests that the gas passing through had some water vapor, which was captured by Mg(ClO4)2.

Then, tube 2 is a solution of Ca(OH)2. Calcium hydroxide is a base and would react with acidic gases like CO2. But the problem says that the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so maybe no CO2 was present, or perhaps it wasn't released. Wait, but if the gas didn't react, maybe the gas wasn't acidic. Or perhaps the solution was saturated and couldn't absorb more. Not sure yet.

Tube 3 is red-hot copper. When gases pass through hot copper, probably CO would react. CO would react with copper(II) oxide at high temperatures, but wait, the copper is red-hot. Oh, wait, maybe the gas is CO, because CO would react with CuO. Or maybe it's something else. The result is that the tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. So the gas must have been CO, which reacts with CuO. Because CO is a reducing agent and at high temperatures, it can reduce CuO to copper, but wait, no, wait. Wait, in this setup, the copper is in tube 3 and is red-hot. So when CO passes through, it would react with the hot Cu, perhaps. Let me think: CO is known to react with CuO when heated. The reaction is 2 CuO + CO → CO2 + Cu2O, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the copper is in a +2 state as CuO, and the gas is CO, then the reaction might be CO + CuO → CO2 + Cu. Because that's a common reaction where CO acts as a reducing agent. So the CuO would be reduced to Cu, and CO would be oxidized to CO2.

Wait, but the problem says that CuO was formed. Hmm, that's confusing. Because if the reaction produced Cu, not CuO, why would CuO form? Maybe I got that reversed. Alternatively, perhaps the initial copper is in a different state. Wait, the tube is filled with red-hot copper, which I think is metallic copper (Cu). So when a gas like CO is passed through, the reaction would be: 2 Cu + CO → 2 CuO + C (carbon). Wait, no, that's not right.
