Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. The final product, product 4, is supposed to have a certain number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, and I need to figure out how many that is.

Let me break down each step to see what's happening.

First Reaction: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. Hmm, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When ketones react with bromine, I think it's about the addition of bromine. Wait, ketones can undergo several reactions with bromine. One possibility is the addition in a cyclic transition state, like the formation of a dihydroxybromide or perhaps a dibromide if it's a more vigorous condition. Alternatively, maybe it's some kind of substitution? No, wait, cyclohexanone isn't a halide, so substitution isn't likely. Oh, right! The bromine could add to the carbonyl group. So cyclohexanone has a C=O. Adding Br2 would probably form a geminal dibromide. That makes sense because the bromine adds across the carbonyl group. So product 1 would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Wait, or maybe 1,2-dibromocyclohexan-1-ol? No, wait. Let me think again. Adding bromine to a ketone typically gives a bromohydrin if it's an addition with water, but in this case, it's Br2. Oh wait, bromine in a non-aqueous condition might lead to 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Alternatively, if it's a diaddition, but I'm a bit fuzzy. Maybe I should look up the reaction. Oh right, the addition of Br2 to a ketone. I remember that the bromine adds to the carbonyl, so the ketone O would have two Brs attached. Wait, no, the carbonyl is C=O. So Br2 would add across the double bond, making a vicinal dihalide. Wait, no, a ketone has a C=O. Adding Br2 would break the double bond and add Br to each end. So the
