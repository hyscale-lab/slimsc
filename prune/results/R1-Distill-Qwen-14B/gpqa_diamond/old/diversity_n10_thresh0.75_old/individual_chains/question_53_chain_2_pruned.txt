Alright, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I want to make sure I think it through correctly. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. So that's a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups. Esters have a carbonyl group, so I'm thinking maybe there's an ester functional group attached to the benzene ring. So ester is O-C-O, right? So the formula would have something like O2 from the ester.

The 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let's see what each of those corresponds to. Two signals for aromatic-H. So the benzene ring has two different types of protons. Since it's a di-substituted ring, the substituents must be in a position that causes the aromatic protons to split into two sets. Maybe para-substituted? Or ortho? Wait, no, para would have equivalent protons, so NMR would show fewer signals. Di-substituted could be meta or para. If it's para, the aromatic protons would be split into two sets of two each, but since it's a six-membered ring, I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for aromatic-H. So two distinct sets. So perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two different types of protons. Maybe the substituents are in the para positions, but with different groups attached. Or perhaps it's an ortho substitution, but that might lead to more splitting. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted ring where one substituent is an ester and another is something else. Wait, but the ester is an O-containing group. So the substituents could be an ester group and another group, maybe a methyl or something else.

Moving on, two signals for vinyl-H: one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So maybe there's a vinyl group attached to the ring. The structures could be something like a styrene or similar. Wait, but an ester is O-C-O, so maybe it's something like a benzyl ester or a substituted acrylate?

Wait, the aromatic ring has substituents
