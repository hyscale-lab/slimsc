Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct chemical formula of an unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the question provides some data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My job is to analyze each of these to determine the correct formula among the four options: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is very broad. Carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they're strong acids and can form hydrogen bonds extensively. Alcohols also have a broad O-H stretch, but maybe less so than carboxylic acids. Another possibility is an -OH group in a phenol, but those can also be broad.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester. Alternatively, 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl group or perhaps an amide, but amides have N-H stretches which aren't mentioned here. Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl protons. So maybe something like an ester or a ketone with another group.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It mentions peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has a double bond. That might explain the 1650 cm^-1 peak in FTIR as a conjugated double bond. For example, in a carbonyl group adjacent to a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) or an ester with a double bond nearby.

Now the Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z =45. Let's think about
