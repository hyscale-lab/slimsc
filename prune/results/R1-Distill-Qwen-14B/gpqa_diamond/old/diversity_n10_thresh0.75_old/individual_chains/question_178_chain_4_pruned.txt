Okay, so I've got this physics problem about Lagrangians and renormalizability. I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of a coupling constant determines whether the theory is renormalizable. If the dimension is positive, the theory is non-renormalizable, and negative means it's renormalizable? Wait, wait, no, wait. I think it's the other way around. Or maybe it's that the coupling must have a certain dimension for the theory to be renormalizable.

Let me recall: A theory is renormalizable if all the interaction terms in the Lagrangian have coupling constants with positive or zero mass dimension. Because the superficial degree of divergence is determined by the power counting, and if it's non-positive, then the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d - (n_vertices * (mass dimension of coupling)). Or wait, more accurately, for each term in the Lagrangian, you calculate its dimension in terms of mass. Then, for the interaction term, the dimension must be ≤ d, where d is the spacetime dimension, for the term to be renormalizable.

But wait, the general rule is that the interaction term should have dimension ≤ d, since if a term has dimension higher than d, then the corresponding Feynman diagram would have a superficial degree of divergence positive (so it's divergent and not renormalizable). So if the coupling has a dimension such that the term is dimension ≤ d, the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I think the correct approach is to compute the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. Since the Lagrangian must have mass dimension d (because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is d-dimensional), each term in the Lagrangian must also have mass dimension d.

So for each term in L, [L]_M = d.

In this problem, the given term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν}
