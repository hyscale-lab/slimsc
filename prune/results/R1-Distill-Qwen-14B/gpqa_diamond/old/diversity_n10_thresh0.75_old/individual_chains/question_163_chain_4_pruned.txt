Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the steps, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, okay. So Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide. I remember that hydroxides can react with acids to form salts and water. The reaction should produce Fe³+ ions, right? Let's write down the reaction. Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid like HCl probably. So the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O

Wait, since it's a monobasic acid, each molecule provides one H+ ion. So Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups, so it would need three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

First, I think I need to calculate how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... let's see, iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. Oh, but wait, Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3, so it's Fe + 3(OH). So each OH is 17 g/mol (16+1). So Fe is 55.85, O is 3*(16) from the OH groups? Wait, no, wait. Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Each OH is 17 g/mol. So total is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 55.85 (Fe) plus 3*(16 + 1) for each OH. So 3*(17) is 51. So yeah, 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol is the number of moles.

So moles = 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ let's calculate that. 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles. Wait, because 106.85 times 0.000936 is about 0.1 grams. Let me calculate it more accurately.

106.85 * 0.000936 = 0.1? Let's see: 106.85 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.09999, which is about 0.1. So
