Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's break it down step by step.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group. Ester groups typically show strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹. So, I expect there's a carbonyl (C=O) from the ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum, there are six signals. Let's parse each part:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H: A di-substituted benzene usually has two sets of aromatic protons if the substitution is para. Or, maybe if it's ortho or meta, but for di-substituted, para would give two sets. Wait, but if the substituents are different, perhaps the ring's symmetry changes. Hmm. But in di-substituted, if both substituents are same, like two ester groups, then the aromatic protons would be in two groups: two doublets each for the two Hs. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, the aromatic protons are as two doublets. So maybe the two substituents are the same, making the ring have two sets of aromatic Hs.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H: One is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH-, but wait, in this case, maybe it's part of a conjugated system. Alternatively, if the substituents are ester groups attached to the benzene ring, perhaps each ester is connected to a vinyl group. Wait, but an ester is usually R-O-CO-O-R, no, wait, no. Ester is RCOOR', right. So if the substituents are ester groups, perhaps each is a -OOCR group attached to the ring.

Wait, no, that might not fit. Let me think again. If each substituent is an ester group, like OOCR, then each would have their own structure.

But the NMR says two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl Hs are typically from CH₂=CH- groups. So maybe the substituents are not ester groups but something else. Wait, but the FTIR
