Okay, so I have this chemistry question about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is divided into two parts, A and B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let me recall what tautomerism is. Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, usually in a molecule resulting in a different structure. It's like when a hydrogen moves from one atom to another adjacent one, causing a change in the double bonds. For example, in compounds with conjugated double bonds or carbonyl groups, tautomerism can occur, like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Now, looking at the two compounds for part A: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups (O double bonded to C) on a benzene ring. Quinones are known to have conjugated double bonds because of the aromatic ring and the ketones. I think benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism because it has two carbonyl groups that can conjugate. Wait, but wait, benzoquinone is fully conjugated, so maybe it's more about resonance. Wait, tautomerism requires the movement of a hydrogen and a shift in a double bond, like keto-enol.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, each at positions 1,3,5. The structure is more like three carbonyl groups alternating around the ring. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Let me think. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, each of the carbonyls in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is connected to a carbon which is next to another carbonyl. Wait, but each carbon with a carbonyl is connected to two carbons which are also carbonyls. So, does that mean that there's no hydrogen adjacent to any of the carbonyl groups? Because, for example, if you have a structure like O=C-R, where R is another carbonyl group, then the adjacent carbons might not have hydrogens.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: the structure would be a six-membered ring with three carbonyl groups opposite each other. Each carbonyl is on a carbon that's connected to two other carbonyls because the ring is 1,3,5. So each carbon with the =O is connected to two CH2 groups. No, wait, no, wait. The ring is cyclohexane, so each carbon in the ring is connected to two others. Let me imagine the structure. Each of the three carbonyl groups is on alternate carbons. So, each carbonyl carbon is connected to two other carbons that are also carbonyl groups. So, the structure is like O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C-C, arranged in a ring. Wait, but that might not be possible because of the ring size. Alternatively, the ring has each of the 1,3,5 positions as carbonyls, and the other positions (2,4,6) are CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl group is on a carbon that is flanked by two CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is at position 1, with 2 and 6 being CH2 groups.

So, for tautomerism, each carbonyl (like a ketone) requires a hydrogen on an adjacent carbon. But in this case, each of the carbonyl carbons is connected to two CH2 groups. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (like position 2 and 6) are CH2, which have two hydrogens each. So, each CH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl. But wait, for tautomerism, the hydrogen must be on the carbon adjacent to a carbonyl, right? So, in that case, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does have such hydrogens. For example, position 2 is a CH2 group attached to the carbonyl at position 1. So, the C2 has two H's, so it can potentially lose a hydrogen and form a double bond with the carbonyl, leading to a tautomer.

Wait, but wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, maybe it can't tautomerize because the structure doesn't allow for the necessary H shift. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is so symmetrical that any tautomer would just be the same as the original. Or perhaps the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because there's no available position for the H to shift to.

Wait, thinking again. Benzoquinone is C6H4O2 with two ketone groups. Tautomerism in benzoquinone would involve moving a hydrogen from one position to another, perhaps leading to a dihydro derivative. But wait, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound, so does it have any H's that can move? Or perhaps, considering it's a quinone, it's more about resonance structures than tautomerism. Wait, maybe benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because it's fully conjugated and lacks the necessary H's for the shift.

Alternatively, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each of the adjacent CH2 groups has Hs. So, the molecule can undergo tautomerism. Wait, but if the molecule is symmetric, maybe any tautomer formed would be the same as the original, or if not, perhaps the compound doesn't undergo tautomerism because of steric hindrance or symmetry.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. Which of these two compounds can't undergo tautomerism. So, the one that doesn't have any hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group can't undergo tautomerism.

Looking at benzoquinone: the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Each ketone is on a carbon adjacent to two other carbons, which are part of the ring. The ring's C atoms are each bonded to two other C's. So, the carbonyl C has two adjacent C's which are part of the ring. Do those adjacent C's have any H's? In benzene rings, all carbons are bonded to two other C's and one H each (in the case of a substituted benzene), but wait, quinones have two O's. Let me think, the structure of benzoquinone is O=C6H4O, but that's not accurate. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Benzene has six carbons, and the quinone has two of them as carbonyls. So, each carbonyl group is at para positions (1 and 4, for example). In this structure, each carbonyl carbon is connected to two other carbons, which are part of the ring. Now, each of those adjacent carbons (to the carbonyl) is a CH, because benzene is a six-membered ring with alternating double bonds. Wait, wait, no. Wait, in the quinone structure, the ring might not be fully conjugated because of the ketone groups. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe looking up the structure would help, but I can't do that. Alternatively, I'll think about whether benzoquinone can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. I think benzoquinone is a dienophile and is involved in Diels-Alder reactions, but I'm not sure about tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe it doesn't have any H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups because all the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which might not have H's. Wait, in the case of benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring. So, each carbonyl C is connected to two other Cs from the ring. Those adjacent Cs are in the ring, which are each connected to two other C's and one H (since benzene is a six-membered ring with each C having one H except when substituted). Wait, benzoquinone has two ketone substituents, so the ring would have two carbonyls and four CH groups. But the carbonyl C is not part of the ring, because the ring is C6, and the substituents are O on each of two carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the structure of para-benzoquinone is a benzene ring where two opposite carbons (like positions 1 and 4) have ketone groups, so O=C6H4-O=C. Wait no, that can't be. Wait, no, benzoquinone has two ketone groups on adjacent carbons? Or opposite?

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about which compound is more likely to undergo tautomerism. Tautomerism usually occurs in molecules with adjacent carbonyl groups, or when there are conjugated carbonyls. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups in a conjugated system (the benzene ring), so maybe it can undergo tautomerism, perhaps leading to a dihydro form. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three carbonyl groups. Each of the adjacent carbons (like the CH2 groups at positions 2,4,6) have Hs. So, each CH2 is next to a carbonyl. So, each CH2 can potentially lose a H and form a double bond with the adjacent carbonyl, leading to a tautomer. Alternatively, since the molecule is symmetrical, maybe the tautomer would just be the same as the original.

Wait, but if all positions are symmetrical, any tautomer formed would be identical to the starting material, so perhaps it can't form a different tautomer, meaning it doesn't show tautomerism. Or maybe it's the opposite: the presence of multiple Hs allows tautomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione cannot undergo tautomerism because the carbonyl groups are too symmetrical, so any tautomer would be the same as the original. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone cannot undergo tautomerism because of the lack of adjacent H's. Wait, no, because in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons in the ring have H's. So, they could participate in tautomerism. So, perhaps benzoquinone does undergo tautomerism, implying that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is the one that doesn't.

Wait, but then why can't cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione undergo tautomerism? Because each of the CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls has two Hs. So, each can lose a H and form a double bond with the carbonyl. So, maybe cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can undergo tautomerism, implying that benzoquinone can't. But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, maybe the cyclohexane trione is more rigid, and due to steric hindrance, the tautomerism is not possible. Or perhaps the molecule is such that any tautomer is not stable because of ring strain or other factors.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the possibility that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't undergo tautomerism. Why? Because the molecule is symmetrical, and any tautomer formed would result in a structure that's identical to the original, thus not leading to a distinct isomer. So, the molecule can't show tautomerism because the tautomer would not be a different form.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. Wait, another approach: tautomerism requires a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl group. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Are there any Hs alpha to them (i.e., on the adjacent carbons)?

In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene ring. Each carbonyl C is connected to two other C's in the ring. The adjacent C's (in the ring) have H's. So, each carbonyl group has adjacent H's. Hence, benzoquinone can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but if that's the case, then cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione also has H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups. So, why would it not show tautomerism?

Wait, perhaps in the case of cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the molecule is so symmetric that any tautomer is just a rotation or a mirror image of the original, making it the same compound. So, the structure doesn't allow for a distinct tautomer. Hence, the molecule doesn't show tautomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione has three carbonyl groups in a symmetrical fashion, making it impossible to form a tautomer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione is a fully conjugated system, so tautomerism isn't possible because the H's are already in positions that don't allow for a shift. Not sure.

I'm a bit stuck on part A, but perhaps I should move to part B and see if that helps.

Part B asks which of the two compounds shows optical isomerism. The options are methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, if a molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-CO-OCH3. Wait, No, wait. Let me think: 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The carboxylic acid is at the end. So, the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3? Wait, no. Wait, the formula for 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but with a hydroxyl on the 2nd carbon. So, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COO^- (but as an ester, the -OH would be replaced by an ester group). Wait, no, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3 (methyl ester). Now, looking at the structure, the central carbon (second carbon) has the OH, and is connected to CH3, COOCH3, and two other groups. Wait, no: the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So, the second carbon (CH) has:

- CH3 (from the first carbon)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from the third carbon)
- and another CH (the same as the first carbon?)

Wait, no, wait. Let me write this out.

The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate part is -CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, propanoate is a three-carbon chain. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, the correct structure is CH3-CHOH-COOCH3. So the carbon chain is: COOCH3 is the first carbon, then CH(OH), then CH3. So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3. So, the middle carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- COOCH3
- OH
- CH3
- and another H? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the structure would be:

O
||O
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. As an ester, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the middle carbon (the 2nd carbon) is CH(OH). That carbon is connected to:

- The COOCH3 group (from the 3rd carbon)
- The CH3 group (from the 1st carbon)
- The OH group
- And another H.

Wait, that can't be right because if it's CH(OH), then it's a CH with an OH, but I'm not sure. Let me imagine the structure:

Carbon 1: CH3

Carbon 2: C connected to:

- Carbon 1 (CH3)
- OH
- Carbon 3 (COOCH3)
- Another H?

Wait, that can't be because that would make four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. So, on carbon 2, that's four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Wait, but wait, one of the substituents is an H, which is the same as another substituent (the H's on the same carbon). Wait, no, the substituents are:

Carbon 2 has four groups: 

- CH3 (from C1)
- OH
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- and another H attached to C2.

Wait, so does that make four different groups? Because the substituents are:

1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. H

Wait, but then one substituent is H. So, carbon 2 has four different groups (since CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H are all different). So, if that's the case, then the molecule has a chiral center at C2, so it would exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the OH is attached to the same carbon. So, is the carbon connected to four different groups?

Let's list them:

- CH3 (from C1)
- COOCH3 (from C3)
- OH
- H

So, four different substituents: yes. So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. Maleic acid is a di-carboxylic acid with two double bonds. So, the structure of fumarate would be with two ester groups and a double bond between the two central carbons.

Wait, the structure of fumarate is CH2=CH(COOOR)2. So, the dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2
       |
       COOCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumarate is the cis isomer of maleate. So, the structure is (Z)-butenedioic acid. The dimethyl ester would have two methyl ester groups on adjacent carbons connected by a double bond.

So, the structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(OCH3)? No, wait. Wait, no, fumarate is (E)-butenedioate, but wait, no. Wait, maleic anhydride is the cis version, and fumaric acid is the trans. So, dimethyl fumarate would be trans, so the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Wait, but regardless of that, does dimethyl fumarate have any chiral centers? Let's look. The double bond is between the two central carbons, each connected to two ester groups. So, the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So, each of the two central carbons is bonded to:

- One COOCH3 group
- Two CH2 groups (but not exactly, as the structure is CH2=CH... )

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out mentally:

The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has:

On the left carbon: one CH2 group (from the double bond) and two COOCH3 groups? No, wait, no, in the structure CH2=C(COOCH3)2, each of the two central carbons (the double bond carbons) have:

Left carbon: CH2- (connected to the right carbon via double bond)
Right carbon: C connected to two COOCH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let me think about symmetry. If the molecule is symmetric across the double bond, then it might not have a chiral center.

In dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on the same side (if it's the cis isomer) or opposite sides (trans). Wait, but dimethyl fumarate is the trans isomer because fumarate is the trans form.

So, the structure is: 

COOCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2
       |
       COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-2,3-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. So, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O-C-OCH3
    ||
    O

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

COOCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2-COOCH3

No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, no. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3, but that's not right. Alternatively, I think I'm confusing it with other esters.

Wait, wait. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's incorrect. No, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, which is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, its dimethyl ester would be CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2
       |
       COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me imagine it as:

The molecule is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH in fumaric acid. So, the dimethyl ester would replace the two -OH groups with OCH3. So, the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is connected to a COOCH3 group.

Wait, but in that case, each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups attached. So, each of these carbons would have:

Left carbon: bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group (from the double bond).
Right carbon: bonded to two COOCH3 groups and a CH2 group.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again. The structure is:

- The molecule has a central double bond: CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, no, the correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CO(O)OCH3? No, that's more like the structure of something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the symmetry of dimethyl fumarate. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't have any chiral centers.

In dimethyl fumarate (trans), the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-C=CH2
       |
       COOCH3

Wait, that would mean that each of the double bond's carbons has one COOCH3 group and one CH2 group. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2
       |
COOCH3-C=C-COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
       |
       COOCH3

But that would be a single bond, not a double bond. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then any potential chiral centers would be mirrored, making the molecule achiral.

In dimethyl fumarate, if the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, there are no chiral centers, meaning it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait: if the molecule is symmetric, then it can't have a chiral center because any chiral center would have a mirror image, making the molecule achiral overall.

So, in dimethyl fumarate, the two ester groups are on opposite sides, leading to a symmetric structure. Therefore, the molecule isn't chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, for part B, the compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Putting it all together: For part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. Because cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism, but I'm not sure. Wait, earlier I thought that the trione might not show tautomerism because the tautomer would be the same as the original, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's re-examine part A. Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

If benzoquinone can show tautomerism, then the answer would be that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't show tautomerism because it's fully conjugated, and any H shift would require breaking the conjugation, which isn't favorable. So, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the trione doesn't show tautomerism because it's symmetrical and any tautomer would be the same as the original.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone does not show tautomerism because it's a stable compound with no available H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups. But earlier I thought that the adjacent H's are present.

I'm a bit stuck here, but let's proceed with the assumption that part A's correct answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. Or perhaps it's benzoquinone.

Wait, another approach: which of the two compounds is more likely to undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone has conjugated carbonyl groups, making it more likely to undergo tautomerism. Wait, but tautomerism is about hydrogen shifts, so perhaps both can undergo it, but one doesn't.

Alternatively, maybe the trione doesn't show tautomerism because it's a symmetrical molecule, making any tautomer identical to the original. So, it can't show tautomerism.

So, for part A, the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, no, because the question says "the compound that does not show tautomerism." So, if A is the one that doesn't, then for part A, the answer would be either benzoquinone or the trione.

Wait, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism. Because I'm trying to think of whether it can undergo tautomerism, but I can't remember any specific examples. Maybe it's more about being a fully conjugated system, making tautomerism not possible.

Alternatively, maybe the trione is the one that can't undergo tautomerism.

I'm not entirely sure, but proceeding with the assumption that part A's answer is that cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione doesn't show tautomerism. So, A is the trione.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the trione has H's adjacent to the carbonyl groups, which would allow tautomerism. So perhaps I should reverse that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for common examples. For example, is there any tautomerism in 1,3,5-cyclohexatrione? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the trione doesn't show tautomerism because the molecule is too rigid, making the tautomerization not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzoquinone is the one that doesn't show tautomerism. So, A would be benzoquinone.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the assumption that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism, making A the correct answer for part A.

In that case, part A: A is benzoquinone.

Part B: B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which shows optical isomerism.

Looking at the options:

Options:

A) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

B) A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

C) A = cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, B = dimethyl fumarate.

D) A = benzoquinone, B = dimethyl fumarate.

If my earlier reasoning is correct, then:

A) For part A, if A is benzoquinone, then option B or D would have A as benzoquinone.

For part B, if the correct answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, then the options B and A would have B as that.

So, if part A is benzoquinone and part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the correct option would be B.

But wait, another possibility: I thought that dimethyl fumarate doesn't show optical isomerism because it's symmetric. So, for part B, the correct compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the options:

If A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), and B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism), then the correct option is B.

Looking at the options, option B is: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, the answer would be option B.

But wait, another possibility: if A is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, and B is dimethyl fumarate (which doesn't show optical isomerism). So, in that case, the answer would be C, but that contradicts part B's reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in part B. Let me re-examine dimethyl fumarate.

Dimethyl fumarate's structure is (E)-CH2=C(COOCH3)2. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. The molecule has two identical groups (COOCH3) on each end. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it's not chiral, so no optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So, putting it all together: part A is benzoquinone (doesn't show tautomerism), part B is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (shows optical isomerism). Thus, option B is correct.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the question in two parts:

### Part A: Compound that does not show tautomerism
Tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and a shift in bonding, typically requiring a hydrogen atom adjacent to a carbonyl group. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two carbonyl groups on a benzene ring. The carbonyl carbons are part of the aromatic system, and the adjacent carbons in the ring are bonded to hydrogens. However, due to the fully conjugated aromatic system, tautomerism is unlikely because the necessary hydrogen shift would disrupt conjugation, making benzoquinone the compound that does not show tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three carbonyl groups on a cyclohexane ring. Each carbonyl carbon is adjacent to a CH₂ group with hydrogens. These hydrogens can shift to form a tautomer, so cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does show tautomerism.

Thus, the compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Compound that shows optical isomerism
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (CH(OH)) is bonded to:
   - CH₃ (methyl group),
   - OH (hydroxyl group),
   - COOCH₃ (carboxylic ester group),
   - H (hydrogen atom).
   Since this carbon is bonded to four different groups, it is a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂. The molecule has a plane of symmetry due to the trans configuration of the double bond, making it achiral. Therefore, it does not show optical isomerism.

Thus, the compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from both parts:
- **A = benzoquinone** (does not show tautomerism),
- **B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** (shows optical isomerism).

The correct option is **B**.

**Answer: B**
