Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it my best shot.

Alright, the question is about a reaction involving an anhydride and a cyclopentadiene derivative. Let's break down what's given.

First, the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride has a single peak in its 1H NMR at 7 ppm. Hmm, I remember that protons on carbonyl groups (like in anhydrides) can show up around 7 ppm. Wait, but wait—if it's an anhydride, there are usually two carbonyl groups. But the NMR shows a single peak. Maybe the structure is symmetrical somehow. Like, maybe the two carbonyl groups are equivalent, so the protons adjacent to them are equivalent too. So in the 1H NMR, they would merge into a single peak. That makes sense.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the peaks are at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. I think the 137 ppm is likely the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (maybe a methylene next to the carbonyl?), and the 165 ppm is the carbonyl carbon itself. Wait, but anhydrides have two carbonyl carbons. Oh wait, but maybe in this case, the carbonyls are equivalent, so they give a single peak. Wait, but 13C NMR usually shows each unique carbon. So if the structure is symmetric, perhaps the two carbonyl carbons are the same, so 165 ppm is from both. But wait, anhydrides have two carbonyls, so maybe each is at 165. Wait, but why two peaks in 13C? Oh, wait, the question says two peaks. So 137 and 165. So that would imply two different carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the anhydride is a cyclic anhydride. Dicarboxylic acids often form cyclic anhydrides, like succinic anhydride or something. But the initial acid has a cis-alkene, so maybe the anhydride is formed from a cis-dicarboxylic acid. Wait, but when you dehydrate a cis-dicarboxylic acid, which would form a cyclic anhydride with the two carbonyl groups adjacent to each other.

Wait, perhaps it's a structure like this: O=C-O-C-O=C-O with the two carbonyl groups adjacent. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a non-cyclic anhydride, but that might not have symmetry. Hmm.

Wait, but the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Maybe those are the protons adjacent to the carbonyl. So if there's symmetry, maybe there are two equivalent protons, but they'd merge into a singlet. But wait, 7 ppm is usually aromatic protons, but this isn't an aromatic compound. Oh wait, no—protons next to electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls can deshield and appear around 7 ppm. Like in an anhydride, the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are deshielded and show up around 7 ppm.

So maybe the structure is something like this: CH2-CO-O-CO-CH2, but that's a cyclic structure. Wait, but wait—if the starting material is a cis-alkene, the structure would have the two double bond carbons each attached to a COOH group. So when you dehydrate, you form an anhydride. So maybe it's a five-membered ring? Like, O=C-O-CH2-CH2-CO-O. No, that doesn't make a ring. Wait, perhaps it's a four-membered or five-membered ring.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So all the protons that are equivalent are showing up as one peak. If the anhydride is symmetrical, perhaps each side has the same protons. So maybe the structure is symmetric, like the two carbonyl groups are on either end, connected by a symmetrical chain. So perhaps the structure is such that the two carbonyl groups are across from each other in a ring, making the protons equivalent.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about what the anhydride looks like. When a cis-dicarboxylic acid is dehydrated, the two -COOH groups lose water and form an anhydride. The cis configuration would lead to a trans arrangement in the anhydride. Hmm. Wait, maybe the structure is something like:

O
||
O-C-O
   \
    C
   / \
  C   C
  |   |
O   O
||   ||

No, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bicyclic structure. But maybe it's simpler. Let's think about the reaction next.

The anhydride is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene, and the tetramethyl substitution is on positions 1,2,3,4. So the structure is a cyclopentadiene where each of the four carbons (positions 1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. Wait, but cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Wait, no—wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, no. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. But wait, that's not possible because that would make it a conjugated diene in a five-membered ring, but the positions would be a bit different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentene with a double bond between 1 and 2, and another between 3 and 4. So the ring has double bonds at 1-2 and at 3-4. But then that's a conjugated diene in a ring.

But the compound is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So each of the carbons 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group.

Wait, that would mean the cyclopentadiene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, and each of the four carbons in those double bonds has a methyl group. So each double bond carbon is CH2 (since each is connected to a methyl group). Hmm.

Wait, when an anhydride reacts with a diene, it's likely a Diels-Alder reaction. The diene (the cyclopentadiene derivative) would act as the diene, and the anhydride as the dienophile.

Wait, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (conjugated double bonds) reacts with a dienophile (like an anhydride). The reaction forms a six-membered ring with two new stereocenters.

So the reaction between the anhydride and the cyclopentadiene would form a bicyclic structure, perhaps? Or maybe just a six-membered ring.

Wait, but the product has a molecular formula of C13H16O3. Let's see: the anhydride would have CO groups. Let me figure out the molecular formula.

The starting anhydride is derived from a dicarboxylic acid. Let's say the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH (but that's for a trans case). Wait, but the original acid is a cis-diacid. So perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond? Wait, no, the acid has a cis-alkene. Oh wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? Hmm, no, if it's a cis-alkene, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, so HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but that's not possible because the double bond would be in the middle. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it a cis configuration. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the original acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a cis double bond elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the molecular formula.

The anhydride would have the formula (COOH)₂ losing H2O, so the formula would be (CO)₂O plus substituents. Let's say the original acid is a four-carbon acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When it loses two H2O molecules (since dehydration of a diacid forms an anhydride), it becomes (CH2)2(CO)₂O. So the formula would be C4H4O3. But wait, the product after reaction is C13H16O3. The cyclopentadiene derivative is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene.

Wait, the molecular formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene: each of the four carbons has a methyl group. So the cyclopentadiene has five carbons in the ring. Four of them have methyl groups, so the formula would be C9H12. Because each methyl adds one carbon and three hydrogens. So the ring has 5 carbons, four with a methyl (so 4*(CH3)), and the other carbon is CH. Wait, no, the structure is 1,2,3,4 positions. So each of these positions is CH2 in the ring? Hmm, perhaps the formula is C9H12. Let me check: the ring is cyclopentadiene, which has five carbons. Each of the four positions (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So each of those four carbons has a CH2 group (since each is attached to a methyl group). Wait, no, the ring is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. So each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) is a CH2 group with a methyl attached. So each of these would be CH2(CH3). So the four methyl groups contribute 4*(CH3) = 4 carbons and 12 hydrogens. The ring has five carbons, but four of them are each attached to a methyl. So the ring itself is made up of five carbons, four of which are each attached to a methyl. So the formula would be:

The ring: 5 carbons + 4*(CH3) = 5 +4 =9 carbons.

Hydrogens: Each methyl has 3 H, so 4*3 =12. The ring has double bonds, so each CH2 group (assuming each of the four positions has a CH2 attached to methyl) would have two H each. Wait, the ring is 1,3-cyclopentadiene with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups, and 5 is CH2. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, the molecular formula of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene is C9H12. Because cyclopentadiene is C5H6 (if it's a conjugated diene), but with four methyl groups, each adding a CH3, so 4*(CH3) is 4C and 12H. So the total would be 5+4=9 C, and 6+12=18 H? Wait, but the original cyclopentadiene would have a certain number of hydrogens. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think that the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which has four double bonds—no, wait, a five-membered ring can't have two non-conjugated double bonds. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have two double bonds: 1-2 and 3-4. So that's a conjugated diene.

So the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. So each of these carbons is connected to one methyl. So each is a CH(CH3) group. Since they're in a ring, they're part of the double bonds.

Wait, but cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. So each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group.

So for each of these four carbons: each is a CH2 group? Or a CH group? Wait, perhaps each is a CH2 group attached to a methyl, but that might not make sense with the double bonds. Alternatively, perhaps each of these four positions has a CH that is part of the double bond and attached to a methyl group.

This is getting a bit complicated, but maybe I can move forward. The molecular formula of the diene derivative is given, and the product after the reaction is C13H16O3.

The anhydride's formula: if the starting acid is a four-carbon diacid (like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH), the anhydride would be (CH2)2(CO)2O. Molecular formula would be C4H4O3. Then, when reacted with the diene (C9H12), the product would be C4H4O3 + C9H12 → C13H16O3 + something? Wait, but wait, the Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition. So the diene (4 pi electrons) reacts with the dienophile (2 pi electrons). The reaction forms a six-membered ring, and the formula would be the sum of the two reactants minus the two hydrogens from the dienophile. Wait, no—Diels-Alder adds the diene and dienophile, so the product's formula would be the sum of the two, minus two H2O? Or no, perhaps just the sum, because they form a new ring without losing any atoms.

Wait, no, the Diels-Alder reaction is a [4+2] addition, so the product combines the diene (4 carbons) and the dienophile (2 carbons, since an anhydride is a good dienophile; for example, the dienophile could be something like maleic anhydride, which is four atoms but contributes two carbons to the product ring). So the product would have 4 (diene) + 2 (dienophile) = 6 carbons in the ring, plus any substituents.

Wait, but in this case, the dienophile is the anhydride. So let's think about the molecular formula. The diene is C9H12. The anhydride, let's say, is C4H4O3 (if it's a four-carbon diacid anhydride). So when they react, the product would be C4 + C9 = C13, and H4 + H12 = H16, and O3. So the product formula is indeed C13H16O3. That matches the given formula.

So the product is a Diels-Alder adduct. The dienophile is the anhydride (which is a good dienophile), and the diene is the cyclopentadiene derivative.

Now, when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the endo rule might come into play, but perhaps the major and minor products are due to different regiochemistry or stereochemistry.

Wait, but the question says that two products were formed: a major and a minor. Both have the same molecular formula. The difference is in their structures.

The next part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor does not. NOESY detects nuclear Overhauser effect, which occurs when two protons are close in space (within 5 Å), even if they are not necessarily coupled. So a cross-peak indicates that the two protons are spatially close.

So the major product has protons that are near each other, while the minor product doesn't. This suggests that the major product has a specific stereochemistry where certain protons are close, perhaps on the same face of the ring.

So the question is, which two resonances in the major product's 1H NMR are connected by this cross-peak.

The options are:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm
B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm
C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm
D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

Hmm. So I need to figure out which protons are close in the structure of the major product.

Let me think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The diene (cyclopentadiene derivative) would form a six-membered ring with the dienophile (anhydride). The endo transition state is usually favored, so the substituents (like the anhydride's groups) would end up on the same face as the diene's substituents.

Wait, but the dienophile is an anhydride, which has two carbonyl groups. So when it reacts, the substituents from the dienophile would be on the same face as the diene's substituents.

In the product, the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride would become part of the six-membered ring. The diene's substituents (the methyl groups) would be attached to the cyclopentadiene part.

So the product would have two ester groups (from the anhydride) attached to the ring. Wait, no—when the dienophile is an anhydride, the Diels-Alder adduct forms a six-membered ring with two ester groups or ketones? No, the Diels-Alder adds the dienophile's double bond. Wait, the anhydride has a structure like O=C-O-C=O. So when it reacts as a dienophile, the two carbonyl groups are part of the product structure.

Wait, the structure of the adduct would have the two carbonyls from the anhydride as substituents on the six-membered ring. So the ring would have two carbonyl groups attached, and the substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be in specific positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclic structure. But perhaps I should think about the substituents.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So when it reacts, the four methyl groups are attached to the diene, which would become part of the six-membered ring in the adduct.

Wait, but the Diels-Alder forms a bicyclic structure because the diene is part of a ring. So the product would have a bicyclic structure, perhaps a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative or something similar.

Wait, maybe the diene is part of a five-membered ring, so the adduct would have a six-membered ring fused to a five-membered ring.

Hmm, perhaps it's a bicyclo structure where the six-membered ring (from DA adduct) is fused to the five-membered diene ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a tricyclic structure. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think about the possible structures.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (four carbons) and the dienophile (two carbons) combine to form a six-membered ring. The diene is the conjugated diene, and the dienophile is the anhydride.

But the diene in this case is part of a five-membered ring with methyl groups. So when the Diels-Alder occurs, the diene (which is part of a ring) will form a new six-membered ring, and the original ring becomes a bridge in the bicyclic structure.

So the product would be a bicyclic compound, perhaps a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative, with substituents from the anhydride.

Wait, the DA adduct forms a bicyclo structure if the diene is cyclic. For example, when using cyclopentadiene as the diene, the DA adduct is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative.

In this case, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the DA adduct would have a bridge structure, perhaps with four methyl groups attached.

In the adduct, the bridge would have the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride.

Wait, but the anhydride is symmetric, so perhaps the product has two ester groups attached to the bridge.

But perhaps I'm getting off track. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The product has two protons that are close in space, as indicated by the NOESY cross-peak. So which protons would be near each other in the structure?

In the major product, the cross-peak connects two protons that are on adjacent carbons and perhaps on the same face of the ring, leading them to be close in space.

Looking at the options, let's consider each possibility.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

A 6H singlet suggests a set of equivalent protons, perhaps methyl groups attached to the same carbon. The 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm could be a CH adjacent to another CH2 group.

But why would a methyl group be at 1 ppm? Usually, methyl groups are around 0.9-1.5 ppm. But 1 ppm is possible.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

6H singlet could be two methyl groups each with 3H (but 6H total would require two CH3 groups, but 3H each would add up to 6H, so perhaps two equivalent CH3 groups). The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm suggests two equivalent protons, perhaps on an oxygen-bearing carbon, like an OCH2O group.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

This would be two sets of equivalent methyl groups. Maybe one set is more shielded (at 1 ppm) and the other less (1.7 ppm). For example, if the bridge has two methyl groups, and another set elsewhere.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. The 1H could be a CH adjacent to another CH. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could be an OCH2O group.

But I'm not sure. Let's think about the structure.

In the major product, the bridgehead protons (if any) might be near each other. Alternatively, the substituents from the anhydride (like the carbonyl groups) could influence the environment.

Wait, the cross-peak in NOESY suggests that the two protons are close in space. If the product has a six-membered ring with substituents, perhaps there are axial or equatorial substituents that bring certain protons close.

Alternatively, perhaps the major product has a specific stereochemistry where two protons are on the same face, leading to a cross-peak. The minor product would have the opposite stereochemistry, leading those protons to be on opposite faces, so no cross-peak.

But which two protons would be close?

Let me think about the structure of the adduct. The DA adduct would have a six-membered ring. Let's imagine that the two carbonyl groups from the anhydride are in positions 1 and 4 of the six-membered ring. The diene's substituents (the methyl groups) would be on adjacent carbons.

Wait, but the diene was 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, so when it reacts, those methyl groups are attached to the adduct. So the adduct would have four methyl groups attached to the ring.

But perhaps the two carbonyl groups are in positions 1 and 4, and the methyl groups are attached to positions 2,3,5,6 of the six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that two of the methyl groups are adjacent, and their protons are near each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the two methyl groups from the anhydride's substituents are near each other.

Wait, perhaps the bridge in the bicyclic structure has two methyl groups attached, leading their protons to be close.

Alternatively, perhaps the two carbonyl groups are on the same face, and the substituents from the diene are arranged in such a way that certain protons are close.

Hmm. Another approach: the 1H NMR of the major product has certain signals that are connected by a cross-peak. Let's think about the possible structures and their NMR signals.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

If the 6H is a singlet, it's likely equivalent protons. Maybe two methyl groups each with three equivalent protons, but in this case, 6H would be two methyl groups (each 3H) but as a singlet. Hmm, but two different methyl groups wouldn't be a singlet unless they're equivalent. So perhaps in the structure, there are two equivalent methyl groups attached to the same carbon, but that would make a triplet of triplets perhaps, not a singlet. Wait, no, if two methyl groups are on the same carbon, each with three H, but split into a singlet because they're all equivalent. So for example, a C(CH3)2 group.

If there's a C(CH3)2 group, the six H would be as a singlet. The 2H at 3.5 ppm as a singlet could be an OCH2O group, but that's usually around 3-4 ppm, as a singlet if the two H are equivalent.

But why would the 6H singlet and 2H singlet be connected by a cross-peak? That would imply that the two sets of protons are near each other in space.

Wait, perhaps the C(CH3)2 group is adjacent to the OCH2O group. So the methyl groups are on a carbon next to the OCH2O. In that case, the protons on the OCH2O would be near the methyl groups. But how would that lead to a cross-peak between the 6H singlet and the 2H singlet? Because the 6H are all on the same carbon, and the 2H are on another, but perhaps the methyl groups are near the OCH2O group, so their protons are close enough to cause a NOE effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is from two methyl groups on adjacent carbons, and the 2H are from another part. But I'm not sure.

Option D: 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

The 1H doublet could be a CH group adjacent to a CH2 or another CH. The 2H singlet at 3.5 would be two equivalent protons, perhaps on an oxygenated CH2.

If these two sets of protons are adjacent or near each other, they could show a cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1H is on a bridgehead, and the 2H are on an adjacent bridge.

But I'm not entirely clear.

Another angle: in the major product, the cross-peak indicates that the two protons are close. The question is, which of the options represent two protons that are near each other in the structure.

Looking back, the NOESY cross-peak is present in the major product but not the minor. That suggests that the major product has a particular stereochemistry where those two protons are on the same face.

So, for example, if the product has substituents on the same face of a ring, the protons on those substituents would be near each other, leading to a cross-peak.

So perhaps the 6H singlet and the 2H singlet are on adjacent carbons with substituents that are on the same face.

Wait, let me think about the structure again. The Diels-Alder adduct would form a bicyclic compound. In the bridge, perhaps there's a CH2 group next to an OCH2O group.

Alternatively, perhaps the two methyl groups (6H singlet) are adjacent to an OCH2O group (2H singlet). So the methyl groups are on a carbon next to the OCH2O. If the OCH2O is in a certain position, the methyl protons would be close to the OCH2 protons.

But why would the NOE effect connect the 6H and 2H?

Wait, the NOE effect is about spatial proximity, not necessarily being on adjacent carbons. So perhaps the 6H singlet (methyl groups) are on a carbon that's near the 2H singlet, perhaps across the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2H singlet is part of an epoxide or an ester group.

Wait, the product comes from an anhydride, so it would have two ester groups or perhaps a bridged structure with ester functionalities.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck and need to think about which options are more plausible.

Option B says 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm. The 6H would likely be from two methyl groups adjacent to each other or in a symmetric position.

The 2H singlet at 3.5 could be from an OCH2O group, such as in an ester linkage. If the OCH2O is next to a carbon bearing the 6H singlet, the protons could be near each other, causing a cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet is from a C(CH3)2 group adjacent to an OCH2O group, and the two sets of protons are spatially close.

In that case, the cross-peak would connect the methyl protons to the OCH2 protons.

Option B's 6H and 2H would be connected if the 6H methyl groups are near the 2H OCH2.

Alternatively, looking at option D: 1H doublet and 2H singlet.

The 1H doublet could be a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group, which is part of an OCH2O. If the CH is near the OCH2, then their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

But I'm not sure which option is correct.

Another approach: the anhydride's 1H NMR has a singlet at 7 ppm. That suggests that the protons adjacent to the carbonyl are equivalent and thus give a singlet. In the DA adduct, those protons would be incorporated into the new structure, perhaps as the bridgehead protons. But wait, the bridgehead protons in a bicyclic system are usually deshielded and appear downfield. But that might not directly help.

Wait, the DA reaction adds substituents to the ring. The substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride's carbonyl groups) would end up as substituents on the six-membered ring of the adduct.

So the product would have an ester or ketone group attached, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bridged bicyclic ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two ester groups attached, leading to certain NMR signals.

But I'm not making much progress. Let me think about the possible structures again.

The starting anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. So perhaps it's a symmetric anhydride, like a five-membered cyclic anhydride. For example, maleic anhydride is a five-membered cyclic anhydride and has two equivalent protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, which would appear as a singlet around 7 ppm. But wait, maleic anhydride's 1H NMR actually shows a pair of doublets, not a singlet, because the two protons are not equivalent. Hmm, but in the case of a symmetric anhydride, like succinic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring, the two CH2 groups adjacent to the carbonyls are equivalent, so their protons would be a singlet. Wait, no—succinic anhydride is a six-membered ring (O=C-O-CH2-CH2-O=C=O), but no, wait: succinic anhydride is a cyclic structure where the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other. So the structure is O=C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C=O, but that can't form a six-membered ring. Wait, perhaps it's a five-membered ring: O=C-O-C-O-C=O, but that would require more oxygens. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the anhydride is a four-membered ring, like butyric anhydride. But regardless, the key point is that the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm, indicating equivalent protons.

So the DA product would incorporate these protons, perhaps as bridgehead protons or as substituents.

But perhaps the more straightforward approach is to consider the options and see which pair of protons would be close in the major product.

Option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

If the 6H are from two methyl groups attached to the same carbon (C(CH3)2), and the 2H are from an OCH2O group, perhaps these are on adjacent carbons. So the methyl groups are on a carbon next to an oxygen-bearing CH2 group. In that case, the methyl protons and the OCH2 protons could be close in space, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is from a single methyl group split into a singlet by symmetry. Wait, no, 6H would require two methyl groups each with three H, giving a singlet if they're equivalent.

The 2H singlet at 3.5 would likely be from an OCH2O group, maybe part of an ester or an ether.

So the DA product would have an ester group (from the anhydride) attached, leading to an OCH2O group.

If the structure has a C(CH3)2 group adjacent to an OCH2O group, then the protons on the methyl groups and the OCH2 would be close enough to show a cross-peak.

So in the major product, the cross-peak would connect the 6H singlet and the 2H singlet.

Looking at the options, that's option B.

Alternatively, option D has 1H doublet and 2H singlet. If the 1H is a CH group next to the OCH2, perhaps there is a cross-peak between them.

But the question states that the cross-peak is in the major product but not the minor. Since the major product is the endo product, perhaps the substituents are arranged in such a way that the methyl groups and OCH2 are on the same face.

But I'm not entirely certain. Given the options and the reasoning, I think option B might be the correct answer.


The problem involves the reaction of a symmetric anhydride derived from a cis-dicarboxylic acid with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction. The anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its ¹H NMR spectrum, indicating equivalent protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups, and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in its ¹³C NMR spectrum, corresponding to a methylene carbon and a carbonyl carbon, respectively. The reaction produces two products (major and minor) with the molecular formula C₁₃H₁₆O₃. The major product shows a cross-peak in its 2D NOESY NMR spectrum, while the minor product does not, indicating spatial proximity of specific protons in the major product.

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a bicyclic structure where the anhydride contributes two carbonyl groups, and the cyclopentadiene derivative contributes four methyl groups. The major product likely adopts the endo stereochemistry, where substituents on the same face of the ring are close in space. This spatial arrangement explains the presence of a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum for the major product.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. A 6H singlet suggests two equivalent methyl groups, but the 1H doublet at 1.5 ppm does not align with the expected spatial proximity of protons in the major product.
  
- **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet likely corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, while the 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could correspond to an OCH₂ group. These protons are likely spatially close in the major product, consistent with the NOESY cross-peak.

- **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This suggests two distinct sets of methyl groups, but it does not explain the presence of a cross-peak between specific protons.

- **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 1H doublet could correspond to a CH group, but this arrangement does not align well with the expected spatial proximity of protons in the major product.

The most plausible explanation is that the 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm corresponds to two equivalent methyl groups, and the 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm corresponds to an OCH₂ group. These protons are spatially close in the major product, consistent with the NOESY cross-peak. 

Answer: B
