Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but let's take it step by step.

So, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene, and it's a bicyclic structure with a specific configuration. (R) configuration, so it's the (R)-enantiomer.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so I think this is a hydrogenation reaction. Limonene has a double bond, so hydrogenation would add hydrogen across it. Since limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, after hydrogenation, the double bond would be saturated. So product 1 would be a hydrogenated limonene. Wait, but limonene is a bicyclic compound—maybe it's a ring-opening? Or just adding hydrogen to the double bond.

Wait, limonene has two rings, a six-membered and a five-membered ring, right? No, wait, limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene, which I think is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. The structure is more like a norbornene, if I remember correctly. So hydrogenation would saturate the double bond in the norbornene structure, turning it into norbornane.

So product 1 is (R)-limonene hydrogenated to the corresponding cycloalkane, so (R) configuration would be retained in some way, perhaps, but now the double bond is gone. So product 1 is (R)-limonene hydrogenated, giving a bicyclo structure, maybe cyclohexane or something else? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it mentally. Limonene structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So when hydrogenated, the double bond becomes a single bond, so it's bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane.

Then, product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (CPBA). CPBA is a peracid, which typically is used for epoxidation of alkenes. Wait, but product 1 is already hydrogenated, so it's a saturated compound. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Wait, the first step is a hydrogenation of limonene. If limonene is a bicyclic diene, then maybe the hydrogenation doesn't stop at one equivalent. Wait, the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation, but I'm not sure. Wait, limonene has one double bond, so adding 1 equivalent of H2 would add across that double bond, making it a single bond. So product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene.

But then, product 1 is treated with CPBA. But if product 1 is a saturated compound (no double bonds), then CPBA wouldn't do anything, right? Wait, no—that can't be. There must be an alkene somewhere else. Wait, maybe the hydrogenation didn't saturate everything. Or perhaps I'm wrong about product 1.

Alternatively, maybe the initial hydrogenation isn't of the limonene's main double bond. Wait, limonene is a bicyclic structure with one double bond. So hydrogenation would saturate that. So product 1 is the fully hydrogenated limonane, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, perhaps with some substituents. But that would be a saturated molecule, so the next step with CPBA wouldn't do anything. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation isn't of the limonene itself but of some other group. Oh wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but maybe when hydrogenated, it becomes a more complex structure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial
