Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) when the speed of a nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I need to find the energy of the nucleus X, which is lithium with three neutrons. Wait, lithium's atomic number is 3, so I think that's Li-6 because it has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6.

Wait, the question is about relativistic energy. Right, I remember that in relativity, the total energy of a particle is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, E = gamma * m0c². Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which depends on the velocity v of the particle.

So, the speed is 0.96c. I think gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that. So v is 0.96c, so v² is (0.96)^2 times c squared. Let's compute 0.96 squared: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.2
