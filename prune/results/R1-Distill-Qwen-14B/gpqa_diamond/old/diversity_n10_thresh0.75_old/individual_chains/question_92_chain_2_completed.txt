Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. It looks like a molecule with multiple substituents and double bonds. Maybe it's a polyene or something with conjugated double bonds. But I'm not sure if that matters right now.

The question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization for carbon. Oh right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element, so for carbon, it's 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, but carbon atoms are diatomic in the gas phase, like C-C bonds. So the bond energy for C-C is 200 kJ/mol as given. So the enthalpy of atomization is the energy needed to break a C-C bond in graphite or some standard state, maybe?

But wait, the problem is about enthalpy of formation. The standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for hydrocarbons like this one, that would be from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas.

The formula for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of all bonds in reactants] - [sum of bond energies of all bonds in products]

But wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. Because bond breaking is endothermic. So the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break the bonds in the reactants (elements) minus the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formation reaction.

The formation reaction for this compound would be:

Elements (C and H2) → Compound.

To calculate ΔHf°, we can use the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of elements' bonds)] - [Σ (Bond energies in the compound)].

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again.

Each bond in the reactants (elements) is broken, and new bonds are formed in the product. So the enthalpy change is the sum of the energies of the bonds broken (reactants) minus the sum of the bonds formed (products). But wait, when bonds are broken, it's endothermic, so that adds to the enthalpy. When bonds are formed, it's exothermic, so that subtracts.

So the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = sum of bond energies of reactants (elements) - sum of bond energies of products (compound's bonds).

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The enthalpy of formation is the energy change when the compound is formed from elements. So the process is:

C(graphite) + H2(g) → Compound.

In this process, bonds in the reactants (C-C in graphite, H-H in H2) are broken (endothermic), and new bonds are formed in the compound (C-C, C-H, C=C, etc.) which release energy.

So the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds]. 

Wait, but if I'm breaking bonds in the reactants (which requires energy) and forming bonds in the product (which releases energy), then the overall enthalpy change is (energy used to break bonds) minus (energy released when forming bonds). So ΔHf° = (reactants' bonds broken) - (products' bonds formed).

But I'm not sure if I'm getting this right. Alternatively, I've heard the formula as:

ΔHf° = sum of bond energies of the reactants (elements) minus sum of bond energies of the product.

Wait, that might make sense. Because the reactants are elements in their standard states, which are broken into atoms, and those atoms form the product's bonds.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the heats of atomization and bond energies. The heat of atomization is the energy required to break bonds in the element to form atoms. So for carbon, each C-C bond in graphite requires 1000 kJ/mol to break into two C atoms.

Wait, but wait: the enthalpy of atomization is usually the energy to produce gaseous atoms from the element. For carbon, it's the energy to break C(s) into 2 C(g) atoms. Wait, but graphite has C-C bonds. So each C-C bond in graphite would require 1000 kJ/mol to break, and each mole of C(s) has 12 g, but perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is given per mole of C atoms. Oh wait, the problem says the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. So that would be the energy per mole of C to become gaseous atoms. So each C atom in graphite would require 1000 kJ/mol to become gaseous. But wait, one mole of C atoms would require 1000 kJ to be atomized from solid? Or is it that the bond energy for C in the solid is 1000 kJ per mole? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think differently. For a hydrocarbon, the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the enthalpies of the elements (atomized) minus the sum of the bond energies in the molecule.

Wait, no, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (H° of atomization of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies in the molecule)].

But I'm not sure. Let me think about a simple example, like methane.

Methane is CH4. The formation reaction is:

C(graphite) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g).

The enthalpy of formation would be calculated as:

(1 * H atomization of C) + (2 * H atomization of H2) - (4 * C-H bond energies + 1 * C-H bond energies? Wait, no, in CH4, there are four C-H bonds.

Wait, let's model this with numbers. Suppose:

H atomization for C is 1000 kJ/mol (as given). For H, the bond energy H-H is 100 kJ/mol, so each H atom has (100 kJ/mol) / 2 = 50 kJ per H atom. Because each H2 molecule has two H atoms, so to break H2 into two H atoms, it's 100 kJ per mole of H2.

So for the reaction above, the enthalpy of formation would be:

(1000 kJ for C) + (2 * 100 kJ for H2) - [ (4 C-H bonds * 400 kJ/mol ) ]

Wait, but wait. Each C-H bond has energy 400 kJ/mol. So four C-H bonds would be 4 * 400 = 1600 kJ.

So ΔHf° would be (1000 + 200) - 1600 = 1200 -1600 = -400 kJ/mol.

Wait, but the actual enthalpy of formation of methane is about -74.8 kJ/mol. So I must be doing this wrong. Hmm.

Ah, I see. Because in the problem, the bond energies are given per mole of bonds. So for the H-H bond, it's 100 kJ per mole. But for the reaction, I need to account for the number of bonds broken and formed.

Let me try again for methane:

C(graphite) → 1 C(g): requires 1000 kJ/mol (given).

Each H2 → 2 H(g): each H2 has one bond, so 100 kJ/mol per H2. So for 2 moles of H2, that's 2 * 100 kJ = 200 kJ.

So total bond energy for reactants: 1000 (C) + 200 (H2) = 1200 kJ.

Now, the product is CH4, which has four C-H bonds. Each C-H bond is 400 kJ/mol. So for four bonds, it's 4 *400 = 1600 kJ.

But wait, in the product, those bonds are formed. So the energy released is 1600 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is (energy required to break bonds in reactants) - (energy released when forming product bonds) = 1200 -1600 = -400 kJ/mol. Which is more negative than the actual value, but perhaps the given bond energies are hypothetical.

So for the given problem, perhaps I can apply the same approach.

So the formula for the enthalpy of formation is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies in reactants) - (sum of bond energies in products)

But wait, the reactants here are the elements in their standard states. So for carbon, it's graphite, and for hydrogen, it's H2 gas.

So for the given compound, I need to calculate the total bond energy in the reactants (C and H2) and subtract the total bond energy in the product (the molecule's bonds).

Wait, no. Because the reactants are being broken into atoms, and the product is formed from those atoms. So the formula would be:

ΔHf° = [Σ (bond energies of reactants)] - [Σ (bond energies of product molecule)].

So in the case of CH4, it would be:

Reactants: 1 C (which in graphite has C-C bonds, but wait, C is in solid, so how does that work?)

Wait, perhaps the approach is to think of the reactants as the elements in their standard states, which are broken down into their constituent atoms, and then the atoms form the product molecule.

So for the given compound, let's first figure out how many C and H atoms are in the molecule.

The molecular formula of the compound given is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of each atom:

Looking at each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH: That's two CH3 groups attached to a C, which is double-bonded to another CH. So the structure is (CH3)2C=C H...

Wait, no, actually, it's (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-... So the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Then the rest is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the molecular formula.

Each (CH3) group contributes 3 H and 1 C. Let me count each part.

Let me parse each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : The (CH3)2C=CH- part has:

- C: 3 (two from CH3 groups, one central C, and one in the CH group)
Wait, no: the (CH3)2C=CH- would be:

(CH3)2C is a group where two CH3 are attached to a C, which is double-bonded to a CH- group.

So in this segment, we have:

Each (CH3) has 3 H, so two (CH3) contribute 6 H, and the central C is connected via two single bonds to each CH3, and a double bond to the CH.

So in this part, we have:

Carbon: 3 (two from CH3, one from the center C, and one from the CH part) → Wait, no, the CH is a CH group attached via double bond. So the structure is:

(CH3)2C=CH-

Which is like:

C(CH3)2-CH2 (but with a double bond between the two Cs). So the structure is (CH3)2C=C-H-.

Wait, no, the CH3 groups are attached to the central C, which is double bonded to a CH group. So the structure is:

(CH3)2-C(=CH-)... So the central C is double bonded to a CH- group.

So for this part, the molecule has:

C: 3 (two CH3, one central, and the CH has another C? Wait, no. Let me count all the carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the entire molecule's formula.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it down into each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : So this is a group where a central C is attached to two CH3 groups and a CH group via a double bond.

So, this part has:

Each CH3 has 3 H and 1 C. So two CH3 groups contribute 2*3=6 H and 2 C.

The central C is attached to the two CH3 groups and the double bond to the CH group. So the CH is a CH group, which has 1 C and 1 H.

Wait, but the CH is part of the double bond. So the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-.

So the first part:

C: 3 (two from CH3, one central, and the CH has another C? No, wait. The central C is double bonded to a CH, so the CH has one C. So the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, which has 3 C (two CH3, one central, and the CH is the fourth C? No, wait, perhaps no. Let me recount.

Wait, no, the (CH3)2C=CH- is:

The central C (say, C1) is bonded to two CH3 groups (C2 and C3), and has a double bond to a CH group (C4). So C1 is connected to C2, C3, and C4 via double bond. Then C4 is connected to another H (since it's CH).

Wait, but that's four C atoms in this part. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe it's better to write the molecular formula.

The entire molecule is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So let's count each part:

Each (CH3) is CH3, so each contributes 1 C and 3 H.

Breaking down each segment:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- : This part has two CH3 groups (so 2 C and 6 H), a central C (so +1 C), and a CH group (so +1 C and +1 H). But because it's connected via a double bond (C=C), that part is (CH3)2C=CH-.

Wait, maybe I should count each C and H in the entire formula.

Let me go step by step.

The formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count the number of each atom.

Carbon:

Each (CH3) group contributes 1 C. Let's count each part:

- The first (CH3)2C=CH-: here, two CH3 groups (2 C), one C in the central position, and one C in the CH group. So that's 2 + 1 + 1 =4 C.

Wait, no. The central C is part of the (CH3)2C= group. So:

(CH3)2C=CH- → (CH3)2-C=CH-.

Each CH3 has 1 C, so two of them contribute 2 C. The central C is 1 C, and the CH is another C. So that part has 2 +1 +1 =4 C? Or wait, that's not right. The central C is attached to two CH3 and a CH via double bond. So in that part, it's (CH3)2C=CH-, which is a four-carbon chain? No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Each CH3 is a group, so let's count all the C:

Looking at the entire formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me expand each group:

- (CH3)2C=CH- → CH3-CH3-C=CH-? No, that's not right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the molecular formula by expanding the structure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should find the molecular formula.

Each CH3 group is 1 C, 3 H.

So, let's parse each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: This is (CH3)2-C=CH- → that's 3 C (two from CH3, one from the central C, and the CH group's C is the fourth? Or is the CH part part of the same C as the central C?)

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each atom in the entire formula.

The formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me break it into each segment and count the C and H:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - 2*(CH3): 2 C, 6 H.
   - Central C: 1 C.
   - CH: 1 C, 1 H.
   So total for this part: 3 C, 7 H.

Wait, but the 'C=CH-' part is a double bond, so the CH is connected via double bond to the central C.

Wait, no, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2... So the C=CH- is a double bond between two C's.

So, (CH3)2C is attached via a double bond to a CH, which is then connected to CH2.

So, the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2.

So:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-: The (CH3)2C is the first three C, the CH is the fourth C, and the CH2 is the fifth C. So that's 5 C's in this part.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count each C in the entire formula.

Let me proceed:

The entire formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is a group, and the molecule is a chain with double bonds.

Let me count the number of C and H:

Each (CH3) contributes 1 C and 3 H.

Now, the formula can be written as:

(CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Let me count each group:

1. (CH3)2-C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, but perhaps I'm better off writing the entire formula as a series of carbon and hydrogen counts.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the formula as C10H14.

Wait, let's count:

Each (CH3) is 1 C, 3 H.

Looking at the formula:

- (CH3)2: 2 C, 6 H.
- C=CH: 2 C, 1 H (since CH has one H).
- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.
- CH(CH3): 1 C (the central C) + 1 C from CH3 → total of 2 C, 4 H (the CH has 1 H, plus 3 from CH3).
- CH2: 1 C, 2 H.
- CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (the central C), and two (CH3) groups: so 1 + 2*1 = 3 C. The CH has 1 H, and the double bond is C=C, so each end is a C. So CH=C(CH3)2 would have 1 (from CH) + 1 (from the C in the double bond) + 2 (from the two CH3) = 4 C? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me count each C and H in the entire formula:

Let me list all the carbons and hydrogens.

The formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Number of C atoms:

Each (CH3) is 1 C.

Looking at each part:

- (CH3)2C=CH-: 2 (from (CH3)2) + 1 (central C) + 1 (CH) =4 C.
Wait, but the C=CH is a double bond, so the CH is a single C connected to the central C. So that gives 2+1+1=4 C in this segment.

Then, the next part: CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

- CH2: 1 C.
- CH(CH3): 1 C (the central) + 1 C (from CH3) → 2 C.
- CH2: 1 C.
- CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (CH) + 1 C (from the C in the double bond) + 2 *1 (each CH3) → 4 C.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the entire molecule has the following:

- Starting from (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So:

Each (CH3) contributes 1 C.

Let me count step by step:

1. (CH3)2C=CH:

   - 2 (from two CH3)
   - 1 (central C)
   - 1 (CH in the double bond)
   → 4 C.

2. Then, CH2: 1 C.

3. CH(CH3): 1 C (central) + 1 C (CH3) → 2 C.

4. CH2: 1 C.

5. CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (CH) + 1 (C in double bond) + 2*(CH3) → 1+1+2=4 C.

Wait, but that would make the total C: 4 +1 +2 +1 +4 = 12 C? That seems high.

Wait no, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me try to count each C separately.

The entire formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is 1 C.

Breaking it down:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 2 (from CH3) + 1 (central C) + 1 (CH) → 4 C.

- Then, -CH2-: 1 C.

- -CH(CH3)-: 1 C (the central C in CH(CH3)) + 1 C (from CH3) → 2 C.

- -CH2-: 1 C.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (from CH) + 1 C (the double bond C) + 2 *1 (each CH3) → 4 C.

Adding all together: 4 +1 +2 +1 +4 = 12 C.

Wait, but that seems a lot. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, and each end is a (CH3)2C=CH- group.

Wait, perhaps the correct molecular formula is C14H20?

Wait, perhaps I should recount properly.

Another approach: the formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is 1 C and 3 H.

So:

Each (CH3) group: 1 C, 3 H.

Now, let's go through each part:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-:
   - 2*(CH3): 2 C, 6 H.
   - C=CH-: 1 C and 1 H (since it's CH).
   So total for this part: 3 C, 7 H.

2. -CH2-:
   → 1 C, 2 H.

3. -CH(CH3)-:
   → 1 C (central) + 1 C (from CH3) = 2 C.
   → 1 H (from CH) + 3 H (from CH3) = 4 H.

4. -CH2-:
   → 1 C, 2 H.

5. -CH=C(CH3)2:
   → The CH is 1 C, 1 H.
   → The C= is a double bond, so the next C has two CH3 groups.
   → So, that's 1 C (CH) + 1 C (double bond) + 2*(1 C each from CH3) = 4 C.
   → H: 1 (from CH) + 3*2 (each CH3) → 1 +6 =7 H.

Wait, but wait. The group is CH=C(CH3)2. So the C in the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups and the CH.

So, for this part:

- CH: 1 C, 1 H.
- C= : 1 C, bonded to two CH3 groups.
- Each CH3: 1 C, 3 H → two of them → 2 C, 6 H.

So total for this part: 1 (CH) +1 (C=) + 2 (CH3) =4 C.

Hydrogen: 1 (CH) + 0 (C=) + 6 (CH3) →7 H.

Now, summing all parts:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: 3 C, 7 H.
2. -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.
3. -CH(CH3)-: 2 C, 4 H.
4. -CH2-: 1 C, 2 H.
5. -CH=C(CH3)2: 4 C, 7 H.

Adding all together:

C: 3 +1 +2 +1 +4 = 11 C?

H:7 +2 +4 +2 +7 = 22 H.

Wait, that's 11 C and 22 H. So the molecular formula is C11H22.

Wait, but that seems more plausible. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, each (CH3)2C=CH- is:

- 2*(CH3) → 2 C, 6 H.
- C=CH- → C=CH is another 2 C (the central C and the CH C), but wait, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH- which implies a double bond between the central C and the adjacent C. So the central C is connected to two CH3 and the double bond to CH. So the CH is a single C, so in (CH3)2C=CH-, it's 3 C (two CH3, one central C), and the CH is another C. So that's 4 C so far.

Wait, but perhaps I'm confusing myself. Let me try to count each C in the entire formula.

Looking at the entire formula:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is 1 C.

So let's go through each part:

1. (CH3)2 → 2 C.

2. C=CH- → 2 C (the C from (CH3)2C and the CH).

3. CH2 → 1 C.

4. CH(CH3) → 1 C (the central C) + 1 C (from CH3) = 2 C.

5. CH2 → 1 C.

6. CH=C(CH3)2 → 1 C (CH) + 1 C (from the double bond) + 2*(CH3) → 1 +1 +2 =4 C.

Wait, that can't be because it's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the formula as C10H14. Because the structure seems to have 10 carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to count each C and H again.

Each (CH3) is 1 C and 3 H.

The formula is: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it into parts:

- (CH3)2C=CH: 2 CH3 groups → 2 C, 6 H. Central C → 1 C. CH → 1 C, 1 H. So this part is 3 C, 7 H.

- CH2 → 1 C, 2 H.

- CH(CH3): 1 C (CH) + 1 C (CH3) → 2 C, 4 H.

- CH2 → 1 C, 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (CH) + 1 C (double bond) + 2*1 C (each CH3) → 4 C. H:1 (CH) + 6 (two CH3) →7 H.

So adding up:

C: 3 (from first part) +1 (CH2) +2 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +4 (CH=C(CH3)2) → total 3+1=4, +2=6, +1=7, +4=11 C.

H:7 (first part) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C...) →7+2=9, +4=13, +2=15, +7=22 H.

So the molecular formula is C11H22.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's C10H14. Hmm. Maybe I miscounted.

Well, perhaps I can proceed with the calculation using the formula I have, assuming it's C11H22.

So, the next step is to compute the enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

The formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (H of atomization for C and H)] - [Σ (Bond energies in the molecule)].

Wait, no. The correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (H atomization of elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies in the molecule)].

Because when you form the molecule from the elements, you break the bonds in the elements (endothermic) and form the bonds in the molecule (exothermic).

So, for each mole of the compound, the enthalpy change is the sum of the energies needed to break the bonds in the elements minus the sum of the energies released when forming the bonds in the compound.

So, the formula is:

ΔHf° = [ (number of C atoms) * (H atomization of C) + (number of H atoms / 2) * (H-H bond energy) ) ]  - [ sum of all bond energies in the molecule ]

Wait, because each H atom comes from H2, so for n H atoms, you need (n/2) * H-H bond energy.

So for the compound C11H22, the number of C atoms is 11, and H atoms is 22.

So,

ΔHf° = (11 * 1000 kJ/mol) + (22/2 * 100 kJ/mol) )  - (sum of all bond energies in the molecule).

Wait, so:

11 * 1000 = 11,000 kJ.

22 H atoms → 11 H2 molecules → 11 * 100 kJ = 1,100 kJ.

So sum of reactants' bonds: 11,000 + 1,100 = 12,100 kJ.

Now, subtract the sum of bond energies in the molecule.

What are the bonds in the molecule?

Looking at the structure, the molecule has:

- C-C single bonds: Each contributes 200 kJ/mol.

- C=C double bonds: Each contributes 300 kJ/mol.

- C-H bonds: Each contributes 400 kJ/mol.

So, let's count the number of each bond type in the molecule.

Number of C-C bonds.

Number of C=C bonds.

Number of C-H bonds.

Wait, but how many of each?

Let me try to count.

The molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Looking for each type of bond:

1. Each (CH3) group has three C-H bonds. So two (CH3) groups contribute 2*3=6 C-H bonds.

2. The central C in (CH3)2C=CH is connected to two CH3 groups (so two C-C single bonds) and a double bond to CH.

3. The CH is connected via a double bond to the central C, so that's one C=C double bond.

4. Then, the CH is connected to a CH2 group via a single bond. So that's one C-C single bond.

5. The CH2 is connected to another CH(CH3) group via a single bond. So that's another C-C single bond.

6. The CH(CH3) is connected to another CH2 via a single bond. Another C-C.

7. The CH2 is connected to another CH via a single bond. Another C-C.

8. The CH is connected via a double bond to another C, which is part of a C=C bond. So that's another C=C bond.

9. The C on the other end of the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups. Each is a C-C single bond.

So, let me list all bonds:

C-C single bonds:

- From (CH3)2C=CH: two C-C (from CH3 to central C).

- CH2-CH: one C-C.

- CH(CH3)-CH2: one C-C.

- CH2-CH: one C-C.

- The C=C has two C-C bonds on either side? No, wait, the double bond is C=C, which is two bonds. So the other C is connected to two CH3 groups, each via a single C-C bond. So two more C-C bonds.

So total C-C single bonds:

Let me recount:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: two C-C (each CH3 to central C).

2. CH2 connected to CH: one C-C.

3. CH(CH3) connected to CH2: one C-C.

4. CH2 connected to CH: one C-C.

5. The C on the other end of the second C=C is connected to two CH3 groups: two C-C.

So that's 2 +1 +1 +1 +2 =7 C-C single bonds.

Each contributes 200 kJ, so 7 *200 =1,400 kJ.

C=C double bonds: there are two in the molecule. So 2 *300=600 kJ.

C-H bonds:

Each (CH3) group has three C-H bonds. There are six CH3 groups in the molecule.

Wait, no. Let me recount.

Each (CH3) in the structure:

- The first (CH3)2 group: two CH3 → 2 *3=6 C-H.

- The C=CH- group: the CH has one C-H.

- Then, the CH2 groups: each has two C-H bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to count all C-H bonds.

The molecule has:

Each CH3 group: 3 C-H.

The CH groups: 1 C-H each.

Each CH2: 2 C-H.

So:

1. (CH3)2 group: 2 *3 =6 C-H.

2. The CH in (CH3)2C=CH: 1 C-H.

3. The CH2 groups: let's see how many.

Looking at the structure, the first part: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The CH2 groups are:

- CH2 after C=CH.

- CH2 after CH(CH3).

- CH2 before the CH=C.

So three CH2 groups → each has 2 C-H → 3 *2=6.

The CH(CH3) group: 1 C-H (from CH) + 3 (from CH3) → 4 C-H.

Wait, but the CH(CH3) has a C connected to another CH3. So the CH has one C-H, and the CH3 has three.

So each CH(CH3) has 4 C-H bonds.

Wait, no, no. The CH(CH3) has one C connected to a CH3, so the structure is CH(CH3). So that's one C-H and three from the CH3. So four C-H bonds per CH(CH3).

But in our structure, there are two CH(CH3) groups? Wait, no, I think there's only one in this molecule.

Looking at the formula: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

So the CH(CH3) occurs once: -CH(CH3)-.

So for that, 4 C-H bonds.

Additionally, in the C=CH group, the CH has one C-H.

Wait, no, in (CH3)2C=CH-, the CH is part of the double bond, so it's a CH group with one C-H.

And the CH2 groups have two each.

So let's count:

- (CH3)2: 2 CH3 → 6 C-H.

- C=CH: 1 C-H.

- CH2-CH2-CH2: three CH2 groups → 3 *2=6.

- CH(CH3): 4 C-H.

- The other CH3 groups: the molecule ends with C(CH3)2, which is two CH3 groups → 2 *3=6.

Wait, no: the structure ends with CH=C(CH3)2.

So, the C in the double bond is connected to two CH3 groups. So each CH3 is a C-H group, so two CH3 → 6 C-H.

Wait, but wait: the CH=C(CH3)2. The CH is one C, and the C is double bonded to another C which is connected to two CH3 groups. So the CH3 groups contribute 3 H each.

So, let's recount:

C-H bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: 6 (from two CH3) +1 (from CH) =7.

2. -CH2-CH2-CH2: three CH2 groups → 3 *2=6.

3. CH(CH3): 1 (CH) +3 (CH3) =4.

4. CH=C(CH3)2: 1 (CH) + 3*2 (two CH3) =7.

So total C-H bonds:7 +6 +4 +7=24.

Wait, but that can't be right because 24 C-H bonds would be 24 *400 =9,600 kJ, which is a lot.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think again.

Each (CH3) group has three C-H bonds.

The molecule has:

- Two (CH3) groups in the first part: 2 *3=6.

- The CH in (CH3)2C=CH: 1.

- Three CH2 groups (each contributes 2): 3*2=6.

- One CH(CH3): 1 (from CH) +3 (from CH3) →4.

- One CH in the second C=CH group:1.

- Two CH3 groups in the C(CH3)2: 2 *3=6.

So adding up:

6 +1=7, +6=13, +4=17, +1=18, +6=24 C-H bonds.

So 24 C-H bonds.

Each C-H bond is 400 kJ/mol, so 24 *400 =9,600 kJ.

C-C bonds: earlier count was 7 C-C single bonds →7 *200=1,400.

C=C bonds: 2 *300=600.

So total bond energies in the molecule: 9,600 +1,400 +600 =11,600 kJ.

So the sum of bond energies in the product is 11,600 kJ.

Now, the sum of bond energies in the reactants (elements) is:

11,000 (C) +1,100 (H2) =12,100 kJ.

So ΔHf° =12,100 -11,600 =500 kJ/mol.

Wait, but that's positive, which would make the compound endothermic to form. But looking at the options, option A is 11,200, which is much higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the number of C-C bonds.

Let me recount the C-C bonds.

Looking at the structure again:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The C-C bonds are:

1. Between each CH3 and the central C in (CH3)2C=CH: 2.

2. Between the CH in (CH3)2C=CH and the next CH2: 1.

3. Between CH2 and CH(CH3): 1.

4. Between CH(CH3) and next CH2:1.

5. Between CH2 and CH:1.

6. Between the CH and the C in CH=C(...): 1 (this is part of the double bond, so it's a C=C bond, not a C-C single bond.

7. The C in CH=C is connected to two CH3 groups: 2 C-C bonds.

Wait, so that's:

2 (from (CH3)2) +1 (CH to CH2) +1 (CH2 to CH(CH3)) +1 (CH(CH3) to CH2) +1 (CH2 to CH) → that's 5 C-C so far.

Plus the two from the CH3 groups connected to the second C=C: 2 more → total 7 C-C bonds.

So 7 C-C bonds. Each is 200 →7*200=1,400.

C=C bonds: two → 2*300=600.

C-H bonds: let me recount.

Each (CH3) group: 3 H per group.

Number of (CH3) groups:

- Two in (CH3)2C=CH.

- One in CH(CH3).

- Two in C(CH3)2.

So total (CH3) groups: 2 +1 +2 =5.

Each contributes 3 →5*3=15.

But wait, no: the (CH3)2C=CH has two CH3 →6 H.

Then, the CH=C(CH3)2 has two CH3 →6 H.

The CH(CH3) has one CH3 →3 H.

The CH3 groups in (CH3)2C=CH and C(CH3)2 are 2 +2=4 CH3 groups.

Plus the one in CH(CH3) →5 CH3 groups.

Each CH3 has 3 H →5 *3=15.

But wait, each CH3 group contributes 3 C-H bonds.

So that's 5 *3=15.

Then, the CH groups:

In (CH3)2C=CH: the CH has 1 C-H.

In CH2 groups: each has 2 C-H.

There are three CH2 groups: 3 *2=6.

In the CH=C group: the CH has 1 C-H.

In the CH(CH3): the CH has 1 C-H.

So adding all C-H bonds:

5 CH3 →15.

CH groups: 1 (from (CH3)2C=CH) +1 (from CH=C) +1 (from CH(CH3)) →3.

CH2 groups:3 *2=6.

Total C-H bonds:15 +3 +6=24.

So earlier count was correct: 24 C-H bonds.

So bond energies in the product: 24 *400=9,600.

C-C:7 *200=1,400.

C=C:2 *300=600.

Total product bonds:9,600 +1,400 +600=11,600.

Reactants:11,000 (C) +1,100 (H) =12,100.

ΔHf°=12,100 -11,600=500 kJ/mol.

But looking at the options, option A is 11,200, which is much higher. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I missed some C-C bonds in the molecule.

Wait, let me recount the C-C bonds again.

The structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each C-C single bond:

1. (CH3)2C=CH: two C-C bonds (each CH3 to central C).

2. CH=CH-CH2: the C=CH is a double bond. So the single bond is after that between CH and CH2.

3. CH2-CH(CH3): one C-C.

4. CH(CH3)-CH2: one C-C.

5. CH2-CH: one C-C.

6. The C in the second C=C is connected to two CH3 groups → two C-C bonds.

So that's 2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds.

Wait, that's 8, not 7. Because in point 2, the CH is connected to CH2 via a single bond → that's one. Then point 5 is another. So that would be 8.

Ah, so I must have missed one earlier. So 8 C-C bonds.

So 8 *200=1,600.

C-C bonds: 1,600.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:24 *400=9,600.

Total product bonds:1,600 +600 +9,600=11,800.

Reactants:12,100.

ΔHf°=12,100 -11,800=300 kJ/mol.

But that's not among the options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the number of C-C bonds. Let me try a different approach.

Each single bond between two carbons is a C-C bond.

So in the structure:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

The chain is:

(CH3)2-C=C-H-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH-C=C(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it as a series of connected carbons.

Each single bond is a C-C:

1. (CH3)2C=CH- → (CH3)2-C=C-H-.

So the double bond is between the first and second C.

Then, the second C is connected to a CH2 group.

So the bonds are:

1. (CH3)2-C=C → double bond.

2. C=CH: the second C is connected via single bond to CH2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should count all the single C-C bonds.

Each segment:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-: the double bond is between C1 and C2. C2 is connected to C3 via a single bond.

- C3 is connected to C4 (CH2) via a single bond.

- C4 connected to C5 (CH(CH3)) via single bond.

- C5 connected to C6 (CH2) via single bond.

- C6 connected to C7 (CH) via single bond.

- C7 connected to C8 (double bond) via double bond.

- C8 connected to two CH3 groups: each via single bond.

So, the single C-C bonds are between:

C1-C2 (no, that's a double bond).

C2-C3 (single).

C3-C4 (single).

C4-C5 (single).

C5-C6 (single).

C6-C7 (single).

C7-C8 (no, that's a double bond).

C8-C9 and C8-C10 (each single, since C9 and C10 are the two CH3 groups attached to C8.

Wait, but that's a benzene-like structure? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the molecule might have 8 single C-C bonds:

C2-C3: 1.

C3-C4:1.

C4-C5:1.

C5-C6:1.

C6-C7:1.

C7-C8: no, that's a double bond.

C8-C9:1.

C8-C10:1.

So that's 7 single C-C bonds. Plus the two from the (CH3)2C= part.

Wait, no, the (CH3)2C= part has two C-C bonds (from each CH3 to C1).

So:

C1-C2 (double bond, not counted as single).

C1-C3 (each CH3): two single bonds.

C2-C3 (single bond).

Wait, I'm getting too confused. Maybe the correct number is 8 single C-C bonds.

In this case, 8 *200=1,600.

So product bonds: 1,600 +600 (C=C) +9,600 (C-H) = 11,800.

Reactants:12,100.

ΔHf°=12,100-11,800=300 kJ/mol.

Still not matching the options.

Looking at the options, option A is 11,200, which is way higher than my calculation. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C10H14.

Let me recount:

If the formula is C10H14, then:

Number of C atoms:10.

Number of H atoms:14 → so H2 molecules:7 → H bond energy: 7 *100=700.

So:

ΔHf°= (10*1000) + (7*100) ) - [sum of bonds].

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy of formation is calculated as:

ΔHf = (Σ bonds broken in elements) - (Σ bonds formed in compound).

Which would be (1000*10) + (100*(14/2)) - [sum of bonds in the molecule].

Wait, but without knowing the exact molecular formula, it's hard to proceed accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as the molecule having 12 C and 18 H.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that each (CH3) group is 1 C and 3 H.

The formula is:

(CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Each (CH3) is 1 C, 3 H.

Counting:

- (CH3)2: 2 C, 6 H.

- C=CH: 1 C, 1 H.

- CH2:1 C, 2 H.

- CH(CH3):1 C, 4 H.

- CH2:1 C, 2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2:1 C,7 H.

Wait, no, the CH=C(CH3)2 has:

CH:1 C,1 H.

C= :1 C, but bonded to two CH3.

So each CH3 contributes 3 H →2*3=6.

So CH=C(CH3)2: 1 C (CH) + 1 C (double bond) + 2*(1 C each) =4 C. H:1 +6=7.

So adding up:

C:2 (from CH3) +1 (C=CH) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +4 (CH=C(CH3)2) → 2+1=3, +1=4, +1=5, +1=6, +4=10 C.

H:6 (from CH3) +1 (C=CH) +2 (CH2) +4 (CH(CH3)) +2 (CH2) +7 (CH=C(...)) →6+1=7, +2=9, +4=13, +2=15, +7=22 H.

So the formula is C10H22.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was C11H22. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the counting. Let me try again.

The formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Breaking it down:

Each (CH3) contributes 1 C, 3 H.

So:

- (CH3)2: 2 C,6 H.

- C=CH: 1 C,1 H.

- CH2:1 C,2 H.

- CH(CH3):1 C,4 H.

- CH2:1 C,2 H.

- CH=C(CH3)2:1 C (CH) +1 C (double bond) +2*(1 C each from CH3) →4 C, 7 H.

So adding all C:

2 (from (CH3)2) +1 (C=CH) +1 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH2) +4 (CH=C(...)) → 2+1=3, +1=4, +1=5, +1=6, +4=10.

H:6 +1=7, +2=9, +4=13, +2=15, +7=22.

So the molecular formula is C10H22.

Ah! So earlier I thought it was C11H22, but it's actually C10H22. That changes everything.

So, number of C:10, H:22.

So, the bond energies from the elements are:

C:10 *1000=10,000 kJ.

H:22 H atoms → 11 H2 molecules → 11 *100=1,100 kJ.

So sum of reactants' bonds:10,000 +1,100=11,100 kJ.

Now, the product's bonds:

C-C, C=C, C-H.

Number of each type:

C-C: Let's count each single bond.

Each (CH3)2C=CH- contributes two C-C (from CH3 to C).

Then, C=CH is a double bond → no C-C there.

Then, CH2 connected to next C: single bond.

CH2-C: single.

CH(CH3) connected to CH2: single.

CH2 connected to CH: single.

CH connected to C=C: double bond → no single bond.

C=C has a C connected to two CH3 groups: each is a C-C.

So:

C-C bonds:

1. (CH3)2C=CH-: two C-C.

2. CH2 connected to C=CH: one.

3. CH2 connected to CH(CH3): one.

4. CH(CH3) connected to CH2: one.

5. CH2 connected to CH: one.

6. C=C connected to two CH3: two.

Total:2+1+1+1+1+2=8 C-C bonds.

Each contributes 200 →8*200=1,600.

C=C bonds: two → 2*300=600.

C-H bonds: Let's count.

Each (CH3):3 H.

Number of (CH3) groups:

- (CH3)2: two.

- CH(CH3): one.

- C(CH3)2: two.

Total:2+1+2=5 →5 *3=15 H.

CH groups:

- C=CH: one CH →1 H.

- CH2 groups: three → each has 2 H →3*2=6.

- CH(CH3): one CH →1 H.

- CH connected to C=C: one CH →1 H.

So adding C-H:

15 (from CH3) +1 (C=CH) +6 (CH2) +1 (CH(CH3)) +1 (CH=C) →15+1=16+6=22+1=23+1=24.

Wait, that can't be right because 24 H would mean 24 C-H bonds.

So 24 *400=9,600.

So product bonds:

C-C:1,600.

C=C:600.

C-H:9,600.

Total:1,600 +600=2,200 +9,600=11,800.

So ΔHf°=11,100 (reactants) -11,800 (product) =-700 kJ/mol.

But that's a very large negative value, and it's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the bonds again. Let me try once more.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is C10H14.

Let me recount that.

If the formula is C10H14, then:

Number of H atoms:14 →7 H2 molecules →7 *100=700.

C:10 *1000=10,000.

Reactants sum:10,000 +700=10,700.

Now, product bonds:

Number of C-C, C=C, C-H.

If the formula is C10H14, then number of C-H bonds is 14.

Wait, but that can't be. Because each CH3 contributes 3, and there are more CH3 groups than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, but perhaps the correct option is A, 11,200. Let me see.

Wait, in my initial calculation with C10H22, the ΔHf came to -700, which isn't an option. But perhaps the correct approach is to calculate based on the number of bonds without knowing the exact molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider each bond in the molecule:

The molecule has:

- (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Which has two double bonds: each C=C contributes 300 kJ.

Number of C-C single bonds: let's say it's eight, as before.

Number of C-H bonds: let's say 24.

So, bonds in product:8*200=1,600; 2 *300=600;24 *400=9,600 →11,800.

Reactants:11,000 (C) +1,100 (H) →12,100.

ΔHf°=12,100-11,800=300 kJ/mol.

But none of the options match that. The options are 11200, 67.4, 11.44, 1900.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula. Let me think about the possibility that the enthalpy of atomization is per mole of C atoms, not per mole of C as a solid.

Wait, the problem states: Enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol.

If the molecule has, say, 10 C atoms, then the total for C is 10 *1000 =10,000.

Number of H atoms: let's say 22 →11 H2 →11 *100=1,100.

So reactants sum:11,100.

Product bonds: let's say if product has 8 C-C, 2 C=C, and 24 C-H.

Total product bonds:8*200=1,600; 2*300=600;24*400=9,600 →11,800.

ΔHf=11,100 -11,800= -700.

Not matching any options.

Wait, looking back at the options, option A is 11,200, which is higher than the reactants sum.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done differently. Let me see.

Alternative approach:

The formula for enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of elements] - [sum of bond energies of compound].

But maybe the formula is actually:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of elements] - [sum of bond energies of compound bonds].

So, if the product's bonds are stronger than the reactants', the formation is exothermic.

But if the product's bonds are weaker, it's endothermic.

In our case, the product has more C-H bonds (which are strong) and C-C (weaker than C= bonds).

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 11,200 kJ/mol, which is the sum of bond energies of the reactants.

But that would imply that the product's bonds sum to 11,100 -11,200= -100, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that I've made a mistake in the initial approach, perhaps the formula for ΔHf° is different.

Another approach: Each molecule is made from 10 C atoms and 22 H atoms.

Bond energies of reactants:

10 C atoms → each requires 1000 kJ/mol (but wait, each C atom comes from graphite. The bond energy given is 1000 kJ/mol per mole of C, which for breaking C-C bonds in graphite.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

The total bond energy for C in reactants is the number of C atoms multiplied by the enthalpy of atomization per C atom.

Wait, but the enthalpy of atomization is given per mole of C (solid to gas). So each mole of C atoms requires 1000 kJ/mol.

Similarly, each mole of H atoms comes from H2, which is broken into 2 H atoms per mole of H2. So each H atom requires 50 kJ (100 kJ per H2).

So for the molecule, the number of C atoms is n, and H atoms is m.

ΔHf° = (n *1000 ) + (m *50 ) - [sum of all bond energies in the molecule].

So for the formula C10H22:

n=10 →10,000.

m=22 →22 *50=1,100.

Sum reactants:11,100.

Product bonds:8*200 +2*300 +24*400 = 1,600 +600 +9,600 =11,800.

ΔHf°=11,100 -11,800= -700 kJ/mol.

But again, none of the options match.

Looking back at the options, the only one that is positive and near 11,000 is option A:11,200.

But 11,200 is higher than the reactants sum of 11,100, which would give ΔHf°= -100. But that's not possible because breaking bonds in reactants (11,100) and forming product bonds (11,800) would require more energy than provided, implying the reaction is endothermic, so ΔHf° positive.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula. Maybe the correct formula is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of product] - [sum of bond energies of reactants].

Which would give 11,800 -11,100=700 kJ/mol.

But that's positive, which would imply the reaction is endothermic, which is possible.

But I thought the formula was reactants - product.

Wait, maybe I got the formula backwards.

Because when you form the product, you're forming new bonds which release energy, and breaking bonds in reactants which takes energy.

So the correct formula should be ΔHf° = (sum reactants) - (sum product).

If sum reactants is less than sum product, ΔHf° is negative (exothermic).

But if sum product is higher, then ΔHf° is positive (endothermic).

Wait, but in our case, product bonds sum to 11,800, which is higher than reactants' 11,100.

So ΔHf°=11,100 -11,800= -700, which is exothermic.

But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says, "the enthalpy of atomization of carbon = 1000 kJ/mol." So that's the energy to break C-C bonds in graphite to form C atoms.

Each mole of C in graphite has 12 g, but perhaps that's not relevant here.

Then, the bond energies are given. So for each C-C bond broken in graphite, it's 1000 kJ per mole.

Wait, no. The bond energy is the energy per mole of bonds. So for C-C bond in graphite, it's 1000 kJ/mol per bond.

So, for each mole of C atoms, you have to break 1/12 of a mole of C-C bonds (since each C has four bonds in a graphite lattice, but perhaps that's more complicated).

Wait, maybe the correct way to calculate the bond energy for C is 1000 kJ per mole of C atoms. So for n C atoms, it's n *1000 kJ.

Similarly, for H2, each mole of H atoms requires 50 kJ (since each H2 bond is 100 kJ, providing 2 H atoms).

Thus, for the molecule with 10 C and 22 H:

ΔHf°= (10 *1000) + (22 *50) ) - (sum of product bonds).

=10,000 +1,100 →11,100.

product bonds:11,800.

ΔHf°=11,100 -11,800= -700.

Again, no matching option.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the structure and compute based on the number of each type of bond.

But I'm stuck. Maybe the correct answer is option A, 11,200.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate based on the number of C and H in the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has 12 C and 18 H.

Then, number of C atoms:12 →12,000.

H:18 →9 H2 →9 *100=900.

Sum reactants:12,900.

Product bonds: let's say product has 9 C-C, 2 C=C, 24 C-H.

So 9*200=1,800; 2*300=600;24*400=9,600 → sum 1,800+600=2,400 +9,600=12,000.

ΔHf°=12,900 -12,000=900 kJ.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C8H14.

So 8 C →8,000.

14 H →7 H2 →700.

Sum:8,700.

Product bonds: let's say 6 C-C, 2 C=C, 20 C-H.

6*200=1,200. 2*300=600. 20*400=8,000.

Sum:1,200+600=1,800+8,000=9,800.

ΔHf=8,700-9,800= -1,100.

No match.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe the correct answer is none of the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is [sum of bond energies in the elements] minus [sum of bond energies in the molecule], which in this case would be 12,100 -11,600=500 kJ/mol.

But that's not an option. The options are A:11200, B:67.4, C:11.44 g, D:1900 g.

Wait, perhaps the question is about enthalpy per gram rather than per mole.

Wait, the options C and D are in kJ/g, which is unusual. The others are in kJ/mol.

But the problem statement says 'calculate the enthalpy of formation', which is typically per mole.

Wait, perhaps the options are in kJ/g, but the calculation is for per mole and then converted.

But the given data is in kJ/mol, so the answer should be in kJ/mol.

So, looking back, the only option in kJ/mol is A) 11200.

But wait, that's much higher than the sum of the reactants' bonds, which is 12,100.

Hmm. Perhaps I've made a mistake in the number of bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has more C-C bonds than I thought.

Wait, if the structure has 10 C-C bonds, each 200 →2,000.

Plus 2 C=C →600.

Plus 24 C-H →9,600.

Total product bonds:2,000 +600 +9,600=12,200.

Reactants sum:12,100.

ΔHf=12,100 -12,200= -100 kJ/mol.

But again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure has 12 C-C bonds →12 *200=2,400.

C=C:2 *300=600.

C-H:24 *400=9,600.

Total:2,400 +600=3,000 +9,600=12,600.

Reactants:12,100.

ΔHf=12,100 -12,600= -500.

Still not matching.

Given that I'm stuck and time is limited, perhaps the intended approach is to realize that the number of H atoms is twice the number of C atoms, leading to a specific calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see how to reach that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula, and the correct answer is option A, which is 11,200 kJ/mol. But that's the sum of the reactants' bonds, not the formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 67.4 kJ/mol, but I can't see the connection.

Hmm. I'm truly stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that the correct answer is option A, 11200 kJ/mol.


To calculate the enthalpy of formation of the compound **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂**, the following approach was taken:

### Key Formula
The enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies of the reactants (elements in their standard states) and the bonds in the product molecule:

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Sum of bond energies of reactants]} - \text{[Sum of bond energies of product bonds]}
\]

### Reactants
1. **Carbon (C)**:  
   The enthalpy of atomization of carbon is given as **1000 kJ/mol**. For a molecule with **10 C atoms**, the total energy required to atomize all carbon atoms is:  
   \[
   10 \times 1000 = 10,000 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

2. **Hydrogen (H)**:  
   Each H₂ molecule has a bond energy of **100 kJ/mol**. For a molecule with **22 H atoms**, this corresponds to **11 H₂ molecules**:  
   \[
   11 \times 100 = 1,100 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

**Total bond energy of reactants**:  
\[
10,000 + 1,100 = 11,100 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Product Bonds
The molecule **(CH₃)₂C=CH-CH₂-CH(CH₃)-CH₂-CH=C(CH₃)₂** contains the following bonds:
1. **C-C single bonds**: Counted as **8** in total. Each bond has an energy of **200 kJ/mol**:  
   \[
   8 \times 200 = 1,600 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

2. **C=C double bonds**: Counted as **2** in total. Each bond has an energy of **300 kJ/mol**:  
   \[
   2 \times 300 = 600 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

3. **C-H bonds**: Counted as **24** in total. Each bond has an energy of **400 kJ/mol**:  
   \[
   24 \times 400 = 9,600 \, \text{kJ}
   \]

**Total bond energy of product**:  
\[
1,600 + 600 + 9,600 = 11,800 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Enthalpy of Formation
Using the formula:  
\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = \text{[Sum of reactants]} - \text{[Sum of product bonds]}
\]

\[
\Delta H_f^\circ = 11,100 - 11,800 = -700 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol)**: This value is much higher than the calculated enthalpy of formation and does not match the derived result.  
- **Option B (67.4 kJ/mol)**: This value is far too low and inconsistent with the calculations.  
- **Option C (11.44 kJ/g)** and **Option D (1900 kJ/g)**: These values are in kJ/g, which is inconsistent with the standard unit for enthalpy of formation (kJ/mol).  

### Conclusion
The calculated enthalpy of formation is **-700 kJ/mol**, but none of the provided options match this result. Based on the given options, **Option A (11,200 kJ/mol)** is the closest plausible answer, though it does not align with the detailed calculations.

**Answer: A**
