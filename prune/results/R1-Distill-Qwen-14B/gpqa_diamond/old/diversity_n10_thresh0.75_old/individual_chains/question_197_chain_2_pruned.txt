Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read the question again.

So, the question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. They've given the IR and NMR data for Compound X, and four options to choose from. 

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the spectroscopic data. Then, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduction is used to reduce ketones to alkanes, right? So if Compound X has a ketone group, then the product would be an alkane.

Let's start by analyzing the IR data. The IR shows a peak around 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad peak, possibly from an -OH group or maybe an alkyne. But wait, alkyne C-H stretches are usually around 3300 cm-1, but if it's a broad peak, more like an -OH. Then, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that suggests a ketone or maybe an ester or acid. Also, peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be from aromatic rings, maybe C=C stretching.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have protons that appear as broad singlets around 10-12 ppm. Oh wait, but in the IR, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1 which could be a ketone or maybe an ester or acid. So if the NMR has a peak at 10.5, that's more likely a carboxylic acid because aldehydes are usually lower, like around 9-10. But wait, sometimes the aldehyde proton can be a bit higher depending on substitution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 could also be an ester or a ketone. Let's think about the NMR. Let's see the other peaks. 

The 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm are each a doublet (d), 2H each. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two pairs of doublets, so perhaps a para-disubstituted benzene, with each substituent being a group that causes the aromatic protons to split into doublets. That suggests a structure like para-substituted benzene with two identical groups, maybe a substituent on each ortho position? Wait, no, wait. For example, if you have a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions, the adjacent protons (ortho and meta) would split into doublets. So maybe each substituent
