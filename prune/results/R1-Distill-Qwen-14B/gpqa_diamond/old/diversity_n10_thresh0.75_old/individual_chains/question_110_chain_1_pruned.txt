Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking which stars can be detected with both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. From the information provided, each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, the star needs to have an apparent V magnitude that is less than or equal to 16 (for HIRES) and less than or equal to 17 (for ESPRESSO). Wait, noâ€”wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. Wait, magnitude is a tricky scale. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means its apparent magnitude is less than 17. Because, for example, the Sun is about -26, very bright stars are 0, and each increase in magnitude means it's getting fainter. So, 17 mag is fainter than 16 mag. So, the fainter limit for ESPRESSO is 17 mag, meaning it can't see stars fainter than that. HIRES can go down to 16 mag, which is brighter.

Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. The way it's phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, a star with V magnitude 17 is the limit for ESPRESSO. So, any star with V mag <=17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, HIRES can observe stars with V mag <=16. So, for a star to be observable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=16 because HIRES's limit is lower (brighter).

Wait, but wait. Let me clarify. If a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17, that means it can see all stars with V <=17. Because, for example, a V mag of 17 is the threshold. So, a star with V=17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. But to be observed by HIRES, it must be <=16. So, stars with V
