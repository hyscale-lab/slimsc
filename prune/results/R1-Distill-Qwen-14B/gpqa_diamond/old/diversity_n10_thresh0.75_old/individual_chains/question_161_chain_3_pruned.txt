Okay, so I've got this question about a transmission electron microscope and mean free paths of gas molecules. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right, so Mike's set up a high vacuum, but some gas particles are still there. He measures λ1, the mean free path under those conditions. 

Then, when he turns on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. Wait, why would that happen? Oh, because the electron beam is interacting with the gas molecules. I think when high-energy electrons pass through the gas, they can cause various effects. One possibility is that the electrons knock the gas molecules, maybe ionizing them or causing them to move more. 

Oh, right! There's the concept of electron scattering. When the electrons in the beam hit the gas molecules, they can cause scattering. But in a vacuum, the gas molecules are spread out because of the low pressure. The mean free path λ1 was determined without the beam. Once the beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas, which might increase the effective interaction of the gas molecules with each other and the electrons.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The mean free path depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where d is the collision diameter, P is pressure, and T is temperature. But wait, when the beam is on, perhaps the gas is being excited, maybe increasing the effective cross-section or changing the collision rate.

Alternatively, another effect comes into play: the electron beam can cause gas molecules to be more likely to collide because the beam provides energy. Oh! There's something called the "bombardment effect." High-energy electrons can knock gas molecules out of the vacuum chamber walls, but wait, in this case, the pressure is already low, so even then, maybe it doesn't contribute much. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, it can cause gas molecules to be ionized. Charged particles (ions or electrons) might interact more with the electric fields of the microscope, perhaps altering their trajectories. Or, the presence of the beam could cause more frequent collisions between gas molecules, thereby reducing the mean free path. Because if more collisions happen, the mean free path would be shorter.

Alternatively, maybe the gas is getting heated by the electron beam. If the temperature increases, since mean free path is proportional to temperature (because it's in the numerator of the equation), λ would increase. But the question states that the sample compartment temperature remained the same. So temperature isn't the factor here.

So why does the mean free path change? Let me think about other factors. Oh! The electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be excited, perhaps making them more likely to collide with each other. So the collision cross-section might increase. Or maybe the electrons cause the gas to ionize, leading to more frequent collisions.

Wait, in the presence of the electron beam, the gas molecules might be more likely to collide with each other because the electrons are causing them to move or because the beam's energy affects their interactions. So if the cross-sectional area for collisions (d) increases, the mean free path λ would decrease because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

Wait, but wait, the mean free path λ is given by λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. So if σ increases, λ decreases. So if the electron beam causes σ to increase, then λ2 would be less than λ1.

Alternatively, maybe the beam induces some other effect, like causing the gas to expand or change the pressure, but the pressure is already given as ultra-high vacuum, so probably not a big change.

Another angle: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules can be excited and cause more scattering events, which would mean more frequent collisions, hence shorter mean free path. So λ2 would be less than λ1.

Wait, but what about the mean free path for the electrons? No, the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam itself is causing gas molecules to be scattered, leading to more collisions. Or, more accurately, the electrons are a source of scattering for the gas particles. So the gas particles are now colliding not just with each other but also with the electrons. So the effective cross-section increases because each gas molecule can also collide with the electrons. But wait, in the original calculation (λ1), the mean free path was considering only gas-gas collisions. Now, with the beam on, gas-electron collisions also contribute, so the total collision rate is higher. Therefore, the effective cross-section for collisions is higher, making λ2 smaller than λ1.

Wait, but wait. The mean free path λ is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions with any other molecule. If the beam is adding more particles (the electrons) in the same volume, then the effective number density of scattering centers increases. So for the gas molecules, the presence of the electrons would mean more targets to collide with. So their mean free path would be shorter because they're colliding more often with the electrons as well as with other gas molecules.

But wait, the electrons are moving at relativistic speeds (since the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV, electrons are moving very fast). So their cross-section for collision with gas molecules might be significant. So each gas molecule now has more chances to collide with the fast-moving electrons, leading to shorter mean free path.

So in that case, λ2 would be less than λ1. So looking at the options, option C
