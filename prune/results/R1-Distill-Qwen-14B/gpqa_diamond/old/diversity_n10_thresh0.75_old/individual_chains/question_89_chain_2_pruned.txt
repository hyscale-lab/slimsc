Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

First, the question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

Step 1: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C gives a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I remember is indicative of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). Hmm, so the IR suggests we have a ketone or maybe an ester. But considering the reaction conditions with KOH and heat, it's probably an elimination reaction, maybe forming a diketone?

Wait, wait. 1,3-dibromoadamantane... when treated with a strong base like KOH, especially under high heat, it's likely an E2 elimination. Each bromine would lose H and Br⁻, forming a double bond. But since the molecule is symmetric (1,3-dibromo), maybe the elimination leads to an allene or a conjugated diene? Or wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so perhaps it's a bridged structure. Oh right, adamantane has a structure with four cyclohexane rings fused in a chair-like structure.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br atoms across two bridgeheads. When KOH is used, perhaps dehydrohalogenation occurs. Each Br would lose, so they might form a double bond between C1 and C3? But wait, in adamantane, the positions are such that C1 and C3 are bridgeheads. Oh, wait, but I think that when you eliminate two HBr molecules from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, you form a molecule with two ketone groups. Because the elimination would form a conjugated dienone or something similar.

Wait, no. Let's think again. 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two Br atoms. KOH is a strong base;
