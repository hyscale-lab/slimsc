Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's break it down step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, I need to figure out how to get from benzene to this compound using the given reaction sequences in the options. Let me think about the substituents and their positions.

First, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are at the 1, 2, and 3 positions respectively. Wait, noâ€”actually, numbering the benzene ring can sometimes be a bit confusing. Let me visualize it. Let's imagine the benzene ring with the substituents as follows: the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at position 2, and the nitro at position 3. So, it's ortho, meta arrangement relative to each other.

Now, the key is to figure out the order of substitution because the order will determine where each group ends up due to directing effects. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution, and each substituent will direct the next substitution.

Let me list the substituents:

1. tert-butyl (a bulky group, which is a strong activating, para-directing group)
2. ethoxy (an activating, ortho/para-directing group)
3. nitro (a deactivating, meta-directing group)

Wait, but wait. Nitro groups are meta directors. So if a nitro group is already present, any subsequent substitution will be directed meta to it. But the nitro is a strong deactivating group, which makes the ring less reactive towards further electrophilic substitution.

Hmm, but I'm starting with benzene, which is highly reactive. I need to add these substituents in an order that allows each step to direct the next correctly.

I think the order of adding substituents matters. Let me think: if I add a strong activating group first, like tert-butyl, that might help in adding more groups. Alternatively, adding a nitro group early on might slow down the addition of other groups because the ring becomes deactivating.

Wait, but the target molecule has both nitro and ethoxy groups. Nitro is deactivating, so once added, it would make the ring less reactive. So, perhaps adding nitro last? Because after adding activating groups, the ring is more reactive, which might help in adding the nitro group. But wait, nitration is a meta-directing reaction, which is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added early, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each group's directing effects.

The target structure is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, which can also be named as tert-butyl at position 2, ethoxy at position 1, and nitro at position 3. Wait, let me number the benzene ring correctly. Let's imagine the benzene ring with the substituents: the ethoxy is at position 1, the tert-butyl at 2, and the nitro at 3. So, relative positions: ethoxy ortho to tert-butyl, and nitro meta to ethoxy. Hmm, maybe I should draw it but since I can't, I'll try to visualize.

Another approach: The substituents in the target are at positions 1,2,3. So positions 1 and 2 are adjacent (ethoxy and tert-butyl are next to each other), and nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to ethoxy but across from tert-butyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the order of substituent addition. Let's consider which substituent can be added first.

Optionally, the tert-butyl could be added first. Then, considering that tert-butyl is a strong activating, para-directing group, the next substituent (if added) would go para to it. But in the target, the substituents are ortho and meta. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added next. Let me think: after adding tert-butyl, the next substitution would be directed to the para position of tert-butyl, but in the target, the ethoxy is in the ortho position. That would not fit. So maybe the order is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Nitro is a meta director. Then, adding ethoxy next. Wait, but the nitro group is deactivating, so after nitration, the ring is less reactive, but perhaps the ethoxy can be added via an activating group.

Wait, but wait. Let me outline the steps:

1. First substitution: add tert-butyl group. After that, the ring has a bulky, activating group which is para-directing.

2. Next substitution: perhaps adding ethoxy. Since the tert-butyl is para director, the ethoxy would be added in the para position. But in the target, ethoxy is ortho to tert-butyl. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the right order.

Hmm, perhaps ethoxy should be added first. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Adding ethoxy would direct the next substituent to ortho or para positions.

Suppose we add ethoxy first. Then, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would
