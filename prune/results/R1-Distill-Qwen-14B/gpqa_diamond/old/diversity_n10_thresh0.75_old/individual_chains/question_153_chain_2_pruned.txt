Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C), each of which are Michael additions. The options give possible products for each, and I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I'll recall what a Michael addition is. The Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack by an enolate on a beta, gamma-unsaturated carbonyl compound. The enolate acts as a nucleophile, and the alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl (like an acrylate) is the electrophilic part.

Let's take each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction (A):
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So NaOEt is a strong base, which would deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is (CH3COO)2CHCH3, right? Wait, no. Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(COOCH3)2. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no, the structure is actually:

O
|| 
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-COOCH3

So it's CH2(COOCH3)2. When deprotonated, the enolate would form on the central carbon. So the enolate would have negative charge on the central carbon adjacent to both carbonyls.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait, no, the structure is CH2CH2? No, wait, the E configuration is important. Let me see: for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So structure is CH2=C-CH(p-tolyl)-OCH3. Wait no, wait: the formula for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH(OCOCH3) with the substituent on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as CH2=CH-CH(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or is it CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CH2-OCH3? No, wait, the substituent is on the gamma position. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the double bond is
