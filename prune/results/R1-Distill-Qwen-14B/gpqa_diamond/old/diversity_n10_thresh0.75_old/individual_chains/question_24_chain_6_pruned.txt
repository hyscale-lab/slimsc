Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down.

The problem is about some mixtures and reactions. Let's start by going through the information piece by piece.

First, it says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes, because they can undergo addition reactions with Br2. So mixture X has two liquids, each with unsaturated bonds.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, a new mixture Y is formed, which is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps one of the reactants is being split into two different products with different oxidation states.

Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the products are more saturated than before. For example, if X had alkenes, Y might have more single bonds or maybe even hydrogenated products, but since it's a disproportionation, maybe something like the breaking of a double bond into two different structures.

Then, when both mixtures X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they both give the same hydrocarbon Z. Z is a solvent, and it doesn't react further with hydrogen. So Z must be a fully saturated compound, maybe an alkane because alkanes don't react with hydrogen (they're already saturated). Or wait, wait—hydrogenation usually adds H2, so maybe Z has no double bonds, triple bonds, or rings.

The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies. The mass percentage is (mass of H)/(molar mass of Z) * 100 = 14.28%. Let's denote Z as CnH2m. Wait, but if it's a hydrocarbon, possible structures could be alkanes (saturated), alkenes (but Z doesn't react further, so not alkenes), or maybe aromatic rings (but that's less likely because they might require higher temps for hydrogenation).

Wait, but wait, alkanes are already saturated, so hydrogenation wouldn't change them. But if X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which doesn't change, then Z must be a fully saturated alkane. Because alkenes would react with hydrogen (add H2) but Z doesn't, so it's already an alkane.

So, let's figure out Z. Let me calculate. Let's say Z is CnH2n+2, an alkane. The mass fraction of H is (2n * 1)/(12n + 2n + 2) * 100 = 14.28%.

Wait, let's compute that:

The formula for mass% H is [(number of H atoms × 1)/(molar mass)] × 100 =14.28.

So, mass fraction = (2n)/(12n + 2n + 2) *100 = 14.28%.

Simplify denominator: 14n + 2.

So,

(2n)/(14n +2) *100 =14.28

Divide both sides by 100:

2n/(14n +2) =0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2n =0.1428*(14n +2)

Compute 0.1428 *14n = 2n, because 0.1428 *14 is approximately 2. So:

2n = (2n) + 0.2856

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute 0.1428 *14: 0.1428 *14 = 2 (since 14 × 0.1428 is 2; wait, 14
