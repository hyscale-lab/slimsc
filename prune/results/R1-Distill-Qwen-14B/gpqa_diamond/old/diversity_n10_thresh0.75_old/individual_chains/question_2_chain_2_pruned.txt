Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with trans-cinnamaldehyde. Let me break down each step and see what happens.

First step: trans-cinnamaldehyde is treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. Hmm, I remember that Grignard reagents like methyl magnesium bromide add to aldehydes. Aldehydes have the structure RCHO, and when Grignard reagents react, the Grignard (nucleophile) attacks the carbonyl carbon. So in the case of an aldehyde, the product would be a secondary alcohol after acid workup.

Wait, but wait. trans-cinnamaldehyde is an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)H. Oh, wait, no, wait. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CHO? No, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is the aldehyde form of cinnamic acid. So its structure is Ar-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no, wait. No, cinnamaldehyde is Ar-CH2-CH2-CHO? No. No, cinnamic acid is Ar-CH2-CH2-COOH. Wait, no, cinnamic acid
