Okay, so I've got this question about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about the annihilation process where a high-energy gamma-ray photon collides with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair, right? The reaction is gamma gamma → e+ e-.

The question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. So, I think this has to do with photon-photon interactions and maybe the concept of photon attenuation length. The lifetime being limited would mean that the gamma-rays are annihilating before they can travel too far, so the energy where this happens would depend on the cross-section of the interaction and the density of the CMB photons they're interacting with.

I remember that the cross-section for photon-photon interactions isn't very large, but in the presence of a lot of photons (like the CMB), the interaction rate becomes significant. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, the CMB photons are usually around a milli-eV range, so 1e-3 eV makes sense.

So, how do I approach this? I think I need to find the energy E where the mean free path of the gamma-ray equals the age of the universe's universe's scale, or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the condition where the interaction rate (Gamma) is such that the lifetime (tau) is about the Hubble time or something.

Wait, the mean free path is the distance a photon travels on average before interacting. If the mean free path is smaller than the size of the universe, then the photon would have a limited lifetime because it would interact quickly. So the energy where the mean free path becomes comparable to the universe's size would be the threshold.

The mean free path λ is given by 1/(n σ v), where n is the number density of the target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity.

But wait, photons are massless, so their velocity is the speed of light c. So v ≈ c. So λ ≈ 1/(n σ c). 

The interaction rate Γ is the inverse of the lifetime τ, so Γ = 1/τ. If the lifetime is to be limited by this process, then τ must be comparable to the age of the universe, say t ~ 1e10 years. Alternatively, since we're dealing with high-energy processes, perhaps it's better to use the Hubble constant H0 to find the Hubble time, which is about 1e10 years.

Wait, but the Hubble parameter H0 is about 70 km/s/Mpc, and the age of the universe is roughly 1/H0 ≈ 14 billion years, which is about 4.4e17 seconds. So, t ≈ 1e18 seconds or something like that.

But perhaps there's a standard way to compute the threshold energy where the photon's lifetime is limited by photon-photon interactions. I think this is a standard calculation in astrophysics or particle physics.

I recall that when a photon's energy is
