Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its decay. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of this meson X. They give the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. 

Hmm, mean decay distance... I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ ≈ ħ/τ, but wait, actually, the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is ħ. So for the width Γ, which is the uncertainty in energy, the lifetime τ is ħ/(Γ). 

So first, I need to find the lifetime τ of this meson. Once I have τ, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the velocity of the meson. Because distance is velocity multiplied by time. But wait, the meson is moving, so I need to find its velocity.

Wait, but the meson's energy is given as 8 GeV, and its mass is 1.2 GeV. So I can find its momentum using the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The energy E is given by sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So I can solve for p.

Let me rearrange that:

p c = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) 

Wait, but E is in GeV, and m is in GeV/c², so units might get a bit tricky. Let me think about the calculation.

So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². So plugging into the equation:

p = sqrt( (E^2 - (m c^2)^2) ) / (c^2) ?

Wait, no. Let me re-express the terms properly. Let's write it as:

E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 

So, (p c)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2 

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) 

So p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c 

Wait, but E and m are in units that include c squared. Hmm, maybe I should just work with natural units where c=1 for the calculations, and then convert back at the end.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute the momentum in units where c is 1, and then multiply by c to get back to proper units. Let me see.

Wait, so in natural units (c=1, ħ=1), E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So then, p is sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) GeV. Let me compute that.

8^2 is 64, 1.2^2 is 1.44. 64 minus 1.44 is 62.56. So sqrt(62.56) is about 7.91 GeV. So p ≈7.91 GeV/c. 

Wait, but wait, in natural units, p is in GeV/c. So to get actual momentum in units of kg·m/s, I might need to do some unit conversions. But maybe I can wait until the end for that.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the velocity of the meson. Because the mean decay distance is v * τ.

So velocity v is given by the relativistic expression: v = c * sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E^2)} )

Wait, but since E is much larger than m c² (E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so m c² is 1.2 GeV), so perhaps the velocity is close to c. But let's compute it accurately.

In natural units, v is beta * c, where beta is (p c) / E. So beta = (p c) / E. From earlier, p c is sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) GeV, which is sqrt(62.56) = 7.91 GeV. So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875.

So beta ≈ 0.98875, so v ≈ 0.98875 * c. That's a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the velocity is about 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s. But let's compute it more accurately later.

Now, back to the lifetime. The meson's width Γ is given as 320 MeV. I think the width is related to the lifetime via Γ = ħ / τ. Wait, no, wait: the natural line width equation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Γ is given in MeV, so I have to convert it into energy units compatible with ħ, which is in J·s.

Alternatively, perhaps in natural units where ħ = 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s, I can compute τ. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so ħ in GeV·s is 6.582e-25.

So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

So Γ = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 s

Let me compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s.

Which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, that can’t be right. Because 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 = about 20.56875 * 1e-25 s, which is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, but is this correct? Because tau is the mean lifetime, so yes, τ = ħ/(Γ).

Wait, but I'm getting τ as approximately 2e-24 seconds.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * tau.

v is 0.98875c, so c is 3e8 m/s. So v is approximately 2.966e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = (2.966e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) ) = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 m.

Calculating 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see:

2.966 * 2 = 5.932,

2.966 * 0.056875 ≈ 0.168 (since 0.056875 is
