Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is that they found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The results of their resistance tests are given. The control is 100% resistance, meaning wild type is highly resistant. The mutants have varying resistances: g1 is 75%, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%, g1g3 is 10%, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%.

I need to figure out the interaction between these genes based on their phenotypes. The question mentions that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. 

Let me think about what each result means.

First, the single mutants: 
- g1 has 75% resistance. So it's less than wild type but not completely susceptible. Maybe G1 isn't the only factor, or perhaps its function isn't entirely gone.
- g2 is 0%, so this plant is completely susceptible. That's a big decrease. Maybe G2 is critical for resistance. Since the question says one is a transcription factor upstream, maybe G2 is that factor.
- g3 is 50% resistance. So it's half as resistant as wild type. That suggests G3 contributes but isn't the only one.

Now the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Both mutations cause complete susceptibility. So the absence of both G1 and G2 leads to no resistance. But wait, g2 alone is also 0%—so perhaps G2 is necessary for resistance. If g2 is 0%, then its function is crucial. So without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 or G3.

Looking at g1g3: 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance drops further. But neither single mutant g1 nor g3 is as bad as this. Hmm. So perhaps G1 and G3 are contributing to resistance, but when both are missing, the resistance is even lower.

g2g3 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So without G2, having G3 also knocked out doesn't change the resistance. So G3 might only function if G2 is present. That makes sense if G2 is upstream. Maybe G2 activates G3 or other genes.

g1g2 is 0%, same as g2 alone. So when G1 is also knocked out along with G2, the resistance is still 0%. That suggests that G2's function is independent of G1. Or perhaps G1 isn't downstream of G2. Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then G1 might be downstream. But if G2 knock-out is already 0%, then G1 might not contribute when G2 is absent.

Wait, let me think about epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if the double mutant has the same phenotype as one of the single mutants, that gene is epistatic to the other.

Looking at g2g3: 0% like g2. So when G3 is knocked out in addition to G2, the resistance doesn't drop further—it's still 0%. So that suggests that the function of G3 only contributes when G2 is present. So G2 is epistatic to G3. Because the presence of G2's function is required for G3's effect to be seen. So G2 is upstream; without it, G3 can't do anything.

Similarly, the double mutant g1g2 is 0% like g2. So when G1 is knocked out along with G2, the resistance is 0%—the same as when only G2 is knocked out. So the presence of G1 doesn't change anything when G2 is absent. That suggests G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G1 were upstream, then knocking out both might result in a more severe phenotype than just G2. But here, it's the same as G2 alone. So G2 is epistatic to G1.

So G2 is acting upstream of G1 and G3, perhaps. Because when G2 is knocked out, the presence of the other mutations doesn't change the resistance.

Now looking at the single mutants again: G2 is 0%, G1 is 75%, G3 is 50%. So the presence of G1 alone gives 75% resistance, and G3 gives 50%. So perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2 but maybe function in parallel pathways.

When both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), the resistance is 10%, which is lower than either single mutant. So their functions contribute additively or synergistically. So maybe G1 and G3 are in separate pathways that both contribute to resistance. So without both, the resistance is worse.

Now, let's look at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Wait, G2 is 0%, so it's likely the TF. So A says G1 is TF. That would conflict with our earlier conclusion that G2 is the TF. So probably not A.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (so same pathway?), G3 epistatic to G1.

Wait, if G1 and G3 have same promoter, knocking out either would have similar effects. But in the data, g1 is 75%, g3 is 50%. Not same. So perhaps this isn't the case. Also, B says G3 is epistatic to G1. But from earlier, G2 is epistatic to both. So B may not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 epistatic over G3.

Wait, pleiotropy means a single gene affecting multiple traits. But here, perhaps G1 and G3 are both involved in the same pathway. Alternatively, I'm not sure about pleiotropy here. Also, C says G1 is epistatic to G3. But from the data, in g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is lower than both G1 and G3. So perhaps G1 and G3 are additive. But if G1 were epistatic to G3, then knocking out both would have the same effect as G1 alone. But in this case, it's worse than either. So maybe that's not it.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic to G3.

Gene redundancy is when two genes can compensate for each other. So knocking out both would have a more severe effect than either alone. Which is what we
