Okay, so I have this question about optical activity of several compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them exhibit optical activity. The options are from A to D, with A being 5 correct and D being 4. Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene:** 
   Hmmm, so this is a chlorinated alkene. The configuration is Z, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But optical activity in alkenes usually comes from having a chiral center. Wait, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let me draw the structure. It's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on C1 are Cl and another CH2 group (since it's 1-chloro and 2-methyl). So C1 has Cl, CH2CH2CH3 (from the butene chain), and two other substituents? Wait, no. Let me see. Structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, wait. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. At position 1 (the CH2 end), there's a Cl, and at position 2 (the CH), a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would make it (Z) configuration. So does that create a chiral center?

Wait, the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded to the second. The second carbon has a methyl group and two other substituents. Let me see: C1 is Cl, CH2 group (but butene is four carbons, so after C1 comes C2 which
