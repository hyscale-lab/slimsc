Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length a. Monochromatic light is shining along the z-axis, and I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Hmm. 

Wait, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, creating a diffraction pattern. The far field region is where the light has spread out, so we're looking at the interference pattern there. For a single slit, the minima occur at certain angles, right?

The question mentions that when N is infinitely large, the shape becomes like a circle because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So, perhaps this is a problem about circular aperture diffraction. Oh wait, but the options given don't match the single-slit exactly. Wait, the single-slit formula for minima is a sin(theta) = m lambda, where m is the order. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is when the angle is such that the path difference around the circumference corresponds to a half wavelength difference. 

Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is different. The minima occur at angles where the path difference from the edges leads to destructive interference. For a single slit (which is a different scenario, but maybe the problem is similar?), the minima are at a sin(theta) = m lambda, but for a single slit, yeah, that's right. But this is a polygonal aperture which becomes a circle as N approaches infinity.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, wait, for circular diffraction, the first minimum is at theta given by something like a sin(theta) = 1.22 lambda, so the first minimum is at around 1.22 lambda/a. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Or is it the first minimum from the central maximum?

Wait no, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think. For a single slit, the first minimum is at theta where a sin(theta) = lambda. Wait, no: wait, single-slit diffraction minima are at a sin(theta) = m lambda, m = 1,2,3... So the first minimum is at theta where a sin(theta) = lambda. So the angular position is theta = arcsin( (lambda)/a ). But because the angles are small, sin(theta) ≈ theta, so theta ≈ lambda/a.

Wait, but the problem is assuming that the polygon has N sides and all apothems are length a. So the polygon becomes a circle with apothem a. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) as a = R cos(pi/N). Oh, but when N is very large, R is approximately equal to a, because cos(pi/N) approaches 1 as N becomes large. So for a circular aperture, the radius R is approximately a. Because when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem a becomes the radius R, but wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the middle of a side. For a circle, the apothem would be equal to the radius. So in this case, perhaps for the circular case, the radius R is equal to the apothem a.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this straight. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. The radius (circumradius) is the distance from the center to a vertex. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius r (which is the same as the circumradius) by a = r * cos(pi/N). So for very large N, the apothem a approaches r,
