Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. They weigh 7.20 grams in total and are heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through several tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2 doesn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas remain at standard temperature and pressure. The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes to determine what the original salts were. Let's break it down.

First, I'll consider the gases produced. The salts are heated without air, which suggests that they might be undergoing thermal decomposition, maybe producing gases like CO2, H2O (vapor), NH3, or something else. The tubes are used to trap these gases.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong dehydrating agent and can react with water. Also, it can react with other substances. When it's anhydrous, maybe it's acting as a desiccant, but I think in this context, it's more likely to react with specific gases. For example, Mg(ClO4)2 can react with water vapor. The formula is Mg(ClO4)2, so when it reacts with water, maybe it forms Mg(ClO4)2·xH2O or something else. Or perhaps it's reacting with another acid or base gas.

Wait, another thought: Mg(ClO4)2 is a powerful drying agent and can also react with ammonia. Wait, but ammonia is a base. Mg(ClO4)2 is acidic because ClO4- is a weak base, but Mg^2+ is a Lewis acid. So, maybe it reacts with water or with NH3.

Wait, but the reaction with Mg(ClO4)2 and water: Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O? I'm not sure, but I think in this setup, the increase in mass in tube 1 is due to the absorption of a gas. If the gas is water vapor, then Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it. Alternatively, maybe the gas is NH3, which would react.

Wait, but if Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, it can react with water. So maybe the gas is water vapor. Let me think: if the salt A and B when heated produce H2O vapor, then the anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 would trap it. So the mass increase of 3.60g would be the mass of the water absorbed. Because Mg(Cl
