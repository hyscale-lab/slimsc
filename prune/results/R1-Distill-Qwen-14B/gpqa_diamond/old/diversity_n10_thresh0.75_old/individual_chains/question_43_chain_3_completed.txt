Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but let's try to work through this step by step.

The question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, meta means each is separated by two carbons, right? So if I imagine the benzene ring, these three groups are each in positions that are three apart. But wait, no, meta is two positions away. Like in positions 1,3,5 if the ring is numbered that way. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think: in a benzene ring, substituents that are meta are in positions 1,3,5 if it's a tri-substituted ring. But wait, the question says they are all meta to one another. So each is meta to the others. So they must be in positions 1,3,5. Wait, but wait, actually, I think that's when all three are meta to each other. Because if you have three substituents, each pair is meta. So their positions are 1,3,5.

But wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For three substituents to be mutually meta, they can't all be at 1,3,5 positions. Because 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, but 1 and 5 are ortho. No, no. Wait, maybe I'm confusing. No, in a benzene ring, each substituent being meta to the other two would require a specific arrangement. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Alternatively, perhaps the three groups are each meta to each other, which would mean that each is separated by two positions from the others. So, for example, if one is in position 1, the next would be in 3, and the third in 5? Because that way, each is two positions apart from the others. Wait, but 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, and 5 and 1 would be ortho. Oh wait, no. 1 and 5 are ortho because they are adjacent (positions 1 and 2 are ortho, 2 and 3 are meta, etc.), but 5 and 1 are across each other. Wait, no, wait. Benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1 and 3 are meta (two apart), 1 and 4 are para. So, if substituents are in 1,3,5, then each is meta to the others. Wait, 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 5 are para? No, wait, 1 and 5 are actually adjacent, so ortho. Oh, wait, no. Let me number the ring: position 1, then 2 is next, 3 is next, etc. So 1 and 2 are ortho, 1 and 3 are meta, 1 and 4 are para. Similarly, 2 and 4 are meta. So, if substituents are at 1,3,5, then each pair is either meta or para.

Wait, 1 and 3 are meta, 3 and 5 are meta, but 1 and 5 are para. Oh, so those three substituents can't all be meta to each other. Because 1 and 5 would be para, not meta. So I must have made a mistake here. So perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the substituents are each meta to each other in a way that they form a meta arrangement. Maybe it's arranged as 2,4,6 positions. Let me think: 2,4,6 positions are each two apart. So substituent at 2 is meta to substituent at 4, substituent at 4 is meta to substituent at 6, and substituent at 6 is meta to substituent at 2. So that way, each substituent is meta to the others. So in this case, the three substituents are in the 2,4,6 positions. So that setup makes sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the substituents as a ring with three substituents in positions that are all meta. So, for example, each substituent is two positions away from the others.

Wait, maybe the question is a bit more complicated. Let me read the question again.

The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So each of these three groups is in a position that is meta to each other. So each group is in a position that's two away from the other two. Hmm, that seems tricky because in a benzene ring, that would require each substituent to be two away from the others. Let me think of a way to arrange this.

Wait, perhaps the substituents form a triangle where each is two positions apart. So, in a benzene ring, if substituent A is at position 1, substituent B is at position 3, and substituent C is at position 5, then A is meta to B (positions 1 and 3), B is meta to C (positions 3 and 5), but A and C are para (positions 1 and 5). Oh, which isn't meta. So that setup doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe substituents are at positions 1, 4, and 6? No, that's not possible because 1 and 4 are para, so they can't be meta to each other. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question says all three groups are meta to one another. So, each is meta to the other two. So for all three, each pair is meta. That would require each pair to be in positions that are two apart.

But in benzene, each position is connected to two others as ortho, one as meta, and one as para. So, if I have substituents at positions 1, 3, and 5, then:

- 1 and 3 are meta (correct),
- 3 and 5 are meta (correct),
- 1 and 5 are para (incorrect, as they should be meta).

So this arrangement won't work because 1 and 5 are para, not meta.

Wait, perhaps the three substituents are arranged in a way that each is meta to the others but not in consecutive positions. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Perhaps I should focus on the other substituents and their positions relative to the carboxylic acid. The question states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Oh, wait, the carboxylic acid group is one of the substituents. So, let's assign positions relative to it.

Let me start by numbering the benzene ring. Let's say the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at position 1. So, the ring is numbered starting from the COOH group as position 1.

Then, ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) group. So, substituents at positions 2 and 6. But which one is where? It depends on the structure.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (-OCH3). So the para position is position 4. So the methoxy group is at position 4.

Additionally, the methoxy and the alcohol (OH) are both ortho to the nitrile group (CN). So the nitrile group must be in a position where both the OH and OCH3 are ortho to it. Let me think: the nitrile is in position 3. Then, positions 2 and 4 would be ortho to it. Because position 3's ortho positions are 2 and 4.

Wait, but wait. Let me draw this:

Positions:

1: COOH

2: ?

4: OCH3

6: ?

But the OH and N(CH3)2 are at positions 2 and 6. Let's say position 2 is OH, position 6 is N(CH3)2.

Wait, but the nitrile (CN) is part of the three meta substituent group. So the COOH, CN, and CHO (carbaldehyde) are all meta to each other.

Wait, the COOH is at position 1. So the meta positions would be 3 and 5. Wait, no: for a benzene ring, the meta positions relative to position 1 are 3 and 5. So the other two substituents (CN and CHO) must be at positions 3 and 5.

But wait, the question says the COOH, CN, and CHO are all meta to each other. So each of them is meta to the others. So if COOH is at 1, then CN and CHO must be at 3 and 5? But 3 and 5 are meta to each other (since 3's meta is 6, but wait, no. Wait, position 3: meta positions are 6 and 1. Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so each position's meta is two positions away in either direction. So position 1's meta is position 3 (next meta would be 5, but that's three away, which is para). Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to number the ring in such a way that the substituents are arranged correctly. Let me try this:

Putting COOH at position 1.

Then, the other two meta substituents (CN and CHO) must be at positions 3 and 5 because each is meta to each other. Wait, position 3 and 5 are two apart, so they are meta. So, for example, 3 and 5 are meta, and 1 is meta to 3 (since position 1 and 3 are two apart) and 1 is meta to 5 (since position 1 and 5 are four apart, which is actually two apart the other wayâ€”so they are meta).

Wait, no. Wait, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 3 are meta, positions 1 and 4 are para, positions 1 and 5 are ortho (since moving clockwise, 1 to 2 is ortho, 2 to 3 is ortho, etc.), but wait no. Wait, in a benzene ring, the positions are arranged in a hexagon. So, position 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6 (ortho), position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3 (ortho), and so on.

So, the meta positions for 1 are 3 and 5. So if COOH is at 1, the other two meta substituents (CN and CHO) would be at 3 and 5. So in this arrangement, each substituent is meta to the others.

Wait, but the problem says that all three are meta to one another. So each substituent is meta to every other substituent. So COOH (1) is meta to CN (3) and CHO (5), but then CN (3) and CHO (5) are also meta to each other. Because position 3 and 5 are two apart? Wait, 3 and 5 are two positions apart in a ring of six. So yes, they are meta to each other. So this arrangement works: 1,3,5 positions for COOH, CN, and CHO.

So the substituents are:

1: COOH

3: CN

5: CHO (carbaldehyde)

But wait, what about the other substituents? Let's see. The question also states that ortho to COOH (position 1) are a hydroxyl and a dimethylamino group. So positions 2 and 6 have substituents.

Also, para to COOH is the methoxy group at position 4.

Additionally, the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile group (CN). So, the nitrile is at position 3. So the ortho positions to 3 are 2 and 4. So, which substituents are at 2 and 4?

Wait, position 2 is ortho to 3. So substituent at 2 is either OH or N(CH3)2. Position 4 is OCH3.

Wait, the methoxy is at 4, which is ortho to the nitrile at 3. So OCH3 is at position 4, which is ortho to CN at 3. So that's correct.

The alcohol (OH) is also ortho to CN. So the OH must be at position 2, which is ortho to position 3 (CN). So position 2 has OH.

What about position 6? It's ortho to COOH at 1. So position 6 has the dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2).

Let me list all substituents again:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2

So, substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, but that would be all positions on the ring, which is not possible because a benzene ring can have six substituents, but this molecule has six substituents? No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, the substituents are the three meta groups (COOH, CN, CHO), and then the ortho to COOH has OH and N(CH3)2, and para to COOH is OCH3. So all substituents are accounted for.

Wait, but position 4 is OCH3, which is para to COOH. Also, OCH3 is at 4, which is ortho to CN at 3. That's correct per the question.

So now, the substituents are at positions 1(COOH), 2(OH), 3(CN), 4(OCH3),5(CHO),6(N(CH3)2). Wait, but that's six substituents. Hmm, but benzene can have up to six substituents, but in reality, the molecule can't have six substituents besides the ring. Wait, no, the ring itself is part of the molecule, and substituents are attached to it. So, in this case, the substituents are COOH, OH, CN, OCH3, CHO, and N(CH3)2. So that's six substituents on the benzene ring, which is possible.

Wait, but let me think again. The question mentions a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Also, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile.

Wait, so substituents at positions:

1: COOH (carboxylic acid)

2: OH (hydroxyl)

3: CN (cyano)

4: OCH3 (methoxy)

5: CHO (carbaldehyde)

6: N(CH3)2 (dimethyl amino)

So that's all six positions filled. Now, to name this compound, I need to determine the correct numbering to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, but the IUPAC rules for benzene rings say that the substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible numbers. So, for a benzoic acid derivative, the COOH group is given the lowest possible number, which is 1. Then, the other substituents are numbered in a way that their numbers are as low as possible.

So in this case, COOH is position 1.

Now, the substituents are at positions 2 (OH), 3 (CN), 4 (OCH3),5 (CHO),6 (N(CH3)2).

Wait, but the question wants the IUPAC name, so the substituents are listed alphabetically in the name, after the main functional group.

Wait, the main functional group here is the carboxylic acid, so the base name is benzoic acid.

Then, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order as prefixes, with their positions.

The substituents are:

CN (cyano),

CHO (carbaldehyde),

OCH3 (methoxy),

OH (hydroxyl),

N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino),

and COOH is the main group.

Wait, but wait, when numbering, the substituents are given the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps the numbering can be adjusted to make the substituent numbers as low as possible.

Let me check if there's a way to number the ring such that substituent numbers are lower. For example, maybe starting the numbering at a different position would give lower numbers.

Let me imagine the substituents in the order of the main group and the substituents:

Main group: COOH at position 1.

Other substituents at 2,3,4,5,6.

But if I number the ring starting at a different position, perhaps I can get lower numbers for some substituents. Let me think.

Wait, the substituents are at 1,2,3,4,5,6. So if I start numbering from position 2, then the COOH would be at position 6. But the main group would then be at 6, which isn't better than 1, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the main group is at position 1, and the substituents are numbered from 2 onwards.

Now, the substituents are:

Position 2: OH

Position 3: CN

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CHO

Position 6: N(CH3)2

So, the substituents in order would be:

CN (3-cyano),

CHO (5-formyl),

OCH3 (4-methoxy),

OH (2-hydroxy),

N(CH3)2 (6-(dimethylamino)).

Wait, but the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so the order in the name would be based on their substituent names.

Let me list them with their positions:

At position 2: hydroxyl (OH)

Position 3: cyano (CN)

Position 4: methoxy (OCH3)

Position 5: formyl (CHO)

Position 6: dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)

So, the substituents are:

2-hydroxy,

3-cyano,

4-methoxy,

5-formyl,

6-(dimethylamino).

So the base name is benzoic acid, so the full name would be:

3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but wait, when naming, the substituents are arranged alphabetically, not by position. So the order in the name is based on the substituent's name, not their position numbers.

The substituents are: formyl, hydroxy, methoxy, cyano, dimethylamino.

Wait, let me list them alphabetically:

Cyano comes first? Wait, no. Let me think about the alphabetical order of the substituent prefixes.

The substituents:

- 2-hydroxy

- 3-cyano

-4-methoxy

-5-formyl

-6-(dimethylamino)

The substituent prefixes are:

cyano (C),

formyl (F),

hydroxy (H),

methoxy (M),

dimethylamino (N).

So the order in the name is alphabetical: C comes before F, which comes before H, then M, then N.

Wait, but wait: the substituents are arranged alphabetically, so the order would be:

cyano, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy, dimethylamino.

Wait, no, wait: the substituents are named in alphabetical order, regardless of their position. So the substituent with the name that comes first alphabetically is listed first in the name.

So the substituents in alphabetical order are:

C (cyano), F (formyl), H (hydroxy), M (methoxy), N (dimethylamino).

So the name would be:

3-cyano-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Wait, but let me check the options provided.

Looking at option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That matches what I just wrote. Let me see the order in the options.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So let's see the substituents order in option B: hydroxy (2), cyano (3), methoxy (4), formyl (5), dimethylamino (6). Alphabetically, this isn't correct because cyano starts with C, which comes before H.

Option A's order is cyano, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy, dimethylamino. That's correct for alphabetical order.

Now, checking the substituent positions:

COOH is at 1.

CN is at 3.

CHO is at 5.

OH is at 2.

OCH3 is at 4.

N(CH3)2 is at 6.

So the substituents are correctly numbered as per their positions.

So the correct name would be option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but looking at option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

The substituents are in the correct order alphabetically, but the positions may not match.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the numbering. Let me double-check.

In my initial setup, COOH is at 1, OH at 2, CN at3, OCH3 at4, CHO at5, N(CH3)2 at6.

So substituent positions:

- COOH: 1

- OH: 2

- CN:3

- OCH3:4

- CHO:5

- N(CH3)2:6

Thus, when writing the substituents in alphabetical order, their numbering would be:

CN (3),

CHO (5),

OH (2),

OCH3 (4),

N(CH3)2 (6).

Wait, so the substituents would be listed in the order: CN, CHO, OH, OCH3, N(CH3)2.

So the full name would be 3-cyano-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Which is option A.

Wait, option A is exactly that.

But let me make sure of the positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the substituents. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says that the methoxy and the alcohol are both ortho to the nitrile. So, OCH3 (para to COOH) is at position 4, and OH is at position 2.

Nitrile is at 3. So, the positions ortho to 3 are 2 and 4, which are OH and OCH3. That fits.

Also, the dimethylamino group is at position6, which is ortho to COOH (position1), as 6 is adjacent to 1.

CHO is at position5, which is meta to COOH (position1), since 1 and5 are adjacent? Wait, no. Wait, position1 and5 are adjacent. So 1 and5 are ortho. Wait, but the question said the COOH, CN, and CHO are all meta to each other. So that can't be right.

Wait, this is a problem because in my initial setup, COOH is at 1, CHO is at5, which is ortho to COOH. But the question says that the COOH, CN, and CHO are all meta to each other.

Ah, here's the mistake! So, I must have the substituents arranged such that COOH, CN, and CHO are all meta to each other. So, each of these substituents must be two positions away from each other.

Wait, perhaps I numbered the substituents incorrectly.

Let me start over. Let's imagine that COOH is at position 1.

CHO must be at a position that is meta to COOH. So, position 3 or 5.

Similarly, CN must be at a position that is meta to COOH and meta to CHO.

Wait, so perhaps if COOH is at1, CHO is at3, then CN must be at5, because 5 is meta to 3 (since 3 and5 are two positions apart).

Wait, that would make:

1: COOH

3: CHO

5: CN.

Wait, but then let's check: COOH (1) is meta to CHO (3) and to CN (5), which are each two positions away. CHO (3) is meta to CN (5), as 3 and5 are two apart.

So this arrangement satisfies that COOH, CHO, and CN are all meta to each other.

In this setup, the substituents are:

1: COOH

3: CHO

5: CN.

Now, the other substituents: ortho to COOH are OH and N(CH3)2, which would be positions 2 and6.

Para to COOH is position4, which is OCH3.

Moreover, the OCH3 and OH are both ortho to the CN group (at5).

Wait, CN is at5, so its ortho positions are 4 and6.

Wait, OCH3 is at4, which is ortho to CN at5. That's correct.

OH is at2, but CN is at5. So the ortho positions for CN (5) are 4 and6. So OH at position2 is not ortho to CN at5. So this setup doesn't satisfy the condition that both OH and OCH3 are ortho to CN.

So that's a problem.

Hmm, so perhaps the arrangement is different.

Alternative approach: Let's have COOH at position1.

CHO at position5 (meta to 1).

CN at position3 (meta to 1 and to 5).

Then, substituents ortho to COOH (1) are positions2 and6.

Which would be OH and N(CH3)2.

Para to COOH is position4: OCH3.

Now, for CN (position3), the ortho positions are 2 and4.

So, OCH3 is at4, which is ortho to CN.

OH is at2, which is also ortho to CN.

So that's correct.

So the substituents would be:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CN

4: OCH3

5: CHO

6: N(CH3)2.

So the substituents are now correctly placed.

Now, their positions:

COOH:1,

CHO:5,

CN:3,

OH:2,

OCH3:4,

N(CH3)2:6.

So when naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order.

The substituents are:

CHO (formyl),

CN (cyano),

OH (hydroxy),

OCH3 (methoxy),

N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino).

So, the order for the substituents in the name is alphabetical:

C (cyano) comes first,

then F (formyl),

then H (hydroxy),

then M (methoxy),

then N (dimethylamino).

So the substituents in order are:

3-cyano,

5-formyl,

2-hydroxy,

4-methoxy,

6-(dimethylamino).

So the name is 3-cyano-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Looking at the options, option A is:

3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which matches the substituent order I just wrote. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, let me check option B:

2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

The substituent order here is different. It starts with hydroxy, which is not correct because 'cyano' should come first alphabetically.

So option B is incorrect in the substituent order.

Thus, the correct option is A.


The molecule is a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid (-COOH), a carbaldehyde (-CHO), and a cyano (-CN) group, all meta to one another. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino (-N(CHâ‚ƒ)â‚‚) group, and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy (-OCHâ‚ƒ) group. The methoxy and hydroxyl groups are also ortho to the cyano group. The task is to determine the correct IUPAC name for this molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Substituent Positions**:
   - The carboxylic acid (-COOH) is assigned to position 1.
   - The cyano (-CN) and carbaldehyde (-CHO) groups are meta to the carboxylic acid, so they are at positions 3 and 5, respectively.
   - Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are the hydroxyl (-OH) and dimethylamino (-N(CHâ‚ƒ)â‚‚) groups, which are at positions 2 and 6, respectively.
   - Para to the carboxylic acid (position 1) is the methoxy (-OCHâ‚ƒ) group at position 4.
   - The methoxy (-OCHâ‚ƒ) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups are ortho to the cyano (-CN) group at position 3, confirming their positions at 2 and 4.

2. **Substituent Order in the Name**:
   - The substituents are listed alphabetically in the IUPAC name: cyano (C), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M), and dimethylamino (N).
   - The positions of the substituents are:
     - 3-cyano
     - 5-formyl
     - 2-hydroxy
     - 4-methoxy
     - 6-(dimethylamino)

3. **Correct Name**:
   - The full IUPAC name is **3-cyano-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid**.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Matches the derived name exactly.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect because it lists the substituents in the wrong alphabetical order.
   - **Options C and D**: Incorrect as they misrepresent the substituent positions or order.

### Final Answer:
The correct IUPAC name for the molecule is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

Answer: A
