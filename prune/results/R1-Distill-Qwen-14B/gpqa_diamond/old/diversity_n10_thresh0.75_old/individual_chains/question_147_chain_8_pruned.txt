Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the velocity of particle A in a certain reaction.

The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of each A⁺ and A⁻. Interesting. I remember that in particle reactions, conservation laws are key here—like conservation of energy and momentum.

The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so I guess that means its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass. Wait, the mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. So each A has a rest mass energy of 300 MeV.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe I can approximate that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy, so its total energy is close to its rest energy. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach yet.

Let me think about the initial and final states. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. I know the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So each has a rest mass of about 938 MeV, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can model their energies as their rest energies plus a small kinetic. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the proton is at rest? Or maybe
