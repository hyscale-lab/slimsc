Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves several reactions and their products, and then determining the NMR coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product.

Alright, let's start by reading the problem carefully.

The first part says that 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), 1.94 ppm (2H). Also, there's an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, okay. So I need to figure out what product 1 is. Let's think about the reaction conditions. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromo compounds react with it, especially when heated, it's likely an elimination reaction, maybe dehydrohalogenation. But wait, in adamantane derivatives, elimination could form an alkene.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3 of the adamantane structure. When KOH is used with such a compound, perhaps in a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of an allene (a conjugated diene?) but wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so maybe the elimination occurs to form a double bond.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane on dehydrohalogenation would lose two HBr molecules, forming an alkene. But wait, elimination typically forms a double bond. But if there are two bromines, perhaps it's a vicinal dihalide, so elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2? But then, wait, the parent structure is adamantane, which is a bicyclic structure. So maybe the elimination occurs to form an exo-cyclic double bond.

Alternatively, another possibility is that KOH might cause a substitution, but in such a structure, substitution might be less likely than elimination. Also, given the IR data, there's a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. Wait, that's a strong indication of a ketone or an ester. But the product is formed by heating with KOH, which is a base. Hmm, maybe it's an epoxide? No, epoxides don't have a carbonyl group.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of the dibromide. But hydrolysis of a dihalide typically leads to diols, but that would be under different conditions, maybe not with KOH. Alternatively, if it's an elimination, maybe it forms a ketone through some rearrangement.

Wait, perhaps elimination of two equivalents of HBr would form a carbonyl group. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane, upon elimination of two HBr molecules, would lose Br from each adjacent carbon. But wait, the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent. So perhaps that's not possible for a vicinal dihalide. Alternatively, maybe the structure of adamantane allows for some kind of conjugated elimination.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the reaction is a double dehydrohalogenation, leading to an allene, which is a diene. But how would that result in a carbonyl group? Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to the formation of a ketone via some rearrangement.

Wait, let me think about possible products. If the product has a carbonyl group, maybe it's an diketone. But the starting material is a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps the base (KOH) abstracts a beta-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of a double bond. But since it's a dihalide, maybe two eliminations occur, leading to a conjugated diene.

But wait, the IR shows 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So perhaps the product is a ketone. How can elimination of HBr lead to a ketone? Maybe via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement? That would require a carbocation rearrangement, but with KOH, which is a strong base, perhaps it's more of an elimination scenario.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the dihalide doesn't eliminate but instead undergoes substitution. But with KOH, substitution would lead to a diol. But 1,3-diol on adamantane. However, the IR would show O-H stretch if it were a diol, which isn't mentioned. So maybe not.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an epoxide. But again, that might require a different setup. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Hofmann elimination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR data might help. The 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom or group. For example, maybe an epoxide would have protons around 3-4 ppm. Alternatively, in a ketone, adjacent protons (like CH2CO) might be around 2-3 ppm, but 4.79 seems higher. Wait, maybe it's a diol, but then why the IR doesn't show OH.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclopropane or something else, but the 1720 cm⁻¹ points more towards a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone. How can a dihalide turn into a ketone? Maybe through oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, perhaps elimination forms a carbene or some intermediate that rearranges.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the reaction isn't elimination but a substitution. Wait, but with two bromines, perhaps it's a SN2 reaction on each bromide, but in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so substitution might not be feasible for each Br. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination for each Br, leading to the formation of a conjugated diene. But I'm not seeing how that would form a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diketone. But how? Oh, wait! Maybe the elimination isn't straightforward. When you have a dihalide on a cyclohexane ring (but in adamantane's case, it's a diamondoid structure), eliminating both X groups could form a carbonyl group via some kind of pinacol-like elimination? Wait, pinacol is a vicinal diol that eliminates water to form a carbonyl, but here we have a dihalide.

Wait, perhaps it's a double dehydrohalogenation leading to a conjugated diene, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me think again. The IR shows a strong peak around 1720 cm⁻¹, which is typical for a carbonyl group. So product 1 likely has a carbonyl. So maybe the reaction is a substitution where Br is replaced by something else, but that's not obvious.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the dihalide reacts with KOH to form a gem-diol, which then undergoes elimination to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the hydroxide attacks one Br, but that would form a mono-substituted alcohol, but then where would the other
