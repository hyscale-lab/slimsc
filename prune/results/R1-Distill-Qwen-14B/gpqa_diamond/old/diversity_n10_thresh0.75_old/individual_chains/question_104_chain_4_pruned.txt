Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the scenario is that astronomers are looking for exoplanets around two stars that have the same mass as each other, and similar to our Sun. They found a planet around each using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The planets are in circular orbits.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. The key information given is the wavelength shift of a spectral line. Planet #1's host star has a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's host has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. We need to find how many times longer Planet #2's orbital period is compared to Planet #1's.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength is related to the star's velocity towards or away from us. So, a larger shift would mean a higher velocity, right?

I think the formula involved here relates the velocity of the star (v) to the orbital period (P). Oh wait, I also remember that the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is K. So K is the maximum velocity the star moves due to the planet.

The formula for K is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * (1/( (P) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) )) ) )^(1/3) ), but since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are Sun-like, M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, the mass of the star. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, alternatively, I remember that for circular orbits (e=0), the semi-amplitude K can be expressed as:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * something... Maybe I should look up the exact formula.

Wait, no, perhaps the simpler approach is to use the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P. The formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G)^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the formula simplifies a bit.

But since both stars have the same mass (M_*) and the planets have the same mass (M_p), because both are Neptune-like and same as our Sun, perhaps we can eliminate some variables.

Wait, the problem states that both stars have exactly the same masses, and the planets have masses similar to Neptune, so I can assume M_p1 = M_p2. So M_p is same for both.

So the equation for K1 and K2 would be:

K1 = (constant) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P1^(1/3))
K2 = (constant) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P2^(1/3))

Since M_p and M_* are the same for both, the constants will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So K1 / K2 = (1/P1^(1/3)) / (1/P2^(1/3)) ) 

Which is the same as (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K1 is smaller than K2, then P1 would be longer than P2? Or wait, no, because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K = something / P^(1/3).

So, K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Where C is the same for both because M_p and M_* are same. So when we take K1 / K2 = P2^(1/3) / P1^(1/3).

Wait, so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

But the given data is that K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7 milliangstrom. So K2 is larger than K1.

So K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

But according to the formula, K2/K1 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, wait. Let's write it correctly.

If K1 = C / P1^(1/3)

K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Then K2/K1 = [C / P2^(1/3)] / [C / P1^(1/3)] ) = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Because (1/x)/(1/y) = y/x.

So K2/K1 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We have K2 =7, K1=5, so K2/K1=7/5=1.4.

So 1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

We want to find how many times longer P2 is than P1, i.e., P2/P1.

Let me compute (P1/P2) from 1.4 = (P1/P2)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(1.4)^3 = P1/P2

1.4^3 is approximately, let's calculate: 1.4 *1.4=1.96, 1.96*1.4=2.744.

So 1.4^3 ≈ 2.744. So P1/P2=2.744, which means P2/P1=1/2.744 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times the period of P1, meaning P2 is shorter. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, but the question is "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times longer, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Because in the formula, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So if K is higher, P is smaller.

So planet #2 has a higher K (7 vs 5), which implies a shorter orbital period. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's, so "how many times longer is P2 than P1?" would be 0.36 times, so it's shorter. So the answer is 0.36
