Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. The question has three parts, A, B, and C, and I need to figure out the products for each. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: The reactants are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with H+ and heat. Hmm, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a molecule with two methoxy groups and an amine all on the same carbon. So the structure might be like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But wait, no, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Or maybe (CH2OCH3)2NH2? Wait, perhaps it's more like (CH3O)2CH-NH2? I'm a bit confused about the structure, but moving on.

But-3-en-2-ol is another reactant. That's a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group on C2. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait no, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2(OH)CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be HOCH2CH2CH=CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but but has four carbons. Let me think. The double bond is between C3 and C4? No, because but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it. Carbon chain: 1, 2, 3, 4. The double bond is between 3 and 4? But that can't be because for butene, the possible double bonds are between 1-2 or 2-3. Oh wait, maybe it's but-3-en-2-ol as CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but the numbering... Hmm, maybe I should write it as CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3 with a double bond between C2 and C3? No, but the question says but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at C3? That would imply a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's beyond the chain length for but. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, that would be pent-3-en-2-ol. Oh, wait, but but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but then that's five carbons, which isn't possible. Oh wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2OH? No, that's 2-propenol, which is allyl alcohol. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The correct structure for but-3-en-2-ol would have four carbons, with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. But that's impossible because but only has four carbons, and the double bond between 3 and 4 would be the last two. So, structure would be CH2CH(O
