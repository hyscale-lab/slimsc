Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. It's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). So the structure is a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromo group, and position 5 has a nitro group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the numberingâ€”oh, wait, the phenyl is attached to the ketone. So the ketone is on the benzene ring. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone.

Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH2CO-) or wait, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)COCH2-? No, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? No, wait. Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one), which is (CH3)2CO. Oh wait, ethan-1-one would be CH3CO, but that's actually a ketone. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think: ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-, but that's not possible because that would be a terminal carbonyl group, which is a ketone only if it's in the middle. Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So that would be:

Phenyl group attached to a ketone. The position is such that the phenyl is connected to the carbonyl carbon, and the other carbon (CH2-) is attached. Wait, no: wait, ethan-1-one is (CH2)CO, so the structure would be: O=C-CH2-Ph, where Ph is the aryl group. So the aryl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon, and the other side is a CH2 group. So the benzene ring is attached to a ketone (C=O), and the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point of attachment.

So the benzene ring has a ketone group at position 1, and substituents at 3 and 5. So substituents are at 3: Br, 5: nitro.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (position 1), Br (position 3), and nitro (position 5). Wait, but that's not possible for benzene because when you have substituents in the 1,3,5 positions, they are meta to each other. Wait, no: the ketone is at position 1, so the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, which is meta to each other. So the ring has substituents at 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). So the three groups are in a sort of symmetric arrangement, but that's a bit complicated.

So the problem is to find a sequence of reactions starting with benzene to get this structure.

I need to plan the synthesis. I know that Friedel-Crafts acylation is a way to add an acyl group to benzene. But Friedel-Crafts doesn't work if there are strong deactivating groups present because the ring becomes deactivated, making the Friedel-Crafts difficult. So perhaps I should plan the order of adding substituents.

Wait, the ketone is an acyl group attached to the ring. But Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. So if I have electron-withdrawing groups on the benzene ring, Friedel-Crafts may not work. So perhaps I should add substituents in a certain order.

Wait, the target has two strong electron-withdrawing groups: nitro (EWG) and bromine (which is slightly deactivating but ortho/para-directing). The ketone is also an EWG but is an acyl group, which is a meta director when attached.

Wait, let's think about substituent effects. Nitro is a strong meta director. Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating. The ketone (acyl group) is meta-directing and deactivating.

So when adding substituents, I need to plan their order to direct the incoming groups correctly.

Hmm. Let me think about possible steps.

First, perhaps I should add nitro group and Br in the correct positions, then do a Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts won't proceed if the ring is deactivated. Alternatively, maybe I need to activate the ring, but that's tricky once EWGs are present.

Alternatively, maybe add the acyl group first, then add the nitro and bromine.

Wait, but the ketone is an EWG, which would deactivate the ring, making further substitution difficult. So maybe that's not the way.

Hmm. Let me think of the substituents. The substituents are nitro (position 5), Br (position 3), and the ketone (position 1). Wait, no. Wait, the ketone is at position 1 of the phenyl group attached to the ethanone.

Wait, maybe it's better to approach this by considering the positions.

The target structure:

Phenyl group: positions are 1 (attached to the ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2).

So the substituents are in 1,3,5 positions, which are all meta to each other. So the benzene ring must have three substituents: acetyl (from ketone), Br, and nitro.

Wait, but how can I arrange that? Because adding substituents can be influenced by their directing effects.

I think the key is to add the substituents in an order that allows each new group to be added in the correct position.

Let me think: Perhaps the nitro group and bromine are added after the ketone. But Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, which nitro and Br are not. So perhaps the order is:

1. Add the acyl group (Friedel-Crafts acylation) first.

But wait, benzene is activated towards electrophilic substitution. So first, do Friedel-Craft
