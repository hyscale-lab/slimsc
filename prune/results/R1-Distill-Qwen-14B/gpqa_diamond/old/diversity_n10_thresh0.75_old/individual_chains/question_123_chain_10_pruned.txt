Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, the supernova's ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait a minute, I remember something about time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Oh right, because the frames are moving relative to each other, time might not be the same in both frames.

The problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so I don't have to consider those factors. So it's purely a special relativity problem.

Alright, let's think about this. The ejecta is moving towards the center from the galaxy's perspective, and from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them. Wait, but in the problem statement, the ejecta is moving toward the galaxy's center, so in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at some speed, let's say velocity v. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. 

Wait, so the velocity in the galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's velocity in the opposite direction. Because in relativity, velocities are frame-dependent. So if in the ejecta
