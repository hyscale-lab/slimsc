Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

So, the given state is (3i, 4). I remember that spin states are usually two-component vectors, like a column vector with two elements. So here, the state is a vector [3i, 4]^T, right? Because the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨S⟩ = <ψ| S |ψ>, where ψ is the state vector. But wait, I also remember that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Oh yeah, the S_y operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli sigma_y matrix.

The sigma_y matrix is given as:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So, S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

To find the expectation value, I need to compute the bra-ket product: ψ† S_y ψ.

Let me write this out step by step.

First, the state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T. So the bra vector ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which would be [ -3 (since 3i's conjugate is -3), 4 ].

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original state is (3i, 4). So the first component is 3i, the second is 4. The conjugate transpose would be a row vector where each component is the complex conjugate. So [3i]* becomes -3, and 4 remains 4. So ψ† is [-3, 4].

So now, the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by S_y multiplied by ψ.

But let me write S_y explicitly. S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

So let's compute the matrix product ψ† S_y ψ.

Wait, no, actually, the expectation value is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

But wait, ψ is a column vector, so S_y is a 2x2 matrix, and ψ is 2x1. So S_y
