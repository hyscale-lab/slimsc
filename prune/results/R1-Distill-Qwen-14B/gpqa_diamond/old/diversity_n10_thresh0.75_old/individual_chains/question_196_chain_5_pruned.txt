Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I need to figure out the maximum speed. Let me start by recalling what I know about both the classical and relativistic harmonic oscillators.

In the classical case, a harmonic oscillator has potential energy U = (1/2)kx². The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a mass m, the maximum speed v_max is sqrt(kA²/m), where A is the amplitude. But wait, this is the non-relativistic case. The question here is relativistic, so things are different.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, c. The kinetic energy in relativity isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Instead, it's (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in relativity includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

The problem states it's a 1-dimensional oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic.

Wait, the total mechanical energy in the relativistic case would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the maximum potential energy at amplitude, which is (1/2)kA². So that's the total energy the system has, right?

Wait, no. Wait, in non-relativistic, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is the potential energy at maximum displacement. But in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, but wait, maybe the setup is that the oscillator is relativistic, so the potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic term is relativistic.

So the total energy E is the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic energy. So E = mc² + K, where K is the kinetic energy.

But wait, in the case of the oscillator, when the potential is maximum (x = A), the kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, no. Because the total mechanical energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA² in the non-relativ
