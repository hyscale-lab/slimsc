Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off, and a new one is turned on along the +Y direction, same strength B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Magnetic moment mu is gamma times spin component, right? So mu = γ S, but here it's given as mu = γ Sz. Oh, so the magnetic moment is along the z-axis initially.

When the magnetic field is along +Z, the particle's spin will align with it because that's the lowest energy state. The energy is given by the Zeeman term, E = -μ·B. So when the field is along Z, the energy depends on Sz. But then the field is turned off and another along Y is turned on. So the magnetic field changes direction from Z to Y.

Wait, but how does the spin state change when the field changes? Oh, because the field is suddenly turned off and on in a different direction, the spin state of the particle may no longer be an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

Let me try to model this as a quantum mechanics problem. The spin-1/2 system has a Hamiltonian determined by the magnetic field. Initially, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = - μ · B_initial. Since B is along Z, H_initial would be proportional to Sz. So the eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>, with energies proportional to +1/2 and -1/2 times ħω, but wait, let's think in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the Hamiltonian would be H = - μ · B = - γ B S · n, where n is the direction of the field. Initially, n is along Z, so H_initial = -γ B S_z. Then, the field is turned off (so B becomes zero), and then the field is applied along Y, so H_final =
