Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about operators and uncertainties. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that this state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis. That would make sense because the basis is given as the eigenvectors of P_z.

Wait, so the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z. So, in that case, the expectation value of P_z should be straightforward. Because in an eigenbasis, the expectation value is just the eigenvalue multiplied by the probability of that state. Hmm, but wait, no. Because the given state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. Oh wait, no, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in terms of P_z's eigenstates.

Wait, maybe I should write down the state vector. The state is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T. Since the basis is the P_z eigenbasis, each component of this vector corresponds to the amplitude of each P_z eigenstate.

So, the eigenstates of P_z are |+ħ>, |0>, and |-ħ>, right? Because looking at the matrix for P_z:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ]]

So, the diagonal entries are the eigenvalues. So the possible eigenvalues are +ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |1> = [1, 0, 0], |2> = [0,1,0], |3> = [0,0,1], which correspond to eigenvalues +ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively.

So the state |ψ> is expressed in this basis. So the components of |ψ> are:

c1 = -1/2,
c2 = 1/sqrt(2),
c3 = -1/2.

Wait, the state is [-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2]^T. So to find the expectation value of P_z, ⟨P_z⟩ = sum (c_i * λ_i * c_i^* ), where λ_i are the eigenvalues.

Wait, but maybe a better approach is to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩. Let's compute that.

P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

So when I compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, that
