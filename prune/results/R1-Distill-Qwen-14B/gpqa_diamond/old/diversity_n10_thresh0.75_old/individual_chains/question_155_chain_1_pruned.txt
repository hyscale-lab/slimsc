Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz, given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px with a specific eigenvalue. 

Alright, let's start by recalling what I know. The uncertainty of an observable, like Pz, is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value. So the formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²). 

The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So I think the state is already written in the Pz basis, which might make things easier.

Wait, let me make sure. The basis vectors are eigenvectors of Pz, so the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of Pz. That should mean that the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of Pz.

So, the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. That's a three-component vector, so the system must be in a three-level system, perhaps like spin-1 or something similar. 

I need to compute the expectation values ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩. Since the state is given in the Pz basis, I think that the expectation value of Pz is straightforward. Because in the eigenbasis of Pz, each component corresponds to an eigenvalue. So each component of the vector gives the amplitude for that eigenstate.

Wait, the matrix for Pz is given. Let me look at it again. The Pz matrix has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second (0, 0, 0), third (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues of Pz must be ħ, 0, -ħ. So the possible outcomes when measuring Pz are ħ, 0, and -ħ.

But wait, the given state is in the Pz basis, which means each basis vector corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz. So the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates.

The state vector is |ψ> = a|ħ> + b|0> + c|−ħ>, where |ħ>, |0>, |−ħ> are the eigenstates of Pz with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively. 

So looking at the components: a is -1/2, b is 1/√2, c is -1/2. 

Now, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value. Since each eigenstate |λ> contributes λ times the probability |c|^2. 

So, ⟨Pz⟩ = |a|² * ħ + |b|² * 0 + |c|² * (-ħ). 

Let me compute each term. |a|² is
