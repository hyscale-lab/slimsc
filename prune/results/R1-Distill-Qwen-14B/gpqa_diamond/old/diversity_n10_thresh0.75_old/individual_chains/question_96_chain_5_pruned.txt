Okay, so I've got this black hole question here. Hmm, the question is about finding the entropy of a supermassive black hole given its angular size. Let's think through this step by step.

First, the question says the event horizon's angular size θ is 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I remember that the angular size relates to the actual size of the object. Oh right, the formula for angular size is something like θ ≈ size / distance, but I should get the exact formula.

Wait, wait. Angular size in radians is approximately the ratio of the actual size (in meters) to the distance (in meters). Oh right, θ ≈ s / D, where s is the size of the object and D is the distance to it. But since θ is given in degrees, I'll have to convert that to radians first.

So let me convert θ from degrees to radians. 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees * π/180. Let me calculate that: 1e-17 * π ≈ 3.14e-17, divided by 180 is around 1.745e-19 radians.

Then, using the small angle approximation, θ ≈ s / D, so s = θ * D. But wait, D is in parsecs, and I need it in meters. I remember that 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So D = 1e10 parsecs = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

Now, let's compute s: s = θ_rad * D. So θ_rad is 1.745e-19, D is 3.086e26 m. Multiplying those: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 = let's see... 1.745 * 3.086 is approx 5.37, and 1e-19 *
