Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. So, there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming the same albedo.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—right. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^1/4 * ( (1 - A) / (d^2) )^1/4, but maybe I'm mixing some constants. No, wait, another approach. Oh right, the equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) ), but I might be getting confused. Let me think again.

Oh, wait! The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * ( (L_star/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) * (1/a)^0.5 )^(1/4). Hmm, maybe that's not the right way. Let me think about it in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.

The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula is T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)} ), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I'm probably complicating things. Another approach: the equilibrium temperature scales with ( (L * (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) )^(1/4). Since the albedo A is the same for all planets, that term can be ignored in the ratio. So the ratio of temperatures will depend on the ratio of (1/a)^(1/2), because L and A are the same for each planet.

Wait, no. Because all the planets orbit the same star, L is the same for each. So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis. So T ∝ 1/√a.

But wait, the orbital periods are given in a ratio. So, the period of Planet 1 is P1, Planet 2 is 2 P1, and so on. Since the planets are in circular orbits, Kepler's third law applies. Kepler's law says P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a³ ∝ P², so a ∝ P^(2/3).

So, if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (a4/a2), then I can find the ratio of their temperatures.

So, let's compute the periods first. Let’s denote P1 as the period of Planet 1. Then:

P1 : P2 : P3 : P4 : P
