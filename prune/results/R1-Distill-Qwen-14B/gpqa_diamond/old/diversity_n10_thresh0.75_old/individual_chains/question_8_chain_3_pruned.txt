Okay, so I have this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine plants related to resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. The question gives me data from experiments with knockout mutants and their double mutants. I need to figure out the relationship between these genes, G1, G2, and G3, based on the resistance levels observed.

First, let me restate what I know. The experiment involves creating knock-out mutants for each gene and testing their resistance. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The mutants and their double mutants have varying resistance percentages. 

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less resistant than wild-type.
- g2: 0% resistance. So, completely susceptible.
- g3: 50% resistance. Half as resistant.
- g1g3: 10% resistance. Very low.
- g2g3: 0% resistance.
- g1g2: 0% resistance.

The question also mentions that at least one gene is a transcription factor upstream of others. So, I think transcription factors are involved in regulating other genes. 

I remember that when a double mutant has a phenotype more severe than either single mutant, it suggests epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, the order in which genes act can be determined by looking at the double mutant phenotypes.

In epistatic relationships, if the double mutant (g1g2) is as severe as g2, that suggests that G2 is downstream of G1. Because if you knock out both, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. So, g1g2 has 0% resistance, same as g2. So, maybe G2 is downstream of G1.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then knocking out G2 would disable its function, so the downstream genes won't be expressed. So, G2's product is required for the function of the other genes. But wait, G1's mutant is 75% resistance, so it's still somewhat resistant. Which suggests that G1 isn't required for full resistance but contributes to it. But when G2 is knocked out (g2), resistance is 0%, which is much worse than G1.

Looking at the double mutants, the g1g2 double mutant is 0% resistance. So, when both are knocked out, it's as bad as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G2 is downstream. Because if G2 is downstream, then not having it would negate any effect of G1.

Wait, but the g1 mutant is at 75%, which is better than g2 but worse than wild-type. So, perhaps G1 is part of a pathway that contributes to resistance, but G2 is more critical. Or maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and other genes.

Alternatively, if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking
