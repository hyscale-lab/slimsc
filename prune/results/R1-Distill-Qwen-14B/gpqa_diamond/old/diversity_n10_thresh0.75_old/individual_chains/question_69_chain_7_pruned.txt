Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime from our lab frame perspective would be longer due to time dilation. Oh right, that's the gamma factor effect.

So gamma (γ) is the Lorentz factor, given by γ = E / m. Because E is the total energy of the particle, which is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV. So dividing those gives gamma.

Calculating that: 27 / 3.41 equals approximately... let's see, 27 divided by 3 is 9, but 3.41 is a bit more. Let me compute it more accurately. 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, so 3.41 times 7.9 is roughly 27 (since 3.41*8=27.28). So gamma would be approximately 7.92 or so. Let me do it more precisely: 27 / 3.41.

Wait, 3.41 * 7 = 23.87. 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.918. So 7.918, approximately 7.92. So gamma is around 7.92.

So the observed lifetime τ would be gamma multiplied by tau_0. So τ = γ * τ₀ = 7.92 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 8 *8 is 64, but wait, 7.92 *8 is 63.36. So 63.36e-16 seconds. So 6.336e-15 seconds? Wait, no, 7.92 *8e-16 is (7.92 *8) × 1e-16. 7.92 *8 is 63.36, so τ =63.36e-16 s, which is 6.336e-15 s.

Wait, no, wait. 8e-16 times 7.92 is 63.36e-16, which is the same as 6.336e-15 seconds. Got it.

Now, why do we need the lifetime? Because the particles have to travel a certain
