Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. I know that C3H6 can be either propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But considering the reaction steps, I think it's more likely propene. Because when you brominate an alkene, it adds bromine across the double bond.

So, Compound A is C3H6. It undergoes bromination in CCl4. Bromination of alkenes typically adds Br2 across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane. So Compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane (C3H5Br2).

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and usually leads to elimination reactions. So, when 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with KOH, it would eliminate HBr twice. So first, one HBr is eliminated to form a double bond, but since there are two Br atoms, another elimination might happen. Wait, no, 1,2-dibromopropane would likely eliminate two equivalents of HBr to form propene again. Wait, but that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe it's a single elimination to form a diene? Or perhaps a ring?

Wait, wait, 1,2-dibromopropane has Br on adjacent carbons. When treated with alcoholic KOH, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation. So the first elimination would remove one HBr, giving a double bond. But since there's another Br on the adjacent carbon, maybe another elimination occurs. Wait, but that would require another base. Alternatively, perhaps the first elimination gives 1-bromo-1-propene, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I got the structure wrong. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, so adding Br2 would add across the double bond. The addition of Br2 to propene would give 1,2-dibromopropane, which is CH2BrCH2BrCH3?
