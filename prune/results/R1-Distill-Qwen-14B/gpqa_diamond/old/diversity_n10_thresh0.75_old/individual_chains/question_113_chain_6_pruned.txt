Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, which I remember is usually indicative of O-H groups, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. I think the 1700 peak could be a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or something like that. The 1650 might be an aromatic ring with conjugation or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group.

The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means they're attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has an alkene somewhere.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Well, I know that CH3CO (acetyl) is 45 because carbon is 12, hydrogen is 1, oxygen is 16. So 12*2 + 1*3 +16= 24+3+16=43? Wait, that doesn't add up right. Wait, another possibility: maybe a CH2O fragment? Or perhaps the CH3COO⁻ ion? Or maybe it's something else. Alternatively, 45 could be the methyl group attached to something. Wait, wait, let's think. 45 is a common fragment. Oh! The methyl group from an acetate ester. The acetate ion is CH3COO⁻, which has a molecular weight of 60. Maybe the fragment is something else. Or maybe it's a CH3CO (43) but the mass is 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a CO₂H group? No, that's more like 44 (COOH, which is 12+16+1+16=45? Wait, 12 (C) + 16 (O) + 1 (H) +16 (another O) = 45. So COOH would be 45. Because COOH is -COOH, so the molecular weight is 12+16*2 +1 = 45. So maybe the fragment comes from a carboxylic acid group.

Putting this together, the compound has O-H and carbonyl groups. The presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ suggests an O-H, maybe in an alcohol or carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1700 is likely a carbonyl. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugation, but another possibility is a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated ketone or ester.

Looking at the NMR, vinyl protons are present, so there's an alkene. So maybe this is an aromatic compound with an ester group or a ketone. Wait, but if it's an aromatic ring, then the IR might show a peak around 1500-1600 cm⁻¹, but in this case, there's a peak at 1650. Maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl group.

Looking at the possible formulas: the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

So the molecular formulas need to match. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each.

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, so:

For C6H12O2:
DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14-12)/2=2/2=1. So one DoU, which could be a ring and a double bond, or two rings, etc.

Wait, no, wait: let me recalculate. The formula is CnHmOx. The general formula is DoU = (2n +2 - m - x)/2.

Wait, for C6H12O2:

n=6, m=12, x=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -2)/2 = (12+2 -12 -2)/2= (0)/2=0. Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Wait, O doesn't contribute to DoU, right? So the formula is (2C
