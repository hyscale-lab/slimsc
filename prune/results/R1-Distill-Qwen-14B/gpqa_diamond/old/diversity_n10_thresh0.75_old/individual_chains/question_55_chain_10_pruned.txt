Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is an organic one, and the options are various propenyl or butenyl acetates. The NMR data given is:

1H NMR (ppm): 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. So I need to figure out which structure corresponds to this spectrum.

First, let me recall what each of these options looks like. All of them are acetates, so they have an acetyl group (OAc) attached to an alkene. The difference is whether the substituents on the double bond are cis or trans.

Wait, but propenyl and butenyl would have different structures. Propenyl would be CH2=CH- group, and butenyl would have four carbons with a double bond. Let me think: propenyl acetate is CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc maybe. Or wait, no, the structure probably is where the oxygen is attached to the propenyl group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure. Let's break it down.

The options are either propenyl or butenyl, and either cis or trans. So for example, Cis-propenyl acetate would have the substituents on either side of the double bond in a cis arrangement. Similarly for the others.

So in propenyl acetate, the structure is probably CH2=CH-OAc, but wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH3? No, no, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but the actual structure of propenyl acetate would be CH3CO-O-CH2CH2CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-OAc connected to another CH2?

Wait, maybe I should draw the structures. Let's think:

Prop
