Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures and the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, so the star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—no spots to spots.

Oh wait, the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å. And LTE is assumed, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds. Right, in LTE, the behavior of the atoms can be described using the Boltzmann equation.

The ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait. The problem says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. But does that mean that the temperature of the photosphere is lower, or is the presence of spots affecting the observed flux? Hmm, I think the Teff is the effective temperature, which is the temperature of a black body that would emit the same total radiation as the star. So when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, which are cooler, the overall Teff is lower.

But the photosphere's temperature—well, when spots are present, they're cooler regions. But the surrounding areas are hotter? Or wait, no. Wait, no, the overall Teff is 5500 K when 40% is covered. So the effective temperature is an average, but when the spots are present, the star emits less total radiation, hence lower Teff.

Wait, but does the photosphere's actual temperature decrease? Or is it that the spots are cooler regions, so the average emission is lower.

Hmm, but the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels in the photosphere. So the photosphere's temperature—if the star's overall Teff is lower, does that mean the photosphere is cooler? Or is it that the spots are cooler, but the unspotted regions are hotter?

Wait, the star's photosphere is emitting with a lower Teff when 40% is covered. So I think the star's overall photospheric temperature is lower, but perhaps the spots are just cooler regions. Hmm, but the problem states that when the star's surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. So when spots are present, the Teff is 5500 K. So the average temperature of the whole star is lower. But when the star has spots, the unspotted regions could be at 6000 K and the spotted regions at a lower temperature. But the overall emission would be a mix.

Wait, but the problem says that the photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K when 40% is covered. So perhaps the photosphere's effective temperature is lower because the spots are at a lower temperature. But the question says when examining the ratio in the photosphere, the ratio decreases. So I need to model this ratio based on the temperature of the photosphere.

Wait, but the photosphere is a layer of the star where most of the light is emitted. If the star's overall Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, does that mean that the photosphere is now at 5500 K, or that part of it is at a lower temperature? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the star without spots has a Teff of 6000 K, and with spots, the average Teff is 5500 K because 40% of the surface is emitting at a lower temperature.
