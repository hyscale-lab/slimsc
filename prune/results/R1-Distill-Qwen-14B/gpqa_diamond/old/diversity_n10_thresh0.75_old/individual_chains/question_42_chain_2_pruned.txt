Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They have circular orbits and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not too sure how that method works, but maybe it's not super relevant here.

The problem gives me some temperature ratios and mass ratios between the planets. Specifically, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's. Then between Planet2 and Planet3, the ratio is about 2.3. So Planet2 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet3.

Wait, wait. Or is it the other way around? Because equilibrium temperature would depend on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = (L*(1 - a))/(16πσd²) )^(1/4), where a is albedo. Since the albedo is the same for all three planets (given as 0.3), that part cancels out. So the temperature ratio depends on the square root of the inverse of the distance ratio. Because T is proportional to (L/(d²))^(1/4). So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then (d2/d1)^(1/2) = 1.4. Squaring both sides, d2/d1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1. Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3, so (d3/d2)^(1/2) = 2.3 → d3/d2 = 5.29. So Planet3 is about 5.29 times farther than Planet2, which in turn is 1.96 times farther than Planet1. So d3 is 1.96 *5.29 times d1. Let me compute that: 1.96 *5.29. Hmm, 2 times 5 is 10, but 1.96 is just under 2. Let's see: 1.96 *5 =9.8, 1.96 *0.29 is about 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So d3 is approximately 10.37 times d1.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that right. So T1 is the temperature of Planet1, and T2 is that of Planet2. Since T1 > T2, Planet1 must be closer because the temperature is higher when closer. So the ratio T1/T2 = 1.4. So (d2/d1) = (T1 / T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 d1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So (T2)/(T3) =2.3 → (d3/d2 )^0.5 = 2.3 → d3/d2 =5.29. So d3=5.29 d2. Since d2 is 1.96 d1, then d3=5.29 *1.96 d1. Let me compute 5.29 *1.96. 5 *1.96 =9.8. 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So 9.8+0.5684=10.3684. So d3 is about 10.37 times d1.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods. So I need to relate the
