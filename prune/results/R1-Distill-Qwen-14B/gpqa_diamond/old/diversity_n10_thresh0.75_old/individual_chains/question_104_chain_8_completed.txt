Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I've heard about this method before. It's when you look for the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. Right.

So the setup is that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key here is the radial velocity measurements. 

They detected Planet #1 with a periodic shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods. How does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period?

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) depends on several factors. The formula is K = (v) where v is the velocity, right? But how is that connected to the orbital period?

Wait, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day in seconds)) )

But wait, since both planets have similar masses to Neptune and their stars are similar to the Sun, M_p << M_*, so we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think about the relation between the semi-amplitude K and the orbital period P.

I think the main relation is that K is inversely proportional to the square root of the mass of the star and the orbital period. Wait, correct formula?

Alternatively, I know that the RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / (M_* )^(2/3) )

Wait, but M_* is the same for both stars, as per the question. And since both planets have similar masses, M_p is the same. Also, assuming the inclination angle i is about the same for both (like edge-on, but the question doesn't specify, so maybe it's a factor if it's not the same, but perhaps we can assume sin i is same or it's simplified).

So, if M_p and M_* are the same, then K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). Because the other factors would be the same for both planets.

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_*)^(2/3) * (1/(P)^(1/3)) )

Since M_p and M_* are same, K is proportional to 1/(P)^(1/3).

Wait, that would mean that P is proportional to (1/K)^(3/1) ), so P is inversely proportional to K^3.

Wait, because K ∝ 1/(P)^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/(K)^(3).

So if K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7, then P2 is (K1/K2)^3 times P1.

Wait, let me think again. Let me write it out.

If K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Therefore, (K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

Wait, no. Let's see:

K1 = (constant) / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = (constant) / (P2)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = [ (1/P1^(1/3)) ] / [ (1/P2^(1/3)) ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raising both sides to the power of 3:

(K1/K2)^3 = (P2/P1)

Which rearranges to P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, no. Let's do it step by step.

Let me assign:

K1 = C / P1^(1/3)
K2 = C / P2^(1/3)

Divide K1 by K2:

K1/K2 = [ C / P1^(1/3) ] / [ C / P2^(1/3) ] = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So, (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1

Which means, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1

Wait, no. Let's see, if (K1/K2)^3 = P2/P1, then P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

Wait, but actually, let's take the reciprocal.

Let me compute the ratio of the periods.

We have:

K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3). So,

P ∝ 1/K^3.

So, P1 ∝ 1/K1^3
P2 ∝ 1/K2^3

The ratio P2/P1 is (1/K2^3) / (1/K1^3) ) = (K1/K2)^3

So P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 → P2 = P1 * (K1/K2)^3

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers. K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So K1/K2 is 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

Cubing that: (5/7)^3 = 125 / 343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is planet 2's orbital period than planet 1's. Oh, wait. The question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So, P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1 → P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3 → that's the ratio.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 times P1 → which is about 0.364 times P1. So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.364. So P2 is ~0.36 times as long as P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is about 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, not longer. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.36, which means P2 is ~36% the length of P1.

Wait, but the options are about how many times longer P2 is. So if P2 is shorter, the answer would be less than 1.

Wait, the options given are:

A) ~0.36

B) ~1.40

C) ~1.96

D) ~0.85

So the ratio is 0.364, which is approximately 0.36. So the period of planet 2 is about 0.36 times that of planet 1, meaning it's shorter. So planet 2's period is shorter, so it's orbiting faster. So the question is, how many times longer is P2? The answer is less than one, so 0.36.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36. So the answer should be A.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Am I getting the ratio right? Because I thought the ratio is P2 = (K1/K2)^3 * P1.

So, K1 is 5, K2 is 7.

So K1/K2 is 5/7. So (5/7)^3 is 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = 0.364 * P1. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So the period of planet 2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet 1. So the period of planet 2 is shorter; planet 2 is orbiting closer to its star, perhaps?

So the question asks, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So it's P2 / P1. Which is 0.364. So the answer is 0.36 times as long, so option A.


To determine how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period, i.e., 

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}.
\]

This implies that the orbital period is proportional to the inverse cube of the radial velocity semi-amplitude:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}.
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2, the ratio of their orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.

From the given options:

- **A) ~0.36**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **B) ~1.40**: Incorrect, as this would imply a longer period for planet #2, which contradicts the calculation.
- **C) ~1.96**: Incorrect, as this is far too large.
- **D) ~0.85**: Incorrect, as this is closer to 1, which does not match the calculated ratio.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
