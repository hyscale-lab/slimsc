Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might make some mistakes, but I'll try to work it out.

The question gives a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is provided, and after reacting with certain reagents, I need to determine the final product.

First, let me look at the NMR data. The peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), and 3.66 (d, 2H). I need to figure out what structure this corresponds to.

Breaking down the NMR:
- 9.72 ppm is a triplet (t) with 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's coupled with two other protons, maybe adjacent to a CH2 group.
- 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets, each integrating to 2H. These might be aromatic protons. The lower field (6.98) could be para-substituted aromatic rings, maybe with electron-withdrawing groups. The 6.51 is a bit downfield but still in aromatic region.
- 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H. Maybe these are vinyl or allylic protons, or perhaps they're adjacent to an oxygen, like in a diene or a conjugated system.
- 3.66 is a doublet with 2H. This could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar.

Let me try to sketch a possible structure. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. The degree of unsaturation can help. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees: probably a ring and some double bonds. Let's see.

Since there's an aldehyde (from the 9.72 peak), that's one double bond. The aromatic regions suggest two benzene rings? But wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Two benzene rings would be C12, which is too high. Hmm, maybe it's not two benzene rings.

Wait, perhaps it's a substituted benzene with a side chain. But looking at the NMR, the 6.98 and 6.51 could be two different substituents on a benzene ring. For example, maybe a para-substituted ring with two substituents that are causing the doublets.

Wait, but the 6.27 is a broad singlet for 2H, perhaps indicating a conjugated diene or a vinyl group. Let me think. Maybe there's an aromatic ring attached to a conjugated system with an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substitu
