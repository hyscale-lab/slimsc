Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about selecting the correct reagents for two different reactions. Let me read it carefully.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different A and B reagents.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my reactions. Let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So when a ketone reacts with CN-, what happens? Oh, I remember, it's a nucleophilic addition. The ketone's carbonyl carbon attacks the cyanide ion. But wait, wait, but after that, what's the workup?

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be something like NC-CH2-C(OH)(CH3)2? Let me see. Wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Hmm, maybe. But how does that happen?

Wait, no, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, I think it undergoes addition to form a cyanohydrin. Oh right, the cyanide attacks the carbonyl carbon, and then the oxygen gets a proton, giving a cyanohydrin. The process usually involves acid catalysis.

Wait, but in the first reaction, the reagent is NaCN and another reagent A. Oh wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- and maybe a base? Or perhaps the conditions are acidic. Because when you make cyanohydrins, you typically use an acid catalyst. So for the first step, perhaps reagent A is an acid like H3O+ which protonates the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic so that the CN- can attack.

So for the first
