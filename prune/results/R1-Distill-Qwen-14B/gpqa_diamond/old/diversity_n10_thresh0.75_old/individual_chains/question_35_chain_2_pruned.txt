Okay, so I need to figure out the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me start by understanding what's given.

Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So, Ay = c * S. Let me write out what Ay looks like. Multiplying each element by c:

Ay = [ [0, -i*c],
        [i*c, 0] ]

Since c is h/(4π), substituting that in:

Ay = [ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
        [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, but for the eigenvalue equation, Ay * φ = a * φ. I need to find a and φ.

Since S is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(S - λ I) = 0.

Wait, but S is a matrix similar to the Pauli matrices. Oh, wait, S looks a lot like the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by something. The standard Pauli Y matrix is:

σy = [ [0, -i],
        [i, 0] ]

Which is exactly our S. So S is the Pauli Y matrix. And the eigenvalues of σy are known to be ±i, right? Because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 when scaled by their own factors, but here S is σy, so its eigenvalues are ±i.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The Pauli matrices σx, σy, σz each have eigenvalues ±1. So S here is σy, so its eigenvalues are ±i. 

But since Ay = c * S, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S. So the eigenvalues a are c * (±i).

Given that c is h/(4π), so:

a = ± i * (h/(4π))

Wait, but looking at the options, none seem to have an imaginary eigenvalue. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute the eigenvalues of Ay directly.

The matrix Ay is:

[0, -i c]
[i c, 0]

So to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the determinant is:

| -a     -i c        |
| i c    -a         |  = 0.

The determinant is ( (-a)(-a) ) - ( (-i c)(i c) ) = a² - ( ( -i c * i c ) )

Wait, let's compute that term: (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c².

Wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. Because i^2 is -1.

So (-i c)(i c) = (i^2) c² * (-1) * (-1) ??? Wait, let me compute it step by step:

-i * i = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So (-i c)(i c) = (i*(-i)) c^2 = (1) c^2.

So the determinant becomes:

a² - (c² * 1) = 0 → a² = c² → a = ± c.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh wait, I think I confused S and Ay because I thought S was σy, but here, the calculation shows that the eigenvalues are ±c.

Wait, but wait, S is σy, which has eigenvalues ±1. So if Ay is c * S, then Ay's eigenvalues are c * (±1) = ±c. So which is correct? Let me clarify.

Let me compute the determinant correctly. The matrix is:

[ -a      -i c ]
[ i c     -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Calculate (-i c)(i c):

Multiply them: (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (1) * c².

So determinant equation is a² - (c²) =0 → a^2 = c^2 → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are ±c. Since c is h/(4π), so eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) and -(h/(4π)).

Wait, but looking at the options, which of them have the eigenvalues as ±h/(4π)?

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, which seems way larger. Option B has eigenvalues with imaginary parts ±½
