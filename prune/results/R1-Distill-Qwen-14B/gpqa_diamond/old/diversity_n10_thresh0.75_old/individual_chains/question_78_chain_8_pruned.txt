Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about finding the scalar and vector potentials at a point given a moving charge. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges are moving, they produce both electric and magnetic fields, and potentials are used to describe these fields.

The setup is that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Also, v is the velocity of the charge at time tr. And we're looking for potentials V and A at time t, where t is after tr.

Wait, so scalar potential is V, and vector potential is A. I know the scalar potential is related to the electric field, and the vector potential is related to the magnetic field. The potentials are used in the Lorentz force equation.

The options given are A to D. Let's think about the general expressions for potentials. For a stationary charge, the scalar potential V is q/(4πε₀ r), right? But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of special relativity and the fields' dependence on the charge's velocity.

Wait, but when the charge is moving, the potentials can't just be the same as the static case. I remember that when the charge is moving, we have to consider the retarded time. Oh wait, but the question says that d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. So maybe this is considering the retarded potential approach.

In the case of retarded potentials, the scalar potential V is given by an integral over the charge's history, but perhaps in this problem, it's simplified. Or maybe it's a static case where the charge's motion is considered in a certain way.

Wait, maybe in this problem, we're assuming that the charge's velocity is v at time tr, and the potentials are being evaluated at a later time t. So the scalar potential V would involve the charge's position at tr, and the vector potential would involve the charge's velocity at that same time.

I remember that the scalar potential V due to a moving charge is similar to the static case but modified by a Lorentz factor or something involving the velocity. Or wait, maybe not
