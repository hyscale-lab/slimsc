Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, RHIC. The question is asking for the energy of the collider so that the speed of a certain nucleus, X, is 0.96 times the speed of light, c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium with 3 neutrons. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I should figure out what kind of nucleus X is. Lithium has an atomic number of 3, so Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So, the nucleus is Li-6. Now, I need to find its rest mass energy because when dealing with relativistic speeds, the total energy is the gamma factor multiplied by the rest mass energy.

Wait, the formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 c². But since we're dealing with collisions and perhaps kinetic energy elsewhere, but the question is about the total energy of the nucleus, right? Because the problem says the energy of the RHIC is such that the speed is 0.96c. So the energy would be the total relativistic energy of the nucleus, not just kinetic.

So I think I should compute the gamma factor for v=0.96c, multiply that by the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that. Let me calculate v as 0.96c, so v = 0.96c.

v squared is (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that sqrt. 0.28 squared is 0.0784, yes. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So 1/0.28 is indeed about 3.5714. So gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass of a nucleus can be found from the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons minus the mass defect (binding energy), but maybe it's easier to look up the approximate mass of Li-6. Alternatively, I can compute it using the atomic mass.

Wait, the atomic mass of Li-6 is about... I think the exact value might be needed for precision. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron.

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the rest mass is approximately (3*mp + 3*mn) minus binding energy? Or perhaps just look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, I can approximate the mass of Li-6. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.015 atomic mass units (u). Let me confirm that. Yeah, I remember that Carbon-12 has a mass of about 12 u, and Lithium-6 is around 6.015 u.

So one atomic mass unit is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So the rest mass m0 is 6.015 u * 1.6605e-27 kg/u. Let me compute that.

6.015 * 1.6605e-27 = Let's calculate 6 * 1.6605e-27 is 9.963e-27, and 0.015 * 1.6605e-27 is about 2.49075e-29. So total m0 is approximately 9.963e-27 + 2.49075e-29 ≈ 9.9879e-27 kg.

Wait, that's m0. Now, the rest mass energy m0c². c is about 3e8 m/s. So m0c² = 9.9879e-27 kg * (3e8 m/s)^2.

Calculate that: 3e8 squared is 9e16. So 9.9879e-27 * 9e16 = 9.9879 * 9 * 1e(-27 +16) = 89.8911e-11 J. Because 9.9879*9 is about 89.8911.

Convert Joules to eV. Since 1 eV is 1.60218e-19 J. So 89.8911e-11 J / 1.60218e-19 J/eV = (89.8911e-11) / (1.60218e-19) ) eV.

Let me compute the exponent first: 1e-11 / 1e-19 = 1e8. So 89.8911 * 1e8 / 1.60218 ≈ (89.8911 / 1.60218) * 1e8 eV.

89.8911 / 1.60218 ≈ approximately 56.08. Let me compute that more accurately: 1.60218 *56 = 89.72, which is close to 89.8911. So 56.08 * 1e8 eV is 5.608e9 eV, which is 5.608 GeV.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c². Oh, right! Because 1 atomic mass unit is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So that's a much easier way to compute the rest mass energy.

So Li-6 is 6.015 u. So m0c² = 6.015 u * 931.5 MeV/u.

6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.015 * 931.5 ≈ 13.9725 MeV. So total is approximately 5589 +13.9725 ≈ 5602.9725 MeV, which is 5.6029725 GeV.

Oh, so that's about 5.603 GeV. Wait, but earlier calculation gave me 5.608 GeV. These are very close, so minor differences due to approximations. So the rest mass energy is about 5.603 GeV.

Wait, but that's the rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma times that. Gamma is about 3.5714, so E = 3.5714 * 5.603 GeV.

Let me compute that: 3.5714 *5 GeV is 17.857 GeV. 3.5714 *0.603 GeV is approximately 3.5714 *0.6 = 2.14284, and 3.5714 *0.003= 0.010714. So total for 0.603 is about 2.14284 +0.010714 = 2.15356. So total E is 17.857 + 2.15356 ≈ 20.0106 GeV.

Wait, that would be about 20.01 GeV. But looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, option B is 23.069, D is 21.419, and A is 18.475. So 20.01 is close to option C, but maybe I made some approximations that need to be precise.

Wait, let me recalculate the gamma factor more accurately. Let me compute gamma again.

v=0.96c.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/ sqrt(0.0784).

sqrt(0.0784): Let me calculate it accurately. 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt
