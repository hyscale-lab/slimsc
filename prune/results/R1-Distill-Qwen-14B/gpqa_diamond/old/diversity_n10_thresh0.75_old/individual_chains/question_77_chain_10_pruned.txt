Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure about how to approach it. Let me read through it again.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement. I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a 1,5-diene undergoing a rearrangement, typically when heated or exposed to light. The product ends up with the double bonds in different positions. Oh right, it's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. So the structure changes in a way that the ends of the diene swap places, moving the double bonds accordingly.

Now, the question has two parts, A and B. Let me take them one at a time.

First part (A): The reactant is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methylbenzene. Let me draw that structure. The benzene ring is attached to a methylene group (CH2O). Wait, no, wait. The structure is ( (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy ) methyl benzene. So the benzene has a -O-CH2- group attached, and the O is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group.

Breaking that down: the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-C(=CH(CH3))-CH2-? Wait, no. Let me think. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with a methyl on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but wait, no. Wait: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait: the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So 1-yl is the substituent on the first carbon. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 as the but-2-en-1-yl group.

Wait, but 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on the third carbon. So the
