Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem says that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given by c multiplied by S. Oh right, c is h over 4π. And S is a 2x2 matrix with the first row [0, -i] and the second row [i, 0]. So I should probably write that down.

Wait, what's S look like? The first row is 0 and -i, and the second is i and 0. So S is:
[ 0  -i
  i   0 ]

Right, and c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S. So I can write Ay as (h/(4π)) multiplied by that matrix. Let me calculate that.

So the (1,1) element is 0, (1,2) is -(h/(4π)) * i. Similarly, (2,1) is (h/(4π)) * i, and (2,2) is 0. So Ay is:
[ 0          -(h i)/(4π) ]
[ (h i)/(4π)   0         ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh wait, the question is asking which statement is correct during the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts are ±h/(4π). Wait, eigenvalues are scalars. But wait, does Ay have real or complex eigenvalues?

Wait, angular momentum operators are Hermitian, right? Because they have real eigenvalues. So if Ay is Hermitian, its eigenvalues must be real. So the eigenvalues can't have imaginary parts. So option A says imaginary parts are ±2πh, which can't be right because eigenvalues are real for Hermitian operators. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: The imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. But again, if the eigenvalues are real, this would mean the eigenvalues are real, but the option is saying the imaginary parts are ±1/2. That doesn't make sense because eigenvalues can't have imaginary parts. So B is probably wrong too.

Wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me think. Are we considering the operator Ay? Or maybe I'm getting confused with another operator. Because S is a matrix, and Ay is c times S. What's S? Oh, wait, S is given as the matrix. Let me think about S's properties.

Wait, S is given as a 2x2 matrix. Let me calculate its eigenvalues. Because if S has eigenvalues, then Ay would have eigenvalues scaled by c. So first find S's eigenvalues.

The matrix S is:
[0  -i
 i   0]

To find the eigenvalues, solve det(S - λ I) =0.

So determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)*(i) = λ^2 - [ (-i)(i) ].

Calculate (-i)(i) = -i^2 = -(-1) = 1. So det = λ² -1 = 0 → λ²=1 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of S are +1 and -1. Then, since Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues of Ay are c * 1 = c, and c * (-1) = -c.

c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). Wait, but wait, that's real. So the eigenvalues are real, which makes sense because, as I thought earlier, Ay should be Hermitian. Let me check if Ay is Hermitian.

Wait, for a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Let's see: Ay is (h/(4π))
