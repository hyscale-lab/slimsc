Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down step by step.

The problem starts with an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, so if a liquid mixture decolorizes bromine water, it probably has some unsaturated bonds, like double bonds or triple bonds. Because bromine adds across double bonds, causing the solution to decolorize.

Then, when this mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is also equimolar but consists of two other liquids. Importantly, mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Since X can decolorize bromine, it has unsaturated bonds, but Y can't, so maybe those bonds were hydrogenated, or perhaps they rearranged in some way.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a certain hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. That's a specific number, so let's calculate what that corresponds to. Also, Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent. I'm thinking maybe it's something like hexane or another alkane since alkanes are common solvents.

Wait, substance Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which makes sense if it's a fully saturated compound, like an alkane. So Z is probably an alkane because they don't react with hydrogen under normal conditions.

Looking at the mass fraction of hydrogen: 14.28%. Let me calculate the molar mass of Z. Let's see, hydrogen is 14.28% of Z's mass. So, the formula would be CnH2n+2, since it's an alkane. Let me find the molecular formula first.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7 (since 14.28 is roughly 1/7 of 100). So, if the mass of hydrogen is 1/7 of the total mass, then the rest (6/7) is carbon.

Let me denote the molecular formula of Z as CnH2n+2.

The molar mass of Z is (12n) + (2n + 2) = 14n + 2.

The mass of hydrogen is (2n + 2) * 1 g/mol. The mass fraction is [(2n+2)/ (14n + 2)] = 1/7.

So:

(2n + 2)/(14n + 2) = 1/7

Cross-multiplying:

7*(2n +2) = 14n +2

14n +14 =14n +2

14n cancels out. 14=2? Wait, that can't be right. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I did the mass fraction incorrectly. Let me recheck.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, mass of H is (1/7) of the total mass of Z.

So, for Z: mass of H = (2n + 2) g/mol, mass of C = 12n g/mol. So total molar mass is 12n + 2n +2 =14n +2.

Hydrogen mass fraction is [(2n+2)/(14n +2)] = 1/7.

So:

(2n +2) *7 = 14n +2

14n +14 =14n +2

Subtract 14n from both sides: 14=2. That's impossible. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the molar ratio is different. Alternatively, perhaps the formula isn't CnH2n+2. Maybe I miscounted something else.

Wait, perhaps Z isn't an alkane but another saturated compound. Or maybe
