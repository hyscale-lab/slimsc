Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. Their average Lorentz factor is around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm, so initially, with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third make it. We need to find the new Lorentz factor where two-thirds make it. So I need to find the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the fraction of particles that reach the detector walls.

Wait, I remember that when particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime is affected by time dilation. Since they're moving quickly, from our lab frame, their lifetime appears longer, allowing them to travel farther before decaying. So the distance they can travel before decaying would depend on their speed (Lorentz factor) and their proper lifetime.

But wait, in this problem, the detector is spherical, and particles are produced at the center. So the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is the radius of the detector, which is 30 meters. If the particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall, it will be detected. So the fraction that reach the wall depends on the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it travels 30 meters.

I think the proper approach here is to model the decay process. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after time t is given by the exponential decay formula. But since the particle is moving at a relativistic speed, the time experienced in the lab frame is gamma times the proper time.

Wait, the decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The decay length L is given by L = gamma * c * tau, where tau is the proper mean lifetime. The probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance x is P = exp(-x/(gamma c tau)).

In this problem, the detector radius is 30 meters. So if a particle's decay length is L, then the probability of it reaching the wall is P = exp(-30/(L)). Wait, no, more accurately,
