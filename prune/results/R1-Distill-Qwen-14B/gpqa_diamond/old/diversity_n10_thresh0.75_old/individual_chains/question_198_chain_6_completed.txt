Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are given: c(Co) is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. So I'm thinking, which complex is that? Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached. So that's probably the Co(SCN)_2 complex. So we're looking for the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^2+ relative to all possible Co species.

I remember that the fraction of each species can be found using the stability constants. The general approach is to set up the formation of complexes step by step and calculate their fractions using the β values and the concentrations of the ligand (SCN-) and the metal ion (Co^2+).

Each β represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, etc. Wait, but wait, how exactly do the βs work? Oh right, β is the equilibrium constant for the stepwise addition. So each step adds another SCN-.

Alternatively, sometimes β is given as the overall constant for the complex with n ligands. I think in this problem, since β1 is 9, that's probably for the first step: Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)^+ with β1=9. Then β2=40 would be the next step, so the overall constant for Co(SCN)2^2+ would be β1*β2? Or wait, no, because β2 might be the overall for the second complex. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the stability constant K for each complex is given as βn, where n is the number of ligands attached. So, for the first complex, Co(SCN), the β is 9. For the second, Co(SCN)2, the β would be β2=40. Wait, but no, the β for each step is the stepwise constant. So the overall constant for Co(SCN)2^2+ would be β1 * β2, and for Co(SCN)3^3+, it would be β1*β2*β3, etc. Hmm, I'm not 100% sure, but I think that's how it works.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, I think the β given here are the cumulative stability constants. So β1 is the constant for the first complex (Co(SCN)), β2 is for the second (Co(SCN)2), β3 for the third, etc. So each β is the overall constant for that specific complex.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because the β values would be getting larger for more stable complexes. Let me think. Let's say the first complex is Co(SCN), β1=9. The second is Co(SCN)2, β2=40. The third is Co(SCN)3, β3=63. The fourth is Co(SCN)4, β4=16. Wait, but β4 is lower than β3. That seems odd because usually, each successive addition may have a lower β, but I'm not sure. Anyway, perhaps the problem gives each β as the cumulative constant for the nth complex.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the formation of each complex step by step. Let's denote [Co] as the concentration of free Co^2+ ions, [CoSCN] as the first complex, [Co(SCN)2] as the second, and so on.

The general approach is to consider the distribution of Co species based on the ligand concentration and the stability constants. The fraction of each species is determined by the product of the stability constants up to that point, divided by (1 + sum of all such products up to the highest complex).

Wait, but wait, the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, which is much higher than the Co concentration (1e-2 M). So the solution is in a high ligand concentration regime, which might mean that higher complexes are more prevalent. But let's proceed step by step.

The overall idea is to calculate the fraction of each Co complex and then sum them to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

The formula for the fraction of each species is:

f_n = (β1 * β2 * ... * βn) * [Co] * [SCN]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + ... )

But wait, I think I might have that wrong. Let me think again. The fraction for each species is given by:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co][SCN]^n / (sum from k=0 to m of (β1 β2 ... βk) [SCN]^k [Co]) )

Wait, but [Co] is the total concentration minus whatever is in the complexes, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, the fraction for each species is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βm [SCN]^m )

Wait, no, because [Co] is a common factor. Let me think: the total concentration is [Co]_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]

But the formation of each complex can be written as:

Co^2+ + SCN- ↔ CoSCN+ with K1 = β1 = 9
CoSCN+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)2^2+ with K2 = β2 =40
Co(SCN)2^2+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)3^3+ with K3 = β3=63
Co(SCN)3^3+ + SCN- ↔ Co(SCN)4^4+ with K4=β4=16

So the stepwise βs are given as 9,40,63,16.

But wait, the β4 is 16, which is lower than β3. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. So the first complex is more stable than the fourth? Because each β is the stepwise constant, so each step's stability.

Alternatively, perhaps the overall β for each complex is the product of the stepwise βs up to that point. So the overall K for Co(SCN)2 is K1*K2 = 9*40=360, for Co(SCN)3 it's K1*K2*K3=9*40*63=22680, and for Co(SCN)4 it's 9*40*63*16=440,  wait 9*40 is 360, *63 is 22680, *16=362880.

Wait, but the problem states the stability constants as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β is the stepwise constant. So for Co(SCN)2, the overall β is β1*β2=9*40=360. Similarly, for Co(SCN)3, it's β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680. For Co(SCN)4, it's 9*40*63*16=440, wait no, 9×40=360, ×63=22680, ×16= 362,880.

Wait, but the problem gives β4 as 16. If β4 is the stepwise constant for the fourth ligand, then the overall for the fourth complex would be K1*K2*K3*K4 =9×40×63×16= (9×40)=360; 360×63=22680; 22680×16= 362,880. So that's a huge overall constant, but the stepwise β4 is 16, which is lower than β3 (63). That could mean that adding the fourth SCN- is less favored than the third, but overall the complex is still quite stable.

But for our problem, the main thing is to calculate the fraction of each species.

So the fraction of each species is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all such terms for each n, including n=0 (free Co^2+), which is 1.

Wait, no. The fraction for each species n is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of (β1 β2 ... βk [SCN]^k) for k from 0 to the maximum possible n.

Because when you have a metal ion and ligand, the distribution of species is given by the sum:

Total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4] = [Co]_total.

But [Co]_total is 1e-2 M, which is the total cobalt concentration. Wait, but [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is much higher than [Co^2+], so the complexes are more likely to form higher order species.

Wait, but the sum for the fractions would be:

sum = 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4

Because each term represents the product of the βs up to n, multiplied by [SCN]^n, for n=0,1,2,3,4.

So for each n, the fraction f_n is (β1β2...βn [SCN]^n) / sum.

So let me compute each term for n=0 to 4.

Given [SCN] = 0.1 M.

So let's compute each term:

Term_0 = 1 (n=0)
Term_1 = β1 [SCN] = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9
Term_2 = β1 β2 [SCN]^2 = 9 *40 * (0.1)^2 = 360 * 0.01 = 3.6
Term_3 = β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 = 9 *40 *63 * (0.1)^3 = let's compute that:

9 *40 is 360; 360 *63 is 22680; 0.1^3 is 0.001. So 22680 * 0.001 = 22.68
Term_4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 [SCN]^4 = (9*40*63*16) * (0.1)^4 

Wait, 9*40=360, 360*63=22680, 22680 *16= 362880. So 362880 * (0.1)^4 = 362880 * 0.0001 = 36.288.

So sum is 1 + 0.9 + 3.6 + 22.68 + 36.288.

Let me calculate that:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 3.6 = 5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So the denominator sum is 64.468.

Now, the fraction for each n is term_n / sum.

We are interested in the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So term_2 is 3.6.

So f_2 = 3.6 /64.468 ≈ ?

Let me calculate 3.6 /64.468.

3.6 divided by 64.468.

Well, 3.6 /64 = approx 0.05625.

But let's compute more accurately.

64.468 ≈ 64.468.

3.6 ÷ 64.468 = ?

Let me compute 3.6 ÷ 64.468.

64.468 * 0.055 = 3.54574

Which is close to 3.6.

So 0.0557 (approx 5.57%).

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the sum of the fractions should be 1, but the options are much higher, like 42%, etc. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because I thought of each term as β1 * β2 * ... * βn * [SCN]^n, but perhaps the correct approach is to use the cumulative β for each species.

Wait, alternative approach:

Each species is formed step by step. The fraction of each species can be found using the cumulative formation constants.

Wait, maybe the correct way is to compute the fraction of each species as (β_1 β_2 ... β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_1 β_2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β_1 β_2 ... β_n [SCN]^n )

Wait, that's what I did. But the fractions I'm getting are too low. For example, f_2 is ~5.57%, which doesn't match any of the options given (the options are like 42%, 25%, etc.)

So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I applied the βs.

Wait another thought: maybe the β values are for the overall complex, not the stepwise addition.

Wait, the problem statement says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So I'm assuming that these are the stepwise stability constants, meaning β1 is K1, β2 is K2, etc. Then the overall K for the second complex is K1*K2=9*40=360, as before.

But if the βs are the overall constants for each complex, then β1=9 for Co(SCN), β2=40 for Co(SCN)2, etc.

Wait, but no, that's not how stability constants typically work. Stability constants are usually stepwise, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, sometimes the overall β is given for each complex.

Wait, if the βs are the cumulative (overall) constants, then:

β1 = K1 = [CoSCN+]/([Co][SCN-]) =9

β2 = K1*K2 = [Co(SCN)2^2+]/([Co][SCN-]^2) =40

Similarly,

β3= K1 K2 K3 =63,

β4= K1 K2 K3 K4=16.

Wait, that can't be right because β4 would be 16, which is less than β3=63. That would imply that the fourth complex is less stable than the third, which can happen.

Wait, but if β4 is the overall constant for the fourth complex, then each βn is the product of the stepwise βs up to n. So:

β1 = K1 =9

β2 = K1*K2=40 → K2=40/9 ≈4.444

β3= K1*K2*K3=63 → K3=63/(9*4.444)=63/(39.996)≈1.575

β4= K1*K2*K3*K4=16 → K4=16/(9*4.444*1.575)=16/(71.908)≈0.222.

Hmm, that would mean that adding the fourth SCN- has a very low stepwise stability constant, which makes sense because higher complexes are harder to form once you get past a certain point.

But how does that affect the fractions?

In this case, each complex's concentration is determined by the overall βn for that n.

So for each species:

[Co]^n SCN^n+ = [Co]_total * (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is:

The fraction of Co in the nth complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because βn is the overall constant for the nth complex. So for each complex, the fraction is (βn [SCN]^n) / (sum from k=0 to 4 of (βk [SCN]^k) )

Wait, but for the first complex, β1=9 would be [CoSCN]/([Co][SCN])=9 → [CoSCN] =9 [Co][SCN]

Similarly, [Co(SCN)2] = β2 [Co][SCN]^2 =40 [Co][SCN]^2

And [Co(SCN)3]=β3 [Co][SCN]^3=63 [Co][SCN]^3

[Co(SCN)4]=β4 [Co][SCN]^4=16 [Co][SCN]^4

So the total concentration is [Co]_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4]

But [Co]_total is given as 1e-2 M.

Wait, but [SCN] is 0.1 M, and [Co] is much lower. So perhaps we can make an approximation that [CoSCN], [Co(SCN)2], etc., are much larger than [Co], making [Co] negligible.

But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, maybe [Co] can't be neglected, and we have to solve for it.

Wait, but let's proceed carefully.

Let me denote [Co] = x.

Then,

[CoSCN] = β1 x [SCN] =9 * x *0.1 =0.9 x

[Co(SCN)2] = β2 x [SCN]^2 =40 x (0.1)^2=40 x *0.01=0.4 x

Wait, no, because β2 is given as 40, which is the overall for the second complex. So [Co(SCN)2] = β2 x [SCN]^2 =40 *x * (0.1)^2 =40 *x *0.01=0.4 x.

Similarly,

[Co(SCN)3]= β3 x [SCN]^3=63 x (0.1)^3=63 x *0.001=0.063 x

[Co(SCN)4]= β4 x [SCN]^4=16 x (0.1)^4=16 x * 0.0001=0.0016 x.

Then, the total cobalt is:

x + 0.9 x + 0.4 x + 0.063 x + 0.0016 x = [Co]_total =1e-2 M.

So sum all the terms on the left:

x (1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 +0.0016) = x*(2.3646) =1e-2 → x=1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

Wait, but that would mean [Co] is about 4.226e-3 M.

Then, the concentration of each species is:

[Co] =4.226e-3 M.

[CoSCN]=0.9 *4.226e-3 ≈3.803e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)2]=0.4 *4.226e-3 ≈1.690e-3 M.

[Co(SCN)3]=0.063 *4.226e-3≈2.663e-4 M.

[Co(SCN)4]=0.0016 *4.226e-3≈6.762e-6 M.

Now, the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex is:

([Co(SCN)2] / [Co]_total ) *100.

[Co(SCN)2] is 1.690e-3 M.

[Co]_total is 1e-2 M.

So (1.690e-3 / 1e-2 ) *100 = (0.169) *100 =16.9%.

Wait, 16.9% is option D.

But wait, looking back, the options were:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So the correct answer would be D)16.9%.

But wait, earlier when I computed the fraction using the sum method, I got about 5.57% for the dithiocyanato complex, which doesn't match any of the options. But using this concentration approach, I get 16.9%, which is option D.

Hmm, so why the discrepancy?

I think the mistake I made earlier was in the initial approach, perhaps because I didn't consider that each β is the overall constant, not the stepwise. So when βs are overall, the fractions are calculated differently.

Wait, but another confusion point: whether the βs are stepwise or overall.

The problem statement says "the stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16."

Stability constants are usually given as the overall constant for each complex. So for Co(SCN), β1=9 is the overall stability constant, meaning [CoSCN+]/( [Co^2+][SCN-]) =9.

Similarly, β2=40 is [Co(SCN)2^2+]/( [Co^2+][SCN-]^2 )=40.

And so on.

So the approach I took in the second method is correct, using each β as the overall constant for the corresponding complex.

So in that case, the concentration of Co(SCN)2 is 1.69e-3 M, and the percentage is (1.69e-3 / 1e-2)*100 =16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but I thought the sum approach would give something else. Let me double-check that.

In the sum approach, I thought the fraction of each species is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) / sum(...).

But perhaps that approach is incorrect if βn is the overall constant.

Wait, another approach: the fraction of each species can be calculated by:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / (1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but wait, no, that's not correct. Because each βn is the overall constant for the nth complex.

So the fraction of the nth complex is:

[Co(SCN)_n^2+ ] = βn [Co] [SCN]^n → [Co(SCN)_n ] = βn [Co][SCN]^n.

So the total [Co] is [Co] + Σ [Co(SCN)_n ].

Wait, but that's the same as the approach taken earlier, leading to [Co] =1e-2 / (sum of (βn [SCN]^n ) +1 ), which is the same as solving for x in x (1 + β1[SCN] + β2[SCN]^2 + ... + β4[SCN]^4 ) = [Co]_total.

Which is what I did earlier.

So according to this, the percentage of Co(SCN)2 is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, in the first approach, I treated each β as a stepwise constant, which gave a much lower percentage, but that approach doesn't match the options. So probably, the correct approach is the second one, leading to option D.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations.

[Co]_total = [Co] + [CoSCN] + [Co(SCN)2] + [Co(SCN)3] + [Co(SCN)4].

Each [Co complex] is β_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n.

So:

[Co]_total = [Co] (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

So,

[Co] = [Co]_total / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β2 [SCN]^2 + β3 [SCN]^3 + β4 [SCN]^4 )

Plugging in the numbers:

β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

β1 [SCN] =9 *0.1=0.9

β2 [SCN]^2=40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4

β3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063

β4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016

Sum these terms plus 1:

1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So denominator is 2.3646.

[Co]_total =1e-2 M → [Co]=1e-2 /2.3646 ≈4.226e-3 M.

So [Co(SCN)2] = β2 [Co] [SCN]^2=40 *4.226e-3 * (0.1)^2=40 *4.226e-3 *0.01.

Compute that:

40 *4.226e-3 = 0.16904.

0.16904 *0.01 = 0.0016904 M.

Percentage of [Co(SCN)2] is (0.0016904 / 0.01 ) *100=16.904%, which is approximately 16.9%, option D.

So the correct answer must be D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, Co(SCN)₂²⁺, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the given stability constants (β₁=9, β₂=40, β₃=63, β₄=16) and the concentrations [Co²⁺] = 10⁻² M and [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are interpreted as the overall stability constants for each complex.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Species**:  
   The fraction of cobalt in each complex is determined by the equilibrium distribution of species. The total cobalt concentration is distributed among free Co²⁺ and its complexes:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}] + [\text{CoSCN}] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_3] + [\text{Co(SCN)}_4]
   \]
   Each complex's concentration is proportional to its stability constant and the ligand concentration raised to the power of the number of ligands attached:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_n] = \beta_n [\text{Co}] [\text{SCN}]^n
   \]

2. **Total Denominator**:  
   The total concentration of cobalt is expressed as:
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}] \left( 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 \right)
   \]
   Solving for \([\text{Co}]\):
   \[
   [\text{Co}] = \frac{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}}{1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4}
   \]

3. **Substitute Values**:  
   Using \([\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\) and \([\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = 10^{-2} \, \text{M}\), compute each term:
   \[
   \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9, \quad \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4
   \]
   \[
   \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063, \quad \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016
   \]
   Summing these terms:
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   [\text{Co}] = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Concentration of Co(SCN)₂²⁺**:  
   The concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is:
   \[
   [\text{Co(SCN)}_2] = \beta_2 [\text{Co}] [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot 4.226 \times 10^{-3} \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.0016904 \, \text{M}
   \]

5. **Percentage of Co(SCN)₂²⁺**:  
   The percentage of Co(SCN)₂²⁺ is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)}_2]}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} \right) \cdot 100 = \left( \frac{0.0016904}{0.01} \right) \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

**Answer: D**
