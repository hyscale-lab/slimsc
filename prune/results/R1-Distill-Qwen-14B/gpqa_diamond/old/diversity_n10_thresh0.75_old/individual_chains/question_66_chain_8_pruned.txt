Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT. Hmm, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think it stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Right, it's a framework where you write down all possible interactions that can occur at energies below a certain scale, usually the Planck scale or something like that. The idea is that you start with the Standard Model (SM) and add higher-dimensional operators to account for beyond the SM physics.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let me think about each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics look the same in all inertial reference frames. In the SM, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. When we add operators in SMEFT, do they have to maintain that? I think yes. Because if they don't, it would mean that the physics is different depending on the observer's frame, which is not acceptable in a consistent theory. So all SMEFT operators must respect Lorentz symmetry.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Wait, Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's the full symmetry of special relativity. The SM respects Poincare symmetry, right? But when you add higher-dimensional operators, like in SMEFT, I'm not so sure. Because SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, you usually assume that the high-energy physics respects Poincare. But wait, effective theories can have operators that don't respect certain symmetries if the UV theory breaks them. Wait, no, I think SMEFT operators are constructed to respect the same symmetries as the SM, including Poincare. Or do they? Because higher-dimension operators are written with derivatives and fields, which are compatible with Poincare. Hmm, but wait, the SM includes Poincare, so SMEFT, being an effective theory built upon SM, should also respect it. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required.

Wait, but wait another thing. SMEFT is a low-energy theory, so when you integrate out the heavy fields, the resulting theory should respect the same symmetries as the UV theory, provided those symmetries are present. If the UV theory has Poincare, SMEFT would have it too. But if the UV theory doesn't, then
