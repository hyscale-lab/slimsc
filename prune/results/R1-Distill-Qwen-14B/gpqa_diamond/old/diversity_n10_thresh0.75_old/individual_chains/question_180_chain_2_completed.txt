Okay, I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. Hmm, so the question is about calculating the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Alright, let me read it again.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, 2e means twice the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, since it's identical particles, they're all the same charge, 2e each.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where one charge is fixed, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. So they're on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters, centered at P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them, considering their interactions. But wait, in an isolated system, energy is minimized when the potential energy is the lowest. So I need to calculate the potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, but when you have multiple charges, the potential energy is the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. But wait, since the charge at P is fixed, and the others are at 2m apart, perhaps the potential energy is the sum of the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, plus the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The system consists of 13 charges: one fixed at P, and 12 others located at 2 meters from P. So each of these 12 is 2 meters away from P. But the 12 charges are at the same radius, so they form a spherical shell around P, each at 2m from P.

Wait, but how are the other 12 arranged? Are they equally spaced on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m? Probably, that's the most symmetrical arrangement, which would minimize the potential energy. But maybe the exact arrangement doesn't matter because we're considering identical charges in a symmetrical setup. So for the potential energy, we can calculate the contributions from each pair.

But wait, potential energy for a system of point charges can be calculated as the sum over all pairs of (1/(4πε₀)) * (q₁ q₂)/r. So for each pair, calculate that and sum them all.

But since all the 12 charges are identical and at the same distance from the fixed charge, perhaps the calculation can be broken down.

Wait, but wait. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So each of the 12 charges at 2m away will have an interaction with this fixed charge. So each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy term with the fixed charge.

So the first part of the potential energy is the sum of the interactions between the fixed charge and each of the 12. Each of these is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e * 2e)/ (2m). So 12 terms of ( (2e)^2 )/(2m * 4πε₀). Because each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P.

But wait, 2e times 2e is (2e)^2, which is 4e². So each term is (4e²)/(2m * 4πε₀). But since there are 12 such terms, the total for this part is 12 * (4e²)/(2m * 4πε₀) = (48e²)/(2m * 4πε₀) ) = 24e²/(m * 4πε₀).

Wait, but wait. Another thing: the potential energy when adding a charge is the charge times the potential at the point where you place it. So maybe I can think of it as the fixed charge at P creates a potential there, and each of the 12 charges is placed at 2m from P. So the potential at each position is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e)/(2m). Wait, no: the potential due to a point charge is (k q)/r, where k is 1/(4πε₀). So the potential at each of the 12 positions is (k * 2e) / (2) since r is 2m.

So each of the 12 charges has a potential energy of (2e) * (k * 2e / 2) ) = (2e)^2 * k/(2) = (4e²) * (1/(4πε₀)) ) / 2 = (4e²)/(8πε₀ m). Wait, because r is 2m, so 2e/(2m) would be e/m. Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, since each of the 12 charges is placed at a point where the potential due to the fixed charge is V = k*(2e)/2. So the potential at each point is (1/(4πε₀))*(2e)/(2) = (e)/(4πε₀). So the potential energy for each of the 12 charges is q * V, which is 2e * (e/(4πε₀)) )= 2e²/(4πε₀) )= e²/(2πε₀).

Wait, but that would be the potential energy for each of the 12 charges. So total for this part is 12 * (e²/(2πε₀)) ) = (12 e²)/(2πε₀) )= 6 e²/(π ε₀).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this approach accounts for all interactions. Because the 12 charges also interact with each other. Oh right, so the total potential energy is not just the interactions between each and the fixed charge, but also between each pair of the 12.

So the potential energy has two parts: U1 is the energy due to the fixed charge and the 12 charges, and U2 is the energy due to the interactions between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but wait. The fixed charge is at P, and the 12 charges are each at a distance of 2m from P. But how far are the 12 charges from each other? Because that affects their mutual potential energy.

Wait, if all the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two charges on the sphere's surface would depend on their positions. But if they are arranged as a regular dodecahedron or something, the average distance could be calculated, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that all the 12 charges are at the same distance from each other, but that's not possible unless they are all at the same point, which can't be the case. So perhaps the problem doesn't require considering the mutual interactions between the 12 charges because they are constrained to stay at 2m from P but their positions relative to each other are not fixed. Hmm, but that complicates things.

Wait, the problem says the 12 charges are "constrained to stay at 2 m from a point P." So each of them is at 2m from P, but their positions relative to each other can vary. So the minimum energy would be when their mutual repulsion is minimized, which would be when their mutual potential energy is as low as possible.

Wait, but wait: if all the charges are positive, each repels the others. So the system's potential energy is the sum of all the pairwise potentials. But if the 12 charges are on a sphere of radius 2m, the distance between any two would be 2m * sqrt(2(1 - cosθ)), where θ is the angle between them. But without knowing their exact arrangement, I'm not sure how to compute this. Hmm, maybe the mutual potential energy is negligible compared to the energy due to the fixed charge, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem simplifies by considering that the mutual interactions among the 12 charges are not part of the problem. Wait, but that can't be right because the potential energy would definitely include their interactions. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So maybe the mutual interactions would contribute to the total energy. But without knowing their exact positions, it's hard to compute. Alternatively, perhaps the problem only considers the interactions between each of the 12 charges and the fixed charge, and not between the 12. But that might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are placed very far apart, so that their mutual interactions are negligible, but that doesn't make sense because they're all at 2m from P, but their distance from each other could be as small as 0 (if they all coincide, but that's impossible due to their repulsion) or as large as 4m (diametrically opposite on the sphere). But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the mutual interactions are actually part of the calculation. Let me think again. How many pairs are there among the 12 charges? It's 12 choose 2, which is (12*11)/2 = 66 pairs. Each pair contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e * 2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the ith and jth charges.

But without knowing r_ij, I can't compute this. So perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the mutual interactions between the 12 charges, and only consider their interactions with the fixed charge. But that might not be correct. Let me think about what the problem is asking again.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. The other 12 are at 2m from P. So the question is about the potential energy of the entire system. The potential energy of a system of charges is the sum of the potentials due to each charge as each is brought into place. So perhaps the calculation includes all pairwise interactions.

But that's getting complicated. Maybe let's proceed step by step.

First, calculate the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12.

Each fixed charge is 2e, and each of the 12 is 2e. The distance between them is 2m.

So the potential energy for each pair is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e * 2e) / (2) = (4e²) / (8πε₀ m) ) = e²/(2πε₀ m).

Wait, no: wait, (2e)^2 is 4e², and denominator is 4πε₀ * 2 meters. So 4e²/(8 π ε₀ m) ) = e²/(2 π ε₀ m). So each pair contributes e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

Since there are 12 such pairs (the fixed charge with each of the 12), the total for this part is 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ m)) ) = 6 e²/( π ε₀ m).

Now, the second part is the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves. Each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and their mutual distances vary. But without knowing their exact positions, it's tricky. But perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual potential energy is zero, which isn't possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that we only consider the potential energy between each charge and the fixed charge, and not their mutual interactions. Because otherwise, the problem becomes too complex without more information.

But wait, the question is about the minimum energy. For point charges, the minimum energy configuration is when they are as close as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to be 2m from P but can move on the sphere. So perhaps the mutual potential energy is minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the problem gives options, perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is considered zero or negligible for this problem. But that's a big assumption. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, they are A) 5.645e-26, B) 2.822e-26, etc. Let's compute the first part and see.

Compute U1: 6 e²/( π ε₀ m )

e is 1.6e-19 C.

ε₀ is 8.854e-12 F/m.

m is 2 meters.

So e² is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So U1 = 6 * (2.56e-38) / ( π * 8.854e-12 * 2 )

Compute denominator: π * 8.854e-12 * 2 = approx 3.1416 * 17.708e-12 = 3.1416 * 1.7708e-11. Wait, 8.854e-12 multiplied by 2 is 1.7708e-11.

So 3.1416 * 1.7708e-11 ≈ 5.56e-11.

So numerator is 6 * 2.56e-38 = 15.36e-38.

So U1 = 15.36e-38 / 5.56e-11 = approximately 2.76e-27 J.

Wait, that's 2.76e-27, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute denominator:

π ≈ 3.1415926536.

8.854e-12 * 2 = 1.7708e-11.

So π * 1.7708e-11 = 3.1415926536 * 1.7708e-11 ≈ 5.5604e-11.

Numerator: 6 * 2.56e-38 = 15.36e-38.

So 15.36e-38 / 5.5604e-11 = (15.36 / 5.5604) ) * 1e-27.

15.36 /5.5604 ≈ 2.761.

So U1 ≈ 2.761e-27 J.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times this value. Option B is about half of this value.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me double-check the U1 calculation.

Wait, U1 is 6 e²/( π ε₀ m ), with e = 1.6e-19 C, ε₀ = 8.854e-12 F/m, m=2 meters.

So e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So:

U1 = 6 * (2.56e-38) / ( (3.1416) * (8.854e-12) * 2 )

Compute denominator:

3.1416 *8.854e-12 = 3.1416 *8.854 ≈ 27.82, so 27.82e-12.

Multiply by 2: 55.64e-12 = 5.564e-11.

So U1 = (6 * 2.56e-38 ) / 5.564e-11.

6 * 2.56e-38 = 15.36e-38.

15.36e-38 / 5.564e-11 = (15.36 /5.564) )e-27.

15.36 /5.564 ≈ 2.76.

So U1 ≈ 2.76e-27 J.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them are exactly that. Option B is 2.822e-26, which is 10 times higher than this. Option A is 5.645e-26, which is 20 times higher. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher than 2.76e-27.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me recalculate.

Wait, when I compute U1 as 6 * e²/( π ε₀ m ), with e² = (2e)^2 =4e²? Wait, no, because each charge is 2e. So each charge is 2e, so when calculating the potential energy between the fixed charge (2e) and each of the 12 (2e), the product is (2e)(2e) =4e².

So earlier, I think I forgot to square the 2e correctly. So each term is (4e²)/(4πε₀ * 2m).

Wait, let me re-express U1 correctly.

Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge. The potential energy for each pair is (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e * 2e) / (2m).

Which is (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) )= (e²)/(2 π ε₀ m).

So each pair contributes e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

So total U1 is 12 * (e²/(2 π ε₀ m)) )= 6 e²/( π ε₀ m).

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before.

So U1 is about 2.76e-27 J.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing the mutual energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Let's think about that.

Each of the 12 charges is 2e, and their mutual distances vary, but I'm to assume the most symmetrical arrangement, perhaps that they form a regular icosahedron or something, but the exact arrangement isn't given. Without knowing the exact distances between them, it's hard to compute. But perhaps for the minimum energy, the mutual potential energy is considered as zero, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is neglected because the problem is only considering the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed charge. But that doesn't seem right because all pairs contribute to the potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to model a situation where the 12 charges are at the same point, but that would mean each of them is extremely close to each other, leading to a large potential energy. But that can't be, because they are constrained to stay 2m from P. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero because they are all at the same point, but that's not possible due to their repulsion.

Wait, but maybe the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2m. But that would require them to be arranged on the vertices of a regular icosahedron with radius 2 meters, but the exact distance between any two would not be 2m. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is ignoring the mutual interactions because it's too complicated and only considering the fixed charge's interactions. Let me think about the options again. The options are:

A)5.645e-26

B)2.822e-26

C)7.056e-27

D)122.330

Wait, 2.76e-27 is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, the 12 charges are 2e each, and the fixed charge is 2e as well. So each interaction is (2e)*(2e)=4e².

So the potential energy for each pair between fixed and a moving charge is (4e²)/(4 π ε₀ *2 m) = (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) )= e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

So U1 is 12*(e²/(2 π ε₀ m)) )=6 e²/( π ε₀ m).

Plugging in the numbers:

e = 1.6e-19 C.

e² = 2.56e-38 C².

m=2 m.

ε₀=8.854e-12 F/m.

So:

6 * 2.56e-38 =15.36e-38.

Denominator: π * 8.854e-12 * 2.

Wait, wait, denominator is π * ε₀ * m = π *8.854e-12 * 2.

Compute that denominator: 3.1416 * 8.854e-12 *2 ≈ 3.1416 * 17.708e-12 ≈ 5.56e-11.

So 15.36e-38 /5.56e-11 = (15.36 /5.56) * 1e-27.

15.36/5.56 ≈ 2.76. So 2.76e-27 J.

Hmm. None of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering only the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12. Maybe I should include the mutual interactions as well.

Wait, but the mutual interactions between the 12 would contribute additional potential energy. Let's try to compute that.

The mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is the sum over all possible pairs. There are 12C2 = 66 pairs.

Each pair contributes (1/(4πε₀)) * (2e * 2e) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between the ith and jth charges.

But without knowing r_ij, perhaps we can model the average distance in a spherical arrangement. However, without exact positions, this is tricky. Another approach is to model the 12 charges as being very far apart, but that's not the case because they're constrained to 2m from P. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the mutual interactions because the 12 charges are assumed to be far apart. But that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as zero, which isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as the same as the fixed charge's interactions, but that also doesn't make sense.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 12 charges are all at the same point, but that's impossible because they repel each other. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not required for this problem, and only the interactions between the fixed charge and the others are considered. But then why do the options not include 2.76e-27?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the numbers.

Compute U1 again.

U1 = 6 e²/( π ε₀ m )

e² = (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

π =3.14159265.

ε₀=8.854e-12 F/m.

m=2m.

So,

6 * 2.56e-38 =15.36e-38.

Denominator: π * ε₀ * m =3.14159265 *8.854e-12 * 2.

Compute that:

3.14159265 *8.854e-12 = 27.82e-12.

Multiply by 2: 55.64e-12 =5.564e-11.

So U1 =15.36e-38 /5.564e-11 = (15.36 /5.564) ) * 1e-27.

15.36 ÷5.564 = approximately 2.76.

So U1 is about 2.76e-27 J.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, maybe I forgot to account for the mutual energy between the 12 charges.

Wait, each of the 12 charges is 2e, and there are 66 pairs.

Assuming all the 12 charges are equally distant from each other, but that's only possible if they form a regular icosahedron, but the exact distance would be the same for each pair, which isn't the case. Alternatively, if they're arranged in a way that each is at the same distance from every other, but that's impossible in 3D space beyond a certain number of points.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats all mutual distances as 2m. But that's not correct because that would require all charges to be on a sphere of radius 2m, but their mutual distances would be greater than 2m. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is zero because the charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual potentials cancel out. But that's not possible for like charges; they repel each other, so the potential energy would be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered, and the problem is only about the fixed charge. Let me check the options again. Option B is 2.82e-26, which is 10 times larger than our calculated U1 of 2.76e-27.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C. So e² is 2.56e-38 C².

Wait, 2e is 3.2e-19 C. So (2e)^2 is (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

Ah! Oh! I think I made a mistake here! I used e² as 2.56e-38, but since each charge is 2e, the charges are 3.2e-19 C, so (2e)^2 is (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

So earlier, I forgot to square 2e correctly. Oh! That's a big mistake.

So, let me correct that.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

So 2e = 3.2e-19 C.

(2e)^2 = (3.2e-19)^2 = 10.24e-38 C².

So now, U1 is the sum of all the interactions between the fixed charge and the 12.

Each interaction is ( (2e)^2 )/(4πε₀ * 2 m) ) = (10.24e-38 )/(8 π ε₀ m ) = (1.28e-37)/( π ε₀ m ), because 10.24e-38 /8 =1.28e-37.

Wait, no: 10.24e-38 / (8 π ε₀ *2 ) = 10.24e-38/(16 π ε₀ m ) = 6.4e-39 / ( π ε₀ m ). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost again.

Alternatively, for each pair between the fixed charge and a moving charge, the potential energy is (1/(4π ε₀)) * (2e * 2e) / (2m) ) = (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m) )= e²/(2 π ε₀ m).

But wait, e is 1.6e-19, so e² is 2.56e-38. But each charge is 2e, so the product is 4e² =4 * (1.6e-19)^2 =4 *2.56e-38=10.24e-38.

Wait, alternatively, each charge is 2e, so the product is (2e)(2e) =4e².

So each pair contributes (4e²)/(4 π ε₀ * 2m) )= (4e²)/(8 π ε₀ m )= (e²)/(2 π ε₀ m).

Wait, but e² is (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38. So e² / (2 pi ε₀ m ) is 2.56e-38 / (2 *3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2).

Wait, let's compute denominator:

2 *3.1416 =6.2832.

6.2832 *8.854e-12= approx 5.56e-11 (same as before).

Multiply by 2: 5.56e-11 *2 =1.112e-10.

So e²/(2 pi ε₀ m )= 2.56e-38 / 1.112e-10 ≈ 2.3e-28 J.

Each of the 12 charges contributes this, so U1 =12 * 2.3e-28 =2.76e-27 J.

Wait, that's the same as before. So why the discrepancy? Because I thought I made a mistake earlier, but it's not.

So, why is the option not matching? Let me look again.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges. Let's compute that.

Each pair among the 12 contributes (1/(4π ε₀)) * (2e * 2e)/r_ij.

But r_ij is the distance between two charges on the sphere of radius 2m. Let's assume the charges are equally spaced, forming a regular icosahedron. The distance between adjacent charges in a regular icosahedron of radius R is d = R * sqrt( (2 + sqrt(5/2)) ) )  ≈ 2.202 m. Wait, perhaps not exactly, but for the sake of estimation, maybe each charge is about 2 meters apart from each other. But that's an approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interaction is considered zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is considered as the same as the U1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, but the mutual potential energy would involve 66 pairs (since 12C2=66). Each pair's potential is (4e²)/(4 pi ε₀ r_ij) )= (1e-37 J·m)/(r_ij). Wait, but if all r_ij are 2m, which isn't the case, but for approximation.

Wait, assuming all r_ij are 2m, which they are not, but to proceed, compute U2 = 66 * (4e²)/(4 pi ε₀ *2m) )= 66 * (e²/(2 pi ε₀ m)) ).

Which is 66 * (2.56e-38)/(2 pi ε₀ *2) )= same as 66 * (2.56e-38)/(4 pi ε₀ m).

Wait, but given that U1 is about 2.76e-27 J, U2 would be 66 times that, which would be 1.81e-25 J. But that's way bigger than any of the options, so perhaps this assumption isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are larger, so the potential energy is smaller. But without knowing the exact distances, I can't compute accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, which would be incorrect, but let's proceed with that assumption for a moment.

Then the total potential energy would be U1=2.76e-27 J.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating U1.

Wait, let's compute U1 again more accurately.

U1 = 6 * ( (2e)^2 ) / (4 pi ε₀ * 2 m ) )

Wait, (2e)^2 is 4e², and 4 pi ε₀ *2 m is 8 pi ε₀ m.

So U1 =6 * (4e²) / (8 pi ε₀ m ) )= (24 e² )/(8 pi ε₀ m )= 3 e²/( pi ε₀ m ).

Ah! Oh! I think I made a mistake earlier in the number of terms. Wait, each of the 12 charges contributes a pair with the fixed charge. So it's 12 pairs, each with (2e)(2e)/(4 pi eps0 *2m).

So each term is (4e² )/(8 pi eps0 m )= e²/(2 pi eps0 m).

So 12 terms: 12 * e²/(2 pi eps0 m )=6 e²/( pi eps0 m).

Wait, that's correct.

Now, e² = (2e)^2 =4e²? No, wait e is the elementary charge. So 2e is 3.2e-19 C, so (2e)^2 is 10.24e-38 C².

So, substituting:

e² = (2e)^2 =10.24e-38.

So U1 =6 *10.24e-38 / ( pi *8.854e-12 *2 )

Compute denominator: pi *8.854e-12 *2=3.1416*17.708e-12= 5.56e-11.

So 6 *10.24e-38 =61.44e-38.

61.44e-38 /5.56e-11 = (61.44/5.56) )e-27.

61.44 /5.56 ≈11.05.

So U1 ≈11.05e-27 J =1.105e-26 J.

Wait, that's 1.105e-26 J. But none of the options match that. The closest option is B)2.822e-26, which is about 2.5 times higher.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1.

Wait, let me compute the denominator correctly. 8.854e-12 *2 =1.7708e-11. Multiply by pi: 3.1416 *1.7708e-11 ≈5.56e-11.

So denominator is 5.56e-11.

Numerator is 6 *10.24e-38=61.44e-38.

61.44e-38 /5.56e-11 = (61.44 /5.56 )e-27.

61.44 /5.56 ≈11.05.

So U1=11.05e-27=1.105e-26 J.

But the options are A)5.645e-26, B)2.822e-26, C)7.056e-27, D)122.330.

Hmm. So 1.105e-26 is not among them. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the mutual potential energy.

Wait, perhaps the mutual potential energy is being considered, and I'm only calculating U1.

If I compute U2 as the mutual energy between the 12 charges, assuming each pair is at a distance of 2m, which is incorrect, but for the sake of calculation:

Each pair would contribute (4e²)/(4 pi eps0 *2m)= (4e²)/(8 pi eps0 m) = e²/(2 pi eps0 m).

There are 66 pairs, so U2=66 * (e²/(2 pi eps0 m )).

Which is 66 * (10.24e-38 ) / (2 pi eps0 *2m ).

Wait, 10.24e-38/(2 pi eps0 *2m )=10.24e-38/(4 pi eps0 m )= 2.56e-38/( pi eps0 m ).

So U2=66 *2.56e-38/(pi eps0 m )=168.96e-38/(pi eps0 m ).

Hmm, but then U2 would be larger than U1, but let me compute it.

Denominator is pi *8.854e-12 *2=5.56e-11.

So 168.96e-38 /5.56e-11= (168.96/5.56) )e-27= approx 30.37e-27=3.037e-26 J.

So total potential energy would be U1 + U2=1.105e-26 +3.037e-26≈4.142e-26 J.

Which is not exactly any of the options either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual potential energy is not considered, and the correct answer is approximately 1.105e-26 J, which is not one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check all the steps again.

Wait, the charges are 2e each, so when I calculate (2e)^2, that's correct as 10.24e-38 C².

U1 is 12 pairs, each with (2e)(2e)/(4 pi eps0 *2m).

Which is 12 * (4e²)/(8 pi eps0 m )=12 * (e²)/(2 pi eps0 m ).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, e is 1.6e-19 C, so e² is (1.6e-19)^2 =2.56e-38 C².

But in our case, each charge is 2e, so (2e)^2 is 4e², which is 4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*2.56e-38=10.24e-38 C².

So U1=12 * (10.24e-38) / (8 pi eps0 m )=12 * (10.24e-38)/(8 pi eps0 m ).

Wait, 8 pi eps0 m =8 *3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2.

8 *3.1416=25.1328.

25.1328 *8.854e-12=223.55e-12.

Multiply by 2:447.1e-12=4.471e-10.

So denominator is 4.471e-10.

So U1=12 *10.24e-38 /4.471e-10.

12*10.24=122.88.

So 122.88e-38 /4.471e-10= (122.88/4.471) )e-28.

122.88/4.471≈27.5.

So U1≈27.5e-28=2.75e-27 J.

Wait, earlier I got 1.1e-26, but now I'm getting 2.75e-27. That's a factor of 10 difference. So where did I go wrong?

Ah! I think I messed up the denominator again. Let's compute denominator correctly.

Denominator for each term is 8 pi eps0 m.

So 8 *3.1416=25.1328.

25.1328 *8.854e-12≈25.1328*8.854=223.09, so 223.09e-12.

Multiply by m=2: 446.18e-12=4.4618e-10.

So U1=12 *10.24e-38 /4.4618e-10.

12*10.24=122.88.

122.88e-38 /4.4618e-10= (122.88/4.4618) )e-28.

122.88 /4.4618≈27.53.

So 27.53e-28 =2.753e-27 J.

So that would be U1=2.75e-27 J.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is about 10 times higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should have considered the 12 charges as 2e each, so the product is (2e)^2, and each term is ( (2e)^2 )/(4 pi eps0 *2m ), and there are 12 terms.

So U1=12 * (4e²)/(8 pi eps0 m )=12 * (e²)/(2 pi eps0 m ).

So e² is (2e)^2=4e²=4*(1.6e-19)^2=4*2.56e-38=10.24e-38 C².

So U1=12 *10.24e-38/(2 pi eps0 *2 m ).

Wait, denominator: 2 pi eps0 *2 m=4 pi eps0 m.

So U1=12 *10.24e-38/(4 pi eps0 m )= (122.88e-38)/(4 pi eps0 m )=30.72e-38/(pi eps0 m ).

Compute pi eps0 m:3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2=5.56e-11.

So U1=30.72e-38 /5.56e-11= (30.72/5.56) )e-27.

30.72 /5.56≈5.519.

So U1≈5.519e-27 J.

Hmm, that's approximately 5.5e-27 J. The closest option is C)7.056e-27, which is about 1.3 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm still making a mistake. Let me recompute this.

Compute denominator: pi * eps0 * m =3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2.

3.1416 *8.854e-12=27.82e-12.

Multiply by 2:55.64e-12=5.564e-11.

Numerator:12 * ( (2e)^2 ) =12 *10.24e-38=122.88e-38.

So U1=122.88e-38 / (2 *5.564e-11 )=122.88e-38/(1.1128e-10 )= (122.88 /1.1128 )e-28.

122.88 /1.1128≈110.42.

So U1=110.42e-28=1.104e-26 J.

Wait, now I'm getting 1.104e-26 J, which is 1.104e-26. Hmm.

Wait, but the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option B) 2.822e-26 J.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate my approach. Maybe the problem isn't considering the mutual potential energy, and only the interaction with the fixed charge.

In that case, the U1 is approximately 1.104e-26 J. But none of the options match this. The closest option is B)2.822e-26, which is roughly 2.5 times higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of interactions. Wait, each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge, which is 12 interactions. But each interaction contributes (2e)(2e)/(4 pi eps0 * 2m ), so each is (4e²)/(8 pi eps0 m )= e²/(2 pi eps0 m ).

So U1 =12*(e²/(2 pi eps0 m )).

With e=1.6e-19 C, e²=2.56e-38.

So, U1=12*(2.56e-38 )/(2 pi eps0 *2 )=12*2.56e-38/(4 pi eps0 m ).

Which is 12*2.56e-38=30.72e-38.

Denominator:4 pi eps0 m=4*3.1416*8.854e-12*2=4*3.1416*17.708e-12≈4*55.6e-12=222.4e-12.

So U1=30.72e-38 /222.4e-12= (30.72/222.4 )e-26.

30.72/222.4≈0.138.

So U1≈0.138e-26=1.38e-27 J.

Hmm, that's significantly lower than any option. So I'm getting conflicting results due to confusion in the calculation steps. I think I made a mistake in the denominator in some steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy due to the fixed charge, and the mutual energy is zero. But that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to compute the potential energy as the work done to bring the 12 charges from infinity to their positions. In that case, each charge contributes (2e) * (V due to the fixed charge and the other 11 charges at 2m).

Wait, that's a different approach. The potential at a point 2m from P is due to the fixed charge (2e) and the other 11 charges (each 2e) at 2m. So the potential at each point is:

V = k*(2e)/2m + 11 * k*(2e)/r_ij,

where r_ij is the distance from the other 11 charges, which are at 2m from P. But without knowing r_ij, this is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the mutual potential energy is zero, but that's not physically realistic.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I'll consider the options and look for one that fits the initial calculation where U1 was about 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B)2.822e-26, which is about 10 times higher than my U1 calculation, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me compute it again carefully.

U1 =12 * ( (2e)^2 )/(4 pi eps0 *2m )

=12 * (4e²)/(8 pi eps0 m )

=12 * (e²)/(2 pi eps0 m )

e=1.6e-19 C.

e²=2.56e-38 C².

So U1=12 * (2.56e-38) / (2 pi eps0 *2 ) )

Wait, 2 pi eps0 *2 =4 pi eps0.

So denominator is 4 pi eps0 m.

So U1=12*(2.56e-38)/(4 pi eps0 m )

=30.72e-38 / (4 pi eps0 m )

Compute denominator:4 pi eps0 m=4 *3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2.

4 *3.1416=12.5664.

12.5664 *8.854e-12=111.9e-12.

Multiply by 2:223.8e-12=2.238e-10.

So U1=30.72e-38 /2.238e-10.

30.72e-38=3.072e-37.

3.072e-37 /2.238e-10= approx 1.37e-27 J.

Hmm, about 1.37e-27 J. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the answer intended is option B)2.822e-26 J, which is 10 times higher. That suggests that maybe I forgot a factor of 10 somewhere, perhaps in the exponents.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of e^2.

e=1.6e-19 C, so e²=2.56e-38 C².

(2e)=3.2e-19 C, so (2e)^2=10.24e-38 C².

So U1=12*(10.24e-38)/(8 pi eps0 m )

=122.88e-38/(8 pi eps0 m )

Denominator:8 pi eps0 m=8 *3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2.

8*3.1416=25.1328.

25.1328 *8.854e-12=223.08e-12.

Multiply by 2:446.16e-12=4.4616e-10.

So U1=122.88e-38 /4.4616e-10= (122.88 /4.4616 )e-28.

122.88 /4.4616≈27.54.

So U1=27.54e-28=2.754e-27 J.

Hmm, again I'm getting around 2.75e-27 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is considering only the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the 12 charges are all at the same point, leading to a much higher potential energy. But that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the minimum energy is zero, but that's not any of the options.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, I think I'll have to make an educated guess. The initial U1 calculation without considering mutual energy gave me about 2.76e-27 J, but that's not an option. The closest option is option C)7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, and the correct answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, which is about 10 times higher than my U1.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that each of the 12 charges also contributes to the potential due to the other charges.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to compute the potential energy as the sum between each pair, including all 13 charges. So the fixed charge interacts with each of the 12, and the 12 interact among themselves.

So total pairs:12 (fixed with others) +66 (among the 12) =78 pairs.

So:

U_total = U1 + U2.

We have U1=12*( (2e)^2 )/(4 pi eps0 *2m )=12*(4e²)/(8 pi eps0 m )= (48 e² )/(8 pi eps0 m )=6 e²/(pi eps0 m ).

U2=66*( (2e)^2 )/(4 pi eps0 * r_avg ), where r_avg is the average distance between the 12 charges.

But without knowing r_avg, we can't compute U2. Unless the problem assumes r_avg=2m, which isn't the case, but for approximation.

Assuming r_avg=2m, then U2=66*(4e²)/(8 pi eps0 m )= (264 e² )/(8 pi eps0 m )=33 e²/(pi eps0 m ).

So U_total=6 e²/(pi eps0 m) +33 e²/(pi eps0 m )=39 e²/(pi eps0 m ).

With e²=(2e)^2=10.24e-38.

So U_total=39 *10.24e-38/(pi eps0 m ).

Compute denominator:pi eps0 m=3.1416 *8.854e-12 *2=5.56e-11.

So numerator:39 *10.24e-38=398.56e-38=3.9856e-36.

So U_total=3.9856e-36 /5.56e-11= (3.9856/5.56 )e-25 ≈0.717e-25=7.17e-26 J.

Which is close to option A)5.645e-26 or B)2.822e-26.

Hmm, perhaps my assumption that r_avg=2m is incorrect, leading to an overestimation.

Alternatively, if the mutual distances are much larger, U2 would be smaller.

But without more information, I can't accurately compute U2.

Given all that, I think the intended answer is option B)2.822e-26 J, but I'm not entirely confident.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the potential energy due to the interactions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical particles, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to remain at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \).

### Key Calculations:
1. **Potential Energy Between the Fixed Charge and the 12 Charges (U₁):**
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge. The potential energy for each pair is:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2m} = \frac{4e^2}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 m} = \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 m}.
   \]
   Since there are 12 such pairs:
   \[
   U_1 = 12 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 m} = \frac{6e^2}{\pi \varepsilon_0 m}.
   \]
   Substituting \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \), \( m = 2 \, \text{m} \), and \( \varepsilon_0 = 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \):
   \[
   e^2 = (1.6 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2,
   \]
   \[
   U_1 = \frac{6 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38}}{\pi \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 2}.
   \]
   Compute the denominator:
   \[
   \pi \cdot 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 2 = 5.56 \times 10^{-11}.
   \]
   Compute the numerator:
   \[
   6 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38} = 15.36 \times 10^{-38}.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   U_1 = \frac{15.36 \times 10^{-38}}{5.56 \times 10^{-11}} = 2.76 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Potential Energy Between the 12 Charges Themselves (U₂):**
   The 12 charges interact with each other in \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) pairs. The potential energy for each pair is:
   \[
   U_{\text{pair}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{(2e)(2e)}{r_{\text{avg}}},
   \]
   where \( r_{\text{avg}} \) is the average distance between the charges. Without explicit information about \( r_{\text{avg}} \), it is challenging to compute \( U_2 \). However, if \( r_{\text{avg}} \) is assumed to be approximately \( 2 \, \text{m} \), then:
   \[
   U_2 = 66 \cdot \frac{4e^2}{8 \pi \varepsilon_0 m} = 66 \cdot \frac{e^2}{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 m}.
   \]
   Substituting \( e^2 = 2.56 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \), \( \pi \varepsilon_0 m = 5.56 \times 10^{-11} \):
   \[
   U_2 = \frac{66 \cdot 2.56 \times 10^{-38}}{5.56 \times 10^{-11}} = 3.037 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Total Potential Energy (U):**
   The total potential energy is:
   \[
   U = U_1 + U_2 = 2.76 \times 10^{-27} + 3.037 \times 10^{-26} = 3.313 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}.
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
- **Option A:** \( 5.645 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) — Too high.
- **Option B:** \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) — Closest to the calculated value.
- **Option C:** \( 7.056 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{J} \) — Too low.
- **Option D:** \( 122.330 \, \text{J} \) — Far too high.

Given the calculations and approximations, the most reasonable answer is **Option B**.

ANSWER: B
