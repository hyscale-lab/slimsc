Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. The question is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the expectation value of an operator is like the average value you'd expect to measure in an experiment on a large number of identical systems in the same state. The formula involves taking the conjugate transpose (bra), multiplying by the operator, and then the ket vector.

But wait, the operator here is a combination of σz and σx. Oh, right, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is a different operator. So I can't directly use the expectation values of σz and σx separately unless I find them.

First, maybe I should find the expectation value of σz and σx individually, then plug them into the operator's expectation value.

Wait, but the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩, since expectation is linear. Oh, right, because expectation value is linear, so that holds.

So I need to compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ for the given state.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let's think about this. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz is easy. Because σz acting on |↑⟩ gives +1 times |↑⟩ and on |↓⟩ gives -1 times |↓⟩.

So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

The coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Since the square of the coefficients gives the probabilities, we have |0.5|^2 = 0.25 for |↑⟩ and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4) which is 0.75 for |↓⟩. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

That's straightforward. Now, what about ⟨σx⟩?

Hmm, σx is a Hermitian operator, and its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But maybe there's a better way to compute ⟨σx⟩ directly.

The expectation value ⟨ψ | σx | ψ⟩ is needed. Let me write out σx in matrix form. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[
