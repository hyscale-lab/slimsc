Okay, so I have this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, does that mean the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%? Or is it something else, like the half-life? Oh wait, the half-life is the time it takes for half the atoms to decay, but this is the probability, not necessarily the half-life. 

So the setup is that we have a single atom, and we start observing it after getting it, say from a beta decay. After 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet. Now, what's the chance it decays in the next 150 minutes?

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, the probability that the atom decays in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. 

But the thing is, radioactive decay follows an exponential law. So the decay probability is modeled by an exponential distribution. The probability that a nucleus decays in a time t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But wait, the way the question is phrased might imply that the 32% is the probability over 100 minutes. So, P(100) = 0.32. 

So, let me find λ first. 

We
