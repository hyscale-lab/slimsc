Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. Hmm, that's a bit of a process, but I'll take it step by step.

Let me read the question again. So, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene derivative with a tert-butoxy group. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. The product is called 1.

Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4. We need to find the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: The starting material is a norbornene with a tert-butoxy group. The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and it's used in two equivalents. So, I'm thinking this might be a Diels-Alder reaction because we have dienes and dienophiles. Wait, but norbornene is a dienophile. Oh wait, wait. Let me think: norbornene has a conjugated diene? Or is it more like a bicyclic structure. Hmm.

Wait, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, so it has a bridge structure, and the double bonds are in positions 2 and 5. So, the starting molecule has a bridge and two double bonds. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, that's a cyclohexadiene with substituents at positions 5 and 6 being dibromomethyl groups. So each of those positions has a CH2Br2 group. So, two double bonds—so cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene.

So, the first reaction is between 7-(tert-butoxy)norbornadiene and two equivalents of the cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups, along with sodium iodide and elevated temp. Sodium iodide is often a deprotonating agent or maybe a nucleophile, but in this case, perhaps it's involved in an elimination or substitution.

Wait, but another thought: when two equivalents of a dienophile react with a diene, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction. But norbornene is a dienophile, not a diene. So perhaps the other molecule is the diene, and the norbornene is the dienophile. But wait, norbornene has two double bonds, so maybe it's acting differently.

Wait, the norbornene has a bicyclo structure with two double bonds
