Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so that the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in the rotation-vibration model, a diatomic molecule has both rotational and vibrational energy levels. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which I think corresponds to the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So when it absorbs a photon, it moves to the next higher energy state. But wait, what's the next state? Does it go to the next vibrational state, the next rotational state, or a combination?

Wait, the question specifies it's the next state with the lowest possible energy. So maybe it's the first excited state, which would be the next vibrational level. Or perhaps it's a combination of rotation and vibration. No, wait, in the quantum model, the energy levels are quantized and the transitions depend on selection rules. Oh right, for diatomic molecules, the rotational and vibrational energy levels are quantized. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state would probably be the next vibrational state, v=1, with J=0, or maybe J increases by one.

Wait, no, I think in the non-rigid rotor model, the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor for rotation, and a quantum harmonic oscillator for vibration. The energy levels for rotation are E_rot = (ħ²/(2I)) J(J+1), and for vibration, E_vib = (½ ħω)(2J_vib + 1), where J_vib is the vibrational quantum number.

But I'm not sure if the molecular transitions are allowed to change both rotation and vibration at the same time. Oh, right, the selection rules for vibrational transitions (like in infrared spectroscopy) typically allow Δv = ±1, but rotational quantum number ΔJ can be ±1 as well, but I think for the fundamental transition, it's often just the vibrational part that changes, with J staying the same. Or maybe in this problem, the molecule goes from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next possible higher state, which could be a vibrational or
