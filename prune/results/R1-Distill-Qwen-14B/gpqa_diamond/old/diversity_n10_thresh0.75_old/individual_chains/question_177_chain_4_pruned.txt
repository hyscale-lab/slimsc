Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Similarly, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the black body radiation peak wavelength depends on temperature, right? So, same peak wavelength implies same temperature? Because according to Wien's law, λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if the peaks are the same, their temperatures must be the same.

Wait, but wait. The problem says they used spectroscopy to find the brightest wavelengths, which suggests they're looking at their black body spectra. So the peak wavelengths being the same would mean T1 = T2. Okay, that's an important point.

Then, the radial velocities: Star_1 has zero, Star_2 has 700 km/s. But since the problem is about luminosity, I'm not sure if radial velocity comes into play here. Maybe it's a red herring, or perhaps it's for something else, but perhaps it's not directly relevant to the luminosity calculation since we're told to assume they're black bodies, so maybe the velocities are just extra info.

So the question is, compute the luminosity of Star_1 compared to Star_2. The options are around 2.2 to 2.35, so factors around 2.2.

The formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since both stars have the same temperature (they have same peak wavelength), we can compute the ratio L1/L2.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2, then L1/L2 = (R1² / R2² ) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴ )

But since T1 = T2, the T term is 1. So L1/L2 = (1.5^2) = 2.25. So the luminosity ratio is 2.25. So Star_1 is 2.25 times more luminous than Star_2.

Wait, but the options don't have 2.25 as the correct answer? Wait, the options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc. So the answer would be A.

But wait, wait a second. There's another factor I might have missed. Because if the stars are moving with radial velocities, does that affect their observed luminosity? Or is the problem assuming intrinsic luminosity, like as measured from their rest frames?

The problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming they radiate as black bodies. So perhaps the velocities don't directly affect the calculation, because we're assuming
