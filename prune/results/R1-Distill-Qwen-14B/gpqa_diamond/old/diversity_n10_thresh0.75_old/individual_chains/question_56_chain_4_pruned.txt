Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions have certain selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for hydrogen are based on the quantum numbers n, l, m.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, for the principal quantum number n, it can change by any integer, but I think in practice, transitions are usually between adjacent levels or something like that.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It's a s-state since l=0.

It decays to |1,0,0⟩, which is also l=0, m=0. So the initial and final states have the same l and m. But wait, how does that work with the selection rules? Because for a dipole transition, l must change by ±1. So if initial l is 0, the next level's l must be 1, right?

So the first transition has to go from l=0 to l=1. So the first step would be from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with l=1. Now, the possible m values for l=1 are -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the initial m is 0. So the selection rule for m is that it can change by 0, ±1. So when transitioning from m=0, the possible m values for the next state could be -1, 0, or +1.

So the first transition could go to |2,1, m⟩ where m is -1, 0, +1. Then from there, the next transition would have to go to l=0 again because the final state is l=0.

So after the first step, l goes from 0→1. Then in the second step, l must go from 1→0. So each transition must change l by ±1.

Now, considering the possible states after each transition.

The initial state is n=3. The first transition would likely go to n=2 because that's the
