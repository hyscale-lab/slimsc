Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. So the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been found using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. Their masses are the same, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits. 

Wait, the host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting because usually more massive stars are bigger, but here they have the same size. So, same radius but different masses. I think that might affect the probability of transit.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers will choose the one with higher probability to observe. The options suggest different probabilities, so I need to figure out how to calculate that.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size. The formula, if I recall correctly, is something like (R_star / a_planet) * (something else?), where R is the radius and a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, I think the transit probability is given by the formula (R_star / a) multiplied by the inclination, but since we're considering the maximum probability, which is when the orbital plane is edge-on, the probability is proportional to R_star/(a * s), where s is the star's radius? Or maybe it's (R_star / a) squared? No, wait, I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no. The transit probability is actually the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbit, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another way I've heard is that the probability is roughly (R_star / a) * (something else). Let me think again. The transit probability for a planet is given by the formula:

Probability â‰ˆ (R_star / a) * (something about the star's size and the planet's orbit). Wait, I think the formula is (R_star / a) multiplied by the fraction of the sky where the planet's orbit would cause a transit. Oh wait, no, the actual formula is more precise.

Wait, I remember that the probability P is approximately
