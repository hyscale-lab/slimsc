Hmm, okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity (RV) method. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question states that there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. They used the RV method to detect them.

Wait, what's the RV method again? Oh right, it's when the star moves back and forth because of the planet's gravity. The star's movement causes a Doppler shift in its spectral lines. So the shift tells us about the star's velocity.

In the problem, Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods, specifically how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Wait, but how does the spectral shift relate to the orbital period? I remember that the RV method is sensitive to the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and orbital period. But there's a formula involved here.

I think the key formula here is the one relating the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) to the orbital parameters. The formula is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/( (1 year)^2 * (1 AU)^3 )^(1/3) )) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should get a better handle on it.

Wait, I think I've seen a simplified version because the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's. So M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the mass of the star, same for both planets here. So the formula simplifies.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) / ( (2π/P) * (1 AU)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe another way. Alternatively, the semi-amplitude K is related to the star
