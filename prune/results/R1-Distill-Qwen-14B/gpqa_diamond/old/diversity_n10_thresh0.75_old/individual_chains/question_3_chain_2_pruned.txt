Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, I remember that σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for those states.

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Oh right, expectation values. So I need to find ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ for this state.

Wait, expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier.

First, let me find ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a superposition of σz eigenstates, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward. The state is a linear combination, so the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. So for |↑⟩, the coefficient is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The eigenvalue for |↑⟩ is +1. For |↓⟩, the coefficient is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2. Let me calculate that: (sqrt(3))^2 is 3, divided by 4, so 3/4. The eigenvalue for |↓⟩ is -1.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So that's -0.5.

Now, the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I remember that σx has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, specifically the states |+x⟩ and |-x⟩. So the expectation value of σx might not be as straightforward.

Wait, but since the given state is a combination of σz eigenstates, maybe I can express it in terms of σx eigenstates or use another approach. Alternatively, I can compute it using the expectation value formula.

The expectation value of σx is given by ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩. Let me write out the state |ψ⟩:

|ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩.

So the bra vector is ⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)*⟨↓|.

The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], right? So let's compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Breaking it down:

σx |ψ⟩ = σx [0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ].

σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So,

σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

Now, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ| multiplied by σx|ψ⟩:

= [0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓| ] [0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩ ]

Multiplying term by term:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Wait, inner products ⟨a|b⟩ are zero if a≠b, and 1 if a=b. So:

First term: 0.25 * 0 → 0.

Second term: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * 1 → (sqrt(3)/4).

Third term: (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) *1 → sqrt(3)/4.

Fourth term: (3/4) * 0 → 0.

So summing up all terms: (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866.

Wait, but let me make sure I computed that correctly. Another approach: Maybe using the formula for expectation value of σx.

Alternatively, perhaps express the state in terms of the eigenstates of σx. Let me think. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ = (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and |-x⟩ = (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2). So any state can be written as a combination of these.

Let me express |ψ⟩ in terms of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩.

Wait, |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a linear combination of |+x⟩ and |-x⟩.

We have:

|↑⟩ = (|+x⟩ + |-x⟩)/sqrt(2)
|↓⟩ = (|+x⟩ − |-x⟩)/sqrt(2)

So substituting into |ψ⟩:

0.5*(|+x⟩ + |-x⟩)/sqrt(2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*( |+x⟩ − |-x⟩ )/sqrt(2).

Factor out 1/sqrt(2):

[0.5(|+x⟩ + |-x⟩) + (sqrt(3)/2)(|+x⟩ - |-x⟩) ] / sqrt(2).

Combine coefficients:

For |+x⟩: 0.5 + (sqrt(3)/2) = [1 + sqrt(3)] / 2
For |-x⟩:
