Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. The question says there are five exoplanets, Planet_1 to Planet_5, in orbital resonance with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But maybe that's not too important for this problem.

The key thing here is that their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and each subsequent planet has a longer period, with Planet_5 having five times the period of Planet_1. 

The question asks about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so albedo isn't a factor here. Equilibrium temperature usually depends on the distance from the star, right? The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ d²) )^0.5 ), where L is the star's luminosity, σ the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d the distance. But maybe a simpler way is to think in terms of the inverse square law and the fact that temperature is proportional to the square root of (L/(16πσ d²)), which simplifies to T ∝ (L)^0.5 / d.

Wait, but since all planets are orbiting the same star, L is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature should only depend on the distance from the star. The closer the planet, the higher the temperature. So the ratio of their temperatures would be based on the inverse square of their distances.

But wait, how do the orbital periods relate to their distances? Oh right, Kepler's third law. The law says that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star). So P² ∝ a³.

So if I have two planets, say Planet_2 and Planet_4, their periods are in the ratio 2 : 3.5. So P2 is 2 and P4 is 3.5. Let me write that down.

P2 / P1 = 2, and P4 / P1 = 3.5. So the ratio P4/P2 is 3.5 / 2 = 1.75.

But since P² is proportional to a³, I can write (a4 / a2)^3 = (P4² / P2²). Let me compute that. (3.5/2)^2 = (7/4)^2 = 49/16. So a4^3 / a2^3 = 49/16. Taking cube roots, a4/a2 = (49/16)^(1/3). Let me calculate that.

Wait, 49 is 7², 16 is 2⁴. So 49/16 = (7²)/(2⁴) = (7^2)/(2^4). Taking the cube root gives (7^(2/3))/(2^(4/3)).

But maybe I can approximate this. Let me calculate 49/16 = 3.0625. So the cube root of 3.0625 is approximately 1.446. So a4 is about 1.446 times a2. Wait, but that's the ratio of their distances. Wait no, wait. Wait, P4 is larger than P2, so a4 is larger than a2. So a4 = a2 * (49/16)^(1/3). Let me compute 49/16 is 3.0625. Cube root of 3.0625: Hmm. 1.4
