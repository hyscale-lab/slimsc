Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me break it down. The question is about the mean free path of gas molecules in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. Hmm, I remember that the mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right, so at ultra-high vacuum, the pressure is really low, which should mean a longer MFP because molecules don't hit each other as often.

Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 1e-9 Torr. He found the MFP as λ1. But when he started the electron beam, the MFP became λ2, which is different from λ1. The question is why λ2 would change.

Wait, the electron beam... Oh, right, the electron beam has a high energy. But how does that affect the gas molecules? Oh, maybe the beam interacts with the gas, causing some effects. Oh, like scattering electrons off the gas molecules. But how does that change the MFP?

I think about what affects MFP. The primary factor is the pressure, but also the temperature and the cross-sectional area for collisions. The formula for MFP is λ = 1/(nσ), where n is the number density and σ is the collision cross-section. Or wait, another version is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * n), where d is the diameter of the molecules. But regardless, n is the number of molecules per unit volume.

In the ultra-high vacuum, n is very low, so λ1 is large. But when the electron beam is on, perhaps the gas is ionized? Or maybe the electrons cause the gas molecules to move more, increasing the temperature. Or perhaps the beam induces some other effect like dissociation or something else.

Wait, but the question says the temperature remained the same. So n would be the same, but perhaps the effective cross-section changes. Oh, because when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might be ionized. Ions have a different way of interacting. But wait, the MFP is about collisions. If the gas becomes ionized, the cross-section might change because ions have different interaction cross-sections than neutral atoms.

Alternatively, maybe the beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question says temperature is the same, so that's not it. So the MFP depends on two main factors: the number density and the collision cross-section.

If the beam is causing the gas molecules to be more energetic, but temperature is the same, that's confusing. No, because temperature is a measure of kinetic energy. If temp is same, thermal velocities same as before.

Wait, but when the electrons hit the gas, maybe they cause the gas to become ionized. So the gas is now partially ionized. How does ionization affect the MFP? Well, ions have a different collision cross-section compared to neutral atoms. For example, ions might have a larger cross-section because their charge allows them to interact more strongly. Or perhaps in a plasma state, the mean free path changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to be more likely to collide with the electron beam itself. Wait, but that's electron scattering, which is a different interaction. The question is about the MFP of the gas molecules, not the electrons.

Wait, so the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be excited or ionized. If the gas becomes a plasma, the mean free path could be shorter because the ions might have more frequent collisions. Or maybe the cross-section for collisions increases.

Wait, another angle: the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more likely to interact, either by increasing the rate of ionization or by causing more frequent scattering events. So the collision cross-section σ could increase, which would decrease the MFP because λ is inversely proportional to σ.

So, λ2 would be less than λ1 because σ increased. So λ2 is smaller than λ1. That would mean option C: λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, if the electron beam somehow reduces the effective pressure, but that seems less likely because the temperature is the same. Or maybe the beam causes the gas to expand, but again, the pressure is given as ultra-high, same as before.

Another thought: the presence of the electron beam introduces more particles (electrons) into the system, which would increase the number density of particles that the gas molecules can collide with, thereby decreasing the MFP. But wait, the electrons are moving at high speeds and the gas is at a much lower pressure. So the number of electrons is probably negligible compared to the gas molecules. Or, since the electron beam is a continuous source, maybe it adds more particles into the system, but I'm not sure if that's significant.

Wait, no, because the sample compartment is already at ultra-high vacuum, any gas molecules are minimal. So the main effect is on the
