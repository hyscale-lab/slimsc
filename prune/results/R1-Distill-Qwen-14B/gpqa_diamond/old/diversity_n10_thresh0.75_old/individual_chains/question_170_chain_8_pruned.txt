Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), and I need to compute the expectation value of S_y. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the correct one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So, expectation values involve the operator acting on the state, right? Oh right, the expectation value of an observable is the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state. So for S_y, I need the operator σ_y, which is given as a matrix.

The σ_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times σ, right? Because for spin-½ particles, the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ. So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y.

So the state vector is given as (3i, 4). I should represent this as a column vector. Let me write that down: ψ = [3i; 4]. So the first component is 3i, the second is 4.

To find the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Which is the same as (ħ/2) times ⟨ψ| σ_y |ψ⟩, since S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So first, let's compute σ_y |ψ⟩. Let me write out the matrix multiplication. σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply σ_y by ψ:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.
Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i². Wait, i squared is -1, so that's 3*(-1) = -3. So the second component is -3.

So σ_y |ψ⟩ is the vector [-4i; -3].

Now, I need to compute the inner product of ψ with σ_y |ψ⟩. The inner product is ψ† times σ_y |ψ⟩. Let's compute that.

ψ† is the conjug
