Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star that's being studied by astronomers. The star has certain characteristics: 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. But when the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. However, when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. They observed that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…, which I think is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe visible range. Also, it's stated that the photosphere is in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So I can probably use the Boltzmann equation for this.

Hmm, the Boltzmann equation relates the populations of different energy levels in a gas. The equation is: 

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1) / (k*T) )

Where:
- n is the number of particles in each level
- g is the statistical weight (degeneracy)
- E is the energy of each level
- k is Boltzmann's constant
- T is the temperature

Wait, but in this problem, when there are spots, the effective temperature of the photosphere decreases. So the temperature in the photosphere is lower when spots are present. But wait, the problem says when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temp is 5500 K. Oh, wait, but the spots themselves are cooler regions, right? So when the spots are present, part of the star's surface is cooler, but the rest is the same as before. But the question is about the photosphere as a whole, so how does that affect the temperature in the regions where the Ti atoms are?

Wait no, the problem says that when 40% is covered by spots, the photos
