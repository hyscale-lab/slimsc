Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound is the correct one based on the given spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

The question gives me the FTIR and 1H NMR data. Let's start with the IR first. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch because they are strong acids and can form hydrogen bonds more readily than alcohols. So, that peak suggests the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Then, there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl peak is typically around 1700 cm^-1 or a bit lower. So that fits with the first part. So the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem says that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens, which means there are no double bonds in the molecule. So all the carbons are probably single bonds. That's good to know because it might rule out any structures with double bonds.

In the NMR, we have two specific splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit confusing, but I think it relates to the neighboring protons and their splitting.

Looking at the options, all the compounds are similar but have different substituents. Let me note the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, let me write them all out properly.

Option A: It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the two middle CH groups each have an ethyl group attached. Then a CH2 group before the COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH(C2H5)-CH(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, noâ€”wait, let me parse that correctly. It's CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the two middle CH groups each have an ethyl group, and the chain before COOH is longer: CH2CH2 is part of a longer chain.

Wait, no, actually, it's CH3CH2- so that's ethyl. Then the next carbon is C(H)(C2H5), so it's connected to ethyl and H. Then another C(H)(C2H5), and then COOH. So the structure is ethyl-ethyl-methylene-ethyl? Hmm, not sure.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the two middle CH groups each have a methyl group. Then a CH2 before the COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the two middle CH have methyl groups, and the chain before COOH is longer: CH2CH3.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw them out mentally.

So all four options have a central structure where two CH groups are attached. Each of these CH groups has substituents: either CH3 or C2H5 (ethyl).

The question is about the NMR signals. Let's think about the possible structures and their NMR.

Since the FTIR indicates a carboxylic acid, all options have
