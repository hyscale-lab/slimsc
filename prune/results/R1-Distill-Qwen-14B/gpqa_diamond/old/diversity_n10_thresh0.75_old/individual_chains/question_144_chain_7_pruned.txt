Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember from my classes that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. So X is a meson resonance, which probably means it's a type of meson that exists for a very short time before decaying.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance. I think that has to do with how far the meson can travel before it decays. So, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before it decays. But how do I calculate that?

I remember something about the mean lifetime being related to the decay width. Oh wait, the decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by the equation Γ = ħ/τ. Or wait, maybe it's Γ = ħ * τ⁻¹? Because Γ is the total decay rate, which has units of energy, I think. So, τ is the mean lifetime. So, to get τ, I can use τ = ħ / Γ.

Once I have the mean lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the velocity of the particle by the lifetime. So, distance L = v * τ. But wait, what velocity do I use? The production energy is given, which is E_X = 8 GeV, and the mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So maybe I can find the velocity from that.

Let me think about relativistic energy. The total energy E is related to the rest mass and the momentum. The equation is E²
