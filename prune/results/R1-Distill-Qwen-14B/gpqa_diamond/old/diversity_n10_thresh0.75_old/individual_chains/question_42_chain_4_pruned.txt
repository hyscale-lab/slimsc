Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, the setup: there are three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3, with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the problem, maybe it's more about how they were detected rather than the orbital mechanics here.

The key data given are the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. That means Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 by about 40%. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Planet2 is about 2.3 times hotter than Planet3. So, Planet1 is 1.4 times Planet2, and Planet2 is 2.3 times Planet3. So Planet1's temperature compared to Planet3 would be 1.4 * 2.3, which is about 3.22. So Planet1 is about 3.22 times hotter than Planet3.

Then, the mass ratios. Planet1's mass to Planet2 is about 1.15, so Planet1 is a bit more massive than Planet2. Then, Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2 is 35% more massive than Planet3. So Planet1's mass compared to Planet3 would be 1.15 * 1.35, which is let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35. Hmm, 1 times 1.35 is 1.35, 0.15 times 1.35 is 0.2025, so total 1.5525. So Planet1 is about 1.55 times more massive than Planet3.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. The question asks by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. So, Orbital Period of Planet3 / Orbital Period of Planet1 = ?

They also mention that the albedo for all three is 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo affects the equilibrium temperature because it determines how much light is reflected. But since all have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking ratios. So, I can probably ignore albedo when considering the temperature ratios.

Wait, but equilibrium temperature. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

Te = [(L / (16πσ))*(1 - a) / (d^2)]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, sigma is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star (semi-major axis, which is the same as radius for circular orbits).

But since all three planets are around the same star (I assume), and albedo is same, the ratio of Te depends only on the distance. Because L, a, and sigma are the same for all, so Te is proportional to (1/d)^(1/4). So, if we have Te1/Te2 = sqrt(sqrt( (d2/d1) )) )

Wait, let me think again. Let me rearrange the formula.

Te ∝ (1/d)^(1/4) → so d ∝ (1/Te)^4.

So the distance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the equilibrium temperature.

So, because the ratio of Te1 to Te2 is 1.4, so Te1 = 1.4 Te2.

So, d1/d2 = (Te2 / Te1)^4 = (1/1.4)^4.

Wait, let me compute that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10=7/5. So (5/7)^4. What is that approximately?
