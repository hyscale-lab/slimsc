Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Right, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, so Ca²+ and EDTA^4- combine to form a complex. The formula would be something like CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA part.

The problem states it's a 0.02 M solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But we need to find the concentration of free calcium ions in solution.

I think the key here is the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4−. The formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10^10. Wait, but sometimes Kf is the formation constant, which is the reverse of the dissociation. Let me get that straight.

Formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be:

Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−

The Kf for this reaction is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]) = 5e10.

But if the complex dissociates, the reverse reaction would have a K equal to 1/Kf. So for the dissociation:

CaEDTA^2− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA^4−

The K_dissociation = 1/Kf = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Wait, okay, so the dissociation constant is small, which makes sense because Kf is large, meaning the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ should be low.

Now, assuming that the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M.
