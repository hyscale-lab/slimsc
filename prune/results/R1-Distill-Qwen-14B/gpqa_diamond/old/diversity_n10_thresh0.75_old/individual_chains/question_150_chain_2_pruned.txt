Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me think about the degrees of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degrees of unsaturation. The formula for degrees of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C is 8, H is 9, X (halogens) is 0, and N is 1.

So, plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean, for example, a benzene ring (which is 3 degrees), a double bond (1), and an aldehyde or something else (another 1). Or maybe a benzene and a carbonyl group, along with some other double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data. Let's list them out:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H) – that's a triplet, probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm as a singlet or a triplet if it's next to a CH2 group. Wait, here it's a triplet. So maybe the aldehyde is adjacent to a CH2 with two protons. So perhaps something like RCHO with R being CH2-something.

6.98 (d, 2H) – doublet, likely aromatic protons. Maybe para-substituted on a benzene ring.

6.51 (d, 2H) – another doublet, perhaps another set of aromatic protons. Wait, but the integration is 2H each time. So maybe two different sets of aromatic protons. Like two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That could mean a para-substituted ring and another substituent elsewhere. But wait, the integration is 2H each. So maybe two separate para-substituted benzene rings connected somehow.

6.27 (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group or possibly an aldehyde adjacent to something else. Wait, but the aldehyde is at 9.72. Alternatively, maybe these are protons on a vinyl group. Or perhaps they are part of a conjugated system, like in an enol or something.

3.66 (d, 2H) – doublet, 2H. This could be an OCH2 group. So maybe a methylene next to an oxygen, like an ether or ester. Or perhaps a CH2 connected to something else, like a carbonyl.

Putting this together. Let's think about the structure. The molecule has an aldehyde group, since there's a peak at 9.72. Also, two aromatic rings from the two sets of doublets. The 3.66 ppm could be a CH2 connected to oxygen. So perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with a side chain that includes an OCH2 group and another aromatic ring.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me count: each benzene ring is C6H5. If there are two benzene rings, that would be 12 carbons, but the formula only has 8. So maybe that's not the case. So perhaps it's a single benzene ring connected to a side chain, which includes another aromatic group or a substituent that contributes to the rest of the structure.

Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring (6 carbons) with a substituent that has two carbons, but with some double bonds. Let me think. Let's imagine the structure. The aldehyde is at the end of a chain. So maybe something like Ph-CH2-CHO? But that would be more carbons than 8.

Wait, let's count again. C8H9NO. So 8 carb
