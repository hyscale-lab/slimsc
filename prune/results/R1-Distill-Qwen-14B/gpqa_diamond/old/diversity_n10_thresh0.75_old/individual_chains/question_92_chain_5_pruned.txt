Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Oh wait, atomization is the energy required to break a carbon atom into its constituent particles, right? So each C atom requires 1000 kJ to be atomized. But wait, the bond energies are provided for C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. Also, H-H is given, but since the compound is an alkane or something with H's, I guess we might need that too.

The options are all different values, but I'm not sure which one is correct. Let me think about how to approach this. Oh, right, the enthalpy of formation of a molecule can be calculated using bond energies. The formula is something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the products, but wait, I might be mixing that up.

Wait, I think the general method is to calculate the enthalpy change using the bonds broken and formed. So for a molecule, the enthalpy of formation would be the sum of the energies of all the bonds in the reactants minus the sum of the energies of all the bonds in the products. But wait, that's when you're considering the reaction. Actually, maybe I should think in terms of the molecule's own bond energies.

Alternatively, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by taking the sum of the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule as if it were broken down into its constituent atoms, and then subtracting the sum of the bond energies of the atoms as they appear in their standard states (like CO2, H2O if we were dealing with combustion, but in this case, perhaps it's the elements).

Wait, no. Wait, bond energies are typically used to calculate ΔH for reactions, but for formation, another approach is needed. Alternatively, maybe the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy required to form the molecule from its elements.

So, the formula might be something like:

ΔH_f = [sum of bond energies of all bonds in the molecule] - [sum of bond energies of the elements as they are in their standard states].

Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh right! The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule into its constituent atoms and then re-forming them into the standard bonds. So it's about the energy change when the molecule is formed from its elements.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation for a molecule is the energy change when one mole of the molecule is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon, it's the energy change when the hydrocarbon is formed from carbon (in graphite or something) and hydrogen gas.

But since we're given bond energies, perhaps we can use the method where we calculate the energy required to break all bonds in the molecule and then subtract the energy released when forming the bonds in the elements.

Wait, perhaps a better way to think about it: The enthalpy of formation can be found by taking the bond energies of all the bonds in the molecule and then subtracting the bond energies of the elements as they are in their standard states.

Wait, no, wait: The standard enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for example, for methane, it's the energy change when C(graphite) and H2 gas form CH4.

If we're using bond energies, the formula is:

ΔH_f = [Σ (bonds broken in the reactants)] - [Σ (bonds formed in the products)]

Wait, no
