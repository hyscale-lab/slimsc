Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is distance (in parsecs) is 1 divided by parallax (in arcseconds). So parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—so the number of stars in a certain volume of space should be the same in all directions. But wait, when we talk about parallax, we're essentially looking at how far away the stars are. So as parallax increases, the stars are closer because parallax is inversely proportional to distance.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how many stars are there when we consider a range of parallaxes. Let me think in terms of volume. Because if the distribution is uniform, the number of stars depends on the volume of the spherical shell at a certain distance.

A spherical shell's volume would be the surface area (4πr²) multiplied by the thickness (dr). So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to the volume. But how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax plx is 1/d (where d is distance in parsecs). So d = 1/plx. Let's say we have a small change in parallax, d(plx) = -d(1/d) → d(plx) = - (1/d²) dd. Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's consider
