Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and the radiation it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around the z-axis, but not a perfect sphere maybe. Because it's oscillating, it radiates, and the wavelength is lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, where theta is the angle from the z-axis.

The question is asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f, specifically whether it's lambda to the minus 4, minus 3, etc.

Wait, right, I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle theta. The dipole radiation pattern is such that the intensity is maximum along the equator (theta = 90 degrees), and it falls off as cos^4(theta) or something like that. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Dipole radiation: The power radiated per unit solid angle (intensity) for a dipole varies with cos^4(theta), right? Because I think the intensity pattern for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta))^2? Wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's proportional to sin^2(theta) or something else. Wait, no, I think for a dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the axis. So the intensity should be maximal at theta = 90 degrees and zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180 degrees).

Wait, the formula I remember for the intensity in dipole radiation is I proportional to ( (d^2 E/dt^2) )^2, and that in the far field, the E and B fields have components.
