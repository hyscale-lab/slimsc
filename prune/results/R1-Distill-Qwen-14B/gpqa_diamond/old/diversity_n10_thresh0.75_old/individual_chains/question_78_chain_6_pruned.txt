Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, the question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time when a charge q is moving. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the setup is that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're looking at the potentials at time t, which is after the time tr when the field was generated. The observation point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. The velocity at the field generating time is v.

Wait, I remember there are two main potentials in electromagnetism, the scalar potential V and the vector potential A. They are related to the electric and magnetic fields via Maxwell's equations. For a moving charge, both potentials contribute to the fields.

So, the scalar potential V is usually associated with the electric field. I think it's given by Coulomb's law for a static charge, but when the charge is moving, there might be some corrections due to retarded time or something. Oh wait, but here we're considering the potentials at time t, which is after the charge's motion at tr. So, I might need to consider the retarded time formalism.

The vector potential A is linked more to the magnetic field. For a moving charge, A is proportional to the velocity, I believe. The magnetic field comes from the moving charge's motion, so A should involve the velocity v.

Looking at the options, let's see what each option says.

Option A: V is the simple Coulomb potential, 1/(4πε0 r) multiplied by q. The vector potential A is v squared over c squared times V. Hmm, but wait, v squared? I thought A is proportional to v, not v squared. So maybe this isn't right.

Option B: V is the same as A. A is v over c squared times V. So A proportional to v. That sounds more plausible. Because I remember for a moving charge, the vector potential is (μ0 q v)/(4π c²) (or something like that) times some unit vectors. But wait, the denominator might be more complicated because of distances and dot products.

Option C: V is (
