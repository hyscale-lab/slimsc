Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the product when a specific epoxide reacts with Me2CuLi. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when epoxides react with organocuprates like Me2CuLi, it's an example of a conjugate addition or a nucleophilic attack. Wait, no, organocuprates are strong nucleophiles, so maybe it's a nucleophilic ring-opening reaction. Oh right, epoxides are strained and susceptible to nucleophilic attack.

The question says that the alkyl group from the reagent is introduced at the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. So, in a disubstituted epoxide, the nucleophile adds to the less substituted carbon, and inversion occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. Wait, inversion of configuration? Oh, right, because the epoxide oxygen is a good leaving group, but wait, no—organocuprates typically do a ring-opening via a conjugate mechanism. Or wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution with inversion.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure of the epoxide first. The compound is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is like a norbornane structure, right? So the bridgehead is at carbon 1 and 6, I think. Let me imagine the structure: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane is a norbornane, which is a bridged bicyclic compound with two bridgehead carbons.

So, the 7-oxa means there's an oxygen in place of a carbon in the bicyclo structure. Wait, no—bicyclo[m.n.p], right, so the numbers are the number of carbons in each bridge. So bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has bridges of 4, 1, and 0. So, the structure is norbornane, with two bridgeheads. The oxygen is at position
