Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, transits—right, that's when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting so the researchers should prioritize observing it.

The setup: Two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both detected via the RV method, so their minimum masses and orbital periods are known. Same masses, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So P1 is shorter, meaning it's closer to its star since period relates to distance via Kepler's third law.

The host stars have same radii but different masses. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's star. But same radii, which is interesting because usually a more massive star would be larger, but maybe it's evolved or something. Wait, Planet_2's host is slightly evolved, so perhaps a subgiant or something, which can expand but maybe they're both main sequence? Hmm, but the radii are same, so for P1's star, which is more massive, it's radius is same as P2's. That might affect other factors.

We need to find the transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)² * (something else?), wait no, I think it's more about the geometry. Oh right, the transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet)² / (a_planet * (1 - e²)^0.5) )… Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the transit probability for a circular orbit is approximately (R_p / R_s)² * (1/(a_p)) but I don't think that's quite right. Wait, the probability depends on the relative size of the planet's orbit compared to the star's size. The formula I remember is that the probability P is roughly (R_s + R_p) / a_p, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star to the area of the orbital plane, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively
