Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how they affect the light curve, comparing it to an exoplanet transit. Interesting.

Alright, the question says that the star has a radius equal to the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a 20% filling factor. The star's Teff is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. They mention that because of these spots, the photometric observations show periodic brightness variations, which can look like an exoplanet transit. The task is to find what the radius of such a planet would need to be relative to the star to produce the same brightness variation.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits a star, the dip in brightness is due to the planet blocking some light. The formula for the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, right? Because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. So the brightness variation isn't just a simple dip. Let me think. The spots are cooler, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view and then go away. But since it's only one hemisphere, the spots would come into and out of view as the star spins.

But the question says, if the star wasn't covered by spots, what planet radius would cause the same light curve amplitude. So we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the star's spots to the variation caused by a planet transit.

Wait, no. The problem states that the star's spot coverage causes a brightness variation similar to a planet transit. So the brightness change from the spots is being compared to the change from a planet. So we need to calculate the equivalent radius that would cause the same change.

Let me get the given numbers straight. The star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So the area with spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere. Wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface, right? So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2) )? Because the area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². Wait, actually, no: the area of a hemisphere (half of a sphere) is (4π R²)/2 = 2π R². So the spots cover 20% of that. So spot area is 0.2 * 2π Rstar² = 0.4 π Rstar².

Wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20%. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that is covered by spots. So if the hemisphere's area is 2π R², then the spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². Hmm.

But now, the star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spot temperature is 5000K.

So the star's luminosity without spots is L = 4π Rstar² σ Teff^4. The spots are emitting less, but how does that affect the observed luminosity when they're facing us.

Wait, when the star rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view. So the observed flux would change because part of the star's surface (the spots) is less bright.

Let me model this. The star's total flux without spots is F0 = σ Teff^4. The flux from the spots is F_spots = σ (Teff - 1000)^4, but since spot area is a fraction of the hemisphere, we need to compute the average.

Wait, let me think. The total flux when the spots are visible would be the sum of the flux from the unspotted part and the spotted part.

The unspotted part is (1 - 0.2) of the hemisphere, because the filling factor is 0.2. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So the unspotted area is (1 - 0.2) = 0.8 of the hemisphere.

So the total flux from the star when the spots are visible is:

F_total = [ (0.8 * area per unit) * Teff^4 + (0.2 * area per unit) * (Teff - 1000)^4 ] per unit area.

Wait, no. The total flux is the sum of all the flux from each part of the star. So the star's surface is made up of two parts: spotted and unspotted.

The area of the entire star is 4π Rstar². The spotted area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². The unspotted area on the visible
