Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that a Pi-plus is at rest and decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV and mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two energies. I think I need to find the kinetic energies of the mu and the neutrino.

Wait, when a particle at rest decays, conservation of energy and momentum must apply. Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products should be zero. So the mu and the neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means their magnitudes of momentum are the same but directions opposite. So p_mu = -p_nu.

Now, for energy conservation, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion. The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the mu and the neutrino. The pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. So m_pi c^2 = E_mu + E_nu.

The mu has rest mass 105.7 MeV, so its energy E_mu would be sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). Similarly, the neutrino's energy E_nu is just p_nu c, since its rest mass is negligible (I think neutrinos are considered massless in these problems unless stated otherwise). Oh wait, but wait, the neutrino has some mass, but its rest mass is much smaller than the other particles. But the problem doesn't give a rest mass for the neutrino, so I guess we can treat it as massless. So E_nu = p_nu c.

Since the pion is at rest, the momenta must cancel each other. So p_mu = -p_nu, so their magnitudes are equal. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p, say.

So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ) = c * sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2 c^2) / c^2? Wait, units might be a bit confusing, but perhaps I can work in units where c=1 for simplicity. So E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

The total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

So, sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = m_pi - p.

Then square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi - p)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(m_pi)^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2.

So,

p^2 + m_mu^2 = (m_pi)^2 - 2 m_pi p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

m_mu^2 = m_pi^2 - 2 m_pi p.

Rearranging for p:

2 m_pi p = m_pi^2 - m_mu^2.

So,

p = [ (m_pi^2 - m_mu^2) ] / (2 m_pi )

Wait, let me compute that. Given m_pi is 139.6 MeV and m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So,

m_pi^2 = (139.6)^2 ≈ 139.6 *139.6. Let me compute that.

139.6 *139.6: 140^2 is 19600, but 140-0.4, so (140-0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

Wait wait, no. 139.6 is (140 - 0.4) so the square is 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2. 140^2 is 19600. 2*140*0.4 is 112. 0.4^2 is 0.16. So 19600 - 112 is 19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

Similarly, m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2. Let's compute that.

100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2 * 100 *5.7= 1140. So (105.7)^2 = (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49.

So,

m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then,

p = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) 

Compute denominator: 2 *139.6=279.2.

So 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Divide 8315.67 by 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30 is 8376, minus 279.2, so 8376-279.2=8096.8. That's 29, so 279.2*29 is 8096.8. But 8315.67 is higher than that.

So 8315.67 -8096.8=218.87. Now, 218.87 /279.2 ≈ 0.783. So 29.783. So approximately 29.783 MeV.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation because perhaps I forgot that in the equation, m_pi^2 - m_mu^2 is in (MeV)^2, and p is in MeV because when we're working in units where c=1, energy and mass have the same units, and momentum would have units of MeV/c. But when c=1, p is in MeV/c, but perhaps I'm
