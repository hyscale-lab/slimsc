Okay, so I've got this problem here about an algorithm that converts DNA sequences into numbers. The examples given are AGG -> 115 and TGCTGA ->176. I need to figure out what the algorithm is doing so I can apply it to the sequence ACAGTGACC and find out which option it matches.

Hmm, let me think. DNA sequences are made up of the bases A, T, C, G. So each position is a nucleotide. The output numbers are 115 and 176. Let's see if I can find a pattern or a way to convert each base into a number and then sum them up.

Wait, maybe each base is being assigned a numerical value. Let's see: A, T, C, G. What if each is a digit? Like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4? Or another mapping. Alternatively, maybe each base is converted into a two-digit number, like A=1, T=2, C=3, G=4, but that seems simple. Let me test.

Taking the first example: AGG. So A is 1, G is 4, another G is 4. If I sum them: 1 +4 +4 = 9. But the output is 115. So that's way off. So maybe it's not a simple sum.

Alternatively, perhaps each base is a digit in a number, but in a different base. Like base 10 or some other base. Hmm, wait, the outputs are 115 and 176, which are in base 10. So perhaps each base is mapped to a digit, and then the DNA string is treated as a number in a certain base, which is then converted to base 10.

Wait, let's think about that. Let's say each base represents a digit in a particular base. For example, if the base is 5, then each digit can be 0-4. But our bases are A, T, C, G, which are four, so maybe each is mapped to 0-3. Hmm, but then how would that fit into the examples?

Wait, let's get the first example: AGG. Suppose each letter is a digit in base 4:

A=0, T=1, C=2, G=3. Then AGG would be 0 3 3. So as a base-4 number, that's 0*4^2 +3*4^1 +3*4^0 = 0 +12 +3 =15. But the output is 115. Hmm, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the digits are in a different base. Let's think about the AGG example. The output is 115. Let me see what 115 in base 10 would be if it's a base-5 number.

Wait, maybe each base is mapped to a two-digit number, like A=10, T=20, C=30, G=40. Then adding those up: AGG would be 10 +40 +40 =90. Not matching 115. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe each base is converted into a single digit, and the entire string is considered a number in a
