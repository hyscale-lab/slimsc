Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about identifying an unknown organic compound using its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

The NMR data given is:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm. I remember that in NMR, the splitting and integration can give a lot of information about the structure. Let me try to break down each peak.

First, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet (d) with coupling J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant, which makes me think it's a trans coupling, like between two vinylic protons. Because typically, in trans double bonds, the coupling is larger than in cis. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, I think the coupling between protons across a double bond can be around 10-18 Hz. So a J of 16 Hz suggests a trans double bond. Because in cis, the protons are on the same side, so maybe the coupling isn't as large? Or is it the opposite? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For trans alkenes, the dihedral angle is around 180 degrees, which gives a larger coupling (since the coupling constant J is higher). So yes, J=16 Hz probably indicates a trans coupling, so a trans double bond.

Then, the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quartets (dq). That's a bit more complex. A doublet of quartets means it's split by two different sets of protons. Let me think about possible structures. Maybe this is a vinylic proton that's next to an adjacent CH2 or something else that's causing more splitting. Alternatively, maybe this proton is adjacent to a CH2 group which is next to another CH2 or something else. I'm not entirely sure yet, but let's keep that in mind.

The 2.1 ppm is a singlet integrating for 3H. That's probably a methyl group attached to something deshielded, like an ester. Because acetates have an ester group, like OAc. The methyl in acetate (like in ethyl acetate) is usually around 2.1 ppm and is a singlet because it's attached to an oxygen and not split by neighboring protons. So that makes sense. So I'm thinking this compound is an acetate ester with some propenyl or butenyl group.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet integrating for 3H. A doublet suggests it's next to a proton. So a methyl group attached to a CH2, perhaps. Or maybe it's a CH3 group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2 or something else.

Wait, so putting this together. The options are all propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Let me think about the structure of propenyl acetate. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH=CH2. Similarly, butenyl is longer, like CH2=CHCH2CH2- or similar.

Wait, but wait, the options are Cis and Trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates. So for propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2. For butenyl, it's between C2 and C3 (if it's 2-butenyl) or C3 and C4 (but that's less common, I think).

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a peak at 7.0 ppm as a doublet (J=16 Hz), which suggests a trans double bond. Because a
