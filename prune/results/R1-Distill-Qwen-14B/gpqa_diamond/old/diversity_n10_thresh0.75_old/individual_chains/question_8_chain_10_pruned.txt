Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about gene interactions in white lupine regarding resistance to anthracnose. We have three genes: G1, G2, and G3. Knocking them out gives us mutants g1, g2, g3, and double mutants g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The resistance levels are given, and we need to determine the gene interactions.

First, I remember that transcription factors are proteins that help turn on other genes. If a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it regulates won't be expressed. So, the phenotypes would depend on these interactions.

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, the mutant is less resistant than wild-type (which is 100%).
- g2: 0% resistance. That's super susceptible. So, the plant can't resist the disease at all when G2 is knocked out.
- g3: 50% resistance. So, halfway as resistant as the wild-type.
- Double mutants:
   - g1g3: 10% resistance. Even worse than g1 or g3 alone.
   - g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone.
   - g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone.

Hmm. Let's think about what this means. A double mutant showing the same phenotype as one of the single mutants suggests that one gene is epistatic over the other. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, for example, if G2 is epistatic over G1, then disrupting G2 would mask the effect of G1.

Looking at the double mutants where G2 is involved:

- g1g2: 0% resistance (same as g2). So, in the absence of G2, the effect of G1 doesn't matter. That suggests G2 is epistatic to G1. Because without G2, the plant's resistance is determined by whatever G2 does, which is not working.

Similarly, g2g3: 0% same as g2. So, G2's effect is epistatic over G3. So, when G2 is knocked out, G3's function doesn't contribute anything.

So, G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. That points to G2 being upstream of them. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, it could be activating the others. So, without G2, G1 and G3 can't function, leading to no resistance.

Now, looking at the single mutants:

g2 is 0% resistance, which is the most severe. So, G2 is probably a key gene, maybe a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.

g1 is at 75%, which is less than wild-type but not completely susceptible. Maybe G1 is part of the pathway, but not the main one. So when G1 is out, the resistance is only partially lost. But when G2 is out, it's completely gone, implying that G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly, g3 is 50% resistance. So, G3 is also contributing, but not as much as G2. Or maybe G3 is in a different pathway.

Wait, the double mutant g1g3 is 10%. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out, and the resistance is even lower than either single mutant. So, their contributions are additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because when both are out, the effect is worse than either alone. So, they don't function in the same pathway; if they were in the same, the double mutant would be the same as the more severe single mutant. But since it's worse, they must be in separate pathways contributing to resistance.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. From the data, G2 is the likely candidate for being the TF upstream because knocking it out completely abolishes resistance. So, G2 is the TF.

So, G2 is the transcription factor. The other genes, G1 and G3, are downstream. The double mutant g1g3 shows additive effects, which suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing some level of resistance. So, knocking out both leads to the lowest resistance.

But wait, another point: when you have g1g2, which is 0% resistance, same as g2. So, the effect of G1 is only felt in the presence of G2. So, G2 is upstream of G1.

Similarly
