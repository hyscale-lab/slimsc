Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a meson resonance, and I need to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, the specifics about mesons, like their decay, I think I should think about the concepts involved here.

The question gives me some data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance from the options provided.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that relates to how far the meson travels before it decays. The formula for the mean decay length, I think, involves the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime.

But wait, tau is the mean lifetime at rest, and gamma is the time dilation factor due to the particle's speed. So first I need to find gamma, then multiply by c and tau.

But how do I find tau? Oh, right, the width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the uncertainty principle. Γ is the total decay width, and the natural linewidth is Γ, which gives the uncertainty in energy, related to the lifetime via Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. So Γ ≈ ħ / tau, which gives tau ≈ ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me get that right. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2. For a resonance, the decay width Γ is like the inverse of the lifetime. So the relation is Γ ≈ ħ / (tau), but I think it's actually Γ = ħ / (tau), more or less. So tau = ħ / (Γ). Or wait, sometimes it's written as Γ = ħ * (1/tau), so tau = ħ/(Γ). Yeah, that seems right.

So the steps are:
1. Calculate the Lorentz factor gamma.
2. Calculate the proper lifetime tau = ħ / Γ.
3. Multiply gamma by c (speed of light) times tau to get the mean decay distance L.

Let me break down each step.

First, gamma. Gamma is E/(m c²), right? Because E is the total energy, which is gamma m c squared. So
