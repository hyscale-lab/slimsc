Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on electromagnetism, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, right? And the symmetry axis is along the z-axis. Since it's oscillating, it must radiate energy, and the wavelength is lambda. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle, which is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The problem gives that the maximum power is A. So I need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of function f.

Wait, okay, so the first part is about the fraction of the maximum power at a specific angle. The second part is about the dependence of f on lambda and theta.

I remember that when a dipole radiates, the power radiated is proportional to the square of the acceleration, and the direction of the radiation has a certain angular dependence. But wait, this isn't just a dipole; it's a spheroid, which I think implies it's a dipole-like distribution but maybe more general.

Wait, in dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle (like the radiation pattern) depends on the angle theta. The maximum occurs at particular angles. For a dipole, I think the radiation pattern is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis, so theta = 90 degrees. But wait, no, wait—that's the direction of the radiation's maximum. Wait, no, in dipole radiation, the power is maximum when theta is 90 degrees, because the radiation is most intense perpendicular to the dipole's axis.

Wait, but the question here is about the maximum power A. So if the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, then at theta=30 degrees, the power would be less than A. But the question is, what fraction is that?

Wait, the function f(theta) gives the power per unit solid angle at each angle. So the maximum of f(theta) would be at theta_max, which is either 90 degrees or maybe another angle depending on the dipole.

Wait, but in dipole radiation, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sin theta)^2 or something like that. Wait, I think the formula for the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is (p^2 omega^4)/(something epsilon_0 c^3) multiplied by (1/2)(1 + cos^2 theta). No wait, is it (sin^2 theta) or (1 + cos^2 theta)? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the dipole radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) has the intensity varying as I(theta) = I_0 (1 + cos^2 theta). So the maximum intensity is at theta = 90 degrees, since cos(theta) is zero, so 1 + 0 = 1. Wait, no: cos(90) is 0, so 1 + 0 =1. But at theta = 0, cos(theta) is 1, so 1 + 1 = 2. Wait wait, that can't be right because that would suggest maximum intensity at theta=0, but I thought dipoles have their maximum at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me recall: the dipole radiation pattern for the intensity is maximum when sin(theta) is maximum. Or wait, perhaps the radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole, so theta=90 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, the formula I think is I(theta) = I_0 sin^2(theta) for something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at theta=90 degrees, and it's proportional to (sin theta)^2. Wait, that might be for a different scenario.

Wait, no, wait. The far-field radiation for an oscillating dipole has an intensity that varies as (1 + cos^2 theta). So the intensity is maximum when cos theta is ±1, which is theta=0 or 180 degrees. Wait, that can't be right because a dipole shouldn't radiate more along its axis. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, maybe it's (1 + cos^2 theta) but scaled so that the maximum is at theta=90 degrees. Wait, but (1 + cos^2 theta) is maximum at theta=0 or 180, where cos theta is 1 or -1, so cos^2 theta is 1. So the intensity would be 2 in those cases, and 1 at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because that would imply higher intensity along the axis, which contradicts what I remember. I think I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the correct expression is (sin^2 theta). So when theta is 90 degrees, sin theta is 1, so maximum.

Wait, another approach: The dipole's radiation pattern for E and B fields are such that the fields fall as 1/r, and the intensity (which is E squared over impedance) would fall as 1/r^2. Wait, but the question is about the shape of the function f, which is power per unit solid angle. So solid angle is dOmega = sin theta dtheta dphi.

Wait, the intensity in dipole radiation is proportional to sin^2 theta. Because the radiation is most intense perpendicular to the dipole axis. So the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees, where sin theta is 1.

Wait, but in that case, the intensity at theta=30 degrees would be sin^2(30) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the intensity is a quarter of the maximum intensity. But wait, the maximum intensity is at theta=90, which would be 1. So the fraction would be 0.25, or 1/4. So if the maximum power is A, then the fraction at theta=30 would be A * (0.25) / A_max? Wait, no, because A is the maximum power—so if at theta=90, the power is A, then at theta=30, it would be (1/4) A.

Wait, but wait a second. The function f is the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity. So f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta. The maximum value of f(theta) is when sin theta is 1, so f_max = f(90) = some constant. Then, the total power is the integral of f(theta) over the solid angle. But the maximum power A is f_max multiplied by the solid angle where it's maximum, but no, wait, because power per unit solid angle multiplied by dOmega gives the power in that direction. But when you integrate over all solid angles, you get the total power.

Wait, no, wait. The maximum power radiated in any direction is A. So the maximum of f(theta) is A, because at the direction where f(theta) is maximum, the power per unit solid angle is A (since when you multiply by a small solid angle, that's the power in that direction). Therefore, the maximum of f(theta) is A, and at other angles, it's lower.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the total power is the integral of f(theta) over all solid angles. So if f(theta) has a maximum at theta=90, say, that value multiplied by the solid angle around that point could give the total power. But the problem states that the maximum power is A. So the maximum value of f(theta) is A, and at other angles, it's less than A.

So, if the function f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta, then at theta=30 degrees, f(30) is (sin 30)^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the fraction would be 0.25 of the maximum. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now, checking the options:

Option C says 1/4, lambda^-4. Option B is 1/4, lambda^-3. Option A is 1/2, lambda^-4.

Wait, but what about the dependence on lambda?

The function f is a function of lambda and theta. So what's the dependence of f on lambda? For dipole radiation, the power radiated is proportional to (omega^4), and omega is related to the frequency, which in turn relates to the wavelength lambda by lambda = c / f, or lambda = 2 pi c / omega. So omega = 2 pi c / lambda.

Thus, omega^4 is (2 pi c / lambda)^4 = (c^4 / lambda^4) * (2 pi)^4.

So the power f(theta) would depend on omega^4, which is lambda^-4. So f(theta) is proportional to lambda^-4. So looking at the options, which have lambda^-4.

Option A: 1/2, lambda^-4. Option C: 1/4, lambda^-4.

Earlier, we thought the fraction is 1/4, so option C would match that: 1/4 and lambda^-4.

Wait, but another thought: is the maximum power A the same as the maximum of f(theta) multiplied by the solid angle? No, because f(theta) is power per unit solid angle, and the maximum in any direction is when you multiply f(theta) by dOmega, which is sin theta dtheta dphi. But the maximum power is the maximum value of f(theta), because at theta where f(theta) is maximum, any small solid angle around that point contributes f(theta) * dOmega. But the maximum possible is when you take the maximum f(theta). So the maximum power A is f_max, the maximum of f(theta).

So if f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta, then f(theta) = k sin^2 theta, and k is the proportionality factor. At theta=90 degrees, sin theta=1, so f(90)=k = A. Therefore, at theta=30, f(30)=k*(1/4) = A/4. So the fraction is (A/4) / A = 1/4.

So the fraction is 1/4, and the function's dependence is lambda^-4. So the correct option is C: 1/4, lambda^-4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4, lambda^-4. So the answer should be option C.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution radiating power, with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. The radiated power per unit solid angle, denoted as \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), depends on the wavelength \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the functional dependence of \( f \) on \(\lambda\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Angular Dependence of Power**:  
   For dipole radiation, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). This means the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole axis (\(\theta = 90^\circ\)) and weaker along the axis (\(\theta = 0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\)). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), the power per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength**:  
   The radiated power is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega\) is the angular frequency. Since \(\omega = \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda}\), it follows that \(\omega^4 \propto \lambda^{-4}\). Therefore, the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) depends on \(\lambda\) as \(\lambda^{-4}\).

3. **Matching the Options**:  
   - Option A: \( \frac{1}{2}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( \frac{1}{4} \), not \( \frac{1}{2} \).  
   - Option B: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-3} \) — Incorrect, as the dependence is \(\lambda^{-4}\), not \(\lambda^{-3}\).  
   - Option C: \( \frac{1}{4}, \lambda^{-4} \) — Correct, as it matches both the fraction and the wavelength dependence.  
   - Option D: \( \frac{3}{4}, \lambda^{-6} \) — Incorrect, as the fraction is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the dependence is not \(\lambda^{-6}\).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the function \( f \) depends on \(\lambda\) as \(\lambda^{-4}\). The correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
