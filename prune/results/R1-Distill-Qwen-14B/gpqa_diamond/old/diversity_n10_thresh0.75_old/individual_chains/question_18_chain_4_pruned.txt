Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about elemental abundances in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a certain mass compared to the Sun, and their elemental ratios are given. The goal is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

Let me start by listing what I know. The problem states:

- Star_1 has a mass 1.5 times the Sun.
- Star_2 has a mass 1.2 times the Sun.
- For Star_1: [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.
- For Star_2: [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.
- The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7.

Hmm, wait, so the Sun's values are given as 12 plus the log of the ratio equals 7.5 for Fe and 7 for Mg. That must mean that the actual log values are 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 for Fe, and -5 for Mg? Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe not. Oh wait, the notation is a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, the standard notation for [X/Y] is log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Oh right, the [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y particles relative to the Sun. So for example, [Fe/H] is the log of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, that means the star has the same Fe abundance as the Sun.

Wait, but in the question, they use [Fe/H]_1 and [Mg/H]_2. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, meaning its Fe abundance is the same as the Sun. Similarly, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Star_2's Mg abundance is the same as the Sun's.

But wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So I need to find [Si/Star_1] and [Si/Star_2], then find the ratio of their silicon abundances.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this by first figuring out the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, and then take the ratio of those.

Let me think. For Star_1:

Given [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the log of (n_Si / n_Fe) in Star_1 minus the same ratio in the Sun is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_star - log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

But wait, I am a bit confused about the [X/Y] notation
