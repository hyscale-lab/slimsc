Okay, so I'm looking at this nuclear decay problem, and I need to figure out how the energy spectrum of the E particles changes when the decay variant emits a different set of particles. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The original reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. I know that in such decay processes, especially beta decay, when particles like electrons (or in this case, E and V) are emitted, their energy spectrum is continuous. That makes sense because the emitted particles can have a range of energies, depending on how the energy is divided between them. The maximum energy they can have is determined by the Q value of the reaction, which is the total energy released.

In the original case, two E particles and two V particles are emitted. So each E and V would share the available energy. The E particles' spectrum is continuous with some endpoint Q. I'm guessing Q is the maximum energy each E can have when the others (like the other E and the Vs) get minimal energy.

Now, the variant changes things: instead of 2V, it emits one M particle. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Wait, but M is massless and exotic. Hmm. So the outgoing particles are two Es and one M. Oh wait, wait, looking back, the original emitted 2E and 2V, so the variant emits 2E and 1M? Or is it 2E and 2M? No, the question says the variant emits one M instead of 2V. So in the variant, the products are 2B, 2E, and 1M? Or maybe 2B, 2E, and 2M? Wait, no, the original is 2E and 2V. The variant is 2E and M? No, the problem states "instead of the 2V," so 2E and M? Or wait, let me re-read.

Wait, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The variant emits one M instead of the 2V. So the reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. Because 2V are replaced by M. So the products are 2B, 2E, and M.

Wait, but how many particles are emitted? Originally, 2E and 2V. Now, instead of the 2V, it's 1 M. So the variant is 2E and 1M. So now, the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

Now, considering that M is massless. Oh, because it says M is massless. So M's rest mass is zero. So M would behave like a photon, perhaps, or a massless boson. But that's probably not super relevant here.

In the original decay, the 2E and 2V particles are emitted. Since E and V are lighter, perhaps they are charged leptons or something, but the exact type may not matter. What's important is their masses.

The original scenario
