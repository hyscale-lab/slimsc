Okay, let's tackle this organic chemistry problem. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions leading to a final product, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. 

Alright, let's break it down step by step. First, I'll try to understand each reaction and figure out what the structures look like.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a norbornene structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the structure is a norbornene ring with an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group attached to one of the bridgeheads.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, and the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. So this looks like a Diels-Alder reaction setup. Wait, but wait, another possibility is that the cyclohexadiene is acting as a diene, and the starting material has a dienophile.

Wait, norbornene is a dienophile. So, the starting compound could be the dienophile. The other compound, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, has two dibromomethyl groups. So each of those substituents is a Br2CH2 group. 

Wait, when you have a dienophile (like norbornene) reacting with a diene, in a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (the cyclohexadiene here) would add to the dienophile. But wait, in this case, the diene is a cyclohexadiene with two leaving groups. Hmm, perhaps not a Diels-Alder. Alternatively, perhaps it's an example of cycloaddition with another process.

Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or a [4+2] cycloaddition. Wait, but let me think again. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. So the bicyclo structure has two double bonds, but usually, norbornene has one double bond. Wait, no. Wait, the name is hepta-2,5-diene, so two double bonds? Wait, no, wait: bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a structure with one double bond, but the name here is hepta-2,5-diene, which has two double bonds. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. So, perhaps it's a norbornene derivative with two double bonds, but I might need to visualize it.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is a norbornene derivative with one double bond, but I think I'm getting stuck on that. Let me think of the first reaction. The starting material is treated with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI. So, NaI is a source of iodide ions. The dibromomethyl groups are good leaving groups because Br is electronegative and the leaving groups are in a good position.

So, the reaction between the starting material and the cyclohexadiene with two dibromomethyl groups. Maybe it's an alkylation reaction? The starting material has an oxygen substituent, which is a good nucleophile, but perhaps the cyclohexadiene's substituents are leaving groups, so maybe this is a substitution reaction.

Wait, each of the cyclohexadiene's substituents is a dibromomethyl group. So, each is a CH2Br2 group. Hmm, but CH2Br2 is a good leaving group because when the Br leaves, it can take a pair of electrons with it, but wait, CH2Br2 is not a great leaving group on its own. Alternatively, the presence of sodium iodide would cause an SN2 reaction, where the iodide replaces Br. Wait, but each substituent is CH2Br2, but each Br is on a carbon adjacent to the cyclohexene ring. So, perhaps the cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups at positions 5 and 6.

Wait, maybe the reaction is more about dehydrohalogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a dienophile, and the other molecule is the diene. So, the diene is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the cyclohexadiene has two double bonds? Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two double bonds? No, it's a conjugated diene. So, 1,3-diene is a four-carbon conjugated system. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene would be a 6-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, but that's not possible because 1,3 double bonds in a ring would cause some strain. Wait, perhaps it's a 1,3-diene in a 6-membered ring, but that's a bit unusual. But perhaps the structure is correct.

So, the cyclohexadiene has two substituents (at positions 5 and 6) which are CH2Br2 groups. And in the reaction, the starting material (norbornene analog) is combined with two equivalents of this. So, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur.

Wait, the starting material is a dienophile, and the cyclohexadiene is a diene. Wait, but if the starting material is a bicyclo system with two double bonds
