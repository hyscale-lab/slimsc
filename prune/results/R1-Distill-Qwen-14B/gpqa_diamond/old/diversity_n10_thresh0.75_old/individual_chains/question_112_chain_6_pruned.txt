Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. First, the problem says that there's an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the spin-z operator, so they form an orthonormal basis.

The first part asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of some operator A. The matrix representation of A is given as Aij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles, I think. So for a 2x2 matrix, the elements are A_12 = A_21 = hbar/2, and the diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. If i is not equal to j, then Aij is hbar/2. So the matrix should look like:

[ 0    hbar/2
  hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, but that's an anti-diagonal matrix. Hmm, what operator has such a matrix? Oh, wait a second, the spin-x operator has a matrix representation that looks like [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]], doesn't it? So I think operator A is the spin-x operator. But wait, the spin-x operator usually has eigenstates that are the same as the eigenstates of the spin-x observable. So when you measure spin-x, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues.

Wait, but the question is a bit different. It's asking about the eigenstates of this operator A. So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of spin-x. Because the matrix A is the same as spin-x's matrix. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x> or something like that.

But what's the problem asking? It says to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. So that means, given the state |alpha>, what's the probability that a measurement of A (which is same as spin-x) yields each of its eigenvalues. But wait, since A is the spin-x operator, the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, but the probabilities will depend on the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the spin-x eigenstates.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to find the eigenvectors of A. Let me think. The operator A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation: determinant(A - λI) = 0.

So the matrix A - λI is [[-λ, ħ/2], [ħ/2, -λ]]. The determinant is λ² - (ħ²/4) = 0. So λ² = ħ²/4 → λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, as expected.

The eigenvectors for each eigenvalue can be found by solving (A - λI)|v> = 0.

For λ = ħ/2:

The matrix becomes [ [-ħ/2, ħ/2 ], [ħ/2, -ħ/2 ] ]

Equation: (-ħ/2) v1 + (ħ/2) v2 = 0 → v1 = v2. So the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1, 1). Or normalized,
