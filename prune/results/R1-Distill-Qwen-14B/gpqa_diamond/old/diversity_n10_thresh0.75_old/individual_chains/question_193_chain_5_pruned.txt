Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance somehow. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance, but I'm not sure about the exact units here. Oh wait, distance is usually in parsecs when using parallax in arcseconds. So plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs.

So the problem is about how the number of stars changes with distance. The question is asking about the number of stars per unit range of distance—so like, how does N change as r (distance) changes.

Let me break this down. The number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) → which is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So as d increases, N increases as d^5. But wait, the options give different dependencies. Wait, but wait, the question is per unit range of distance. Oh, right, so the number density in a range dr. Or maybe it's about the differential number of stars with distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a shell of radius r to r+dr. So the number of stars in a thin shell would be proportional to the surface area times the volume element or something like that. Hmm, maybe I need to relate the number of stars to distance.

Wait, but in this case, the given relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. So plugging in plx = 1/d, so N ∝ d^5. So if d increases, N increases as d^5. But that's the total number up to that distance. Wait, no, maybe. Or is it the number per unit distance?

Wait, let me think again. The way the question is phrased: the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So for a given parallax, the number is inversely proportional
