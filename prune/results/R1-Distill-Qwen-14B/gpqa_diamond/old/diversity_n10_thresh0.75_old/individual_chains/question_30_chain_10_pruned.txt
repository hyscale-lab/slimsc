Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color it absorbs.

Wait, does that mean the dye absorbs the complementary color? I think it's about the energy difference. When a substance absorbs light, it gets excited, and then it emits light when it relaxes. So the energy of the emitted light is less than the absorbed, right? No, wait, waitâ€”actually, the energy emitted is usually lower than the absorbed. Because the absorbed energy causes an electron to jump to a higher energy level, and when it drops back, it emits a photon with lower energy.

But wait, the question is about what color is absorbed. Oh wait, maybe I got that wrong. The problem says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the compound must absorb higher energy light and emit lower energy? Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no. Let me think again. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoted from a lower energy level to a higher one. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. The energy of the emitted photon depends on the energy difference between the levels. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one.

So, if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy must be higher than that. Because the absorbed energy is E_absorb = E_emit + E_exc
