Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking what the energy should be so that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X is. Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, then the atomic number is 3 (protons) and the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So, it's Li-6. So, the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, which I think means it's a charged particle, maybe a singly charged ion? Or perhaps a heavier ion, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Oh wait, the problem says it's a nucleus, so maybe it's a bare nucleus, so the charge would be +3e since Li has 3 protons. But for relativistic calculations, perhaps the charge isn't directly relevant except for things like magnetic interactions, but not the energy here.

So the main point is that the speed v is 0.96c. I need to find the total energy of the nucleus in the collider. I remember that in relativity, the total energy E is given by gamma times the rest mass energy, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The formula for gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.96c, let me calculate that. So v² would be (0.96c)^2 = 0.9216 c². So v²/c² is 0.9216. Then 1 - that is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... wait, 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me do that math more accurately. 0.28 times 3.5714 is 1, right? Because 0.28 * 3.5714 ≈ 1. So yes, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let me think: 0.0784 is the number under the square root. Hmm, what's the square root of 0.0784 exactly. Let me compute that. Well, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yes, that's correct. So gamma is 1/0.28 = approximately 3.57142857.

Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of the nucleus is the rest mass multiplied by c squared. But since we're dealing with GeV, and the rest mass is in atomic mass units (u), I should convert it into GeV.

Wait, what's
