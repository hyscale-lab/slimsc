Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, let's read the problem again.

So, the system's state at time t is given as the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, but in quantum states, the components should be complex numbers, right? Or does this mean I'm looking at it in a different context, maybe vectors in a vector space rather than state vectors? Hmm, but the operators are matrices, so perhaps it's about linear algebra rather than quantum mechanics per se.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. The problem says that someone measures Q just after measuring P. We need to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, so the order is important. First measure P, then measure Q. So I think I need to find the probability that when measuring P first, we get 0, and then when measuring Q on the resulting state, we get -1.

Wait, but when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So the process would be: measure P, get 0, so
