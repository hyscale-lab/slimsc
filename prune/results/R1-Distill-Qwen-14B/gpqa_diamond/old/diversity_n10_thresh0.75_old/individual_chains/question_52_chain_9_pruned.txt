Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and understanding what it's asking.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. Without any star spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by dark spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500K. The question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changesâ€”comparing when there are no spots to when there are spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), the number of atoms in different energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this case, the star's overall temperature changes when spots are present. So the temperature affects the ionization state and the excitation states of the atoms. Let me think about how these factors come into play.

First, the effective temperature drops when spots are present. The effective temperature is a measure of the average radiation from the star's surface. But when a star has spots, those regions are cooler, causing the average Teff to decrease.

Now, the problem says that when there are spots, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500K. So I need to compare the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels under 6000K and 5500K.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So the ionization state might affect the number of neutral atoms. But the transition in question is between two energy levels of neutral Ti, right? Because it's about neutral atoms.

So the presence of spots
