Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons with the same energy. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, so first, let me recap what I know. Electrons and positrons are particles with equal and opposite charges. When they annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. The photons are produced in opposite directions, but in this case, the problem says one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So, both are going to the right? Wait, noâ€”that doesn't make sense because if they annihilate, the total momentum should be conserved. Wait, the initial particles are moving along the horizontal axis, but in opposite directions. So their momenta are opposite.

Wait, the problem says the electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. So their initial momenta are opposite. Let's see. Since the electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has a Lorentz factor of 2. Lorentz factors are gamma, right. So gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron.

Wait, the positron is the anti-particle of the electron, so it has the same mass. So both have the same rest mass, m. But their momenta depend on their velocities and gamma factors.

So, the electron's momentum would be p_e = gamma_e * m * v_e. Similarly, the positron's momentum p_p = gamma_p * m * v_p. But wait, the direction matters. The electron is moving to the right (from left), the positron to the left (from right), so their momenta are opposite. So the total initial momentum is p_e (to the right) plus p_p (to the left) because the positron is moving left. Wait, no. Wait: if the positron is moving from the right, that means it's moving towards the left, same as the electron is moving to the right. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but the problem says both are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from left to right, and the positron from right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total initial momentum would
