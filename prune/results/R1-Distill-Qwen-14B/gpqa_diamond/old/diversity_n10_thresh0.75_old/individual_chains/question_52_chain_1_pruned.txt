Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the factor by which the ratio of Ti neutral atoms in two energy levels changes when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the star's effective temperature (Teff) changes when spots are present. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% of the surface is covered, it drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, actually, when spots are present, the overall Teff decreases? Or does the presence of spots lower the observed temperature because the spots are cooler? Oh right, the spots are darker, meaning they're cooler regions, so when a significant portion is covered, the star's overall emission decreases, leading to a lower observed Teff.

But the question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. The ratio is given as decreasing when the star has spots. Wait, why would that happen? Oh, because the ratio depends on the temperature. Let me think about the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation relates the number of particles in two energy levels. The ratio N1/N2 is proportional to (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet range. Hmm, wait, but that's the emitted wavelength when electrons transition between these levels. So E2 - E1 is the energy difference corresponding to that photon.

Wait, no, the energy difference between the two levels would be E = hc/λ, right? Let me compute that. But maybe I don't need the exact value yet.

So the ratio of the number of atoms in level 1 to level 2 is N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, no, wait. The exponent is negative because higher energy states have fewer particles. So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since E2 > E1 (
