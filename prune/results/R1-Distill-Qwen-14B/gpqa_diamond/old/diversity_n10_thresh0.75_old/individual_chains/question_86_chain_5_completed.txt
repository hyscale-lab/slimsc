Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The products from both reactions are (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. The question is asking which starting materials (A and B) are correct when treated with LiBH4 and BH3 in acidic conditions.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. BH3, when used in certain conditions like with THF and then acid workup (like BH3·THF), is used for the hydroboration-oxidation reactions. Wait, but wait—BH3 alone might not be enough. Oh right, BH3 is often used in the formation of boranes, which can then be used in other reactions. But wait, in some cases, BH3 can be used with other conditions. Or is it more about the type of reduction?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Oh, wait! Oh, maybe this has to do with the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols. But LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol. But wait, wait—what about when the carbonyl is part of a cyclic structure, like a cyclic ketone?

Wait, no, looking at the product, it's a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group on carbon 2, and an ethyl group on carbon 4.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are something that when reduced give this product. So, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or an acetal, and the reduction process is opening it up.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps the starting material is an acetal or a ketal. Because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce certain protecting groups.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the reagents. So, for reaction A, the reagent is LiBH4 followed by H+. For reaction B, it's BH3 followed by H+.

Wait, BH3 is a borane, and when it's used with THF (which I think is the case here, even though it's not written), then it's used in hydroboration reactions. But when BH3 is used with something else, like maybe in a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe this is a reduction.

Wait, wait a second. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters, amides, and other groups. But if the starting material is an ester, then LiBH4 might reduce it. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an acetal or ketal.

Wait, another thought: the product is a cyclic ketone. So maybe the starting material is an acetal or a ketal, which upon reduction gives the ketone. Because LiBH4 can reduce some acetal groups. Wait, but I thought that LiAlH4 is typically used for that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe these are cyclic acetals. Let me recall: an acetal is a protecting group for a carbonyl. So, when you reduce an acetal, you get the carbonyl back. But wait, usually, that's done with strong acids, not with LiBH4. Or maybe some other conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and the reactions are removing the ketal group.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are diethyl acetal-protected ketones. When you reduce them with LiBH4, maybe the ketal is hydrolyzed to give the ketone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is more of a reducing agent for carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the LiBH4 is reducing the ester to an alcohol. But then the product would be an alcohol, not a ketone. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are ketals, and when treated with LiBH4, the ketal is opened, giving a diol, which upon acid workup could form a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this from the wrong angle. Let me think about the products. The product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one with an ethyl group. So the structure is a six-membered ring (pyran), with a ketone on C2 and an ethyl on C4.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. For example, if you have a ketone that's protected as a diethyl acetal, then when you reduce it, you get the ketone back.

Wait, but then how does the reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 work here? Because LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but not sure if it can reduce acetals. Or maybe under acidic conditions, the acetal is hydrolyzed to the ketone, which then is reduced further. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the product is a ketone, not an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, which upon reduction would give a diol. But the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting materials are cyclic hemiacetals. When treated with reducing agents, they get converted into the corresponding alcohols. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are gamma or delta lactones. When they are reduced, they open up to form diols, which then cyclize again under certain conditions. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are acetals of ketones, and the reagents are causing their cleavage. Let's think: Acetals are formed from ketones and diols. If you have an acetal, and you cleave it under acidic conditions, you get back the ketone.

But in this case, the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3 with H+. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong base, but BH3 is a Lewis acid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the situation is that the starting materials are alpha-hydroxy esters or something. When you reduce them, you get diols, which can form cyclic ketones? I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product structure again. It's 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a six-membered ring with a ketone on C2 and an ethyl group on C4. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C1 - C2 (with a ketone), then C3, C4 (with ethyl), C5, C6, and back to C1.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. For example, the starting material could be a diethyl acetal of a ketone. So, for example, if the starting material is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is an acetal, then upon treatment with a reducing agent, perhaps the acetal is cleaved, and the ketone is released.

Wait, but the product is a cyclic ketone, not a linear one. So maybe the starting material is an acetal of a gamma-keto ester or something that would form a six-membered ring upon opening.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. For reaction A, LiBH4 is used, which is a strong reducing agent. For reaction B, BH3 is used, which is more of a Lewis acid and used in hydroboration reactions.

Wait a second, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and when reduced, they form the corresponding alcohols. But then the product would be a diol, not a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones), and upon reduction, the ester is converted into an alcohol, which could rearrange into a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals or ketal ethers, and when treated with LiBH4, which can reduce some acetals, you get the ketone back.

Wait, I think I might be on to something here. Let me think: LiBH4 can reduce certain protecting groups. For example, it can reduce silyl ethers, but I'm not sure about acetals.

Wait, another thought: the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and the reducing agents are cleaving them. The product is a ketone, so perhaps the reduction is causing the cleavage of the acetal, releasing the ketone.

Wait, but how does that work? Acetals are usually stable under basic conditions but can be cleaved under acidic conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent but also acts as a base. So maybe under the conditions of LiBH4, the acetal is not cleaved because it's not acidic enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-hydroxy esters. When treated with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, and the hydroxyl group could form a cyclic hemiacetal.

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Let me think about the options given. The options for A and B are all (R) or (S) forms of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, that's a mouthful. So the structure is pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 5, there's an isobutoxy group and an oxo (keto) group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2CO-CH(CH2CH3)-O-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH

Wait, no, let me parse it correctly. 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. Wait, no: pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. But the substituents are at positions 3 and 5.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH?

Wait, no, let me get it right. Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4, 5 (end).

Wait no, wait. Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the chain is five carbons, with the COOH on C1.

So for 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, the substituents are on C3 and C5.

So carbon 3 has an ethyl group, carbon 5 has an isobutoxy and an oxo group.

Wait, but wait, pentanoic acid has five carbons, so substituents on 3 and 5 can't both be attached because 3 is in the middle. Wait, that's confusing. Let me think:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, no. Wait, the main chain is five carbons, with the COOH on C1.

So:

C1: COOH
C2: CH2
C3: CH(CH2CH3)
C4: C(O)
C5: OCH(CH2CH3)

But wait, that's not possible because C4 would be the fourth carbon, so the fifth would be an oxygen, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, another approach: 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo suggests that at position 5, there's both an oxo group (a ketone) and an isobutoxy group. But that's impossible unless it's a geminal di-substitution, which isn't possible in normal organic compounds. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misnaming the structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclic structure. Or perhaps it's a keto group and an ether group attached to the same carbon. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are on adjacent carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

Position 3: ethyl group,
Position 5: both isobutoxy and oxo.

Wait, but how can a carbon have both an oxo (keto) and an isobutoxy group? That would require two substituents on the same carbon, which is possible only if the carbon is a quaternary center.

Ah, so the structure would be:

At carbon 5, it's a carbon connected to an oxygen (from the isobutoxy group) and a ketone (O). Wait, but that's not possible because a ketone is a carbonyl group, which is a double-bonded oxygen. So perhaps the structure is:

The chain is:

COOH (C1) – CH2 (C2) – CH(CH2CH3) (C3) – C(O) (C4) – O-CH(CH2CH3) (C5)

Wait, but that would make the chain five carbons, with substituents on C3 and C5. Hmm, but then C5 would be the end, so it can't have a substituent unless it's a branching point.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw it out mentally.

Pentanoic acid: CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH.

In the given compound, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So position 3 has an ethyl group. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, but that can't be right because the chain would be longer than pentanoic acid. Wait, perhaps I'm not counting correctly.

Wait, maybe the compound is:

CH2(COOH)-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)

Wait, but that would be a five-membered chain, with the COOH on the first carbon, an ethyl on third, and the 5th carbon having both a carbonyl and an isobutoxy group. But that doesn't make sense because a single carbon can't have both a carbonyl and an ether oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-pentan-5-one acid. So the acid is at position 1, the ethyl at 3, and the ketone at 5, which also has an isobutoxy group. But that would require the same carbon having two groups, which is possible if it's a cyclic structure.

Wait, perhaps the compound is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's a gamma-keto ester.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto acid, which upon reduction would form a secondary alcohol.

But how does that tie into the product being a cyclic ketone?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal. Let me think: a cyclic ketal would form from a diol and a ketone. So when you reduce a cyclic ketal, what happens? I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: The product is a cyclic hemiacetal of a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of the ketone. Then, when treated with LiBH4, which is a strong reducing agent, it would reduce the acetal to the ketone.

Wait, but acetals are usually stable under reducing conditions. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers: (R) and (S) forms of the same compound. So the starting materials must have opposite configurations, leading to the two different products.

Wait, so when you reduce a chiral center, the configuration of the new chiral center depends on the reagent and the reaction conditions. For example, in hydroboration-oxidation, the boron adds to the less substituted end, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition, and the stereochemistry is determined by the BH3 addition.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So maybe that's not the right path.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic acetals, and the reduction leads to the formation of a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone via acid workup.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Let me think about the options.

The options are all about whether A and B are (R) or (S) configurations of the same starting material. So perhaps A and B are the same compound but with opposite configurations, leading to different products upon reduction.

Wait, but why would the same starting material (same configuration) give different products when treated with different reducing agents? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are different enantiomers, and the reducing agents lead to different products.

Wait, but the options have A and B as the same or different. Looking at the options:

Option C has A as (S) and B as (R). Option D has A as (R) and B as (S). So perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause the products to be enantiomers as well.

Wait, but how? Let me think about what each reagent does. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, perhaps used to reduce esters to alcohols. BH3 is used in hydroboration, which adds boron to the less substituted end of a double bond, leading to anti-Markovnikov addition.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is a ketone, so they're not adding boron to a double bond. So perhaps the starting materials are gamma-lactones or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and the reducing agents cleave them to form the ketone.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters and amides, but I don't think it reduces ketals. So maybe BH3 is used in a different way.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not about reducing the starting material but about some other transformation. Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, and the reducing agents reduce the ester to an alcohol, leading to a ring formation.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic hemiacetal of a diol, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diethyl acetals of ketones. When treated with LiBH4, perhaps the acetal is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions to form the ketone. But LiBH4 is a base, so maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones), and upon reduction, they form diols, which then cyclize to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me try to think about the reaction conditions.

In reaction A, the reagent is LiBH4 and H+. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce esters, ketones, amides, etc. When used with H+, perhaps it's an acidic workup.

In reaction B, the reagent is BH3 and H+. Hmm, BH3 is typically used in hydroboration reactions, but when used as a reducing agent, it might not be the same as LiBH4.

Wait, wait, I think I remember that BH3 can be used in the reduction of ketones to alcohols, but it's not as strong as LiBH4. Wait, no, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3. So, perhaps that's the key here.

Wait, the starting material is an ester. LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol. But then, how does that form a cyclic ketone?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. When you reduce a lactone with LiBH4, you get a diol. The diol could then form a cyclic hemiacetal, which under certain conditions could form a ketone.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal, and upon reduction, the ketal is opened to form a diol, which then is oxidized, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction with LiBH4 forms the corresponding diol, which then could form a cyclic ketone under acid conditions.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the products. The product from A is (R), and from B is (S). So the starting materials must have opposite configurations to produce enantiomeric products.

Wait, but why would different reducing agents affect the stereochemistry of the product? LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is a Lewis acid.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are not the same. Maybe they are different enantiomers.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says A is (R) and B is (S) of the same compound. So perhaps when A is treated with LiBH4, it produces the R product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces the S product.

Wait, but why would the configuration of the starting material affect the configuration of the product in this way?

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents cause the products to form with opposite configurations.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are epimers, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a reduction but an oxidation, but that doesn't fit with the reagents given.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I can think of the starting materials as being diethyl acetals of a ketone. The product is the ketone. So when the acetal is cleaved, the ketone is released.

But how does LiBH4 and BH3 fit into this? Because acetals are typically cleaved under acidic conditions, not with reducing agents.

Wait, but let's say the starting material is an acetal. When LiBH4 is added, perhaps it doesn't cleave the acetal. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters. When you reduce an alpha-keto ester with LiBH4, you might get an alcohol, which could then form a cyclic structure.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me take another approach.

The product is a cyclic ketone: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with the ketone on C2 and an ethyl on C4.

The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid in some configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal, and when reduced, it forms the ketone.

Wait, but how? Let me think: 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo would imply that on carbon 5, there's both an oxygen from the isobutoxy group and a ketone. That seems impossible unless it's a cyclic structure.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an ethyl substituent and an isobutoxy group. Upon reduction, the ester is converted into an alcohol, which could then form the cyclic ketone through some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the gamma-keto group could rearrange into a ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, which upon reduction forms a diol that can form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the options again.

The options are all about the configuration of the starting materials. So perhaps the correct answer is that A is (R) and B is (S), or vice versa.

Let me think about the reaction conditions. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and BH3 is a milder one. So perhaps the stereochemistry of the product depends on the reagent used.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone, not an alcohol. So perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reduction is converting them into alcohols, which then form the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones), and the reduction opens them to form diols, which then cyclize into the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ketals, and the reducing agents break the acetal to form the ketone.

Wait, but then the product would be a ketone, which is the same as the starting material. Hmm.

I think I need to find a different approach. Let me think about the synthesis of the product. The product is a cyclic ketone. So, perhaps it's formed via a ring-forming process.

Wait, another possibility: The starting materials are diethyl acetals of a ketone, and the reduction with LiBH4 or BH3 cleaves the acetal to form the ketone. But I'm not sure if LiBH4 can do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, and LiBH4 reduces the ester to an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, but in that case, the stereochemistry of the product would depend on the starting material's configuration. So if the starting material is (R), the product would be (R), and if the starting material is (S), the product would be (S).

Wait, but how does the configuration of the starting material affect the product's configuration? Because if the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, reducing it would form a secondary alcohol, which could then form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. When reduced, it becomes a gamma-hydroxy ester, which can undergo cyclization to form a cyclic ketone.

For example, the ester group is on carbon 5, and upon reduction, the ketone on carbon 5 becomes an alcohol on carbon 5, which then can form a five-membered ring with the ester's oxygen.

Wait, that might form a cyclic hemiacetal or a lactone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal, and upon reduction, the ketal is broken to form a diol, which then forms the cyclic ketone under acid conditions.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: The starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal. When treated with a reducing agent, it could form a diol, which then loses water to form the cyclic ketone.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acetal, and the reducing agents cleave the acetal to produce the ketone.

But then why would the product be a cyclic ketone? Because the starting material was a cyclic acetal, and upon cleavage, it forms the cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal, which when cleaved, gives the cyclic ketone.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

In any case, the key seems to be that the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents produce enantiomeric products.

Wait, but the reagents are different. So perhaps the reaction conditions influence the configuration.

Wait, I think I've heard that LiBH4 and BH3 can lead to different stereochemical outcomes in certain reductions because of the reaction mechanism. For example, in the reduction of ketones, the approach of the hydride can be from either face, leading to retention or inversion of configuration.

Wait, but the product in this case is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is an ester or another group that upon reduction forms an alcohol, which then forms the cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are alpha-keto esters, and the reducing agents reduce the ester to an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the cyclic ketone.

Wait, if the starting material is an alpha-keto ester, like CH2(COOR)CH2COOH, then reducing it would convert the ester into an alcohol, giving CH2(COH)CH2COOH. Then, perhaps under certain conditions, this could form a cyclic hemiacetal, which is the product.

But I'm not sure about the specifics. However, the key point is that the configuration of the starting material (R or S) would determine the configuration of the product.

In the options, the correct answer would be where A and B are enantiomers, leading to the R and S products when treated with different reducing agents.

Looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So when A (R) is treated with LiBH4, it produces R product, and when B (S) is treated with BH3, it produces S product.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is reversed. But without knowing the exact reaction mechanisms, it's hard to tell.

Wait, another thought: LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and can reduce more stubborn groups. BH3, being milder, might not reduce certain groups.

Wait, but in the given problem, both reactions produce the same product but as enantiomers. So perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers, and the reagents cause different stereochemistry in the product.

Hmm. Without a clear understanding of the exact reaction mechanisms, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Given that the product configurations are R and S, and the starting materials are enantiomers, the correct option would be where A and B are enantiomers. Looking at the options:

Option D: A is R, B is S.

Option C: A is S, B is R.

So, the correct answer is either C or D.

Wait, why? Because when you treat an R-configured starting material with LiBH4, you might get the R product, and treating the S starting material with BH3 would give the S product.

Alternatively, the reducing agents might cause the configuration to flip or not, depending on the reaction.

But without knowing the exact effect of the reagents on the stereochemistry, I'll have to make a guess. I think the correct answer is D, where A is R and B is S.


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that yield enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reagents used are LiBH4 + H+ for reaction A and BH3 + H+ for reaction B. The key lies in understanding how the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the reagents influence the stereochemistry of the products.

The product is a cyclic ketone, and the starting materials are given as (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. These starting materials are enantiomers, differing in the configuration of their chiral centers. The stereochemistry of the product depends on the configuration of the starting material and the reaction conditions.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 is milder and typically used in hydroboration reactions. In this case, the reagents likely reduce the starting materials to form the cyclic ketone product. The stereochemistry of the product is determined by the configuration of the starting material, as the reduction process preserves the relative stereochemistry.

Given that the products are enantiomers, the starting materials must also be enantiomers. This means that if A is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, B must be (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, and vice versa. Among the options provided, option D specifies that A is (R) and B is (S), which aligns with the requirement that the starting materials are enantiomers to produce enantiomeric products.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
