Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that oscillating charges can radiate energy. The question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

The setup is an oscillating charge that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. The problem is asking about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also the form of f.

Wait, okay, so I think this involves understanding the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna or something similar. Because for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (90 degrees from the axis) and varies with θ. Oh right, the dipole radiation pattern is given by P proportional to (sinθ)^2/(something), but wait, no, the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to (sinθ)^2, isn't it? Because the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole axis.

Wait, but wait. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution, which I think is more like an electric dipole. So the radiation would follow the dipole radiation formulas.

So the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is given by the radiation formula. Let me recall. The power radiated by a dipole is P = (μ^2 ω^4 sin²θ )/(12π c^3), where μ is the dipole moment, ω is the angular frequency, and θ is the angle from the z-axis.

But in this problem, the function f(λ,θ) is the power per unit solid angle, so that's exactly what that formula gives. So f is proportional to sin²θ, and also depends on μ and ω
