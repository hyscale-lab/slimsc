Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about two quantum states with different energies, E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are from A to D.

Wait, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle relates the energy uncertainty (ΔE) to the lifetime (Δt) of a state. The formula is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Or sometimes it's approximated as ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, depending on the exact formulation. I think the more precise version is that the uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is on the order of ħ. So maybe I should use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt.

Wait, but the lifetime here refers to the lifetime of each state. So each state has a different lifetime. Wait, no, wait. The question says two states have lifetimes of 1e-9 sec and 1e-8 sec. So each state has its own lifetime. But how does that affect the energy difference?

Wait, I think the key here is the energy resolution. To resolve two states, the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainty, you can't distinguish them.

So, for each state, the uncertainty in energy is ħ divided by the lifetime of that state. Because ΔE = ħ / Δt.

So, for the first state (Δt1 =
