Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here. Hmm, I need to figure out what's going on. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

The scientist is creating a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He's done serial dilutions and ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. That makes sense because a perfect efficiency (100%) would have a slope of -3.322, approximately. So the numbers line up.

Looking at the results: the Ct values decrease as the concentration increases. Wait, higher number of copies should lead to lower Ct values because there's more target, so the reaction reaches threshold faster. So the data shows that. But the question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options suggest something's wrong with the data.

Wait, the Ct values are in triplicates. Let's look at the data:

At 100000 copies, the Ct's are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average would be around 34.2. Similarly, for 10000, 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. So each of these has a range of 0.6. For 1000 copies, 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Also a 0.6 range. At 100 copies, 24, 24.3, 24.6. Same as before. And for 10 copies, they're 20.7, 21, 21.3. Also a 0.6 range.

Wait, the question is asking about the discrepancies. So the Ct values are varying a bit, but the question is whether this is a problem or not.

The options:

Option A says qPCR can't quantify. But that's not true because the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, so the curve is perfect. So A is wrong.

Option B says Ct values don't agree with target amount. But the data shows that as concentration increases, Ct decreases, which is correct. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, each dilution is 10 times (like 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution). The expected change in Ct for a 10x dilution would be about 3.3 cycles, right? Because a 100% efficient PCR would have each Ct go up by 3.322 when you dilute 10x.

Looking at the data: for 100,000 to 10,000, the Ct goes from about 34.2 to 30.9. The difference is 3.3. Similarly, 10,000 to 1000: 3
