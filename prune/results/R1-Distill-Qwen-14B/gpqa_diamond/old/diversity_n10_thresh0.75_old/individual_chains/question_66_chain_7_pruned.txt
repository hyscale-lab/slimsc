Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. 

Hmm, let me start by recalling what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry has to do with the invariance under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry is a combination of Lorentz symmetry and translations in spacetime, so it includes both Lorentz and translational invariance. 

CP symmetry is Charge conjugation combined with Parity symmetry. Charge conjugation changes particles into their antiparticles, and Parity is spatial inversion. CPT is the combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that CPT symmetry is a fundamental symmetry in quantum field theories because of the CPT theorem, which states that a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must be CPT symmetric.

In the SMEFT framework, operators are higher-dimensional terms added to the Standard Model Lagrangian. These operators must respect the underlying symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT operators must too. 

Wait, but what about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since the SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, it's constructed in a way that respects the same symmetries as the Standard Model. The Standard Model respects Poincare symmetry, so operators in SMEFT should too. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people talk about Lorentz symmetry separately. Oh, right, because Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare, but the question is about which are required for all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, maybe SMEFT operators are written in terms of Lorentz-invariant operators. Because if they weren't, then they wouldn't make sense in a Lorentz-invariant theory. So Lorentz symmetry has to be respected.

Poincare symmetry involves both Lorentz and translations. But wait, operators in the effective theory would have to be local, so they must transform covariantly under Lorentz, but do they have to respect Poincare? Well, the theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant because the Standard
