Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step. So, the question is about stars with spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm.

Alright, first, let me parse the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—how does that work? Oh right, when spots are present, they are cooler regions, so the overall brightness decreases. But the problem says the effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So, the star's overall emission is now lower because a part of its surface is at a lower temperature.

Now, the main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio decreases when there are spots. So, the ratio without spots is higher than with spots. I need to find (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

In the stellar photosphere, under LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium), the ratio of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. So, the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(kT) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when T decreases (from 6000 K to 5500 K), the ratio n1/n2 changes. Let me think about how temperature affects this.

The energy difference, E2 - E1, is related to the wavelength of the transition. The given wavelength is 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet range. The energy E is hc/lambda, where h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. But perhaps I don't need the exact value because it might cancel out.

The Boltzmann factor is exp( -delta E / (k T) ), where delta E is E2 - E1. So higher T would make the exponential term larger, because as T increases, delta E/(kT) becomes smaller, so exp(-x) becomes larger (since x is smaller, negative x is less negative).

Wait, let me rephrase. Let's say delta E = E2 - E1. So the Boltzmann factor is exp( -delta E/(k T) ). If T increases, the denominator increases, so delta E/(k T) decreases. So the exponent is a smaller negative number, making the entire exponential larger.
