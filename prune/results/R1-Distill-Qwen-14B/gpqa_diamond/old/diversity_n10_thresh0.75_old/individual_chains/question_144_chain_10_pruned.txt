Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance, and we need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A, B, C, D with different values.

Hmm, I remember that meson resonances are particles that exist for a very short time before decaying. The mean decay distance would depend on how long the particle lives, which relates to its lifetime, and then multiplied by its velocity to get the distance.

Wait, the mean decay length formula is something like L = gamma * v * ctau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, v is the velocity, and ctau is the proper lifetime multiplied by the speed of light. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I think the mean proper lifetime (tau) can be found using the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. Here, the energy uncertainty ΔE is the width Γ, so tau ≈ ħ / (Γ * c²). Wait, no, maybe it's tau ≈ ħ/(Γ). Because the width Γ is related to the lifetime via Γ = ħ / tau, so tau = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me think again. The natural line width is given by Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Oh, right. So that's the lifetime. Then, the mean lifetime times the velocity times the speed of light gives the decay length. Or wait, the velocity is a fraction of the speed of light, so the mean decay distance L is gamma * v * c * tau. Because gamma is the time dilation factor, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light, multiplied by tau (the proper lifetime, which is the lifetime in the rest frame). 

So putting it together, L = gamma * v * c * tau.

But wait, tau is the proper lifetime, so in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau. So the moving particle will have a lifetime of gamma tau, and during that time, it's moving at velocity v, so the distance is v * gamma tau = v * (gamma tau) = v *
