Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I remember that annihilation involves particles and their antiparticles. The question says p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each of opposite charge.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh right, 'slowly moving' probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate its velocity as non-relativistic, but I'm not entirely sure. Or wait, maybe the opposite? Since protons are heavy, but if it's moving slowly, perhaps the kinetic energy is negligible compared to rest mass.

The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, but protons have a rest mass energy too. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So the proton and antiproton each have rest mass energy around 938 MeV.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So charge conservation: proton is +e, antiproton is -e. On the product side, each A⁺ is +e, and A⁻ is -e, so two each. So 2(+e) and 2(-e) gives a total charge of 0. On the left, proton and antiproton also sum to 0. So charge is conserved.

Now, I need to find the velocity of particle A. Wait
