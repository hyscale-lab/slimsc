Okay, so I have this physics problem about spins and partition functions. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says there are three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). I'm supposed to find the partition function Z. The options are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

Alright, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So I need to find all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3, calculate E for each, then sum exp(-β E).

But wait, how many possible states are there? Each spin has two options, so 2^3=8 states. That's manageable.

Let me list all 8 possible states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now for each state, calculate E. Let's see.

E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So each term is the product of two spins. Let's compute each term:

Let's think about each state:

1. All +1s. Each product is 1*1=1. So sum of products is 1+1+1=3. So E = -J * 3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1: S1S2=1, S1S3= -1, S2S3= -1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait, no. Wait E is -J times the sum. So let me recalculate.

Wait, when each product is calculated:

For state 2: S1 S2 = (+1)(+1)=1, S1 S3 = (+1)(-1)=-1, S2 S3 = (+1)(-1)=-1. Sum = 1 -1 -1 = -1. So E = -J * (-1) = J.

Wait, wait, no. The energy expression is E = - J ( sum of S_i S_j ). So for state 2, sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J * (-1) = J.

Wait, wait a second, perhaps I should compute each state's E again.

Let me make a table:

State | S1 | S2 | S3 | S1S2 | S1S3 | S2S3 | Sum | E
-----|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|---|---
1    | +1|+1|+1|
