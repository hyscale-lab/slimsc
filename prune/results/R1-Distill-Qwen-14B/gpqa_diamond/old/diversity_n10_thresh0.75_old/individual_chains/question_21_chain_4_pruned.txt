Okay, so I have this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and then it asks about tautomerism and optical isomerism in some compounds. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. Constitutional isomers differ in the bonding arrangement, like how the atoms are connected, while stereoisomers are about the spatial arrangement, like how the atoms are arranged in space, such as in geometric or optical isomers.

The question has two parts: part A and part B. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let's tackle part A. The compounds given for part A are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, what's tautomerism? Tautomerism is a type of isomerism where a proton (H) moves from one atom to another, and a bond shift occurs, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds. This typically happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds or conjugated systems, allowing for keto-enol tautomerism, for example.

Benzoquinone is a quinone structure. Quinones have a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups on a benzene ring, I think. So, structure-wise, it's like O=C6H3-C(=O)-.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring, at positions 1, 3, and 5. So the structure is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups opposite each other.

Do these compounds undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen adjacent to a double bond or a conjugated system. In benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are adjacent on the benzene ring. Wait, noâ€”benzoquinone is either para-quinone or ortho. For para-benzoquinone, the two carbonyl groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring. So the structure is O=C6H4=O. But wait, the actual structure is a benzene ring with two double bonds, like O=C-C6H3-C(=O)-O? No, wait, let me think again. Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. So, it's 1,4-diketone in a benzene ring.

Now, can benzoquinone undergo tautomerism? I'm trying to remember. Tautomerism in something like cyclohexane-1,3-dione, which is similar to a diketone. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3-dione can undergo tautomerism because the two carbonyl groups are adjacent, allowing for the shift of a hydrogen and the formation of an enol. But wait, in cyclohexane-1,3-dione, the structure is O=C-C-C-O-C-C. So, the two carbonyls are
