Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. The options given are four different compounds, and I need to use the provided information—Mass, IR, and 1H NMR—to determine which one it is.

Let's start by breaking down each piece of data. I'll go through each one step by step.

First, the Mass Spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, so the molecular ion is at 156. The fragment at 158 is higher, which is a bit confusing because usually, fragments are lower than the molecular ion. Wait, maybe it's an isotope peak. Chlorine has a significant natural abundance isotope, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if the molecular formula includes chlorine, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at 156 (Cl-35) and another at 158 (Cl-37) because 37 is two mass units higher. That would make sense. So, the molecular formula probably includes one chlorine atom. The molecular weight is 156, which includes Cl (about 35.5), so the rest of the molecule is about 120.5 g/mol.

Wait, let's calculate: 156 = molecular weight. Let's think about the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Chlorine adds about 35.5, so 7*12=84, 6*1=6, 16 (O) = 16. So 84+6=90 +16=106. Adding Cl (35.5) gives 141.5. But wait, wait, I might have made a mistake. Let's count the atoms: benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl (so one Cl), a hydroxyl (O), and another O from the aldehyde? Wait, maybe I should just compute the molecular formula.

3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would have the formula C7H5ClO2. Carbon:7, Hydrogen:5, Chlorine:1, Oxygen:2. Let's compute: (7×12)=84, (5×1)=5, (35.5)=35.5, (2×16)=32. Total: 84+5=89; 89+35.5=124.5; 124.5+32=156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 15
