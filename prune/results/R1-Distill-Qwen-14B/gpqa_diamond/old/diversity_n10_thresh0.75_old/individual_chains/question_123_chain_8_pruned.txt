Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, the question is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, I'm a bit confused about reference frames here. Let me try to break it down.

So, the problem says both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. Inertial frames don't accelerate, so they're moving at constant velocities relative to each other. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy's center at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame. But wait, no—actually, the way the problem is phrased is that from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So I think that means the relative speed between them is 60,000 km/s, but I'm not entirely sure about the direction.

Wait, in special relativity, when you have two objects moving towards each other, their relative speed isn't just additive because of the speed limit (c), but wait, 60,000 km/s is way below the speed of light (which is about 300,000 km/s). So maybe we can treat this with classical mechanics? Because at such a low speed compared to c, relativistic effects might be negligible.

But wait, the problem is about time elapsed in different frames. So perhaps I should think about time dilation here. Oh right! Because time passes differently in different frames depending on relative velocity. So the time experienced in the ejecta's frame (t') is different from the time in the Galaxy's frame (t).

The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. I need to find out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during that time, and then multiply by the speed to get the distance.

Wait, but how does time dilation work again? The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)), and v is the relative velocity. But wait, if the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta's velocity is v=60,000 km/s towards the center.

But wait, the problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that's the same as the ejecta moving towards the Galaxy at 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy's frame, right? Because velocities reverse when you switch frames, but since v is much less than c, maybe the classical approach is sufficient for this problem. Hmm, but the question is about time, so I can't just use classical velocity addition.

Wait, no, because of time dilation, the time experienced in each frame will be different. So, the time in the Galaxy’s frame is longer than in the ejecta’s frame if the ejecta is moving at a high speed relative to the Galaxy. Or wait, no—time dilation makes moving clocks run slower. So, the ejecta's clock (t') is moving at high speed relative to the Galaxy’s frame. So, according to the Galaxy, the ejecta’s clock is running slow. So when the ejecta measures t
