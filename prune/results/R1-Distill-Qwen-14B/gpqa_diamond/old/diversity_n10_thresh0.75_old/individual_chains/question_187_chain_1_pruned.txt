Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's supposed to be good for finding exoplanets using the radial velocity method. But what about its detectability limits?

The question is about signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel. The requirement is S/N of at least 10 after a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out for each star whether it meets this criterion.

Wait, the stars are a mix of bright ones and faint ones. Let's list them out again:

a) Canopus: That's a very bright star, I think. It's one of the brightest in the sky, so it's probably easily detectable.

b) Polaris: Also a bright star, but I'm not sure how bright. Polaris is the North Star, so it's around magnitude 2, maybe? Or is that correct? I think it's about magnitude 2, making it quite bright.

c) Star with V mag 15 at 10 pc: Hmm, absolute magnitude is 15. Wait, absolute magnitude (M) is how bright it would appear at 10 pc. So if it's at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude (m) would be 15. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the Absolute V magnitude is 15, which is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if the star is located at 10 pc, its apparent magnitude is 15. Oh, but that's super faint. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no: higher magnitudes mean fainter. So a V mag of 15 is very faint. Because Canopus is like -0.7 or something, and Polaris is maybe 2. So 15 is way dimmer than that. So would ESPRESSO detect that?

d) Same as c, but located at 200 pc. So its absolute magnitude is 15, so apparent magnitude is M + 5 log10 (d/10), right? So d is 200 pc, which is 20 times 10 pc. So
