Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. Hmm, okay.

So the first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's a ketone. When ketones react with CN- (from NaCN), I think it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh, right, the formation of cyanohydrins. So the product is a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group added across the carbonyl.

But wait, how does the reaction proceed? I remember that for cyanohydrin formation, the ketone reacts with CN- in a basic condition. But wait, wait, but sometimes it's done under acidic conditions too. Hmm, wait no, maybe not. Let me think. The mechanism involves the attack of the nucleophile on the carbonyl carbon. But to make that happen, the carbonyl needs to be activated. Oh, right, so maybe the reaction is done in a basic solution? Or maybe with an acid catalyst?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. To get this, I think the conditions are usually either a weak acid or maybe a base. Wait, NaCN is a source of CN- ion, but it's not very strong in aqueous solution. Oh, wait, but butan-2-one is not very reactive unless the conditions are right. Oh, right! I think when you prepare a cyanohydrin from a ketone, you typically use a strong acid as a catalyst. So like H3O+ or H2SO4, something like that. Because the acid would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, which allows the CN- to attack.

So in the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form the cyanohydrin. So Reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have A as NaHSO3. Hmm.

Wait, but sometimes NaHSO3 is used as a source of H+ and SO3^2- but I'm not sure in this context. Alternatively, maybe A is an acid like H3O+. So in the first reaction, the reagent is H3O+.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the starting material has a nitrile group attached. The product is a carboxylic acid. So, the reaction here must be the hydrolysis of the nitrile group to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how does nitrile hydrolysis work? I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. For instance, using H2O with HCl (acidic conditions) or with NaOH (basic conditions) and heat. Oh wait, but in the presence of H2O and acid, the nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl in aqueous conditions would facilitate that.

So in the second reaction, reagent B is H2O, but what else? The options say B is either HCl, CH3COOH, HCl again, or CH3COOH. Wait, in the options, for the second reaction, the reagents are B: for option A it's HCl, for B it's CH3COOH, for C it's HCl again, and D is CH3COOH.

Wait, but the second reaction is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile turning into 2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (cyano group) becomes a carboxylic acid group (-COOH). So that's a hydrolysis of nitrile to acid.

In acidic conditions, the hydrolysis of nitriles (R-CN) to carboxylic acids (R-COOH) can be done with H2O and HCl. Alternatively, using H2O with a strong acid catalyst. So for the second step, Reagent B could be HCl.

Wait, but looking at the options, in the first reaction Reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. Since the first step is a cyanohydrin formation, which requires acidic conditions, so A is probably H3O+.

So for the first reaction: A is H3O+.

Second reaction: B is HCl (acidic condition).

Looking at the options, option A says A is H3O+ and B is HCl. Option C has A as NaHSO3 and B as HCl. So which one is correct?

Wait, but let me double-check. Could NaHSO3 be a possible reagent for the first reaction? NaHSO3 is a source of H+ and sulfite ions. Hmm. Alternatively, sometimes in some reactions like the benzoin condensation, HSO3^- is used as a catalyst, but that's under specific conditions. But for cyanohydrin formation, I think we usually use an acid like H3O+ or H2SO4 as the catalyst. So NaHSO3 may not be the right reagent here.

So for Reagent A, the correct choice would be H3O+.

Then, Reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A says A=H3O+ and B=HCl. So that would fit. But wait, the second step's reagent is H2O and B. So the product is a carboxylic acid, which implies that the nitrile was hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. So using HCl as the catalyst in H2O would make sense.

Wait, but are there other possibilities? For example, sometimes nitriles can be hydrolyzed under basic conditions to form carboxylic acids, but that requires more vigorous conditions, maybe with heat. Alternatively, using a strong acid like HCl would facilitate the hydrolysis.

So, putting it all together:

First reaction: Reagent A is H3O+.

Second reaction: Reagent B is HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+ and B=HCl.

Wait, but option C has A=NaHSO3 and B=HCl. Oh, but I thought A should be H3O+.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) A = H3O+, B = HCl

B) A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH

C) A = NaHSO3, B = HCl

D) A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So, based on this reasoning, option A is the right one.


The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction typically requires acidic conditions to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic and facilitating the nucleophilic attack by CN⁻. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is the most suitable reagent for this step, as it provides the necessary acidic environment.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid is commonly carried out under acidic conditions, such as with HCl in water. This makes HCl the appropriate reagent for the second step.

Considering the options:
- Option A specifies A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl, which aligns with the requirements for both steps.
- Option B specifies A = H₃O⁺ but B = CH₃COOH, which is less suitable for the second step as CH₃COOH is not strong enough to effectively hydrolyze the nitrile group.
- Option C specifies A = NaHSO₃, which is not suitable for the first step as it is not commonly used for cyanohydrin formation.
- Option D specifies A = NaHSO₃ and B = CH₃COOH, both of which are unsuitable for their respective steps.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, where A = H₃O⁺ and B = HCl.

Answer: A
