Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of an operator. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a muon, but I think that's just a particle with the same quantum numbers as an electron, so maybe it's similar to spin-1/2 particles. The operator is P, and we're looking for its eigenvector along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each component is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Wait, so each component is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Right, because the Pauli matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], and diag(1,-1). So P is basically the Pauli vector scaled by ħ/2.

Now, the operator for the direction n is P·n, because for spin operators, the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the Pauli vector with the unit vector n. Since n is in the x-z plane, it's (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ) or something like that. Wait, no, in the x-z plane, φ would be 0 or π, but perhaps the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) since it's in x-z. Hmm, maybe, but in any case, the exact direction might not matter directly for the form of the eigenvector.

But wait, the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ), with θ being the polar angle from the z-axis. Because any direction in the x-z plane would have φ=0 or φ=π, but since it's arbitrary, we can just use θ as the angle.

So the operator P·n would be (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z), since n_y is zero. Because the problem states that it's in the x-z plane. So n is (nx, 0, nz), with nx² + nz² = 1.

So, substituting in, the operator becomes:

P·n = (ħ/2)(n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

Which simplifies to:

( ħ/2 ) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

So the matrix for P·n is:

[ (n_z * ħ/2 ) , (n_x * ħ/2) ]
[ (n_x * ħ/2) , (-n_z * ħ/2) ]

But wait, when we're looking for eigenvalues, maybe we can factor out the ħ/2. The eigenvalue equation is (P·n)|ψ> = λ |ψ>.

But wait, the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2, so λ = +ħ/2.

So the equation becomes:

[ (n_z * ħ/2 ) , (n_x * ħ/2) ]   [a]
[ (n_x * ħ/2) , (-n_z * ħ/2) ]   [b]   =   λ [a]
                                      [b]

But since λ is ħ/2, we can factor that out. Let me divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify.

So the equation becomes:

[ n_z, n_x ]   [a]
[ n_x, -n_z ]   [b]   =   [a]
                           [b]

Which gives the system of equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a
n_x a - n_z b = b

Wait, that's because when you multiply the matrix by [a; b], you get:

row 1: n_z a + n_x b = (λ / (ħ/2)) a? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I messed up the scaling. Let me redo that.

Wait, the original matrix is (ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]]. So when you write the eigenvalue equation:

(ħ/2) * [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) λ [a; b]

Since λ is +1? Because (ħ/2) λ would be the eigenvalue. So if the given eigenvalue is +ħ/2, then λ is 1.

So the equation becomes:

[[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the matrix is [[n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z]], and the right-hand side is [a; b].

So setting up the equations:

n_z a + n_x b = a          (1)
n_x a - n_z b = b          (2)

Hmm. Let's rearrange equation (1):

n_z a + n_x b = a => a (n_z -1) + n_x b = 0

Similarly, equation (2):

n_x a - n_z b = b => n_x a - b(n_z +1) = 0

Now we have two equations:

1) (n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
2) n_x a - (n_z + 1) b = 0

We can write these as a system:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a - (n_z +1) b = 0

We can write this in matrix form:

[ (n_z -1), n_x ] [a]   = 0
[  n_x    , -(n_z +1) ] [b]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

So determinant D is:

(n_z -1) * ( - (n_z +1) ) - (n_x)^2 = 0

Compute D:

D = - (n_z -1)(n_z +1) - n_x^2
= - [n_z^2 -1] - n_x^2
= -n_z^2 +1 -n_x^2
But since n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1 (because n is a unit vector), substitute:

n_x^2 = 1 - n_z^2

So D = -n_z^2 +1 - (1 - n_z^2) )
= -n_z^2 +1 -1 +n_z^2
=0

Which is as expected, since the matrix is singular, so we have non-trivial solutions.

Now, going back to the equations. Let's take equation (2):

n_x a = (n_z +1) b

Which can be rewritten as:

a = [ (n_z +1)/n_x ] b

Assuming n_x is not zero. But if n_x is zero, then n is along z. But since it's in the x-z plane, it could be along x or z, but in general, n_x can be zero.

Wait, but in this case, the direction is arbitrary in x-z, so n_x could be zero. But let's proceed assuming n_x is not zero, so we can express a in terms of b.

So a = [ (n_z +1)/(n_x) ] b

Let me write the eigenvector components as [a; b] = [ ( (n_z +1)/n_x ) b; b ]

We can
