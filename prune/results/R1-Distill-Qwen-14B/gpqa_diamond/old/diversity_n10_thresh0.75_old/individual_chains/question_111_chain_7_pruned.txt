Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to choose the correct options from the given choices.

First, let me look at reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's probably involved in some kind of elimination or addition reaction. The starting material is a ketone, so maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation? Or perhaps it's a Michael addition since ethyl acrylate is a Michael acceptor.

Wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. In the presence of a base, it can undergo a Michael addition. The base would deprotonate the enolate, which might then attack the alpha position of the acrylate. But wait, the starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure.

The cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 (ethyl), 2 (another methyl), and 6 (methyl). Wait, no, 2-ethyl means a substituent at C2, and 2,6-dimethyl would be methyl groups at C2 and C6. Wait, no, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at position 1 (since it's 1-one). The substituents would be at C2: ethyl and methyl? Or wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the carbonyl is at position 1, then C2 has an ethyl and a methyl group attached. Because 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl would mean the 2 position has both ethyl and methyl groups, and 6 has a methyl. Hmm, that might make the structure pretty bulky around the carbonyl.

When a ketone reacts with ethyl acrylate under basic conditions, it's likely undergoing a conjugate addition, specifically a Michael addition. The base (t-BuOK) would deprotonate the alpha
