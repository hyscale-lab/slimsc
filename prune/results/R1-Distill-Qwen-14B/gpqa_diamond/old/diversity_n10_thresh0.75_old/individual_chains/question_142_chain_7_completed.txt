Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that a density matrix is used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So the question gives me this density matrix ρ and asks where it's located in the qubit space. The options are four different r vectors, so I guess each option is a point in some geometrical space.

Let me think about what the given ρ looks like. The density matrix is given as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1| ). Wait, |0><0| is a projection operator that projects onto the state |0>, same with |1><1|. So when I add them, I get a matrix that has 1s on the diagonal. And then I multiply by 1/2, so each diagonal element becomes 1/2.

So the matrix ρ would be a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. The basis states are |0> and |1>, so the matrix would have [ [1/2, 0], [0, 1/2] ] as its elements. That makes sense because ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal.

Now, I think about how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere. Oh right, every density matrix for a qubit can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector has three components (x, y, z), right? The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is (I + r·σ)/2, where r is the Bloch vector and σ are the Pauli matrices.

So let's break down the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, because |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives the identity matrix, which when multiplied by 1/2 gives the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is (I + 0·σ)/2, that would mean r is zero. Because any r·σ term would contribute to x, y, z components, but in this case, all those terms are zero. So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

So the point in the qubit space is at the origin. Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The density matrix being (I)/2 is the maximally mixed state. So it's completely unentangled, like a classical mixture of |0> and |1>. On the Bloch sphere, the pure states are on the surface, and the maximally mixed state is at the center. Oh right, the origin. So yes, r is (0,0,0). So the answer is option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. This represents the maximally mixed state for a qubit, which corresponds to equal probabilities of the qubit being in the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\).

In the Bloch sphere representation, any qubit state can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector and \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given density matrix, there are no contributions from the Pauli matrices, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This places the state at the origin of the Bloch sphere, which corresponds to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
