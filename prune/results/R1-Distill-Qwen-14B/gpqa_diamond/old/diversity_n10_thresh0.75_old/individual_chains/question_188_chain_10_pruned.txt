Okay, so I have this question about rhombohedral crystals and interplanar distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says the crystal is rhombohedral with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, a rhombohedral system is a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, and all three angles are the same. So it's like a cube that's been deformed a bit such that all angles are equal but not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, each angle is 30 degrees.

The interatomic distance is the distance between adjacent atoms in the lattice. So in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameter 'a' is 10 Angstroms because each edge is the same length. But wait, in other crystal systems, like cubic, the interplanar distances are calculated differently. For rhombohedral, I think the formula is similar to hexagonal but with some modification because of the angles.

I remember the formula for interplanar distance (d) in a crystal is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + (2hk cos α)/(sqrt(1 - cos² α)) + ... ) Wait, maybe I should recall the general formula for interplanar spacing in
