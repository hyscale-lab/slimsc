Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by carefully reading the question to understand what's being asked.

The question is about isomers, specifically tautomerism and optical isomerism. It presents two parts, A and B, which I need to solve. The options given are combinations of answers for both parts. Let me break this down.

First, let's tackle part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which does not show tautomerism.

I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that tautomerism involves the relocation of a hydrogen atom and the shift of a bond, typically between carbonyl groups. For example, in compounds with adjacent ketone groups, tautomerism can occur, leading to different structures (like keto and enol forms).

Benzoquinone, if I recall correctly, has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Wait, no, benzoquinone has two ketone-like groups (it's actually an O with two double bonds, but I think in terms of structure, it's similar to having two carbonyl groups). So, if the structure allows for hydrogen shifting between the carbonyl groups, tautomerism would occur.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, has three ketone groups spaced evenly (1,3,5 positions) on a cyclohexane ring. Each is separated by one carbon. Hmm, but wait, each carbonyl is on a separate carbon, but are they conjugated? In trione structures, are there conjugated carbonyl groups that can allow for tautomerism?

Wait, tautomerism occurs when there are adjacent carbonyl groups. For example, in 1,2-diketones, tautomerism is possible because the hydrogen can shift between the two carbonyl groups. But in 1,3,5-trione, the carbonyls are each separated by a single carbon. So would they be able to undergo tautomerism?

No, wait. Let me think again. Tautomerism requires the possibility of a hydrogen to shift from one carbonyl to another, which usually requires the carbonyls to be in positions that allow for the transfer. For example, in o-diketones (like 1,2- positions), tautomerism is possible. But in 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is two carbons apart. So they're not adjacent. So perhaps tautomerism isn't possible there.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize benzoquinone. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. If I imagine the structure, it's a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other. So, positions 1 and 4, perhaps. Wait, no, benzoquinone can be para-quinone (1,4-diketone) or ortho (1,2-diketone). But regardless, the key is whether the compound can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, I remember that quinones can undergo keto-enol tautomerism
