Okay, so I've got this question about cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation and gamma-ray annihilation. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons. The process is gamma plus gamma turning into electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, processes like this can limit their lifetimes because they get absorbed. So, the gamma-rays would lose energy over time through these interactions, and at a certain energy, the lifetime becomes so short that they can't travel far in the universe.

Wait, how does the cross-section for this annihilation depend on the energy? I think the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation increases with the center-of-mass energy. The cross-section probably has some dependency on the energy squared or something like that. Oh right, I remember that the cross-section for e+ e- production from gamma-gamma collisions goes as sigma ~ (s)/(m_e^2) * (something with logarithms perhaps?), but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more like sigma proportional to (E^2)/(m_e^2), but I need to get the exact dependence right.

Also, the interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target photons. The CMB photon density is pretty high, so even though the cross-section might be small, the rate could be significant.

Wait, the lifetime is limited by the interaction time. The interaction time tau is the inverse of the interaction rate. The interaction rate Gamma is sigma * n_photon * v, but for photons, the velocity is c, but maybe that's already accounted for in the cross-section.

Alternatively, the mean free path would be c*tau, and when the mean free path becomes comparable to the size of the universe, the particles can't travel without interacting. So, the lifetime of the gamma-rays is limited when their mean free path is about the same as the universe's size. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Another approach: the optical depth tau is the product of the cross-section, the number density of target photons, and the path length. The condition for significant interaction is tau ~ 1. So, tau = sigma * n_photon * L ≈ 1, where L is the comoving distance.

But wait, the problem says the lifetime is limited by the annihilation process. So, the time it takes for a gamma-ray to annihilate is similar to the age of the universe. So, the lifetime t is approximately h/(E), where h is Planck's constant and E is the energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the lifetime t is related to the annihilation time scale. The annihilation rate is Gamma = sigma * n_photon * c (or something like that). So, Gamma is the probability per unit time. The lifetime is 1/Gamma.

Wait, Gamma is the rate, so Gamma = sigma * n_photon * c? Or is it sigma multiplied by the photon flux? Hmm, I need to think about units.

Sigma has units of cm^2. n_photon is per cm^3. So, sigma * n_photon would have units of cm^-1. Then, multiplied by the velocity (c, in cm/s) gives per second. So, Gamma is in 1/s, which is correct for a decay rate.

So, Gamma = sigma * n_photon * c.

Then, the lifetime t is 1 / Gamma = 1/(sigma * n_photon * c).

But when does the lifetime become significant? If the age of the universe is about t ~ 1e10 years, then for t to be the same as the age, the gamma-rays would have a limited lifetime. So perhaps when the annihilation time is comparable to the age of the universe, their lifetime is limited.

Wait, but the question is about when the lifetime is limited by this process. So, perhaps when the annihilation rate is such that the lifetime (t) is about the age of the universe, t_univ ~ 1e10 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the mean free path is on the order of the universe's size. The mean free path lambda is c*t / (sigma * n_photon). If lambda ~ t_univ * c, then we can equate that.

Wait, maybe I should start by writing down the formula for the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs.

The cross-section for gamma + gamma → e+ + e- is given by:

sigma ≈ (8 π/3) * (α^2 / (m_e^2)) * (E^2)/(m_e^2 c^4} ), or something like that. Wait, I think a more precise formula is needed.

I recall that the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given approximately by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / m_e^4) * (E_cm^2)/(m_e^2 c^4), but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 (in the center-of-mass frame) is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / m_e^4) * (E1 E2) / (m_e^2 c^4) ) * [ ... something ... ]

Wait, maybe I should look for the general expression. Alternatively, I remember that for high-energy photons, the cross-section increases as E^2, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to look for the formula for the cross-section of photon-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs.

After recalling, the cross-section for γγ → e+e− is approximately:

σ ≈ (4 π α²)/(3 s) * ln(s/(4 m_e²)) 

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = (E1 + E2)^2 (assuming photons are moving in the same direction, but perhaps for isotropic, it's (E1 E2) * something? Hmm, actually, when the photons are moving in opposite directions, s = (E1 + E2)^2. But for photons moving in the same direction, s = (E1 - E2)^2, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but the CMB photons are isotropic, but the high-energy gamma-ray is moving in some direction. So perhaps the typical situation is that the two photons are moving in opposite directions. Or maybe not, since the CMB is isotropic, so the average is taken over all angles.

Alternatively, for a single gamma-ray and a CMB photon, which is at rest in the CMB frame, but the gamma-ray is moving at high energy. So in the lab frame, perhaps, the cross-section depends on the product of their energies.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The cross-section for γγ → e+e− is given by:

σ(E, E') ≈ (4 π α²)/(3 (E E') ) * [ ln( (E + E')²/(4 m_e^2) ) - ln( (E - E')²/(4 m_e^2) ) ) ]

But when E ≫ m_e c^2 and E' ≫ m_e c^2, this simplifies.

Alternatively, perhaps for E and E' much larger than m_e c^2, the cross-section can be approximated as:

σ ≈ (4 π α²)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E E') 

Wait, but that's units-wise correct? Let me check.

α is dimensionless, π is dimensionless. m_e^2 c^4 has units of (energy)^2. So 4 π α²/(3 m_e^2 c^4) has units of 1/(energy)^2. Multiply by E E' (energy^2), so the cross-section has units of cm^2, which is correct.

So in that approximation, sigma ≈ (4 π α²)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * E * E'.

Wait, but I think the correct expression is that the cross-section scales as E * E', so sigma ~ E * E'.

But I'm not 100% certain. Another approach: the cross-section is proportional to the square of the amplitude, which for this process involves the square of the logarithm of the energy, but perhaps at high energies, that logarithm isn't as important as the leading terms.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section is approximately sigma ~ (alpha^2/(m_e^4)) * E^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the optical depth approach.

The optical depth tau is given by tau = n_photon * sigma * L, where L is the path length.

Wait, no, tau is the product of the cross-section, the number density of targets, and the distance traveled. So tau = n_photon * sigma * L.

Wait, but in our case, the gamma-ray is traveling through a universe filled with CMB photons. So the number density n_photon is about 411 photons/cm^3, or about 1e8 per m^3. Wait, more accurately, the CMB photon density is about ~1e8 photons per cubic meter, but I'm not certain. Let me think: the CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. Using the photon density formula for a blackbody, n ≈ (g * T^3)/(h^3 c^3)}, where g is the degrees of freedom (for photons, g=2). So T=2.7 K.

Calculating n_photon:

n_photon = (2) * (2.7 K)^3 / (h^3 c^3)

But perhaps I can recall that the number density is about 411 photons/cm^3, or 4.11e7 photons/m^3. So 4.11e7 photons/m^3 is 4.11e7 cm^-3.

Wait, 1 m^3 is 1e6 liters, but maybe that's not the point. Alternatively, 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m^3. So 411 photons/cm^3 is 411e6 photons/m^3.

Wait, no, 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m^3, so 411 photons/cm^3 = 411 * 1e6 photons/m^3 = 4.11e8 photons/m^3.

So n_photon ≈ 4e8 photons/m^3.

Wait, let me double-check using the formula:

n_photon = (2 * (k_B T)^3) / (h^3 c^2) ) * (2 pi / (k_B T)) )

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, using the formula for photon number density in a blackbody:

n = (g * T^3) / (h^3 c^3) * (2 pi k_B)^3 )

Wait, maybe it's better to just look up the number. Oh, right, the CMB photon density is about 411 cm^{-3}, which is 4.11e8 m^{-3}.

So, n_photon ≈ 4.11e8 m^{-3}.

But perhaps I should keep it as n_photon = 4e8 m^{-3}.

Now, the cross-section sigma for gamma + photon → e+ e- is given by an expression I need to find.

Assuming that the cross-section scales as sigma ~ (alpha^2 / m_e^4) * E_gamma * E_cmb.

Because for high energies, the cross-section for two photons to annihilate into an electron-positron pair is proportional to the product of their energies. So sigma ≈ (k * alpha² / m_e^4) * E_gamma * E_cmb.

Where E_gamma is the gamma-ray energy, E_cmb is the CMB photon energy (given as 1e-3 eV).

But wait, the CMB photon energy is about kT, which is about 0.001 eV.

Wait, the average photon energy for the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So sigma ≈ (k * alpha^2 / m_e^4) * E_gamma * E_cmb.

But what is the constant k? Let me think. From what I remember, the cross-section for gamma gamma → e+ e- is:

sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2)/(3 m_e^4) * E1 E2 * (ln(...)) 

But when E1 and E2 are much larger than m_e c^2, the logarithmic terms can be approximated. Alternatively, maybe the leading term scales as ln(s/m_e^2), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for the cross-section formula in terms of E_gamma and E_cmb.

Wait, if I let E1 = E_gamma (the high-energy gamma-ray) and E2 = E_cmb (the CMB photon, low energy), then in the center-of-mass frame, the energy is sqrt(E1^2 c^2 + E2^2 c^2 + 2 E1 E2 c^2 (1 - cosθ)).

But since we're considering the average over all directions, perhaps we can make some approximation here.

Alternatively, since E_gamma >> E_cmb, the cross-section simplifies.

Wait, for E_gamma >> E_cmb, the cross-section can be approximated as sigma ≈ (8 π alpha^2)/(3 m_e^4) * E_gamma E_cmb (ln(something)).

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Maybe I should find an approximate expression.

Alternatively, I remember that the cross-section for this process can be written as:

sigma ≈ (4 π alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E_gamma E_cmb) * ln( (4 E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) )

But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a simplified expression that for E_gamma >> m_e c^2 and E_cmb ≈ m_e c^2, but wait E_cmb is 1e-3 eV, which is much less than m_e c^2 (which is about 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV). So E_cmb is much smaller than m_e c^2.

Wait, that complicates things because the earlier approximation may not hold. So maybe I should instead think about the process more carefully.

But perhaps for this problem, the main point is to get the scaling right. So, if sigma is proportional to E_gamma * E_cmb times some logarithmic factor, and E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV, then the cross-section scales with E_gamma.

Now, the interaction rate Gamma is sigma * n_photon * c.

Wait, no, because n_photon is the number density, and the gamma is moving through a medium with n_photon. So, the interaction rate is Gamma = sigma * n_photon * c.

Wait, actually, the rate is Gamma = sigma * c * n_photon.

The units: sigma (cm^2) * c (cm/s) * n_photon (cm^-3) → cm^{-2} s^{-1} * cm^{-3} * cm → cm^{-2} s^{-1} * cm^{-3} * cm → cm^{-4} * cm → cm^{-3} * s^{-1}. Wait, no, perhaps I should check again.

Wait, sigma has units of cm^2, n_photon is cm^-3. So sigma * n_photon is cm^{-1}. Multiply by c (cm/s), you get 1/s. So yes, Gamma is in 1/s.

So Gamma = sigma * n_photon * c.

The lifetime t is 1 / Gamma.

So, t = 1/(sigma * n_photon * c).

We need to find the energy E_gamma where the lifetime t is limited by this process, probably when the lifetime is comparable to the age of the universe, which is about t_univ ≈ 1e10 years.

Wait, let me compute t_univ in seconds. 1e10 years * 3.15e7 s/year ≈ 3e17 seconds.

So, t ≈3e17 s.

So, set t = 3e17 s.

So, 3e17 s = 1/(sigma * n_photon * c )

We can rearrange this to solve for sigma:

sigma = 1/(3e17 s * n_photon * c )

But n_photon is 4e8 m^{-3} = 4e8 * 1e6 cm^{-3} = 4e14 cm^{-3}.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1 m^3 is 1e6 liters, 1 liter is 1e3 cm^3. So 1 m^3 is 1e6 * 1e3 = 1e9 cm^3. So 1 m^{-3} is 1e-9 cm^{-3}.

So, n_photon = 4e8 m^{-3} = 4e8 * 1e-9 cm^{-3} = 0.4 cm^{-3}.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. 411 photons/cm^3 is 411e6 photons/m^3. So 4e8 photons/m^3 is 4e8 * 1e-6 cm^{-3} = 4e2 cm^{-3}.

Wait, no, wait: 1 m^3 = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm^3. So, 1 cm^3 = 1e-6 m^3.

So, n_photon in cm^{-3} is 4e8 photons/m^3 * 1e6 cm^3/m^3 = 4e14 photons/cm^3. Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 411 photons/cm^3.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The CMB photon density is about 411 photons per cubic centimeter. So 4.11e2 photons/cm^3. Which is 4.11e2 * 1e6 = 4.11e8 photons per cubic meter. Ah, okay, that makes sense. So n_photon = 4.11e8 photons/m^3.

So, converting to cm^{-3}, since 1 m^3 = 1e6 liters = 1e6 * 1e3 cm^3 = 1e9 cm^3. So, 4.11e8 photons/m^3 is 4.11e8 * (1 m^3/1e9 cm^3) ) = 4.11e8 * 1e-9 cm^{-3} = 4.11e-1 photons/cm^3. So about 0.4 photons/cm^3. That can’t be right because I know the CMB has a density of about 400 photons per cubic cm.

Wait, this is a problem. Wait, perhaps I have the numbers wrong. Let me double-check.

The CMB photon density (number per unit volume) can be calculated using the formula for a photon gas in a blackbody. The number density is given by:

n = (g * (k_B T)^3 )/(h^3 c^3) * (2 pi) 

Wait, no, perhaps the formula is:

n = (2 * (k_B T)^3 )/(h^3 c^3) * (4 pi) / (zeta(3)) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to recall that the CMB has a temperature T ≈ 2.7 K. The average photon number per cubic meter is roughly 411,000,000 photons/m³. So n_photon ≈ 4.11e8 m^{-3}.

Which is 4.11e8 photons/m^3. Converting to photons/cm^3:

1 m^3 = 1e6 liters = 1e6 * 1e3 cm^3 = 1e9 cm^3. So, 4.11e8 photons/m^3 = 4.11e8 / 1e9 photons/cm^3 = 4.11e-1 photons/cm^3, which is about 0.4 photons/cm^3. That's about 400 photons per cubic meter. Wait, that doesn't make sense because I thought the CMB has about 400 photons per cubic centimeter.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the conversion. Let me think again. 1 cubic meter is 1e6 liters, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³. So 1 m³ = 1e6 * 1e3 = 1e9 cm³. So if there are 4e8 photons per m³, that's 4e8 photons per 1e9 cm³. So 4e8 / 1e9 = 0.4 photons/cm³. So that's correct. But wait, I thought the CMB density was about 400 photons/cm³. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting the numbers wrong.

Wait, no, wait: The CMB's energy density is about ~ 1e-4 erg/cm³, but the number density is higher. Let me think in terms of the Planck formula.

The number density of CMB photons is given by:

n = (8 pi g / h^3 c^3) * integral_{0}^{infty} x^2/(e^{x} - 1) dx * (k_B T)^3

Where g is the degeneracy factor, which for photons is 2 (two polarizations). The integral is approximately zeta(3) * 14.38, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the number density for the CMB is:

n = (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 c^3) * (8 pi) * (zeta(3)) * (something)

Wait, perhaps using approximate numbers would be better. Let me just accept that n_photon = 411 cm^{-3} = 4.11e2 cm^{-3} = 4.11e8 m^{-3}.

So, n_photon = 4.11e8 m^{-3}.

Now, back to the problem.

We have:

t = 1/(sigma * n_photon * c )

We set t ≈ 3e17 seconds (the age of the universe).

So,

sigma = 1/(3e17 s * n_photon * c )

But sigma is also proportional to E_gamma * E_cmb. So,

sigma = K * E_gamma * E_cmb,

where K is a constant involving alpha, m_e, etc.

Putting it all together:

K * E_gamma * E_cmb = 1/(3e17 * 4.11e8 * 3e8 cm/s )

Wait, wait, c is in cm/s, which is about 3e10 cm/s. Wait, no, 3e8 m/s is 3e10 cm/s.

Wait, units! Let me be careful.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

So, let's compute the denominator:

3e17 s * 4.11e8 m^{-3} * 3e10 cm/s.

Wait, but n_photon is in m^{-3}, and we need to convert that to cm^{-3}.

Wait, wait. Because n_photon is in m^{-3}, 4.11e8 m^{-3} is 4.11e8 / (1e2 cm)^3 = 4.11e8 / 1e6 cm^3} = 4.11e2 cm^{-3}.

Wait, wait, 1 m = 100 cm. So 1 m^3 = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm^3.

So, 4.11e8 photons/m³ = 4.11e8 photons/(1e6 cm³) ) = 4.11e2 photons/cm³.

So, n_photon = 4.11e2 cm^{-3}.

So, now, the denominator is:

3e17 s (t) * 4.11e2 cm^{-3} (n_photon) * 3e10 cm/s (c).

Multiply the units:

s * cm^{-3} * cm/s → s * cm^{-3} * cm/s = s * cm^{-2} * 1/s → cm^{-2}.

So denominator has units of cm^{-2}.

So,

sigma = 1/(3e17 * 4.11e2 * 3e10 )

Wait, but sigma has units of cm^2. Let me compute the numerical value.

Calculating denominator:

3e17 * 4.11e2 = 3 * 4.11e19 = 1.233e20.

Multiply by 3e10: 1.233e20 * 3e10 = 3.7e30.

So,

sigma = 1/(3.7e30) = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

But sigma is also given by K * E_gamma * E_cmb.

We need to find K. Let's think about the cross-section formula.

The cross-section sigma for gamma + gamma → e+ e- is approximately:

sigma ≈ (4 π alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * E_gamma * E_cmb * ln( (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e c^2)^2 )

But since E_cmb is 1e-3 eV and m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV = 5.11e5 eV. So E_gamma is much larger than m_e c^2, and E_cmb is much smaller, so the argument of the logarithm is (E_gamma * E_cmb) / (m_e c^2 )^2.

But E_cmb is 1e-3 eV, and E_gamma is a high-energy gamma-ray, say 1e5 GeV = 1e11 eV.

So, (1e11 eV) * (1e-3 eV) = 1e8 (eV)^2.

(m_e c^2)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 ≈ 2.6e11 (eV)^2.

So the ratio is (1e8) / (2.6e11) ) ≈ 3.8e-4.

Which is much less than 1. So, the logarithm ln(3.8e-4) is about ln(4e-4) ≈ -8.2.

Hmm, but that's negative. Wait, but the cross-section formula includes the logarithm, which could be positive or negative, but cross-section can't be negative. So perhaps there's a modulus, or perhaps the argument of the log is squared.

Alternatively, maybe the logarithm is taken as the absolute value. Alternatively, perhaps I should have written the argument as (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4), which would have the same units as (E^2).

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is:

sigma ≈ (4 π alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * E_gamma E_cmb * ln( (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) )

Wait, but the units here:

E_gamma and E_cmb are energies, so their product is energy squared. m_e^2 c^4 is (mass^2 c^4) which is (energy)^2.

So the argument is dimensionless, which is correct.

Wait, but for E_gamma and E_cmb much larger than m_e c^2, the argument becomes large, and the log becomes positive.

But in our case, E_gamma is high, but E_cmb is low. So, (E_gamma * E_cmb) may not be much larger than m_e^2 c^4.

Hmm.

Let me plug in the numbers:

E_gamma = 1e5 GeV = 1e11 eV.

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So, E_gamma * E_cmb = 1e11 * 1e-3 = 1e8 eV^2.

m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2.

So, the argument is 1e8 / 0.261e12 = ~3.83e-4.

So, ln(3.83e-4) ≈ ln(0.000383) ≈ -8.2.

But the cross-section can't be negative, so perhaps the correct expression is:

sigma ≈ (4 π alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E_gamma E_cmb) * [ ln( (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) ]

But the log is negative, which would make sigma negative. That can't be correct. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: the correct formula for the cross-section is:

sigma ≈ (4 pi alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E_gamma E_cmb) * (ln( (4 E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) )

In this case, the argument is (4 E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) = 4 * 1e8 / 0.261e12 ≈ 1.53e-3.

So, ln(1.53e-3) ≈ ln(0.00153) ≈ -4.16.

Still negative.

Hmm, perhaps the cross-section formula is actually different. Perhaps the correct expression is the square of the logarithm or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should ignore the logarithm for an approximate calculation, assuming it's a small factor.

But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the cross-section can be approximated as sigma ≈ k * E_gamma * E_cmb, where k is a constant that includes the other terms.

So, let's proceed with sigma = K * E_gamma * E_cmb.

We have:

K * E_gamma * E_cmb = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

We can solve for K.

But what is K? Let me compute K.

K = (4 pi alpha^2 )/(3 m_e^2 c^4 )

But let's compute the values:

alpha ≈ 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

m_e = 9.11e-28 grams.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

So,

K = (4 pi * (0.00729)^2 )/(3 * (9.11e-28 g)^2 * (3e10 cm/s)^4 )

First, compute numerator:

4 pi * (0.00729)^2 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 0.0000531 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 12.566 * 5.31e-5 ≈ 6.67e-4.

Denominator:

3 * (9.11e-28 g)^2 ≈ 3 * (8.298e-55 g²) ≈ 2.489e-54 g².

(3e10 cm/s)^4 = (3e10)^4 (cm^4/s^4) = 8.1e40 cm^4/s^4.

So denominator overall:

2.489e-54 g² * 8.1e40 cm^4/s^4 ≈ 2.489e-54 * 8.1e40 = 2.02e-13 g² cm^4/s^4.

So,

K ≈ 6.67e-4 / (2.02e-13 ) → 6.67e-4 / 2.02e-13 ≈ 3.3e9.

Wait, but units? Let me see.

Wait, the denominator is in g² cm^4/s^4.

Wait, but K is (4 pi alpha^2 )/(3 m_e^2 c^4 ), so the units are (cm^2) per (erg^2), because m_e² c^4 is (energy)^2, and alpha is dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I should compute K in cm^2 (eV)^{-2}.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Let me compute K numerically.

Compute K:

K = (4 pi alpha^2) / (3 m_e² c^4 )

m_e in eV/c²: m_e = 0.511 MeV/c² = 0.511e6 eV/c².

So,

m_e² c^4 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (0.511e6)^2 eV^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2.

Putting that into K:

K = (4 pi (0.00729)^2 ) / (3 * 0.261e12 )

Compute numerator: 4 pi * (0.00729)^2 ≈ 4 *3.1416 * 0.0000531 ≈ 6.67e-4.

Denominator: 3 * 0.261e12 ≈ 7.83e11.

So,

K ≈ 6.67e-4 / 7.83e11 ≈ 8.52e-16 cm^2 / (eV^2 )

Wait, cm^2 per eV squared.

Wait, but sigma in cm^2, and E_gamma and E_cmb are in eV, so when we multiply K * E_gamma * E_cmb, we get cm^2.

So, sigma = 8.52e-16 cm^2/(eV^2) * E_gamma (eV) * E_cmb (eV) 

So, sigma ≈ 8.52e-16 * E_gamma * E_cmb cm^2.

Now, plug into the equation sigma = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

So,

8.52e-16 * E_gamma * (1e-3 eV) = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

Solve for E_gamma:

E_gamma = (2.7e-31 cm^2) / (8.52e-16 * 1e-3 eV )

Compute denominator: 8.52e-16 * 1e-3 = 8.52e-19.

So,

E_gamma = (2.7e-31)/(8.52e-19) eV ≈ (2.7 /8.52) * 1e-12 eV ≈ 0.3167 * 1e-12 eV ≈ 3.167e-13 eV.

Wait, that can't be right. That's an extremely low energy, but the options are all in the GeV range.

Hmm, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Wait, let's re-express sigma:

sigma = K * E_gamma * E_cmb.

We found K = 8.52e-16 cm^2/(eV^2).

E_cmb is given as 1e-3 eV.

So,

sigma = 8.52e-16 * E_gamma * 1e-3 = 8.52e-19 * E_gamma.

Set sigma = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

So,

8.52e-19 * E_gamma = 2.7e-31 → E_gamma = (2.7e-31)/(8.52e-19) eV.

Calculating that: 2.7e-31 /8.52e-19 = (2.7/8.52) * 1e-12 = approximately 0.3167 * 1e-12 = 3.167e-13 eV.

But that's way too low. The options are all in the GeV range. So, I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of K. Let me recompute K.

K = [4 pi alpha^2 ] / [3 m_e^2 c^4 ]

But m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2.

So,

K = (4 pi (alpha)^2) / (3 * 0.261e12 )

alpha is approx 1/137 ≈ 0.007297.

So,

alpha^2 ≈ (0.007297)^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

So,

4 pi * 5.32e-5 ≈ 4 * 3.1416 * 5.32e-5 ≈ 6.68e-4.

Denominator: 3 * 0.261e12 = 7.83e11.

So,

K = 6.68e-4 / 7.83e11 ≈ 8.52e-16 cm^2/(eV^2).

Wait, that's correct.

Hmm, but then when I use that K, I get E_gamma = 3e-13 eV, which is way too low. That can't be right. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the cross-section formula is wrong. Maybe the cross-section is proportional to E^2 instead of E*E_cmb.

Wait, maybe I should think about the high-energy limit. If E_gamma >> E_cmb, then perhaps the cross-section scales as sigma ~ (alpha^2 / m_e^2) * (E_gamma^2 / m_e^2 c^4) * something.

Wait, another approach: the cross-section for gamma-gamma annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given by:

sigma ≈ (alpha^2 / (2 pi m_e^2 c^4)) * (E1 E2) * ln( (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section formula is sigma ≈ (alpha^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) * (E_gamma * E_cmb) * ln( ... )

Wait, perhaps I need to recheck the cross-section formula.

Upon reviewing, I realize that the cross-section for two photons (E1 and E2) annihilating into an electron-positron pair is given by:

sigma ≈ (4 pi alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E1 E2) * ln( (E1 + E2)^2/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )

But when E1 ≫ m_e c^2 and E2 ≫ m_e c^2, this can be approximated.

But in our case, E_cmb is much smaller than m_e c^2, so E_cmb << m_e c^2. So, E_cmb is about 1e-3 eV, m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, which is 5.11e5 eV.

Wait, that's a big difference. So, E_cmb << m_e c^2, but E_gamma could be much larger than m_e c^2.

Hmm, but perhaps the cross-section in this case is negligible because one photon is much lower energy.

Wait, another approach: the dominant contribution to the cross-section comes from when both photons have energies much larger than m_e c^2. But in our case, one photon is much lower. So the cross-section might be much smaller. But since the CMB is a bath of low-energy photons, perhaps the annihilation is still significant if the gamma-ray is high enough.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the typical energy where the photon-photon cross-section becomes significant enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the interaction length of the gamma-ray in the CMB. The mean free path lambda is given by 1/(n_photon * sigma).

Wait, the mean free path is lambda = 1/(n_photon * sigma).

The lifetime t is related to the distance traveled and the speed. Since gamma-rays move at speed c, t = lambda / c.

So, t = 1/(n_photon * sigma * c).

Which is the same as earlier.

But perhaps I can find E_gamma such that t ≈ t_univ.

So,

1/(n_photon * sigma * c) ≈ t_univ.

So,

sigma ≈ 1/(n_photon * c * t_univ )

We can compute sigma as:

n_photon = 4.11e8 m^{-3} = 4.11e2 cm^{-3}.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

t_univ ≈ 3e17 s.

So,

sigma ≈ 1/(4.11e2 cm^{-3} * 3e10 cm/s * 3e17 s )

= 1/(4.11e2 * 3e10 * 3e17 )

= 1/( (4.11 *3 *3 )e2+10+17 )

= 1/(36.99e39 )

= 2.7e-41 cm^2.

Wait, that's a very small sigma. But earlier, I calculated sigma to be 2.7e-31 cm^2. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, let me compute the exponents correctly.

n_photon = 4.11e2 cm^{-3}.

c = 3e10 cm/s.

t_univ = 3e17 s.

So,

n_photon * c * t_univ = 4.11e2 * 3e10 * 3e17 = 4.11e2 * 9e27 = 3.699e30.

So,

sigma ≈ 1 / 3.699e30 ≈ 2.7e-31 cm^2.

Ah, okay, that's consistent with earlier calculation.

So sigma ≈ 2.7e-31 cm^2.

Now, using the cross-section formula, sigma = K * E_gamma * E_cmb.

We have K ≈ 8.52e-16 cm^2/(eV^2).

E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So,

8.52e-16 * E_gamma * 1e-3 = 2.7e-31.

So,

E_gamma = (2.7e-31) / (8.52e-16 *1e-3) eV.

Compute denominator: 8.52e-16 * 1e-3 = 8.52e-19.

So,

E_gamma ≈ (2.7e-31) / 8.52e-19 ≈ 3.17e-13 eV.

Wait, that's 3.17e-13 eV, which is 3.17e-13 eV. Converting to GeV: 1 eV = 1e-9 GeV, so E_gamma = 3.17e-22 GeV. That's way too small, but none of the options are anywhere near that.

So, clearly, I've made a mistake in my approach. Let me think again.

Wait a minute, perhaps the cross-section formula I used is incorrect when one photon is much lower in energy than the other.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cross-section is sigma ≈ (alpha^2 m_e^2 c^4) / (E_gamma^2) ) * ln(...), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section scales as sigma ~ alpha^2 (m_e c^2)^2 / (E_gamma^2).

Wait, that would make sigma decrease with higher E_gamma, which would imply that higher-energy gamma-rays have a shorter mean free path, which doesn't make sense because higher-energy particles should interact less if cross-section decreases.

Wait, no, actually, if sigma decreases, the mean free path increases, meaning the gamma-ray can travel further before interacting.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-section increases with E_gamma for a fixed E_cmb.

Wait, perhaps the cross-section for a gamma-ray of energy E and a CMB photon of energy E_cmb is given by:

sigma ≈ (alpha^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) * (E * E_cmb) * ln( ... )

But perhaps I'm missing factors or constants.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula from particle physics.

The cross-section for two photons with energies E1 and E2 in the lab frame (where E2 is much smaller) is given by:

sigma ≈ (alpha^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) * (E1 E2) * ln( (E1 + E2)/(m_e c^2) )

Assuming E1 ≫ m_e c^2 and E2 ≪ m_e c^2, perhaps the cross-section is approximately:

sigma ≈ (alpha^2 / (m_e^2 c^4)) * E1 * E2 * ln(E1/(m_e c^2))

But since E2 is much smaller than m_e c^2, perhaps the logarithm is dominated by E1.

Alternatively, let's model the cross-section as sigma = k * (E_gamma * E_cmb) * ln( (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) )

Wait, but when E_cmb is much smaller than m_e c^2, and E_gamma is much larger than m_e c^2, perhaps the argument is (E_gamma * E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) ≈ (E_gamma)/(m_e c^2) * (E_cmb)/(m_e c^2).

Because E_cmb is 1e-3 eV and m_e c^2 is 0.511e6 eV, E_cmb/(m_e c^2) ≈ 1e-9. So the product is (E_gamma/(m_e c^2)) * 1e-9.

But if E_gamma is, say, 1e5 GeV = 1e11 eV, then E_gamma/(m_e c^2) = 1e11 / 0.511e6 ≈ 1.95e5.

So the argument is (1.95e5) * (1e-9) )= 1.95e-4.

So ln(1.95e-4) ≈ ln(0.000195) ≈ -8.64.

So the cross-section would have a factor of ln(1.95e-4) ≈ -8.64, but since cross-section can't be negative, perhaps we take the absolute value.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct argument is (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4), which is (1e11 eV * 1e-3 eV) / ( (0.511e6 eV)^2 ) ) = (1e8 eV^2) / (0.261e12 eV^2 )= 3.83e-4.

So ln(3.83e-4) ≈ -8.2.

Hmm, perhaps the cross-section is:

sigma ≈ (alpha^2/(3 m_e^4 c^8)) * (E_gamma E_cmb) * ln( (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) )

But I'm not certain about the exact form.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the interaction rate and the age of the universe.

The condition is that the time for the gamma-ray to annihilate is of the order of the age of the universe.

So, the annihilation time tau = 1/Gamma, where Gamma is the interaction rate.

Gamma = n_photon * sigma * c.

Setting tau ≈ t_univ ≈ 1e10 years → 3e17 seconds.

So,

Gamma = 1/t_univ ≈ 3e-18 per second.

So,

n_photon * sigma * c = 3e-18 s^{-1}.

n_photon is known as ~4e8 m^{-3} → 4e2 cm^{-3}.

c is 3e10 cm/s.

So,

4e2 cm^{-3} * sigma * 3e10 cm/s = 3e-18 s^{-1}.

So,

sigma = 3e-18 / (4e2 *3e10 )

sigma = 3e-18 / (1.2e13 )

sigma = 2.5e-31 cm^2.

So, sigma ≈ 2.5e-31 cm^2.

Now, the cross-section for gamma-gamma → e+e- is given by:

sigma = (4 pi alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E_gamma E_cmb) * ln( (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) )

But given that E_cmb is much smaller than m_e c^2, perhaps this simplifies.

Wait, but let me proceed with the numbers.

We have sigma ≈ 2.5e-31 cm^2.

So,

(4 pi alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * E_gamma * E_cmb * ln(...) = 2.5e-31.

Compute the constant term:

(4 pi alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4 )

alpha = 1/137.

m_e = 0.511e6 eV/c².

c = 3e10 cm/s.

But perhaps it's better to compute this term in cm^2/(eV^2).

Compute each part:

4 pi ≈ 12.566.

alpha^2 ≈ (1/137)^2 ≈ 5.3e-5.

So,

(4 pi alpha^2 ) ≈ 12.566 * 5.3e-5 ≈ 6.67e-4.

m_e^2 c^4 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 0.261e12 eV^2.

So, denominator:

3 * 0.261e12 eV^2 = 7.83e11 eV^2.

So,

(4 pi alpha^2 )/(3 m_e^2 c^4 ) ) = 6.67e-4 / 7.83e11 eV^{-2} = 8.52e-16 cm^2/eV^2.

So,

sigma = 8.52e-16 cm^2/eV^2 * E_gamma (eV) * E_cmb (eV) * ln( ... )

Set this equal to 2.5e-31 cm^2.

So,

8.52e-16 * E_gamma * E_cmb * ln(...) = 2.5e-31.

Assume E_cmb = 1e-3 eV.

So,

8.52e-16 * E_gamma * 1e-3 * ln( ... ) = 2.5e-31.

Compute 8.52e-16 * 1e-3 = 8.52e-19.

So,

8.52e-19 * E_gamma * ln(...) = 2.5e-31 → E_gamma = (2.5e-31) / (8.52e-19 * ln(...) )

What's the argument of the ln?

(E_gamma * E_cmb)/(m_e^2 c^4) = (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) / (0.261e12 eV^2) ) = E_gamma * 1e-3 / 0.261e12 = E_gamma * 3.83e-16.

So,

ln(E_gamma * 3.83e-16 )

Assume that E_gamma is such that E_gamma * 3.83e-16 is large. But if E_gamma is 1e5 GeV = 1e11 eV,

E_gamma * 3.83e-16 = 1e11 * 3.83e-16 = 3.83e-5.

ln(3.83e-5) ≈ -10.95.

But that would make the cross-section negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the argument is instead (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e c^2 )^2.

Which is,

(E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) / (0.511e6 eV )^2 = (E_gamma * 1e-3) / (0.511e6 )^2 ≈ E_gamma * 1e-3 / (2.61e11) ) = E_gamma * 3.83e-16.

Same as before.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression for the cross-section has the logarithm of (E_gamma E_cmb)/(m_e c^2 )^2, so:

ln( (E_gamma E_cmb) / (m_e c^2 )^2 )

Which is the same as ln( (E_gamma * 1e-3 eV) / (0.261e12 eV^2) )) → ln( something )

But this would be ln( E_gamma * 3.83e-16 ), which for E_gamma=1e11 eV gives ln(3.83e-5 )≈-10.95.

So, again, the log is negative, which would make the cross-section negative. That can't be correct, so I must be missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula uses the absolute value or takes the ln of the inverse.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct cross-section formula is:

sigma = (4 pi alpha^2)/(3 m_e^2 c^4) * (E_gamma E_cmb) * ln( (4 E_gamma E_cmb )/( m_e^2 c^4 ) )

In this case, for E_gamma =1e11 eV,

4 * 1e11 * 1e-3 =4e8 eV^2.

Divided by m_e^2 c^4 (0.261e12 eV^2 ) → 4e8 / 0.261e12 = 1.53e-3.

So, ln(1.53e-3 ) ≈-4.16.

So, again, negative.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should instead consider that the cross-section goes as E_gamma^2.

Wait, another approach: let me consider the threshold energy for pair production.

The threshold condition is that the center-of-mass energy is at least 2 m_e c^2.

The center-of-mass energy for two photons with energies E and E' is given by:

sqrt( E E' (1 + cosθ) )

Assuming they are moving in the same direction (θ=0), the maximum energy is E + E'.

But for the pair production, we need sqrt(s) >= 2 m_e c^2.

But for high-energy gamma-rays and low-energy CMB photons, the angle between them doesn't matter much because the CMB is isotropic.

Wait, but perhaps the cross-section is zero unless the center-of-mass energy is above the threshold.

So, the condition is E_gamma + E_cmb >= 2 m_e c^2.

But since E_cmb << m_e c^2, the condition is E_gamma > 2 m_e c^2 - E_cmb ≈ 2 m_e c^2.

Which is E_gamma > ~1 MeV.

But the problem is about gamma-rays with much higher energies.

Hmm. Maybe I should use the formula for the interaction length.

The interaction length lambda is given by:

lambda = 1/(n_photon * sigma )

The interaction time is t = lambda / c.

The condition is that the interaction time is about the age of the universe.

So,

t = (1/(n_photon * sigma )) / c ≈ t_univ.

So,

n_photon * sigma * c = 1/t_univ.

n_photon is 4e8 m^{-3}.

t_univ ≈ 1e10 years = 3e17 seconds.

So,

sigma = (1) / (4e8 * 3e17 * 3e8 )

Wait, 4e8 photons/m^3, 3e17 seconds, 3e8 m/s.

Wait, no, let me compute:

sigma = 1/(n_photon * c * t_univ )

n_photon = 4e8 m^{-3}.

c = 3e8 m/s.

t_univ =3e17 s.

So,

sigma = 1/(4e8 * 3e8 * 3e17 ) m^{-2}.

Compute denominator: 4e8 *3e8 =1.2e17; 1.2e17 *3e17= 3.6e34.

So,

sigma = 1/3.6e34 ≈ 2.78e-35 m^2.

Convert to cm^2: 1 m^2= 1e4 cm^2. So,

sigma =2.78e-35 *1e4 = 2.78e-31 cm^2.

Which matches earlier calculation.

Now, using the cross-section formula:

sigma = K * E_gamma * E_cmb * ln(... )

But earlier, when I tried this, I got E_gamma around 1e-12 eV, which is way too low.

Perhaps the formula is incorrect, and the cross-section actually scales as E_gamma^2.

Let me try that.

Assume sigma ≈ K * E_gamma^2.

Then,

K * E_gamma^2 ≈ 2.7e-31 cm^2.

What is K in this case?

K would be the cross-section per (E_gamma)^2.

But earlier, the cross-section formula had sigma ∝ E_gamma E_cmb, but with E_cmb fixed, perhaps sigma ∝ E_gamma.

But in any case, let me compute K as:

K = sigma / (E_gamma^2 )

But without knowing E_gamma, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the photon-photon cross-section.

Upon checking, the cross-section for photon-photon → e+ e- is given by:

sigma = (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s) * ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)),

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy: s = (E1 + E2)^2 (for head-on collision) or s = (E1 - E2)^2 (for same-direction).

But when E1 >> E2, s ≈ (E1 + E2)^2 ≈ E1^2.

So,

sigma ≈ (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * ln( E1^2/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )

But wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Wait, s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons with energies E1 and E2, moving in opposite directions, s = (E1 + E2)^2.

So,

sigma = (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 s) * ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)).

But in the case where E1 ≫ E2,

s ≈ (E1 + E2)^2 ≈ E1^2 + 2 E1 E2 + E2^2 ≈ E1^2 (1 + 2 (E2/E1) + (E2/E1)^2 )

But since E2 is much smaller than E1, s ≈ E1^2.

So,

sigma ≈ (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * ln( E1^2/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )

Which can be written as:

sigma ≈ (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * [ ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)) + ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)) ]

Wait, no, it's just ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)) = ln( (E1^2)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) ) = 2 ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)).

So,

sigma ≈ (8 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * 2 ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)).

So,

sigma = (16 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)).

But wait, that's for photons moving in opposite directions. Since the CMB is isotropic, perhaps we need to average over all angles.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective cross-section is different.

But let's proceed with this formula.

So,

sigma ≈ (16 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)).

We can set this equal to 2.7e-31 cm^2.

So,

(16 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)) ) = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

We need to solve for E1 in eV.

Let's plug the numbers.

alpha = 1/137 ≈ 0.00729.

m_e c^2 = 0.511e6 eV.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 16 pi alpha^2:

16 * 3.1416 ≈ 50.265.

alpha^2 ≈ 5.32e-5.

So,

16 pi alpha^2 ≈ 50.265 *5.32e-5 ≈ 2.673e-3.

Denominator: 3.

So,

(16 pi alpha^2)/(3) ≈ 2.673e-3 / 3 ≈ 8.91e-4.

So,

(8.91e-4) / E1^2 * ln(E1/(2 * 0.511e6 eV)) ) = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

Wait, but units: what is E1 in terms of cm and eV?

Wait, perhaps I should express E1 in eV, and compute the entire expression in appropriate units.

But perhaps it's better to express all terms in eV and natural units.

Wait, let's assume E1 is much larger than m_e c^2, so ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)) is positive.

Let me denote x = E1/(2 m_e c^2).

So,

sigma ≈ (8.91e-4 / E1^2 ) * ln(x) = 2.7e-31 cm^2.

But E1 is in eV, so I need to convert E1^2 into eV^2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express everything in terms of eV and cm.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting too complicated. Let me consider possible options.

Looking at the options provided:

A) 9.5e4 GeV = 9.5e4 *1e9 eV = 9.5e13 eV.

B)1.8e5 GeV = 1.8e5 *1e9 =1.8e14 eV.

C)2.6e5 GeV = 2.6e14 eV.

D)3.9e5 GeV =3.9e14 eV.

These are all in the 1e13 to 1e15 eV range.

Let me plug in option B: 1.8e14 eV.

Compute sigma:

sigma = (16 pi alpha^2)/(3 E1^2) * ln(E1/(2 m_e c^2)).

E1 =1.8e14 eV.

m_e c^2 =0.511e6 eV.

So,

E1/(2 m_e c^2 ) = (1.8e14)/(2 *0.511e6 )= (1.8e14)/(1.022e6 ) ≈ 1.76e8.

ln(1.76e8 ) ≈ ln(1e8 )= 18.42.

So,

sigma ≈ (8.91e-4 )/( (1.8e14)^2 ) * 18.42.

Compute denominator: (1.8e14 )^2 =3.24e28.

So,

sigma ≈ (8.91e-4 *18.42 ) / 3.24e28.

Compute numerator: 8.91e-4 * 18.42 ≈ 0.01633.

So,

sigma ≈ 0.01633 /3.24e28 ≈ 5.04e-31 cm^2.

Which is close to the required 2.7e-31 cm^2.

So, this suggests that E1 ≈ 1.8e14 eV, which is option B:1.8e5 GeV.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine the energy of high-energy gamma-rays whose lifetimes in the universe are limited by annihilation with CMB photons, we analyze the process $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key steps involve calculating the cross-section for this interaction, the interaction rate, and the annihilation time to match the age of the universe.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Cross-Section for $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$**:
   The cross-section for two photons with energies $E_\gamma$ (gamma-ray) and $E_{\text{CMB}}$ (CMB photon) annihilating into an electron-positron pair is given by:
   \[
   \sigma \approx \frac{8 \pi \alpha^2}{3 s} \ln\left(\frac{s}{4 m_e^2 c^4}\right),
   \]
   where $s = (E_\gamma + E_{\text{CMB}})^2$ is the square of the center-of-mass energy. For $E_\gamma \gg E_{\text{CMB}}$, $s \approx E_\gamma^2$, and the cross-section simplifies to:
   \[
   \sigma \approx \frac{16 \pi \alpha^2}{3 E_\gamma^2} \ln\left(\frac{E_\gamma}{2 m_e c^2}\right).
   \]

2. **Interaction Rate and Annihilation Time**:
   The interaction rate $\Gamma$ is given by:
   \[
   \Gamma = n_{\text{photon}} \sigma c,
   \]
   where $n_{\text{photon}}$ is the photon density of the CMB. The lifetime of the gamma-ray is $t = 1/\Gamma$. Setting $t \approx t_{\text{univ}} \approx 3 \times 10^{17}$ seconds (the age of the universe), we solve for $E_\gamma$.

3. **Photon Density of the CMB**:
   The number density of CMB photons is approximately $n_{\text{photon}} \approx 4.11 \times 10^8$ photons/m$^3$, or equivalently $n_{\text{photon}} \approx 411$ photons/cm$^3$.

4. **Solving for $E_\gamma$**:
   Substituting $\sigma$ into the expression for $\Gamma$ and equating $t = 3 \times 10^{17}$ seconds, we solve for $E_\gamma$. After detailed calculations, the energy at which the annihilation process limits the lifetime of gamma-rays is found to be approximately $1.8 \times 10^5$ GeV.

### Conclusion:
The energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by annihilation with CMB photons is **$1.8 \times 10^5$ GeV**, corresponding to **Option B**.
