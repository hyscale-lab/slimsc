Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out step by step.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, wait, no, the rigid rotor is for rotation without considering bond length changes. The non-rigid rotor would allow bond length variations, which probably affects vibrational energy levels.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. So, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next lowest energy state. I need to find the momentum of that photon.

The given data includes the masses of atoms X and Y. Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. Oh, right, amu is atomic mass units. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. I remember that photons carry momentum, which is p = h / lambda, but maybe it's better to think in terms of energy since photon energy relates to its frequency. Or perhaps using the relation E = hf, where h is Planck's constant.

But wait, the molecule can change its state either by rotation or vibration. In the fundamental state, both rotation and vibration are at their lowest levels. So, the next possible state would be the next energy level, which could be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state. Which one has lower energy?

Hmm, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are different. For a diatomic molecule, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J + 1), where B is the rotational constant, and J is the rotational quantum number. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, with n being the vibrational quantum number.

The fundamental state is when J=0 (lowest rotational state) and n=0 (lowest vibrational state). The next state could be either J=1 (next rotational) or n=1 (next vibrational). But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state (so J=0, n=0). It's absorbing
