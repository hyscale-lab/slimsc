Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they produce other particles. The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Let me think about how to approach this.

The problem states that the pion Pi(+) is stationary and decays into a muon mu(+) and a neutrino nu. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, I think the neutrino is considered massless in these kinds of problems, right? Or maybe its mass is negligible compared to the others, so we can ignore it. That might make things easier.

So, since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the total momentum must also be zero because momentum is conserved. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu, but since the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy would be just its momentum times c squared, but I'll get into that later.

Let me write down what I know:

Mass of Pi(+) (m_pi) = 139.6 MeV/c²
Mass of mu(+) (m_mu) = 105.7 MeV/c²
Mass of neutrino (m_nu) ≈ 0 MeV/c²

The decay equation: Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu.

Since Pi is at rest, the initial energy is just its rest energy: E_initial = m_pi c². After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino.

Energy conservation: E_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

Also, momentum conservation: p_pi = p_mu + p_nu. But since p_pi is zero, p_mu + p_nu = 0 → p_mu = -p_nu.

So the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Each of their energies will then be:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no. Wait, the units... Actually, since we're working in units where c=1 (MeV and MeV/c² are used), the expressions simplify.

Wait, let me think again. In particle physics, energies are often given in MeV, masses in MeV/c², but when you calculate energies, E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So when c=1, it's E² = p² + m².

So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²)
E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_nu²) ≈ p, since m_nu is negligible.

So total energy after decay: E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

Set that equal to the initial energy: sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Hmm, that's an equation I can solve for p.

Wait, let's write it:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Let me denote x = p, for simplicity.

So sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*x + x²

So:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute the squares numerically.

105.7^2 = approx 105.7 * 105.7. Let me calculate that. 100^2 is 10,000; 5.7^2 is about 32.49. The cross term is 2*100*5.7 = 1140. So 10,000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no: (a + b)^2 is a² + 2ab + b². So 105.7 is 100 + 5.7.

So (100 +5.7)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*5.7 + 5.7^2 = 10,000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49. So 105.7^2 ≈ 11,172.49 (MeV)^2.

139.6^2: Let's compute that. 140^2 is 19,600. 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,600-112=19,488 +0.16=19,488.16.

So substituting:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 2*139.6 x

Wait, the equation is:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 *x.

So,

2*139.6 * x = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.

Compute the right side: 19,488.16 - 11,172.49 = 8,315.67.

So,

2 * 139.6 * x = 8,315.67

Compute 2*139.6 = 279.2.

So,

x = 8,315.67 / 279.2

Let me divide 8,315.67 by 279.2.

279.2 * 29 = let's see: 279*30=8,370. But 279.2 * 29 = 279.2*(30-1) = 8,376 - 279.2 = 8,376 - 279.2= 8,096.8. Hmm, but wait, 8,096.8 is less than 8,315.67. Let me see, 279.2 * 29.7: 279.2 *29=8,096.8; 279.2 *0.7=195.44. So 8,096.8 +195.44=8,292.24. Close to 8,315.67. The difference is about 23
