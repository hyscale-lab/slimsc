Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the exact concepts, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, right now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. Hold on. The next 150 minutes? Hmm. So, does that mean from the current time, the next 150 minutes? Because 50 minutes have already passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But is the decay probability additive over time? Or does the initial 100 minutes factor in some way?

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed, which is the memoryless property of the exponential distribution. So, the probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is given by an exponential decay formula.

Wait, but the given probability is 32% for 100 minutes. So, let me think about the decay constant. The decay probability P is 32% for t=100 minutes. So, the survival probability (not decaying) is 68% in 100 minutes.

The survival probability S(t) is e^(-λ t), where λ is the decay constant. So, for t=100, S(100) = 0.68.

So 0.68 = e^(-λ * 100). Taking natural logs on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ * 100. So λ = -(ln(0.68))/100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). Hmm, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. 0.68 is just a bit larger than 0.5, so ln(0.68) is around -0.3856. Let me double-check that with a calculator in my mind. Alternatively, I can think that ln(0.7) is about -
