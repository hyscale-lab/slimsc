Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. But I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Wait, wait, that's a bit unusual. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting: 2*8 +2=18, minus H=9, and X is 0 (since no halogens mentioned), plus N=1. So 18-9+1=10. Divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and some double bonds or something like that. 

The NMR data is given. Let's parse that. The peaks are:

9.72 ppm: a triplet (t), 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton because aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Hmm, but wait, aldehydes usually are deshielded and appear as singlets because the adjacent C has no H? Or maybe if it's conjugated or something? Or perhaps I'm thinking of an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde? Because in that case, the aldehyde proton could be split by two protons from the double bond.

Then 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H. 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Maybe a benzene ring with two substituents across from each other. The doublets suggest coupling with each other and perhaps another substituent. Or maybe it's an ortho coupling. Wait, no, para substituents would typically have doublets if coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, maybe it's a trans coupling. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. But the downfield shifts suggest electron-withdrawing groups, perhaps. Or maybe it's just a regular benzene ring.

Then 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH proton or something in a conjugated system. Or perhaps it
