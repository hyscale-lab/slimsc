Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. I'll take it step by step because I'm not too familiar with all the concepts, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question is about transit probability for two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting. Both planets have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Let me read the details again. Both planets have the same mass. Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. However, both stars have the same radius because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved but they end up with the same size. Hmm, so the stars have same radius but different masses.

I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance. The formula for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2, but wait, no, that's the area ratio. Or is that the transit depth? I think the transit probability is the chance that the planet's orbit crosses our line of sight. 

Wait, I think the transit probability formula is more about the alignment. The probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, where a is the semi-major axis (but I might be mixing things up). Alternatively, another formula I remember is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by (some factor) involving the orbital parameters.

Wait, no. The transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (semi-major axis) to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius, but in a specific way. Let me think. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our perspective. 

I think the transit probability (P) is approximately (R_star / a), but perhaps squared or something else. Wait, no, I think it's more like (R_star / a) multiplied by some factor. Alternatively, I remember that the probability is proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied
