Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about measuring observables P and Q on a quantum system. The system's state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's three components, so it's a 3-dimensional vector. Maybe it's a normalized state? Wait, let me check the vector. Oh wait, the vector is (-1, 2, 1). I should probably normalize it because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually of unit length.

To normalize, I need to compute the magnitude. The square of each component: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, and 1^2 is 1. Summing those gives 1 +4 +1=6. So the square root of 6 is the magnitude. So the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)). But wait, the question doesn't specify if the state is normalized. Hmm, maybe I should proceed with the given vector as is because sometimes problems give unnormalized vectors, but the probabilities would depend on that. Alternatively, perhaps the state is already normalized? Let me check: sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2) = sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the state is not normalized. But in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is already normalized? Wait, no, because sqrt(6) is about 2.45, so the components are scaled by that. Hmm, maybe the state is given as (-1, 2, 1) without normalization, but when calculating probabilities, we have to account for that.

Wait, but let me read the problem again. It says the state is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). It doesn't specify that it's normalized. So perhaps we should normalize it first. Because in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized. So, normalization is essential before proceeding.

So, let's compute the norm. As I did before, the square of the magnitude is 6. So the normalized state is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Wait, but actually, the problem might not require normalization because sometimes the probabilities are considered relative. Or perhaps the question is designed so that the state is already normalized. Hmm, but the given state has a magnitude of sqrt(6), which is greater than 1, so it's not normalized. So, I think I need to normalize it before doing any calculations.

So the first step is to normalize the state vector.

Alright, moving on. The
