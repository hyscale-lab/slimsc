Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me think through this. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance. The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, the parallax angle is inversely proportional to the distance. So a star that's closer has a larger parallax value (in arcseconds, I think). So plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), right? Because distance in parsecs is 1 over the parallax in arcseconds. So if a star is 10 parsecs away, its parallax is 0.1 arcseconds.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution usually means that the number per unit volume is constant. So if stars are spread out uniformly in space, the number density is uniform.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So I'm looking at how many stars you find when you look at a certain range of parallax values.

Let me think in terms of distances. Suppose I have a range of parallax from plx to plx + dplx. Each star in this range corresponds to a distance from d = 1/plx to d + dd, where dd is the change in distance corresponding to dplx.

Wait, let's relate the parallax range to the distance. The parallax is plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let me find the change in distance
