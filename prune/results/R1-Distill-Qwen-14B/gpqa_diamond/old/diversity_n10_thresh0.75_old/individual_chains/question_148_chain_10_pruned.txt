Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms multiple compounds with F. Binary compounds mean two elements, so Y and F in each compound.

The problem gives information about several substances: A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5. I'll need to figure out what each of these is to find the molecular weight of A4.

Let me read through the details again.

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So, when A1 breaks down, it releases fluorine and forms A2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, so A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, but under certain conditions, like with strong oxidizers, it can react.

A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y. So, Y is reacted with fluorine to form A3. Since fluorination is adding fluorine, A3 is probably YF where Y is in a lower oxidation state. Wait, or maybe higher? I'm not sure yet.

When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So, A5 is probably a salt that breaks down into something else in water.

I think I need to identify what Y is. Let's consider elements that form multiple fluorides. Fluorine usually forms a variety of compounds. For example, oxygen forms OF2 and OF4, but that's probably not relevant here. Other elements like sulfur form multiple fluorides, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is an alkali or alkaline earth metal that forms different fluorides, but those are usually ionic.

Wait, maybe Y is chlorine? No, because chlorine usually doesn't form multiple binary compounds with fluorine. Or maybe Y is another halogen, but that might not fit. Alternatively, Y is an element that can form multiple oxidation states, like carbon, nitrogen, etc. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition of A1. It decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So, A1 is probably a fluoride that, when heated, releases F2 and forms another fluoride. For example, perhaps A1 is ClF3, which decomposes into ClF and F2? No, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like XFin a higher oxidation state. Wait, let's think about the fluorides of oxygen. But oxygen's fluorides are more like O2F2, which is not a common compound.

Another approach: think of the decomposition. A1 → A2 + F2. If A2 is a fluoride with lower fluorine content, perhaps A1 has higher fluorine content.

Wait, but the oF (I think that's the oxidation state of F in A2?) is 31.96%. Wait, no, I think "ɷF=31.96%" refers to the percentage composition by mass of fluorine in A2. So, in A2, fluorine makes up about 31.96% of the compound. Let me calculate the possible formula for that.

Let’s assume A2 is YF_x. The molar mass of F is about 19 g/mol. So, the mass of F in A2 is 31.96%. Let's say the molar mass of A2 is M. So, (x * 19) / M = 0.3196.

We can rearrange this as M = (x * 19) / 0.3196 ≈ (x * 19) / 0.3196 ≈ x * 59.45.

So, M ≈ 59.45 x. But M must be a reasonable number. Let's try some x values.

If x=1: M≈59.45 → but Y's molar mass would be 59.45 -19 =40.45. So Y is about 40, which is maybe Ti? No, wait, Ti is about 48. Alternatively, maybe it's another element.

Wait, let me think of possible Y. What about Y being chlorine? Cl has a molar mass around 35.5. Let's test x=1: then M = 59.45. So 35.5 + 19 = 54.5, which is less than 59.45. Hmm, doesn't fit.

If x=2: M≈118.9. So for Y with molar mass 118.9 - (2*19) = 118.9 -38=80.9. Hmm, that's close to lead? No, lead is higher. Maybe an element around 80.9? Let me think: Strontium is about 87.9, Yttrium is 88.9. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine? I'm getting confused.

Wait, what about x=3? M≈59.45 *3= 178.35. So Y would be 178.35 - (3*19)= 178.35 -57= 121.35. That's maybe tellurium? No, Te is about 128. So close but not exact.

Wait, maybe Y is something else. Alternatively, perhaps A2 is a different compound. Let's think of possible Y and F combinations. Maybe Y is oxygen? But O and F compounds are like O2F2, but that's a diatomic. Alternatively, maybe Y is nitrogen? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is chlorine. Let me compute for x=1. M=59.45. So Y would be 59.45 -19=40.45. That's between titanium (47.867) and maybe something else. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, maybe x=3: M=59.45*3= ~178.35. So Y would be 178.35 - 3*19= 178.35-57=121.35. What's an element with atomic weight around 121? I think
