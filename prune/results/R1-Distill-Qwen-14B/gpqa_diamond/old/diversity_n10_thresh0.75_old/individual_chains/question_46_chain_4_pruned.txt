Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

First, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of substituents in a double bond are rearranged. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually rhenium or ruthenium based, right? And it's used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis.

The compound in question is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50:50 mix of enantiomers. So the molecule has a double bond from C1 to C2. The structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)H-CH₂-CH3. Or wait, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, the formula for pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂₂? Wait, no, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl on the third carbon, so it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)- something. Wait, pent means five carbons. Let me draw it.
