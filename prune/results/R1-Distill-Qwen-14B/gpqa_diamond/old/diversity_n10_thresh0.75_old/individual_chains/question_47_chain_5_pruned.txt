Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectral data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2, and the options are A, B, C, D. Let me go through the data step by step.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows strong absorption at 3420 and 3325 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of O-H stretches. Typically, a broad peak around 3300 could indicate an amide or a carboxylic acid. But wait, since the compound's formula includes an amine (given the N), maybe it's an amide. Alternatively, could it be an alcohol or something else? The strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹ probably corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. Since the compound has two oxygen atoms, maybe it's an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. The peaks are:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – that's a triplet, likely a CH3 group attached to an oxygen, like an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethoxy group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Not sure what that could be. Maybe an NH group from an amide? Or perhaps an oxygenated CH2, but the broadness suggests maybe an NH or something exchangeable.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet. Quartet usually means splitting into four peaks, which typically comes from a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. Wait, so 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Also, the 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) probably corresponds to the CH3 of an ethyl group. So maybe an ethyl ester, where the ester is OCH2CH3.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That's a pattern of two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So, that suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Each doublet is probably adjacent to substituents. So, if the ring is para-substituted, each pair of protons is in the ortho positions relative to substituents. Wait, but the two doublets have different shifts. 7.0 is lower field than 8.0? Wait, no, 8.0 is higher. Hmm, wait, wait. Actually, the downfield shift is higher ppm. So, perhaps the substituent is electron-withdrawing, causing the adjacent protons to be more deshielded. So, if we have two substituents, one is electron-withdrawing (like a carbonyl group) and another could be another group.

Wait, but the molecule has formula C9H11NO2. Let me draw that. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, formula is C9H11NO2. So, X=0. So, 2*9 +2=20. 20 -11 (H) -0 +1 (N) = 10. 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring (benzene, which is 3), one double bond or ring (like an ester or amide) and another ring or double bond? Wait, 3 (from benzene) plus 2 (from a carbonyl and an ester group maybe), that sums to 5. So that fits.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide (so a benzene ring with CONH2) with an ethoxy group at the 3-position. Wait, but the formula would be C9H11NO2. Let's see: benzamide is C7H7NO2, and adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O) would make it C7+2=9, H:7 +5=12? Wait, no, because the ethoxy replaces a hydrogen. So benzamide is C7H5NO2 (since benzamide is C6H5CONH2: C7H7NO2, but wait, wait. Let me check: benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So formula is C7H7NO2. If we add an ethoxy group in place of a hydrogen, the formula would be C7+2=9, H:7 (from benzamide) minus 1 (replaced) plus 5 (from ethoxy)= 11. So yes, that fits: C9H11NO2. So option A has that.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is formamide (HCONH-) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the phenyl is para-substituted: ethoxy and formamide. The formula would be C8H9NO3? Wait, wait. Let me see: formamide is HCONH- attached to the benzene. The benzene is C6H4. The substituents are OCH2CH3 (ethoxy) and HCONH-. So, the formula would be C6 + (OCH2CH3: C2H5O) and (HCONH: C H O N). Wait, wait:

Phenyl group: C6H5.

But in this case, it's 4-ethoxyphenyl, so C6H4OCH2CH3. Then, the formamide is HCONHR, but here R is the phenyl. So, the formamide is HCONH-C6H4-OCH2CH3.

So counting carbons: 6 (benzene) + 2 (ethoxy) + 1 (formamide's CO) + 2 (formamide's HCONH- ? Wait, formamide is HCONH2, but attached to the benzene, so it's HCONHPh. So in this case, the molecule is Ph-OCH2CH2? Wait, no, the structure is Ph-OCH2CH3 and Ph-NH-CO-H?

Wait, perhaps I should count the formula:

Phenyl group: 6 C.

Formamide group: HCONH- attached to Ph. So HCONHPh: that's 1 (from HCO) + 6 (Ph) + 1 (NH) = 8 C? Wait, no, HCONHPh is PhNHCOH? No, wait, formamide is HCONH2. So when attached to phenyl, it's NH-CO-H attached to the phenyl. So the structure is Ph-NH-C(O)-H. So for the formula:

Ph: 6C, 5H (since one H replaced by NH).

Plus, the formamide group: O is from CO, so O in the carbonyl.

Then, ethoxy group is OCH2CH3.

So overall, the formula would be:

Ph (6 C) + NHCO (adds 2 C: the CO is C=O) + OCH2CH3 (adds 2 C).

Wait, no: the formamide is HCONHPh. So the CO is part of the formamide, so that's one C (from CO) attached to NHPh. So the carbons are:

Ph (6) + formamide (1 C in CO) + ethoxy (2 C) → total 6+1+2=9 C. Hydrogens:

Ph: normally 5 H if one H is substituted. Hmm, the structure is 4-ethoxyphenyl, so substituents are OCH2CH3 and NHCOH. So the benzene has two substituents, in para positions. So benzene would have
