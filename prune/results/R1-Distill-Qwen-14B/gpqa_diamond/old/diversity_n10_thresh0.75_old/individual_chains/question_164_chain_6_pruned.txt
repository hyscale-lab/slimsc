Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the problem is about binary star systems. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses.

Then, they mention spectroscopic observations. For system_1, the two stars have radial velocity (RV) variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of both stars in the system.

Hmm. I need to find the mass ratio, the factor by which system_1's mass is higher than system_2's.

I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocities of the stars are related to their masses. There's a formula involving the masses and the velocities. Let me think.

Oh right, the radial velocity method in binary systems. The velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass because they orbit the common center of mass. So, the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio.

Wait, more precisely, the mass M1 and M2 are inversely proportional to their velocities v1 and v2. So M1/M2 = v2/v1.

Because in a two-body system, the star with more mass will have a smaller velocity. So, M1/M2 = v2/v1.

But wait, the total mass is M1 + M2. But here, each system's total mass is the sum of their two masses.

But the problem is asking for the total mass of system_1 compared to system_2. So, I think I need to find (M1 + M2)_1 / (M1 + M2)_2.

But to find that, I need to find each system's individual masses, sum them, and then take the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the mass function which relates the observed velocities to the masses and the orbital period.

Wait, I think the mass function is given by (M1^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 )) = ( (4π²/G) ) * (a2^3 )/(P²), but maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, I remember that the ratio of the velocities is v1/v2 = M2/M1. Because M1 and M2 are inversely proportional to v1 and v2. So, v1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * V_total, where V_total is the sum of their velocities. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. So, their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, M1 * v1 = M2 * v2. Because the center of mass requires M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are their respective orbital radii. Since velocity v is proportional to 2πa/P, where P is the orbital period.

So, M1 * a1 = M2 * a2 → M1/M2 = a2/a1.

But velocity v is (2πa)/P. So, v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P. So, v1/v2 = a1/a2 = M2/M1. So, v1 = (M2/M1) * v2.

But in the problem, the radial velocity semi-amplitudes are given for each star. So, for system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 and 5 km/s. So, v1 =10, v2=5.

Similarly, system_2 has v1=15, v2=
