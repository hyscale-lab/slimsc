Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some tangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Then they isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain gene in proliferating cells, which showed high variability. The question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm, first, I need to remember what each part does. So, rotavirus is a virus that infects the small intestine, right? The inner capsid proteins are probably VP6, since I remember that VP6 is the protein that makes up the inner capsid. They used GFP to tag these, so they can track where they go.

When they delivered them via oral gavage, the mice's stomach acid would break down some of the GFP-tagged proteins. But some made it through, got into the intestines, and perhaps into the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), important for immune responses in the gut. They're like little immune organs in the intestinal wall.

The GFP fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, meaning that some proteins didn't survive that initial environment. But others must have been protected somehow. Intestinal mucus can entangle things, but I guess the ones that got through were those that made it into the Peyer's patches.

Now, when they isolated the Peyer patches, they looked at the proliferating cell population. These cells are likely B cells because B cells proliferate when they're activated by an antigen. The sequencing showed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. High variability in the variable regions suggests that some process is causing changes in the antibodies.

Wait, what processes change the variable regions of antibodies? Let me think. There's VDJ recombination, which happens during B cell development in the bone marrow. That's when the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to make the initial B cell receptor. But that's more of a primary diversification.

Then, there's somatic hypermutation. That occurs after the B cell is activated, typically in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. SHM introduces point mutations in the variable regions, leading to higher affinity antibodies. This process increases diversity further after the initial VDJ recombination.

Class switching recombination (CSR) changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't change the variable regions. It's more about the constant region. So that's probably not it.

Complement activation is more about opsonizing pathogens or causing lysis, not about altering the antibody genes themselves.

So in this case, the B cells in the Peyer patches are likely undergoing activation and proliferation. Since the variable heavy chain genes show high variability, it's probably due to the process of somatic hypermutation. Because the Peyer patches are part of the GALT, they have these structures where B cells can be activated, especially in the context of a gut infection or vaccination.

Wait, but the GFP-tagged proteins were probably acting as an antigen. So the B cells would take up the antigen, present it, and then the process of generating diverse antibodies would kick in. Since the high variability is after exposure, that points to the SHM process happening in the germinal centers, which are found in secondary lymphoid organs.

So the process taking place is somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, and some are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the Peyer patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs. Fluorescent Peyer patches are isolated, and the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population are sequenced, showing high variability.

Key points to consider:

1. **Peyer Patches and Immune Response**: Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are critical for immune responses in the gut. They contain B cells that can take up antigens and initiate immune responses.

2. **High Variability in Variable Heavy Chain Genes**: The observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests a process that alters the antibody variable regions. This points to somatic hypermutation (SHM), which introduces point mutations in the variable regions of antibody genes to increase diversity and affinity.

3. **Processes of Antibody Diversity**:
   - **VDJ Recombination**: Occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow and generates initial diversity. However, this process does not explain post-exposure variability.
   - **Somatic Hypermutation (SHM)**: Occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs, such as Peyer patches, after B cell activation. SHM introduces mutations in the variable regions, leading to increased diversity and affinity.
   - **Class Switching Recombination (CSR)**: Changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions.
   - **Complement Activation**: Involved in pathogen elimination but does not affect antibody gene variability.

4. **Conclusion**: The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes observed in the Peyer patches is consistent with the process of somatic hypermutation, which occurs in germinal centers during B cell activation and proliferation.
