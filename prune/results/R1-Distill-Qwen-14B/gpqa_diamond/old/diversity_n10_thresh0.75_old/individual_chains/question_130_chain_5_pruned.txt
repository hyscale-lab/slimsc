Okay, so I've got this question about cosmology and redshifts. Hmm, the question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space. These clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, so redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength has stretched due to the expansion of the universe. Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from n=2 to n=1, right? The rest wavelength is around 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So any light at 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm) would be absorbed by the atmosphere and not reach the ground-based telescopes. So how do we detect it?

Well, when the hydrogen cloud is at a certain redshift, the absorbed light would shift into the optical range, where telescopes can see it. So the Lyman alpha line is emitted or absorbed at 1216 Angstroms in the rest frame of the hydrogen. If the cloud is moving away (due to the expansion), the wavelength is shifted to longer wavelengths. So the observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z).

But for us to detect it with optical telescopes, the observed wavelength must be in the optical range. Optical wavelengths are roughly 400-700 nm, I think. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength after redshift must be in that range.

So, let's calculate the minimum redshift. The emitted Lyman alpha is 1216 Angstroms. To reach the lower end of optical, say 400 nm (4000 Angstroms), the redshift z must satisfy:

λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_emit
4000 = (1 + z) * 1216
(1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.289
z ≈ 2.289

So z would be about 2.29. But wait, what if the minimum is higher? Let me think. If the telescope's optical range starts a bit higher than 400 nm, maybe like 450 nm? Let's try 450 nm, which is 4500 Angstroms.

4500 = (1 + z) *1216
(1 + z) ≈ 4500 / 1216 ≈ 3.698
z≈2.698.

But the options given are A)3; B)1.2; C)2.
