Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about binary star systems. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and the periods of these eclipses are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, we get the radial velocity (RV) variations of the stars in each system. 

In system_1, the RV variations have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of a system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in binary star systems, radial velocity curves are sinusoidal because the stars orbit a common center of mass. The amplitude of the velocity is related to the mass of the companion. Oh right, the more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity amplitude because it's closer to the center of mass. So the mass ratio is inversely proportional to the velocity ratio.

But wait, the mass ratio is mass1/mass2 = velocity2/velocity1. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. The more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if star A is more massive than star B, star A's velocity amplitude is smaller. So their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses.

So for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. Let me call them v1 and v2. So the mass ratio would be (M1/M2) = (v2/v1). Wait, because M1 is the mass of star 1, and if v1 is its velocity, then M1 is proportional to v2/(v1). Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the system's total mass.

Wait, in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center, so it has a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity. The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So, M1 / M2 = v2 / v1.

Because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. And the velocities are v = 2Ï€a/P. So since P is the same for both, the velocities are proportional to a. So, M1/M2 = a2/a1 = (v2 * P)/(v1 * P) ) = v2 / v1.

So yes, M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So the mass ratio is v2 over v1.

But wait, the mass of the entire system is M1 + M2. So for each system, the total mass would depend on their velocities.

But how do we relate the velocities to the total mass?

Wait, I think I remember that in the case where you have two stars orbiting each other, the mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses. The mass function is given by f(M) = (M
