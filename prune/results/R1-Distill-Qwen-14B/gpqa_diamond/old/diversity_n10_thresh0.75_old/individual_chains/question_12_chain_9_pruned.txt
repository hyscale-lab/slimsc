Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about pion decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says: a Pi(+) pion is stationary and decays into a mu(+) plus a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, mu is 105.7 MeV. The options are different pairs of kinetic energies for the products. I need to find which pair is correct.

Wait, wait. So the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Oh right, because the pion wasn't moving, so their momenta must cancel each other out.

But the neutrino is nearly massless, right? So maybe its energy is mostly from its momentum. I remember that for neutrinos, the mass is considered negligible compared to other particles, so we can approximate it as such. So the neutrino's energy would be almost equal to its momentum times c, but since we're working in units where c is 1 (like in particle physics), E ≈ p.

The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, so its total energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. Let me denote the muon's kinetic energy as K_mu and the neutrino's as K_nu.

Wait, but the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So the total energy after decay should be the sum of the muon's total energy and the neutrino's energy.

So initial energy: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay:
E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² ? Wait, no, in units where c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²). So E_mu = sqrt(p_mu² + m_mu²), and E_nu = p_nu, because m_nu is negligible.

Since momentum must be conserved: p_mu = p_nu (but opposite directions, so in magnitude, same). So p_mu = p_nu = p.

So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²)
E_nu = p

Total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p.

This must equal the initial energy: sqrt(p² + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

So the equation is sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, how to solve for p here.

Let me let x = p. Then:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expand the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x^2.

Now subtract x^2 from both sides:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute the squares numerically.

105.7^2 is approximately 11172.49, and 139.6^2 is about 19488.16.

So:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Rearranging:

2*139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute that: 19488.16 - 11172.49 is 8315.67.

So 279.2 x = 8315.67.

Wait, 2*139.6 is 279.2.

So x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's calculate that. 279.2 times 29 is about 8096.8, 30 is 8376. Hmm. Let me do 8315.67 / 279.2.

279.2 * 29.8 = let's see: 279.2 *30=8376. Subtract 279.2 *0.2=55.84 → 8376-55.84=8320.16. Oh, that's close to 8315.67.

So 29.8 would give 8320.16, which is a bit higher than 8315.67. So perhaps 29.77?

Let me compute 279.2 *29.77:

279.2 *29 = 8096.8.

279.2 *0.77 = 279.2 *0.7 = 195.44; 279.2 *0.07=19.544 → total 214.984.

So 8096.8 + 214.984 = 8311.784. Hmm, which is 8315.67 - 8311.784 = 3.886 less.

Each 0.1 increment in x adds 27.92 to the product. So 3.886 / 27.92 ≈ 0.14.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just approximate x≈29.8.

Wait, but let me think. So x ≈29.8 MeV/c.

Wait, but since c=1 in these units, x is in MeV/c. Hmm.

So p=29.8 MeV/c approximately.

So E_mu = sqrt( (29.8)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(888.04 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12060.53) ≈ 109.8 MeV.

Wait, wait, let me compute that. 105.7^2 is 11172.49, plus 29.8^2=888.04. Sum is 11172.49 + 888.04 = 12060.53. Square root of that is sqrt(12060) ≈ 109.8, yes.

So E_mu is about 109.8 MeV. Since the muon's rest mass is 105.7, its kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu = 109.8 -105.7 = 4.1 MeV. Approximately 4.1 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p, which is 29.8 MeV. So the neutrino's kinetic energy is approximately 29.8 MeV, since its rest mass is negligible.

Wait, but wait. The neutrino has energy E_nu = p, and its kinetic energy is E_nu - m_nu. But m_nu is so small, it's negligible. So K_nu ≈ 29.8 MeV.

So the muon's KE is about 4.1 MeV, and the neutrino's is about 29.
