Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read through it carefully. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of a reaction product. Let me break down the information given.

So, Compound X has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is provided, both 1H and 13C. My job is to figure out what Compound X was, based on this.

Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a catalyst, right? Specifically, it's used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Sharpless epoxidation is an oxidation reaction that forms epoxides from epoxide precursors, like dienes or something similar. So, if the product is an epoxide, that must mean that Compound X was an alkene that underwent epoxidation.

So, the product is an epoxide. Now, looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's analyze the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR spectrum shows:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

Alright, so let's think about this. Two singlets for 3H each. Those are probably methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals, like an electronegative atom or a ring. Since it's an epoxide, maybe the methyl groups are on an oxygen? Wait, no, oxygen is more likely to deshield protons, but in epoxides, the two CH2 groups are adjacent to the oxygen. Wait, but in the product, the H NMR shows two singlets for 3H each. So perhaps there are two methyl groups attached to the epoxide oxygen or adjacent?

Wait, but epoxides are three-membered rings with two adjacent carbons each connected to an oxygen. The structure is O-C-C-O, but in a ring. So each of those carbons (the ones in the epoxide) would have two substituents. If the substituents are methyl groups, then those would appear as singlets because they're attached to the same carbon and not split by neighboring protons.

Alternatively, maybe those methyl groups are on a benzene ring. Let me think.

Looking at the aromatic region: we have a doublet at δ6.75 (1H), another at 7.08 (2H), 7.68 (1H), and 7.71 (2H). Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me sketch it out.

The aromatic protons could be part of a styryl group. Styryl is a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring, right? So, maybe a structure like benzene with a CH2CH2O (epoxide) group. Or perhaps the epoxide is part of a substituent on the benzene ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting compound X was an epoxide, but no, because the reaction is epoxidation. So X must have had a double bond that was converted into an epoxide. So X is an alkene, and upon reaction, the epoxide is formed.

So, the product is an epoxide, and the NMR shows the structure of the epoxide.

Wait, let's think about the 1H NMR. Let's consider the possibilities.

The two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 ppm are each 3H. Those are probably methyl groups attached to carbons that don't have neighboring Hs. Like maybe they're attached to an oxygen, but in an epoxide, each C is connected to two other things. Alternatively, maybe they're on adjacent carbons to the epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps they're on a benzyl position. For example, if the epoxide is attached to a benzene ring, and the benzene has some substituents with methyl groups.

Looking at the aromatic protons:

The downfield shifts are from 6.75 to 7.71. Let me count the Hs:

1H (d) at 6.75, 2H (d) at 7.08, 1H (d) at 7.68, and 2H (d) at 7.71. Hmm, that's 6 protons in total for the aromatic region. So, perhaps two sets of doublets. Maybe a para-substituted benzene with a substituent that has a double bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the coupling. The downfield protons are more deshielded, so perhaps they're in a conjugated system.

Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are part of a vinyl group attached to the epoxide. Like a styrene group with an epoxide.

Wait, another approach: let's look at the 13C NMR.

13C NMR data:
δ 21.3 (s, 1C)
28.4 (s, 1C)
126.9 (s, 2C)
127.1 (s, 1C)
129.1 (s, 2C)
130.3 (s, 1C)
141.5 (s, 1C)
144.1 (s, 1C
