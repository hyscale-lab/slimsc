Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, which I'm a bit rusty on, but let's think through it. The scenario is a scientist making a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran serially diluted samples with three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, R2 is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that a slope of -3.3 is pretty standard because the formula for the slope in qPCR is related to efficiency. Oh right, the formula is slope = log10(E) / ln(10), and at 100% efficiency, E is 1, so the slope should be around -3.32 (approximately). So that's correct.

Now, looking at his results. The Ct values for each concentration are in triplicates. Let me list them out:

100,000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5 → average around 34.2 maybe.
10,000: 30.6, 30.9,31.2 → average 31
1,000: 27.3,27.6,27.9 → average ~27.6
100: 24,24.3,24.6 → average 24.3
10: 20.7,21,21.3 → average 21.

Wait, each dilution is a tenfold decrease. So from 100,000 to 10,000 is a 10x dilution, which should result in an increase in Ct by 1 cycle, right? Because with each 10x dilution, the Ct increases by log10(10) in base 10? Or wait, no. Ct is inversely proportional to the amount of target. So more copies mean lower Ct (because you reach threshold sooner).

The efficiency is 100%, so each dilution should lead to a linear change in Ct. The slope being -3.3 implies that the equation is Ct = -3.32 * log10(n) + intercept. So for each 10x dilution, the log decreases by 1, so Ct should increase by 3.32. Wait, but looking at the data, let's see the differences between the concentrations.

From 100,000 to 10,000, copies decrease by 10x. The Ct goes from ~34 to ~31. So the difference is 3.3 cycles, which aligns with the expected slope. Wait, but 34 minus 31 is 3, which is a little less than 3.3, but maybe it's an approximation.

Wait, same for others. Next, 10,000 to 1,000: Ct goes from 31 to 27.6. That's a 3.4 difference. Again, close but not exactly 3.3. The next, 1,000 to 100: Ct goes from 27.6 to 24.3 → about 3.3 difference. Then 100 to 10: Ct goes from 24.3 to 21 → 3.3. So all the steps are roughly 3.3 cycles apart, except the first step (100,000 to 10,000) which is 3.2 cycles (34.2-31=3.2). Wait, maybe the first step is a bit off, but the others are spot on.

But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in the results. The options are suggesting possible explanations. Let me look at the options:

Option A: qPCR cannot be used for quantification. No, because the efficiency is 100% and R2 is 1. So qPCR is valid here.

Option B: Ct values don't agree with the target amount. But the results do show a trend with each 10x dilution adding about 3 cycles. So B might not be correct unless the individual replicates are too variable.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the Ct difference for a 10-fold dilution should be 3.3 cycles, and that's exactly what's happening. So if the dilution is more than that, like 3.3 cycles, then C says it's more than 3.3. But in the data, the Ct changes are about 3.3, so this option would be incorrect. Because the dilution's effect is exactly 3.3 cycles.

Option D: The deviation is more than 0.3 between technical replicates. Looking at the data, each replicate has a spread of about 0.3-0.6 cycles. For example, the first set (100,000) is 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The deviation (standard deviation or just the max-min?) between each triplicate is 0.6. So if the deviation is more than 0.3, then D is correct. But the question is about the discrepancies in the results—maybe the problem is that the replicates vary by more than 0.3, which could affect the curve.

Wait, but the question is asking which explains the discrepancies in his results. The results show that
