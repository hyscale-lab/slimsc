Okay, so I've got a physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I remember that when dealing with velocities at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just subtract the speeds normally. Newtonian addition doesn't apply; you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh right, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²), but wait, I'm not sure which one is u and which is v. Oh wait, no, I think I might have it backwards. Let me think. So the relative speed is how one astronaut sees the other moving. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c and astronaut B at 0.5c, their relative speed should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me recheck the formula. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)) where u and v are their speeds relative to the same frame.

Wait, so in this case, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's perspective, B is moving at (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let's compute that.

Wait, but wait a second. The relative speed isn't just the difference because of the terms in the denominator. So let's plug in the numbers. u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c.

So numerator: 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c.

Denominator: 1 - (u v)/(c²)
