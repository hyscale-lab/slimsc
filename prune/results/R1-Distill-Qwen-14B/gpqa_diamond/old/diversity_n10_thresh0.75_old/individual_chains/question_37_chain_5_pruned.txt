Okay, I need to figure out the number of 13C-NMR signals for compound E. Hmm, let's break down each step of the reaction.

Starting with propionaldehyde. Its structure is CH3CH2CHO. The first reaction is with EDT and BF3. Wait, EDT is ethyl diethyl tin, right? And BF3 is a Lewis acid catalyst. Oh, that's a typical aldehyde to enol ether reaction. So propionaldehyde (A) would form an enol ether. The structure would be CH2CH2OCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. When it forms an enol ether, the aldehyde becomes an ether. So the enol ether would have the structure CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3? Or maybe CH2CH2OCH2CH3? Wait no, the enol ether should have a double bond adjacent to the oxygen. So perhaps it's CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So that's A.

Next, A reacts with BuLi. BuLi is a strong base. It's usually used for deprotonation. Where would it deprotonate here? The enol ether has an alpha position. The double bond is between C1 and C2 (if the O is at C2). So the structure is CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. The alpha carbons are the ones next to the oxygen. So the CH2=CH-O- would have the alpha carbons as CH2 and CH. Wait, propionaldehyde's enol ether would have the structure CH2CH2OCH2CH3? Or maybe I should draw it properly. Propionaldehyde is RCHO, R being CH2CH2. So the enol ether would be RCH=CH-O-R', where R' is ethyl. Wait, no, when the aldehyde (CHO) is converted to enol ether, the structure becomes CH2CH2OCH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps the enol ether is CH2=CHOCH2CH3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. When treated with EDT (which is a reagent for forming enol ethers) under BF3 catalysis, the aldehyde becomes an enol ether. The mechanism involves the aldehyde oxygen attacking the adjacent carbon, creating a double bond and forming an ether.

So the enol ether would have the structure CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. Wait, no, because the original aldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So the enol ether would be CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3? Or perhaps the structure is CH2CH2OCH2CH3 with a double bond?

Actually, let me think about the propionaldehyde structure. Propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. The enol ether would form when the aldehyde oxygen forms a double bond with the adjacent carbon. So the structure becomes CH2=CHOCH2CH3. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Maybe it's CH2=CH-O-CH2CH3. So the oxygen is between the two carbons. So A is CH2=CHOCH2CH3? Not sure. Maybe I should move on and come back to it.

Next step: A reacts with BuLi. BuLi is a strong base; it abstracts protons. Where are the acidic protons in A? Enol ethers typically have
