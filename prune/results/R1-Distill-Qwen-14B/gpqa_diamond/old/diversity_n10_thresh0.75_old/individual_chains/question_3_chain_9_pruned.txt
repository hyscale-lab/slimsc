Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, which I remember is the Pauli z-matrix. So, the question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Hmm. I think expectation values involve taking the state, applying the operator, and then taking the average. So, for an operator A, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, right?

But wait, the operator here is a combination of σz and σx. So I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx separately, then combine them with the coefficients.

Let me break this down. First, the given state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. I should probably normalize this state, but wait, does it already have a norm of 1?

Calculating the norm: |0.5|^2 + |sqrt(3)/2|^2. 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's already normalized. That's good, saves me a step.

So, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation separately.

First, what's ⟨σz⟩? Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩, and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ is the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their eigenvalues.

Wait, the state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. The expectation value of σz is then |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Because when you have an eigenstate, the expectation is just the eigenvalue times the probability.

So let's compute that. |a|^2 is (0.5)^2 =0.25. |b|^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 =3/4=0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(+1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, what about ⟨σx⟩? Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I'm a bit fuzzy on how that acts on the states. Wait, σx is the spin-flip operator. So σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. Alternatively, in terms of matrices, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when acting on |↑⟩, which is [1;0], σx gives [0;1], which is |↓⟩. Similarly, acting on |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

So to compute ⟨σx⟩, which is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Let me write ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ would be [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

Then, σx |ψ⟩ is [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ is the inner product of ψ with σx|ψ⟩.

So ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the inner product is:

0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Wait, because the first component is 0.5 (from ψ) multiplied by sqrt(3)/2 (from σx|ψ⟩), and the second component is (sqrt(3)/2) *0.5.

So each term is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5).

Adding them together: 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(
