Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, phase shifts are related to the scattering amplitude. 

Wait, the phase shifts are given as δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄, and the rest are ignored. So those are the l=0,1,2,3,4 phase shifts. The scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, right? The imaginary part of the amplitude for each partial wave contributes to the total scattering amplitude.

I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all the partial waves. Each partial wave has an amplitude with a phase factor. Specifically, the scattering amplitude is a sum of terms like (2l+1) * e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l) * (something with Legendre polynomials?), but wait, maybe for the imaginary part, I can find a simpler expression.

Oh right, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction) only involves the l=0 term because all the Legendre polynomials P_l(cosθ) evaluated at θ=0 are 1 for l=0, but for higher l, they are 1 only if l=0. Wait no, P_0 is 1, P_1 is cosθ, which at 0 is 1. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ)

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ,φ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ sum_{m=-l}^l (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l) e^{i m φ} P_l^m(cosθ)

But since in this problem we are looking along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0, and the scattering is symmetric in φ, so maybe the imaginary part depends only on the l=0 term because higher l terms would have P_l(cosθ) evaluated at 0 as 1 for some and other values for others. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The Legendre polynomial
