Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait. It says stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 can be observed. Oh wait, no, no, wait. The wording is tricky. So, the brightness is measured such that lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So, for a star to be observable, its apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to a certain value. 

So, ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than magnitude 17. That would mean apparent V magnitude <=17, because higher magnitudes are fainter. Wait, no. Wait, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter than 17, that means it's less than 17, because higher magnitude numbers are fainter. Oh, wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, apparent V mag <=17? Because if a star is brighter, it's V is smaller. So, for example, a V mag of 16 is brighter than 17. So, ESPRESSO can see stars with V mag ≤17. Similarly, HIRES can see stars brighter than 16 mag, so V mag ≤16.

So, to be detectable by both, a star must have V mag ≤16. Because if it's brighter than 17 (so V ≤17) and also brighter than 16 (so V ≤16), the tighter constraint is V ≤16.

Wait, no. Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me re-read that part.

Question states: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed."

Wait, so for ESPRESSO, the apparent V mag must be brighter than 17. Because, for example, a star that is brighter than (apparent V mag) 17. So V mag less than 17. Because higher magnitude is fainter. So, a star with V=17 is the limit for ESPRESS
