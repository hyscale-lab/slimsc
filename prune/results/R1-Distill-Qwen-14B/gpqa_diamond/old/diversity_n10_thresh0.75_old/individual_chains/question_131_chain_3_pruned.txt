Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So, the problem starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it becomes an anhydride. I remember that dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride, which is a good leaving group. The next part says that this anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in the 1H NMR. Hmm, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons show up, but wait, this is an anhydride. Anhydrides typically have carbonyl groups, but maybe the 7 ppm peak isn't from that. Oh wait, maybe the anhydride structure has some kind of substituted cyclopropane or something else. Or perhaps it's a cyclic anhydride, like a cyclic structure where the protons are in a ring.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows two peaks around 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is probably an sp² carbon, maybe part of a double bond. 165 is likely a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone or an ester or an anhydride. Since it's an anhydride, the carbonyls would be around there.

Then, this anhydride is reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So that's a diene with four methyl groups attached. I think 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, and when it reacts with an anhydride, it probably forms a Diels-Alder adduct, which is a [4+2] cycloaddition. But wait, the anhydride is a dienophile, right? Because the Diels-Alder reaction involves a diene and a dienophile.

Wait, the anhydride would have the structure where the oxygen is connected to two carbonyls. So in the Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile (anhydride) reacts with the diene (cyclopentadiene) to form a six-membered ring with an oxygen bridge or something like that.

The products formed are two: a major and a minor. Both have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. So the reaction probably leads to different regioisomers or maybe some stereochemistry.

Now, the 2D NOESY NMR spectra: the major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. NOESY cross-peaks indicate through-space interactions between protons that are close in space, not necessarily through bonds. So in the major product, there must be two protons that are close, which suggests a certain spatial arrangement, maybe in a ring structure.

Looking at the options, each option presents two resonances connected by a cross-peak. So, I need to figure out what those protons are.

Wait, the initial anhydride's structure is important here. Let me think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, which integrates to maybe a certain number of protons. But wait, the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. What structure would give a singlet at 7 ppm? Maybe a pair of equivalent protons in a symmetric environment. Like two equivalent vinyl protons or something like that.

Wait, the 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is probably an sp² carbon (like
