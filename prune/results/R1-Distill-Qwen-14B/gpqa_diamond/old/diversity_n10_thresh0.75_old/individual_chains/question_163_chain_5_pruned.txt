Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says that we want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required for this, along with the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. It's a weak base, right? So when it dissolves in water, it should react with an acid. Oh wait, the problem says it's being dissolved in a strong monobasic acid, which would be something like HCl or HNO3. Since it's a monobasic strong acid, it'll donate one H+ ion and completely dissociate.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be helpful here. Let me calculate that. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1 = 3
Total = 55.85 + 48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that: 0.1 divided by about 106.85 is around 0.000936 mol.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when it reacts with a strong acid, it should neutralize to form iron(III) salt. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Wait, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 would react with 3 moles of H+ ions.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So 0.000936 mol * 3 = 0.002809 mol of H+.

Now, the acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 mol per liter (or 100 cm³). So to find the volume needed, I can use the formula:

Molarity = moles / volume (in liters)
Rearranging, volume = moles / Molarity.

So volume V = 0.002809 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02809 liters, which is 28.09 cm³. Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the question is about dissolving in 100 cm³ total volume
