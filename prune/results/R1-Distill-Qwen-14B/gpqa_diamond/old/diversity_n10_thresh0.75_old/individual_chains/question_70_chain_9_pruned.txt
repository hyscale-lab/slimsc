Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got a chemistry problem here, and I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups can be a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll try to reconstruct the reactions given. There are a few steps described, so I'll break them down.

1. Reaction of solid A with 8 equivalents of gas B forms bright red product C. 
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I should identify the possible compounds based on these reactions. Let's think about each reaction.

Starting with reaction 1: Solid A reacts with gas B (8 equivalents) to form C. Bright red product C—what's bright red? Maybe something like sulfur trioxide? Or perhaps lead(II,IV) oxide, but that's more yellow. Wait, another thought: maybe it's a reaction involving nitric oxide or something similar. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide or some other compound.

Wait, another angle: since C is formed when A reacts with B in a 8:1 ratio. 8 equivalents could suggest something like a multi-step reaction where B is in excess. Maybe B is a diatomic gas, like O2? Let's think. If B is O2, then 8 equivalents would be a lot. But I'm not sure yet.

Moving to reaction 4: D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include things like water, ethanol, maybe ether. If B is O2, then D plus O2 gives H. Alternatively, if B is Cl2, maybe D is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is H2 and D is Cl2? No, because then H would be HCl, but that's a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, suppose B is O2 and D is something like C (carbon). Then H might be CO or CO2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps H is something like H2O? Wait, if B is O2 and D is H2, then H would be H2O. That makes sense because H2O is a common solvent. So, if reaction 4 is D + B → H, and H is H2O, then D is H2 and B is O2? Because H2 + O2 → H2O. That makes sense. So B is O2 and D is H2?

Wait, but in reaction 4, it's a 1:1 ratio. H2 and O2 combine in a 2:1 ratio to form H2O. So maybe that's a point of confusion. Alternatively, perhaps D is another diatomic gas, like Cl2 or F2, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me think about reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid. Strong acids like H2SO4 or HCl
