Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that there are two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds respectively. We need to find the energy difference between them so that they can be clearly distinguished. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember something about the uncertainty principle here. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties can be known, like energy and time.

The formula I think is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, ħ is approximately 1.0545718 × 10^-34 J·s. But sometimes when dealing with energy and lifetime, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (or time uncertainty). So maybe the uncertainty in energy ΔE is about ħ divided by the lifetime τ.

Wait, the question is about the energy difference between E2 and E1. To clearly distinguish them, their energy difference should be greater than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Otherwise, the two states might not be resolvable.

Wait, each state has its own lifetime. So for E1, the uncertainty ΔE1 would be ħ/ τ1, and for E2, ΔE2 = ħ/ τ2. But which one matters for the resolution?

Wait, actually, the energy difference between the two levels needs to be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Or perhaps the energy difference should be larger than the sum or something else. Let me think.

Wait, no. To resolve two states, the energy difference between them should be greater than the combined uncertainty of their energy measurements. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, each state's energy has an uncertainty. But when you're trying to distinguish between two states, the minimum energy difference between them should be greater than the sum of their individual uncertainties, perhaps? Or maybe just that each must have an uncertainty smaller than the difference.

Alternatively, another approach: for a state with a shorter lifetime, the energy is less certain. So the energy spread for a shorter-lived state is larger.

Wait, the lifetimes here are given—10^-9 seconds for E1 and 10^-8 for E2. So τ1=1e-9, τ2=1e-8. Since τ2 is longer, its energy uncertainty is smaller than that of E1.

So the energy difference between E2 and E1 should be larger than the sum of their respective uncertainties? Or perhaps the maximum between them.

Wait, maybe the energy difference must be greater than the uncertainty of each. If the energy separation is much larger than either uncertainty, then the states are well-separated.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference ΔE should be at least the maximum of the two individual uncertainties. Because if the difference is larger than the uncertainty in each, then they don't overlap.

Wait, let me think about it. Suppose E1 has an uncertainty ΔE1 = ħ/τ1, E2 has ΔE2= ħ/τ2. Since τ2 is larger (1e-8 s), ΔE2 is smaller than ΔE1.

So, ΔE = |E2 - E1| must be greater than the maximum of ΔE1 and ΔE2. Because if the separation is larger than the bigger of the two uncertainties, then the two states are distinguishable.

Let me compute the uncertainties.

First, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. But since the options are in eV, I'll need to convert units.

1 eV is 1.602e-19 joules. So, 1 J is 1/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

Wait, maybe I can compute ΔE in eV.

Let's compute ħ in eV·s.

Since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, and ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ in eV·s is (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ) = approximately (1.05457e-34)/(1.602e-19) ) eV·s.

Calculating that: 1.05457e-34 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

So, ħ ≈ 6.582e-16 eV·s.

Now, for E1, τ1 is 1e-9 s. So ΔE1 = ħ / τ1 ≈ 6.582e-16 / 1e-9 = 6.582e-7 eV.

Similarly, for E2, τ2 =1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 6.582e-16 / 1e-8 = 6.582e-8 eV.

So ΔE1 is about 6.58e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.58e-8 eV.

So the bigger uncertainty is ΔE1 = ~6.6e-7 eV.

Therefore, the energy difference between E1 and E2 needs to be greater than 6.6e-7 eV to be distinguishable.

Wait, but the options are 1e-9, 1e-11, 1e-4, 1e-8 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is
