Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to think through it. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, sounds a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, a neutralization reaction can happen. Since there are two acids (CH3COOH and HCl) and one base (Ba(OH)2), I think I need to figure out how much of each is present and then see if they neutralize each other.

Let me write down the volumes and concentrations:

- CH3COOH: 500 mL (0.5 L) of 0.1 M. So moles = 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles.
- HCl: 400 mL (0.4 L) of 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 moles.
- Ba(OH)2: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- = 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix everything, the total volume changes. The total volume is 500 + 400 +300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

But before considering the total volume, I should think about the reaction between the acids and the base. Let's see.

HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it will dissociate completely into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions.

So the reaction between the acids and the base. Since both acids are present, the base will neutralize them. But wait, since HCl is a strong acid, it will react first, probably.

So the total H+ from both acids before neutralization would be from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is weak, so it contributes some H+ but not fully. Hmm, but when mixing with a strong base, maybe the OH- will neutralize the H+ from both acids.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's calculate the total H+ and OH- moles.

HCl is a strong acid, so it contributes H+ equal to 0.08 moles. CH3COOH contributes some H+ but it's a weak acid, so I can't just take 0.05 moles of H+ from it. Hmm, but when a weak acid is in solution, especially when also mixed with a strong base, the situation might be different. Maybe the H+ from CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2, but HCl's H+ will also react.

Wait, perhaps I should first find the total H+ and OH- moles.

Wait, let's compute moles of H+:

HCl gives 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But when a weak acid is in solution, the H+ it can contribute is less than its initial moles. However, in this problem, since we're mixing with a strong base, maybe the H+ from all sources will react with the OH-.

So, the total H+ available is from HCl and CH3COOH. But since CH3COOH is weak, maybe when mixing with OH-, it will dissociate more. Alternatively, perhaps the OH- will react with H+ from both sources.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid; all of its H+ is available. CH3COOH, being weak, contributes some H+ but not all. So when OH- is present, it will neutralize the H+ from the strongest acid first, which is HCl. Then, any remaining OH- will neutralize the CH3COOH's H+.

Let me think. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles. The H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles, and from CH3COOH, let's say it's x moles.

Wait, but actually, the CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when mixed with a strong base, it will partially neutralize.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to consider the overall reaction. Let me see:

The OH- will react with both H+ from HCl and from CH3COOH.

So
