Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. Let's see: the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering is important. Let me draw it mentally. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). So the substituents are at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), and 3 (nitro).

Wait, but benzene's numbering is such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So maybe the numbering is as follows: the ethoxy is in position 1, nitro in position 3, and tert-butyl in position 2. Alternatively, maybe it's 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they're adjacent? Hmm, perhaps I should think of the substituents as being in the ortho, meta positions relative to each other.

Wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the benzene ring has the ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So positions 1, 2, 3 are all adjacent? Like 1 is OEt, 2 is t-Bu, 3 is NO2. So that's like a meta arrangement for some groups, but since 1 and 3 are meta to each other, but 2 is adjacent to both. Hmm, perhaps it's a vicinal arrangement for some substituents.

Wait, maybe it's easier to approach this by considering the synthesis steps. Starting with benzene, we need to add substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Each substituent is either activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directing.

Let's list the substituents:

1. Ethoxy (OEt): This is an activating group because it's an ether. It's an ortho/para director.

2. tert-butyl (t-Bu): This is a bulky, activating group (alkyl group). It's an ortho/para director as well, but because of its bulk, it's more likely to direct incoming electrophiles to the para position rather than ortho, but it's still ortho/para.

3. Nitro (NO2): This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but when we add substituents, the order in which they are added will affect where the next substituent goes. Because the existing substituents can direct incoming groups.

So the target has three substituents: OEt, t-Bu, and NO2. So the question is, in which order should these be added to benz
