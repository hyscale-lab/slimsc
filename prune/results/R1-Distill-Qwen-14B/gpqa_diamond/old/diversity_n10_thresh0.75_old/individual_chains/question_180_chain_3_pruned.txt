Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let's see if I can figure it out. Hmm, the problem states that there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the thirteenth charge is fixed at P. So the setup is that one charge is at the center, and the other twelve are arranged around it, each at a distance of 2 meters from P. 

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges is related to the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, since the system is isolated and the charges are placed in their positions, we need to calculate the total potential energy stored in the system.

Wait, but when arranging multiple charges, each pair contributes to the potential energy. The formula for the electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But since energy is a scalar, we'll sum this for all pairs.

But wait, in this case, there are 13 charges. One is fixed at P, and the other twelve are at 2 meters. So the potential energy comes from two types of interactions: the twelve charges each interacting with the central charge, and the interactions among the twelve charges themselves. 

Wait, but the problem specifies that the twelve are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So the central charge is fixed, so when we bring each of the twelve charges into place, each will interact with the central charge. Do the twelve charges themselves interact with each other? Since they're all at the same distance from P, I suppose their distances from each other depend on how they're arranged. But the problem doesn't specify their arrangement. Hmm, that complicates things. Wait, the problem is about the minimum energy. Maybe the minimum occurs when the twelve charges are equally spaced around P, but perhaps their mutual repulsion is considered. But wait, if they're all at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances could vary. But the problem states that the charges are identical and have the same charge. So they will repel each other, but since they're fixed at 2 meters from P, their mutual distances might be in a regular arrangement, like on a sphere, but perhaps for minimum energy, we can consider their mutual interactions.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the twelve charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions are fixed relative to P. So when calculating the potential energy, we have two contributions: the potential energy between each of the twelve charges and the central charge, and the potential energy between each pair of the twelve charges.

But wait, the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the twelve charges are arranged in such a way that the mutual repulsion is minimized. Alternatively, since the problem doesn't specify their arrangement, maybe we can ignore their mutual interactions because they are constrained. Hmm, but I think that wouldn't make sense because the mutual potential energy would still contribute to the total. So perhaps I should include both contributions
