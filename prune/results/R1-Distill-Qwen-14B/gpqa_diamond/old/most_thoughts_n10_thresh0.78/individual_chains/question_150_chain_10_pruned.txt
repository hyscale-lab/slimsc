Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C is 8, H is 9, N is 1, O is 1. So plugging in: (2*8 + 2 - 9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could be, for example, a benzene ring (which is 3 double bonds equivalent) and a couple more rings or double bonds. 

Looking at the NMR data: 

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That high chemical shift is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests maybe coupling with two neighboring protons, but wait, the aldehyde is usually at the end, so maybe it's adjacent to a CH2. Or perhaps it's a conjugated aldehyde. 

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. Probably aromatic protons, maybe ortho to a substituent. 

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic, perhaps para to something else.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group. Or maybe it's a vinyl proton near an electronegative group. 

- 3.66 ppm, doublet, 2H. That's probably a CH2 group, maybe adjacent to an oxygen. Like OCH2 or something. The doublet suggests it's next to another CH2 or maybe a CH group. 

Putting this together, maybe the structure has a benzene ring with substituents, an aldehyde group, and some oxygen-containing groups. The initial thought is that the compound could be a diphenyl compound with some substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: benzene is 6 carbons. So the remaining 2 carbons plus one N and O. So maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with another benzene ring attached and perhaps an amino group or an oxygen-containing group.

Wait, the NMR shows an aldehyde (9.72 ppm), and some aromatic protons. Also, the 3.66 ppm CH2 could be adjacent to oxygen, maybe an ether or an ester, but the formula doesn't have enough oxygens for an ester. Alternatively, maybe a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2.

So, perhaps the structure is something like benzaldehyde with another substituent. Let me think about the substituents. The 6.98 and 6.51 ppm are probably para-substituted aromatic protons. For example, if we have two benzene rings connected, each with substituents. Or maybe one benzene ring with a substituent that's another ring.

Wait, the compound's formula is C8H9NO. So 8 carbons, one N, one O. Let's consider a possible structure. Maybe it's a diphenylmethanol derivative but with an aldehyde group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like a benzaldehyde attached to another benzene ring via a chain that includes an oxygen. Let me think.

Looking at the reagents: first is NaNO2 and HCl. That's typically used for diazotization, which is usually done with aromatic amines. So the starting compound probably has an aromatic amine group. Wait, but the molecular formula includes an O. So maybe it's an aromatic amine with an oxygen elsewhere.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show a peak that would correspond to an aromatic amine. The aldehyde is at 9.72, and there's a broad singlet at 6.27, maybe an -OH. Oh, wait, maybe the structure has a phenol group. So an aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but if the first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl, that's for diazotization, which requires an aromatic amine. So in the starting compound, there must be an -NH2 group attached to an aromatic ring. Because NaNO2/HCl is used to form a diazonium salt.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So if there's an NH2 group, we have N in the formula, which is accounted for.

So the initial structure has an aromatic amine and an aldehyde group. Let me think: Benzaldehyde with an amino group attached somewhere.

But looking at the NMR, the only aromatic protons are the ones in the ranges we saw. The aldehyde is at 9.72, and the other aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests that the benzene rings are para-substituted.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a diphenylamine derivative. Let me imagine a benzene ring with an amino group and another substituent. But then, in the NMR, I would expect some aromatic protons. Alternatively, the amino group could be substituted with another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diphenylmethane with an aldehyde and an amino group. Wait, but the formula is C8H9NO. Let's count: two benzene rings (each 6 carbons) would be 12, which is more than 8. Oops, no, the formula is C8H9NO. So perhaps it's a benzene ring attached to a two-carbon chain that includes an aldehyde and an amino group.

Wait, maybe it's something like a benzene ring connected to a three-carbon chain that includes an aldehyde and an amino group. Let me think: benzene-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, that would be more carbons than allowed.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzaldehyde with another substituent, like a hydroxyl group. Alternatively, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the reagents again.

The first reagent is NaNO2 and HCl. That's for diazotization, so the starting compound must have an aromatic amine. Then, the second reagent is H2O. Third is aqueous KOH and heat. 

So, the reaction sequence is:

1. Diazotization: Ar-NH2 â†’ Ar-N2+Cl^-
