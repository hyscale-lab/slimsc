Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

First, the problem describes a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, giving two products—a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. Then, their NOESY NMR spectra are considered, and the major product shows a cross-peak that the minor doesn't. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

Starting with the dehydration of the dicarboxylic acid. Dicarboxylic acids when dehydrated usually form anhydrides. Since the starting material is a cis-alkene, when dehydrated, the anhydride would probably form a cyclic structure, maybe a cyclic anhydride. Wait, the anhydride has a single peak in the 1H NMR at 7 ppm. That's a high ppm, so maybe it's an aromatic proton? Or perhaps an olefinic proton? Wait, 7 ppm is more in the aromatic region. But the problem says it's an anhydride. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system with some double bonds. Oh wait, the starting material has a cis-alkene, so the dehydration would form an anhydride with possibly a conjugated double bond.

Looking at the NMR data: 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. So it's a singlet integrating for one proton? Or maybe more than one but as a singlet. Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "a single peak (7 ppm)"—so maybe it's a singlet with only one proton? Or maybe more, but they all are equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps the aromatic protons are all the same, like in a symmetrical structure. Wait, but let's think about the 13C spectrum. The 13C has two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Those are probably a double bond carbon and a carbonyl carbon. Because 137 ppm is about where a sp² carbon (like a double bond) would be, and 165 is a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester or anhydride.

So the anhydride has a double bond (since it came from a cis-alkene) and an anhydride carbonyl. Maybe it's a six-membered cyclic anhydride? Because that would explain the 1H NMR—possibly one equivalent proton in the ring, like a bridgehead or something. Wait, but for a six-membered cyclic anhydride, the structure would have two ester groups connected. Alternatively, perhaps a bicyclic structure.

Wait, but maybe the anhydride is from a diacid where the two acid groups are adjacent, leading to a cyclic anhydride with a double bond. Let's say, for example, something like a bicyclic structure with a conjugated double bond.

But perhaps that's getting ahead of myself. Let's think about the reaction next. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a diene, and the tetramethyl substituents are on all four positions of the cyclopentadiene. So that's 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. It looks like a cyclopentane ring with two double bonds? Wait, no. Wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene has conjugated double bonds at positions 1 and 3. So structure is a cyclopentene with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. So it's a conjugated diene, and each of the positions 1,2,3,4 has a methyl group. So the structure would have four methyl groups attached to the cyclopentadiene.

So when the anhydride reacts with this diene, what kind of reaction is happening? Anhydrides can undergo various reactions with dienes, perhaps Diels-Alder reactions. Oh, wait, the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is a conjugated diene. So the anhydride might act as a dienophile. So the reaction is a Diels-Alder between the diene and the anhydride.

Wait, but in a Diels-Alder, the diene is the conjugated diene (like 1,3-butadiene), and the dienophile is something like a carbonyl group (like an anhydride, which has two carbonyls). So in this case, the anhydride would be the dienophile. So the cyclopentadiene would react with the anhydride in a Diels-Alder to form a six-membered bicyclic ring.

Wait, but the product would be a six-membered ring with substituents. Let's think about the structure. The diene is 1,2,3,4
