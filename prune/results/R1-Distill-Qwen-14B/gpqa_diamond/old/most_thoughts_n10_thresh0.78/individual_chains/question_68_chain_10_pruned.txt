Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have their magnetic moments related to their spin. The question says that the particle's magnetic moment mu is gamma times S_z. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio.

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's moment is aligned with this field. Then the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. What happens when the magnetic field changes direction? I think when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian governing the spin precession changes too. The spin will start precessing around the new field direction.

The original magnetic field was along Z. So the initial Hamiltonian was proportional to S_z. When the field switches to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. But wait, I think when the field changes direction, the spin will start precessing around that new axis. So the oscillations in the expectation value of S_z must be related to the transition between spin states.

I remember that in such situations, the energy levels split due to the magnetic field, and the oscillations in expectation values come from transitions between these energy eigenstates. The energy difference between the states is what gives the frequency of oscillation.

So the energy levels for a spin-1/2 in a magnetic field B along a direction (say, n) are given by E = ± (gamma * B / 2) * something... Wait, more accurately, the Zeeman effect. The energy is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field. So E = -mu·B. But mu is gamma * S, so E = -gamma * B · S.

Wait, but for spin-1/2, S can be in any direction. So when B is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma * B S_y. Wait, or is it H = -gamma B S_y? Because the energy is -mu·B, and mu is gamma S. So H = -gamma B S_y? Or maybe I should double-check the signs. Oh, right, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy is E = -mu·B = -gamma (S · B). So here, B is along Y, so E = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, no. Wait, the Hamiltonian is H = -mu·B, which is -gamma S · B. So if B is in the +Y direction, then H = -gamma B S_y. But for spin-1/2, S_y has eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = (-gamma B)(ħ/2) * (1/2) ? Wait, no, wait. S is in units of ħ/2 for spin-1/2. So S_y has eigenvalues ± (ħ/2). So H's eigenvalues would be E = -gamma B (ħ/2
