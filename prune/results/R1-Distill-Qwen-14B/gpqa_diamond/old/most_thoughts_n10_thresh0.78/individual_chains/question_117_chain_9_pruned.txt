Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism... I think that has to do with molecules that can rotate plane-polarized light because they have chiral centers. Right, chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, the molecule isn't symmetrical, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists four organic compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at 6,6' and 2,2'. Wait, the positions are 6 and 2 on each ring? Let me visualize this. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate group at 2. The molecule is symmetrical because the substituents are mirrored on each ring. So, does that mean it's not chiral? Because symmetry usually leads to no optical isomerism. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, the mirror images would be the same, so no enantiomers. So this compound probably doesn't show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is like CH3C(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, more accurately, propanoate would be CH2CH2COO-. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH2OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon. So the structure is CH2OH-CH2-COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxy would be on the middle carbon, making it HOCH2COOCH3.

Wait, but the structure is 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is HOCH2COO- as the anion, then methyl ester. So the molecule is HOCH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (the second carbon) is connected to: hydroxyl (OH), two CH2 groups (one from the methyl ester and one from the CH2 group?), and the other side? Wait, let me draw this. The central carbon (carbon 2) has:

- One -O-CH3 group (from the ester)
- One -COOCH3 group (wait, no, the ester is methyl, so it's OCH3. So the structure is CH2(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, no. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, wait, no, wait: propanoate is CH3CH2COO-; 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. Propanoate is -OOCR, where R is CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. But if it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, that would be the case if the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the carbon chain is:

Carbon 1: COOCH3
Carbon 2: OH and CH2-
Wait, perhaps it's better written as HOCH2COOCH2CH3? No, wait, the name is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the ester is methyl. Propanoate has three carbons. Let me count. The formula is:

The propanoate is CH2CH2COOCH3? Wait, no. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO- with an ester group.
