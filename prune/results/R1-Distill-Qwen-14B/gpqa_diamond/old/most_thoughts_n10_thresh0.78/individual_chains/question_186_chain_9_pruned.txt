Okay, so I've got this Cope rearrangement problem in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let's try to think this through.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene part is like norbornene, right? Norbornene has that bridge structure with two double bridges. And the 5-ene means the double bond is between carbons 5 and maybe 6, but I'll need to draw it out.

Wait, the substituent is 2-vinyl. So the vinyl group is attached to carbon 2 of the bicyclo structure. And since it's 2-azabicyclo, that means there's a nitrogen in one of the bridge positions. Oh wait, azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene—so the nitrogen is at position 1, maybe? Or position 2? Wait, the numbering for bicyclo systems can be a bit tricky. For [2.2.1], the numbering starts at the bridgehead. So positions 1 and 4 are bridgeheads, I think.

So in azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene, the nitrogen is at position 1 because it's the first bridgehead. So the structure is a norbornene-like molecule with a vinyl group attached at position 2, and a double bond at position 5.

Now, the reaction is a Cope rearrangement. Cope is for 1,5-dienes, right? It's a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. So I need to identify the 1,5-diene in this structure.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl group is a CH2-CH2 (but actually it's CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so CH2=). So the structure would have a bridge with a double bond elsewhere.

Let me try to sketch this. The bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene would have a bridge from C1 to C4, and another bridge from C2 to C5. The double bond is between C5 and C6. Oh wait, no—bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the double bond is between C5 and C6. So the double bonds are in the bridges. Wait, no—bicyclo structures have bridge double bonds, so in norbornene, the double bond is between C5 and C6.

So the substituents: at C2, there's a vinyl group. So that's a CH2-CH2 group attached to C2. But wait, the vinyl is a CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons. So it's a CH2=CH- group attached to C2.

Hmm. So the molecule I'm looking at is like norbornene with a CH2=CH- group attached at C2. Now, for the Cope rearrangement, I need
