Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about two reactions. The first reaction is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. The second reaction uses pentane-2,4-dione and treats it with excess NaBH4, then an acidic workup. After the reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is how many peaks the chemist will see in each.

Hmm. I'll need to think about what each reaction does and what the products are.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually reduces ketones. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at C3. So when reduced, it would become a secondary alcohol. Wait, but hexan-3-one is (CH2)2COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, the structure is more like CH2CH2-C-O-CH2CH2-OCH3? Wait, no, let me get this right.

Wait, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the formula is CH3CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO something. Let's draw the structure.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at position 3. The (S) configuration at position 5, which is the methoxy group. So the molecule is:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2- something? Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But wait, the position is 5-methoxy. So at position 5, which is the third carbon from the end? Let me count the carbons.

Wait, the carbons are numbered from 1 to 6. 3 is the ketone. So position 5 is the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH-OCH3
6: CH3?

Wait no, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexane has six carbons. So 3-ketone would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

So position 5 is the fifth carbon, which is the CH2 group next to CO. So 5-methoxy would be a methoxy group on the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH
