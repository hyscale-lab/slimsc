Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to unpack all the information given and see where it leads me.

First, the problem describes mixture X, which is an equimolar mixture of two liquids. These liquids can decolorize bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually happens due to addition reactions, like with alkenes or alkynes. So the liquids in X probably have double or triple bonds.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum under heat, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Mixture Y is also equimolar but consists of two different liquids. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Oh wait, because if the substances in Y don't have double or triple bonds anymore, maybe they're saturated now. So X probably had unsaturated bonds, and Y's components are more saturated.

The next part says that hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, hydrocarbon Z. Z is a constituent of Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, which probably means it's fully saturated—no more double or triple bonds to hydrogenate.

The composition of Z is given: mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate that. 14.28% is approximately 1/7, since 14.28 is roughly 1/7 of 100. So if the mass is 100g, 14.28g is H, and 85.72g is C.

Hydrocarbons are made of C and H. The molecular formula of Z must be such that the mass percentage of H is 14.28%. Let me think about possible formulas. Let's denote the formula as CnHm.

The mass percentage of H is (m*(1))/(12n + m) * 100 = 14.28%. So,

(m / (12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

Simplify:

m / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = 0.1428 * (12n + m)

Bring all terms to left:

m - 0.1428m = 0.1428 *12n

m(1 - 0.1428) = 1.7136n

m * 0.8572 = 1.7136n

Divide both sides by 0.8572:

m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n

Calculate 1.7136 / 0.8572. Let me see: 0.8572 is about 6/7, because 6/7 is approximately 0.8571. So 1.7136 is about 12/7 (since 12/7≈1.714). So (12/7)/(6/7) )= (12/7)*(7/6) = 2. So m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. Wait, that's the formula for an alkene (if n is the number of carbons, and 2n H's). But wait, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated. So wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, wait, no. If Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react with hydrogen, it can't have any double or triple bonds. So it must be a single-bonded structure, like an alkane. But the formula CnH2n implies an alkene. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps miscalculation. Let's re-calculate m:

We have m/(12n + m) = 0.1428 → m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

Let me compute 0.1428*(12n + m) = 0.1428*12n + 0.1428 m → m = 1.7136 n + 0.1428 m

Subtract 0.1428 m from both sides:

m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136n → m*(1 - 0.1428) = 1.7136n → m*(0.8572) = 1.7136n

So m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) * n → 1.7136 divided by 0.8572 is approximately 2. So m = 2n.

So Z is CnH2n. But that's an alkene, which should react with hydrogen. Oh wait, but the problem says Z doesn't react further. So perhaps Z is a cycloalkane, which doesn't have double bonds but is cyclic. But then, cycloalkanes can hydrogenate if they have rings, but maybe under the conditions used, the hydrogenation doesn't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps Z is a fully saturated compound but without any double or triple bonds. Wait, but if m=2n, then it's an alkene. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the percentage.

Wait, the mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate exact numbers. Let me suppose the molecular weight is M, with m H atoms.

Hydrogen mass is m * 1 g/mol. Carbon mass is n *12 g/mol.

So (m)/(12n + m) = 0.1428 → m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

Expanding: m = 1.7136 n + 0.1428 m → m - 0.1428 m = 1.7136n → m = (1.7136 / 0.8572) n → 1.7136 divided by 0.8572 is approximately 2. So m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene, but Z doesn't react with H2. Hmmm. So perhaps Z is something else. Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? No, cyclopropane is C3H6, which is an alkene. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring structure without double bonds. Wait, no, cycloalkanes like cyclopropane have rings but no double bonds. Wait, no, cycloalkanes have single bonds but are cyclic; some can be strained but not necessarily reactive towards hydrogenation. Maybe. Alternatively, perhaps Z is a fully saturated compound but without any double bonds, which would mean it's a single-bonded structure. But for a CnH2n, that would imply an alkene. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do the exact calculation:

We have m/(12n + m) = 14.28/100 = 0.1428.

So m = 0.1428*(12n + m)

Multiply both sides by 1000 to eliminate decimals:

1000 m = 142.8*(12n + m)

1000 m = 1713.6n + 142.8m

Bring terms with m to left:

1000m - 142.8m = 1713.6n → 857.2 m = 1713.6n → m = (1713.6 / 857.2) * n ≈ 2.0 * n

So yes, m=2n.

So Z is CnH2n, which is an alkene. But Z doesn't react further with H2, which is confusing. So maybe Z is not an alkene, but another structure that has H2n but not double bonds. Wait, perhaps Z is a cyclic alkane, such as
