Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says that a small peptidic compound was chemically synthesized. They're looking at the 1H NMR and LC-MS data. So, the NMR spectrum looks mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. They mention that spin-spin coupling is ruled out based on the coupling pattern. Then the LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, matching the expected molecule.

Hmm, I need to figure out what's causing these observations. Let's break down each part.

First, the NMR part. Normally, an alpha-proton (like in a CH group) would give a single peak. But here, there are two peaks for the same proton. They have similar shifts and integrate to 1H together. So, it's not splitting due to coupling because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it. Maybe it's something else causing a doublet, but the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out. That makes me think it's not about neighboring protons. What else could cause a double peak?

Wait, another possibility: diastereotopic protons. Oh wait, no, diastereotopic protons would have different shifts, right? Because they're in different environments. So if the shifts are similar, that's not diastereotopic. Or maybe it's something else. Or maybe it's about the compound being a mixture of different forms, like diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, the question mentions that the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. Same mass would suggest same molecular weight, so if the molecular formula is the same, but the structure might have some stereochemistry. Because if it's two different structures with same molecular weight, but the LC-MS shows same mass, that suggests same molecular weight. So maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomer.

Now, the NMR seeing two peaks for the same proton. If the compound is a racemic mixture, that is, a 50:50 mix of enantiomers, each enantiomer would have the same NMR peaks because the environment is mirrored. So in that case, the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton unless there's something else.

Wait, but in the NMR, the same alpha proton in each enantiomer would have the same shift. So the integral would look like 1H, but since both enantiomers are present, why two peaks? Unless there's something else causing the splitting. Hmm.

Wait, wait, maybe it's not enantiomers but diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But wait, the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. Maybe the diastereomers are close enough in structure that the alpha protons have similar shifts, leading to overlapping peaks that split into two. Or maybe the diastereomers have the same shift, but that's unlikely.

Another angle: if the compound is a mixture of two diastereomers, each would have their own set of protons, but perhaps in this case, the alpha protons are in a position where their shifts are very similar, leading to two overlapping peaks. Or, more accurately, the two diastereomers each contribute a peak for the same proton, but with slightly different chemical shifts, but in this case, the shifts are similar. So the NMR would show two peaks, each integrating to 1H each (since each diastereomer contributes 1H each, but together they add up to 2H? Wait, but the question says the integral together is 1H, which is the expected. So that's confusing.

Wait, the question says the two peaks integrate to 1H together. So each peak is about 0.5H.

Wait, but if the compound is a racemic mixture of enantiomers, each enantiomer would have the same number of protons, but their NMR would superimpose. So the integrals would add up, but the peaks would be the same. So if you have a 50:50 mixture, the NMR would show a single peak because both enantiomers contribute the same shift. So that wouldn't explain two peaks.

So maybe the problem is not about enantiomers. What else?

Ah, wait. Let's think about the LC-MS. It shows two peaks of same mass, and same mass spectrum. Same mass would mean same molecular weight, same molecular formula, which suggests the same compound or diastereomers. Because enantiomers have the same molecular weight as well.

But in LC-MS, if you have a racemic mixture, you'd see only one peak because the two enantiomers would co-elute (since they have the same polarity), but wait, sometimes chiral columns can separate them, but the question says the LC-MS was run at elevated temperature. Maybe the mobile phase or temperature affected the separation. But the question states two peaks of equal intensity, same mass, same mass spectrum.

So the same mass suggests same molecular formula. So the two compounds are either enantiomers or diastereomers.

Now, back to the NMR. Two peaks for the same alpha proton. If the two compounds are diastereomers, their alpha protons could have slightly different shifts, leading to two peaks. But the shifts are similar, so perhaps they have the same or very similar environments.

Wait, but if the molecule is a diastereomer, the environment of the alpha proton would be different, leading to different shifts. So the two peaks would be slightly different, but maybe in this case, the shifts are so similar that the peaks are close but not overlapping. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts. So this could be possible.

But another possibility is that the molecule has some kind of stereocenter that's not set, leading to a mix of different diastereomers.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of a double bond with E and Z isomerism. But that would lead to different shifts.

Wait, but the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. If the molecule has a double bond with a trans and cis configuration, but the alpha protons are in the same environment, maybe the coupling isn't different. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another possibility is that the molecule has an impurity. But the question says the NMR is consistent except for the two peaks. So probably not an impurity.

Wait, the options are:

A) Contaminated with a precursor: That would mean another compound with a lower molecular weight. But the LC-MS shows same mass as expected, so that's not the case.

B) Mixture of enantiomers: If it's a racemic mix, the NMR would show the same as a pure sample because enantiomers have same shifts. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks; it would show one. So this might not explain the two peaks.

C) 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. This is a term I'm less familiar with. Wait, when forming an amide bond, sometimes you can get some side reactions. Maybe double coupling refers to some sort of coupling that leads to two different linkages or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the formation of an amide leading to two different diastereomers. I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's about the presence of two different stereoisomers at a certain position.

D) Mixture of diastereoisomers. So if the molecule has more than one stereocenter, and the reaction didn't fully control the stereochemistry, leading to a mixture of diastereomers. Each diastereomer would have different NMR shifts, but in this case, the alpha proton's shifts are similar. So perhaps the two diastereomers have the same or similar chemical shifts for that proton.

Wait, but diastereomers usually have different shifts. So why would the shifts be similar? Maybe the diastereomers are such that the alpha protons are in very similar environments.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is a mixture of two diastereomers where the alpha protons are affected by different stereocenters, but the shifts are quite similar. So in NMR, each diastereomer contributes a peak, making two peaks for the same proton.

But then the question says the integrals are roughly equal and sum to 1H. So if each diastereomer contributes 0.5H, that would mean each is present in 50% amount, but that's unclear because each molecule would have one alpha proton. Wait, not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule has a stereocenter, but due to some kind of dynamic process, like a rapidly interconverting diastereomer, but that sounds more like a case for a singlet due to fast exchange.

Wait, but the NMR shows two separate peaks for the same proton, so the interconversion must be slow enough on the NMR timescale. So if the two diastereomers are in equilibrium and interconvert, but the rate is slow, then you might see separate peaks. But that's more about enantiomers, isn't it? No, wait, diastereomers can also interconvert, but it's less common. For example, in some epimerizations.

But in this case, if the molecule has a stereocenter that is not fixed, like an alpha stereochemistry, and during synthesis, it forms a mixture of diastereomers, then in the NMR, each diastereomer would cause a peak for the alpha proton. So two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H, but the total is 1H. So that would fit.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me reevaluate.

The key observations:

1. NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton, same integral (1H), similar shifts.

2. LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass, same mass spec.

So the same mass in LC-MS suggests same molecular formula, same molecular weight, so either enantiomers or diastereomers.

In NMR, if it's enantiomers, the peaks would be the same, so no two peaks. So probably not enantiomers.

If it's diastereomers, each would have different shifts. But the shifts are similar. So maybe the diastereomers are such that the alpha protons have similar shifts.

So, the NMR would show two peaks for that proton, each from a different diastereomer.

In that case, the NMR would show two separate peaks, each integrating to 1H (if each diastereomer is present in equal amounts), but the question says the integrals together are 1H. So each peak is 0.5H. So each diastereomer contributes 0.5H? That doesn't quite make sense because each molecule would have one alpha proton. So if the mixture is 50% each, each would contribute 0.5H, but wait, the integral adds up to 1H, which is correct.

But wait, in a racemic mix, each enantiomer contributes 1H, but since they are same shift, it's one peak. So that's not the case here.

So the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same integral (1H), similar shifts. So, the most likely explanation is that the molecule exists as a mixture of diastereomers. Each has its own alpha proton with similar shifts, resulting in two peaks.

But wait, another possibility is that the molecule is a mixture of a compound and its isotopic variant. But that's unlikely as the shifts would be very small. And the mass spec would show different masses.

Wait, but the question says the mass spectrum is the same. So same molecular formula. So isotopes don't change the molecular formula. So that's not it.

Looking back at the options, another option is C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure what that entails, but amide bond formation could lead to some side products, but I'm not certain how that would cause two peaks for the same proton.

Alternatively, during the amide bond formation, maybe the stereochemistry at the alpha position is not controlled, leading to a mixture of diastereomers. So option D would be a possibility.

Wait, the question doesn't mention anything about the stereocenters; it's a peptidic compound. So perhaps during the peptide coupling, the stereochemistry of the alpha carbon (like in an amino acid) is not fully controlled, leading to a mix of diastereomers (like R and S configurations at the alpha carbon). But wait, amino acids are chiral, but if the reaction doesn't control the stereochemistry, you'd get a racemic mix, which is enantiomers. But earlier, I thought that for enantiomers, the NMR wouldn't show two peaks. Unless the coupling is due to some other reason.

Wait, but if the peptide has another stereocenter, and the synthesis leads to a mixture of diastereomers, then the NMR would show different peaks for the same proton.

Wait, but the peptide is synthesized, so perhaps the configuration at a certain position (like the alpha carbon of the amino acid) is not fully controlled. But amino acids are usually in a single enantiomeric form when used in synthesis. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps during the synthesis, the amide bond is formed but with varying stereochemistry, leading to diastereomers. For example, if the amide bond forms with either retention or inversion of configuration, but that's more applicable if the configuration is adjacent to the amide, which in most cases is not the situation.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material has a certain configuration, and the synthesis leads to a racemic mixture, but that would be enantiomers.

Wait, but in the case of diastereomers, each would have different NMR shifts. So in the NMR, if the alpha protons are in different environments, their shifts would be different, leading to two peaks. But the question says the shifts are similar. So perhaps the two diastereomers are such that the alpha protons are in very similar environments, leading to similar shifts.

Another angle: the presence of a double bond with E/Z isomerism. If the double bond is in a position that affects the alpha protons, but in such a way that the shifts are only slightly different. But in that case, the shifts would be split into more than two peaks, depending on the coupling.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has some internal plane of symmetry which causes some protons to be equivalent in certain diastereomers. But that's getting complicated.

Let me think about the options again.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. So the molecule exists as two diastereomers. Each would have different NMR shifts for all protons. But in this case, the alpha protons have similar shifts, so their peaks are close. Thus, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, each from a different diastereomer.

In the LC-MS, each diastereomer has the same molecular weight, so they appear as two peaks of same mass. Since diastereomers have different physical properties, they would elute at different times (hence two peaks), but in this case, perhaps because of similar retention times, but they are clearly separated. The intensity is same, so each is present in equal amounts.

So putting it all together, the NMR has two peaks for the same proton because of two diastereomers. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, same intensity.

So the most likely answer is D: the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but what about option C: 'double coupling' during amide bond forming. I'm not sure what that entails. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, two different coupling partners were used, leading to two products. But the question says the mass is consistent, so I think that's not it.

Another thought: perhaps the molecule has an AB system where two protons are coupled to each other, but the question says the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. So AB coupling is unlikely.

So, based on all this, I think the correct answer is D.


The question involves analyzing the NMR and LC-MS data of a chemically synthesized peptidic compound. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (summing to 1H), and coupling patterns that rule out spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum as the expected compound. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggests that the compound exists as a mixture of two distinct forms.
   - The similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (together summing to 1H) indicate that the two forms are likely stereoisomers, as they share the same molecular environment for the alpha-proton but differ in other aspects.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - The two peaks with the same mass and mass spectrum confirm that the compound has the same molecular formula and molecular weight.
   - This rules out the possibility of contamination with a precursor or a compound of different molecular weight.

3. **Elimination of Options**:
   - **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**: This would result in a peak with a lower molecular weight, which is inconsistent with the LC-MS data showing two peaks of the same mass as the expected compound. This option is ruled out.
   - **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**: A racemic mixture of enantiomers would not produce two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum because enantiomers have identical chemical shifts. This option is also ruled out.
   - **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond forming reaction)**: While "double coupling" could theoretically lead to two peaks, it is more likely to result in additional splitting or side products, not two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton. This option is less plausible.
   - **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**: Diastereomers have different physical properties and distinct NMR shifts due to differences in their spatial arrangements. However, if the diastereomers are such that the alpha-proton environments are very similar, their chemical shifts could be close enough to produce two distinct peaks in the NMR spectrum. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of the same mass, is consistent with a mixture of diastereomers. This explanation aligns well with the observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The NMR spectrum reflects two distinct diastereomers, each contributing a peak for the alpha-proton. The LC-MS data confirms the presence of two compounds with the same molecular weight, consistent with diastereomers.
