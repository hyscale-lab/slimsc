Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem starts with the compound 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Then, it's treated with sodium hydride followed by benzyl bromide to form product 1. Next, product 1 is treated with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide in the presence of HCl to make product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with n-butyllithium at low temp, followed by aqueous ammonium chloride to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is stirred with Pd/C and hydrogen to give product 4. The question is asking what product 4 looks like, and there are four options: A, B, C, D.

Hmm. Let me break this down reaction by reaction.

First Reaction: Starting Compound + Sodium Hydride, then Benzyl Bromide â†’ Product 1.

So the starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Let me visualize that. It's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-C(CH2? Wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is the group attached at position 5: it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between 1 and 2. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2 attached to the double bond at position 1, and the substituent is at position 2. So the group is CH2-C(CH2?) No, wait, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not right. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2- connected to a CH2 group which is double bonded to another CH2? No, perhaps it's a substituent where the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the group is CH2-C(CH2?) Wait, maybe it's a vinyl group attached at the middle. Hmm, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2 but that's not right. Wait, I think I'm getting confused about the substituent. Let me think again: prop-1-en-2-yl is the substituent where the substituent is attached to the
