Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck on where to start, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Its molar mass would help. Let me calculate that. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. So, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles, right?

Wait, that's 0.1 g divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me double-check: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 0.000935 moles. Yeah, that's about 9.36e-4 mol.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think. So when it dissolves in water, it reacts with H+ ions. Because we're adding a strong acid, which is monobasic, so each mole of acid gives one mole of H+.

The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. Wait, no, wait, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide. So the reaction would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve.

So the moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So 0.000936 mol *3 = 0.002808 mol of H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume (V) needed is moles / concentration. So V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me look again.

Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Oh, that's close. But wait, could there be another factor I'm missing? Like any excess acid or something else?

Wait a second, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid added plus the volume of the solution (which I'm assuming is the Fe(OH)3 dissolved in water to make up 100 cm³) might be part of the calculation. But wait, the 100 cm³ is the total volume after adding the acid, right? Or is it the volume after dissolving and adding the acid?

Hmm, the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So when we add the acid, the total volume including the solution becomes 100 cm³. So the volume of the acid added (V_acid
