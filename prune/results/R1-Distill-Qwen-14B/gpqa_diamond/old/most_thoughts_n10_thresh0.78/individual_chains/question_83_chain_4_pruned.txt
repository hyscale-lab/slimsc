Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and when you titrate it with NaOH, a strong base, it forms acetate ions and water. 

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let me think about the initial solution after dilution. Since we're mixing equal volumes, the concentration should be halved. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³. So the concentration after dilution is 0.05 M * (20/40) = 0.025 M. Oh, right, because concentration is moles over volume, and when you double the volume, the concentration halves.

So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Now, when we titrate this with NaOH, each mole of NaOH will neutralize a mole of acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. But let's calculate the volumes needed for equivalence and the 25% point.

Wait, but first, let's find the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 mol.

So, the equivalence point requires adding 0.001 mol of NaOH. The NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So at that point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Wait, no. Wait, the 25% is of the equivalence volume. So, when 25% of the equivalence point has been reached, that is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So, moles of NaOH added are 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol.

Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, the moles of acetic acid remaining will be 0.001 - 0.0002
