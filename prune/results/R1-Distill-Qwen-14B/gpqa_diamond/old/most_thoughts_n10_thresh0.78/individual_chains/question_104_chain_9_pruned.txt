Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines indicates the star's velocity towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass have each been found to have a planet with masses similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The key here is the periodic wavelength shifts detected for each planet. Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. They're asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, how does the Doppler shift relate to the orbital period and the planet's mass? I think the RV method depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something like the semi-amplitude of the velocity (K) is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period.

The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ some exponent) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) ) * (some function of the eccentricity, but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that part is probably 1).

Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/1) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, I recall that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star (since M_p is Neptune-like and M_star is solar mass), this simplifies to K ≈ (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * something with G and constants.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for a more precise formula. The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, the denominator becomes M_star^(2/3). So K ≈ (G/P)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i)/(M_star^(2/3)) ) * (something with c... wait, maybe I'm confusing units here.

Wait, another approach: The Doppler shift is directly related to the velocity of the star. The formula for the semi-amplitude K (in velocity) is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3))

But I might be making a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider the relationship between the velocity semi-amplitude and the orbital period.

Wait, perhaps the key is to note that the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star. Since both stars have the same mass and the planet masses are similar (Neptune-like, so same M_p), then the ratio of their K velocities should be inversely proportional to the cube root of their orbital periods.

Wait, can I think of it this way: K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ), since K ≈ (something) * (M_p) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * P^(1/3) ) ).

Wait, so if we have two planets, 1 and 2, with K1 and K2, and same M_p and M_star, then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) ?

Wait, let's write the equation properly. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/ something) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

Wait, maybe I should look for the exact dependence. Let me think again.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G
