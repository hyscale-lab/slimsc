Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. We need to estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron. The options are from A to D, each being a different order of magnitude in joules.

Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. I think that's the one that relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that you can't simultaneously know both the exact position and momentum of a particle. The more precisely you know one, the less precisely you can know the other.

The formula for the uncertainty principle is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, Δp is the uncertainty in momentum, and Δx is the uncertainty in position. 

Wait, the question asks for the uncertainty in energy, not momentum. How does that connect? Oh right, because the uncertainty in momentum relates to the uncertainty in kinetic energy. Since kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron, I can probably relate Δp to ΔE.

Let me jot down the formulas I might need:

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle:
Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2 → Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx)

Kinetic Energy:
E = p²/(2m)
So, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would come from the uncertainty in p. So, ΔE ≈ (2Δp)/(2m) * p? Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Since E is proportional to p squared, the uncertainty in E would be approximately (2p Δp)/(2m), but I'm not sure. Maybe I can use a differential approach: ΔE ≈ (dE/dp) * Δp. 

Yes, that makes sense. The derivative of E with respect to p is dE/dp = p/m. So, ΔE ≈ (p/m) * Δp. But wait, p is the momentum, which is v*m. Because p = mv. So substituting, ΔE ≈ (mv/m) * Δp = v * Δp. Oh, that simplifies things. So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

Since I know v, I just need to find Δp, which I can get from the Heisenberg principle.

Let's compute Δp first. The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. Oh wait, sometimes I've seen it as h/(2π), right? So h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is about 1.054e-34 J·s.

So, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Let me plug in the numbers. Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometers
