Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Hmm, I remember that σ represents the Pauli spin matrices. So the dot product here would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And n is a unit vector, so it's in some direction in space, right?

Wait, so σ · n would translate to σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. That makes sense. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. But how does that help me find the eigenvalues?

I remember that for Pauli matrices, each of them individually has eigenvalues of ±1/2 when multiplied by ħ. Oh wait, but here the Pauli matrices are multiplied by n components, but since n is a unit vector, the overall coefficient might just be a scalar.

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. The eigenvalues of σ · n would be the eigenvalues of the sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by the components of n. But wait, Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so the operator σ · n is also Hermitian, which means its eigenvalues should be real.

But more importantly, I recall that the eigenvalues of a spin operator in any direction are ± ħ/2. Because the spin operator is usually written as S = (ħ/2) σ. So S · n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But wait, the given Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ · n). So maybe I can relate this to the spin operator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the trace and determinant of the Hamiltonian matrix to find the eigenvalues. Since H is a 2x2 matrix, it has two eigenvalues. The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, and the determinant is their product.

Let's compute the trace first. The trace of σ · n would be the sum of the diagonal elements. But wait, σ_x, σ_y, σ_z have zero trace because their diagonal elements are
