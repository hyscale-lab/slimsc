Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the annihilation of a proton and an antiproton into two A+ and two A- particles. The setup says the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. They're asking for the velocity of particle A.

Wait, wait. So the process is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A-. Interesting. I remember that in annihilation reactions, especially between matter and antimatter, a lot of energy is released. But since they're producing two pairs of particles, maybe it's about conservation of energy and momentum.

The antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, 'slowly' probably means that its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate its momentum as being non-relativistic? Or perhaps we can ignore kinetic energy compared to rest mass? Hmm, not entirely sure, but the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV, so I should probably calculate the rest mass energy for the proton and antiproton.

Wait, protons have a rest mass energy of about 938 MeV, right? Since antiprotons are the same mass as protons. So each has a rest mass of 938 MeV. But the mass of the daughter particles, A, is 300 MeV each. So the system after annihilation has four particles: two A+ and two A-.

Wait, but in terms of energy and momentum conservation, the initial system is a proton and antiproton colliding. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can assume the proton is at rest? Or is it the other way around? Wait, the question says the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some small velocity. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton has low speed. Hmm, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps in the lab frame, the antiproton has low momentum, and the proton is at rest? Or maybe in the center-of-momentum frame, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, but in high-energy physics, protons and antiprotons annihilate, producing other particles. But in this case, the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the process is not head-on, but rather the antiproton is moving towards a stationary proton. Or perhaps the initial frame
