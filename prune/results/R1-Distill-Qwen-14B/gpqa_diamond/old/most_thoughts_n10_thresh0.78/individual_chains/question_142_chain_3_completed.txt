Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubit space. The matrix provided is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I'm supposed to choose from the options A to D, each giving a coordinate in three-dimensional space.

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). So I need to figure out where this particular ρ is located in the Bloch sphere or whatever representation they're talking about.

First, let me write down what ρ looks like. The |0⟩⟨0| is a projector matrix that's diagonal with 1 at (0,0) and 0 elsewhere. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is also diagonal but with 1 at (1,1). So when I add them together, I get a 2x2 matrix where the diagonal elements are 1 each, and the off-diagonal are 0. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal becomes 1/2. So the matrix ρ is:

[ [1/2, 0],
  [0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, that's a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal. I think this is a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. 

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that for a single qubit, the state can be represented on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The density matrix of a pure state can be written as |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this is a mixture, so it's a diagonal matrix.

Wait, how does ρ relate to the Bloch vector? The Bloch vector r is usually a 3-dimensional vector (x,y,z), and for a single qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix.

So let's break that down. The identity matrix I is (2x2) with 1s on the diagonal. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]], and σ_0 is the identity, but wait, no—Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z.

So for a general ρ, it's written as (I + x σ_x + y σ_y + z σ_z)/2. But wait, our given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me expand that. Each |n⟩⟨n| is a diagonal matrix with 1 in the nth position. So adding them gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Divide by 2, so 1/2 on the diagonal, zeros elsewhere.

Now, let's express this using the Pauli matrices. Let me compute (I + r·σ)/2. Let's see:

r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z.

So, (I + r·σ)/2 = [I]/2 + (r_x σ_x)/2 + (r_y σ_y)/2 + (r_z σ_z)/2.

What's each term?

I is [[1,0],[0,1]], so I/2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

σ_x /2 is [[0, 0.5], [0.5, 0]].

σ_y /2 is [[0, -i/2], [i/2, 0]].

σ_z /2 is [[0.5, 0], [0, -0.5]].

Now, adding all these together:

The diagonal terms from I/2 are 0.5 and 0.5. The σ_z term adds 0.5 on (1,1) and subtracts 0.5 on (2,2). So the total diagonal would be 0.5 + (r_z * 0.5) for (1,1), and 0.5 - (r_z *0.5) for (2,2).

Wait, but our ρ has both diagonal elements as 0.5. So:

At (1,1): 0.5 + (r_z *0.5) = 0.5 → 0.5 + 0.5 r_z = 0.5 → r_z must be 0.

Similarly, at (2,2): 0.5 - 0.5 r_z = 0.5 → same equation, r_z=0.

So r_z is zero. That leaves the off-diagonal terms. The off-diagonal terms come from σ_x and σ_y.

So the (1,2) element of ρ is 0. Because the given ρ is diagonal. So let's compute the (1,2) element of (I + r·σ)/2.

The (1,2) element is from σ_x/2 and σ_y/2.

σ_x/2 has (1,2) as 0.5, and σ_y/2 has (1,2) as -i r_y / 2.

So when we sum these contributions, the (1,2) element of ρ is (r_x * 0.5) + (r_y * (-i/2)).

But our given ρ has (1,2) element as 0. So:

(0.5 r_x ) - (i/2 r_y ) = 0.

Which implies that 0.5 r_x = i/2 r_y.

But wait, r_x and r_y are real numbers. Because the Bloch vector components are real. So if this equation holds, the only solution is r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. Because any real number multiplied by i would have to equal another real number, which is only possible if both are zero.

So r_x must be 0 and r_y must be 0. And we have r_z=0.

So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0). But wait, that can't be right because the origin in Bloch sphere is the completely mixed state, right?

Wait, no. The density matrix of the completely mixed state for a qubit is (I)/2. Because for a qubit, the maximally mixed state is when all diagonal elements are 0.5 and off-diagonal are zero. Which matches exactly ρ in the question, because ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is same as (I)/2.

So if r is (0,0,0), then the density matrix is (I + 0)/2 = I/2, which is indeed the case. So the geometrical position is the origin in the Bloch sphere. So the vector r is (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0).

Wait, but why is the origin the point for the maximally mixed state? I thought that pure states are on the surface, and the completely mixed state is in the center. Yes, so that makes sense. So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This matrix is diagonal with both diagonal elements equal to \(1/2\), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. This corresponds to a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which is the completely mixed state. 

For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \(r = (x, y, z)\) represents the state in the Bloch sphere. The relationship between the density matrix and the Bloch vector is given by:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, and \(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Expanding this, the diagonal elements of \(\rho\) are determined by the \(z\)-component of the Bloch vector, while the off-diagonal elements are determined by the \(x\) and \(y\) components. 

For the given \(\rho\), the diagonal elements are both \(1/2\), and the off-diagonal elements are zero. This implies:

1. The \(z\)-component \(r_z = 0\), as the diagonal elements are equal.
2. The \(x\)-component \(r_x = 0\) and the \(y\)-component \(r_y = 0\), as the off-diagonal elements are zero.

Thus, the Bloch vector is \(r = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This is the geometrical representation of the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided:

- **A) \(r = (1,1,0)\):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B) \(r = (0,0,1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state along the \(z\)-axis, not the mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0,0,0):** Correct, as this is the origin in the Bloch sphere, representing the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \(r = (1,1,1):** Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

The correct answer is **C**, as the given density matrix corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.
