Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about reactions involving mCPBA and the products analyzed via HPLC. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The question says that a chemist performs two reactions. Both are using mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So, each reaction is with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene respectively, each treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion.

Wait, so for each reaction, the starting alkene is epoxidized first. Then, when you add aqueous acid, I think that's for acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide. Oh right, epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions. So, the epoxide would react with water or acid to form diols.

But wait, the starting material is (E) and (Z) isomers. So each of them will form their own epoxide. Let me recall: when you epoxidize an alkene, the geometry of the double bond affects the epoxide's structure.

Wait, mCPBA is an oxidizing agent that forms epoxides. The reaction is stereospecific. So (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene would form different epoxides. Because the double bond geometry affects how the epoxide forms.

Wait, no. Wait, when you epoxidize a trans or cis double bond, the epoxide will form a trans or cis ring? Let me think. Oh, wait, the double bond's geometry determines the configuration of the epoxide. For a trans (E) double bond, the two new oxygen atoms will add across the double bond in a way that the substituents on each carbon are on opposite sides. Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, the epoxidation of (E) and (Z) alkenes would result in epoxides with different stereochemistry. Let me visualize. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either side. For (E), the two CH2CH2
