Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products of two different reactions. Let's take it step by step. 

The first reaction is the one where the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi and then H+. Hmm, I remember that BuLi is a strong base, often used for deprotonation. Also, when there's an oxygen involved, maybe an epoxide or some kind of elimination could happen. Wait, but wait, the starting molecule has a structure like OCH2 attached to benzene, with a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So that's like OCH2-CR2, where R is a butenyl group.

Wait, maybe it's an ether with a conjugated diene or something. Oh wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the structure would be: benzene-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-. Wait no, but the 3-methyl would be on the third carbon. Wait, but the structure is 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl. So the substituents on the butenyl group are at position 3. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, maybe it's CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, let me draw it:

But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. So the structure is OCH2-CH2=CH-CH2CH3? Wait no, because the 3-methyl would be on the third carbon of the butenyl. So the structure is
