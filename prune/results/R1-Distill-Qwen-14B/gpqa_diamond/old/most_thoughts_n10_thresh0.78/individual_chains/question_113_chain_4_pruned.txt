Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question describes an unknown compound that was analyzed using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to identify the chemical formula from the given options, which are A to D. The options are all similar with varying numbers of hydrogens and oxygen atoms.

First, I'll start by breaking down the information from each technique.

The FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak is more typical of an -OH group in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, the presence of a very broad peak could also be due to a carbonyl group's overtone or something else... Hmm, no, I think the broad peak here is likely an O-H stretch. So maybe the compound has an alcohol group or perhaps a carboxylic acid. But then looking further, the FTIR also has strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Those are in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). But wait, 1700 is typical for a carbonyl like a ketone or aldehyde, while 1650 might be more like an amide or maybe conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is an aromatic ring's C=C stretching.

Wait, another possibility: 1700 could be a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester) and 1650 might be an aromatic ring with C=C bonds. Because aromatic rings have absorption around 1600 cm⁻¹. So maybe the compound has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

So, possible functional groups: maybe an aromatic ketone, or maybe an aromatic ester, or something with a conjugated carbonyl.

Next, the 1H NMR spectrum shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the H's on a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond, possibly in an aromatic ring, but also maybe an isolated double bond elsewhere.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what fragments have a mass of 45? Well, 45 could be a CH3O group (since CH3O is 15 + 32 (O is 16?) Wait, wait, let's calculate: CH3O is 12 (C) + 3*(1) (H3) + 16 (O) = 31. No, that's 31. Alternatively, what else? Oh, maybe a CH2O group? Wait, no. Or perhaps a fragment like OCH2CH3? Wait, that's 45? Let me think: OCH2CH3 is methyl ether. The molecular formula for that is C2H5O. The molecular weight would be 2*12 + 5*1 +16 = 24 +5 +16=45. Oh, right, so a methyl ether group could fragment to give 45. Alternatively, maybe a ketone group breaking off. Or perhaps a CO group, but 45 doesn't align with that. Hmm.

So, the mass spec fragment at 45 could be a result of losing a methyl group with an oxygen, like OCH2CH3. Or another possibility: maybe a CH2CH2O group, but I'm not sure.

Now, putting this together. Let's think about the possible structures.

The options are the formulas:

A) C6H12O2

B) C6H10O

C) C6H10O2

D) C6H12O

Looking at the degrees of unsaturation might help. Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But since we don't have X or N, let's compute for each option.

Let's compute for each:

Option A: C6H12O2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0)/2 = (14 -12)/2= 2/2=1.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, DoU formula: DoU = (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. Since X and N are zero here:

For A) C6H12O2:

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 +0)/2 = (14-12)/2= 2/2=1.

So 1 degree of unsaturation. That could be a ring or a double bond.

Option B: C6H10O.

DoU =
