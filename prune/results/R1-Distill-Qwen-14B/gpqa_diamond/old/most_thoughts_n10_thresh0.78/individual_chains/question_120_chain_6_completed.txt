Okay, so I have this question about stars being uniformly distributed in the sky and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax value. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the apparent shift in a star's position as observed from Earth as we orbit the Sun. The formula I recall is plx = 1/distance (where distance is in parsecs). So, if a star is closer, its parallax is larger, and if it's farther, the parallax is smaller. So plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, for a given interval of plx, how many stars are there? Let's break it down.

Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means the number density of stars is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

Wait, the number per unit volume is the same everywhere. So, if I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness Δd, the volume would be the surface area of the sphere (4πd²) multiplied by the thickness Δd. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² Δd.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let me substitute that. So, d = 1/plx → Δd = - (Δplx)/(plx²). But wait, that's about Δd in terms of Δplx. Maybe I should express everything in terms of plx instead of d.

The number of stars in a shell between plx and plx + Δplx would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The shell's volume is 4π*(d)^2 * Δd. Since d = 1/plx, then d² = 1/(plx)^2, and Δd is the change in d for a small change in plx. Let me think about this.

If plx increases by Δplx, then d decreases because d is inversely proportional to plx. So, when plx increases by a small amount, d decreases by Δd = (-1/plx²) * Δplx. But since I'm dealing with a small change, I can write Δd ≈ - (Δplx)/(plx²). But the volume is positive, so maybe I should take absolute values.

So, the volume element in terms of plx would be 4π*(1/plx)^2 * (Δd). But since Δd is proportional to Δplx, and plx is small, maybe I can write Δd = (Δplx) / (plx)^2, but considering the negative sign, but for volume, it's the magnitude. So, the volume in terms of plx is 4π*(1/plx²) * (Δplx / plx²) )? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in substituting. Let me re-derive this.

Number of stars in shell at distance d is N = n * Volume, where n is the number density.

Volume of a thin shell at distance d with thickness Δd is 4πd²Δd.

So, N = n * 4πd²Δd.

But Δd is the change in d when plx changes by Δplx. Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx. So, when plx increases by Δplx, d decreases by (d_initial - d_final) = (1/(plx) - 1/(plx + Δplx)).

But for small Δplx, we can approximate Δd ≈ - (Δplx)/(plx²). So, Δd ≈ -(Δplx)/(plx²). The negative indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering a small change, the thickness Δd is positive, so we take the absolute value: |Δd| = (Δplx)/(plx²).

So, substituting into N:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (Δplx / plx²) )

Wait, that's 4π n (1/plx²) * (Δplx / plx² ) = 4π n Δplx / plx^4.

Wait, that's number of stars as a function of plx. But the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, the number per unit plx (like N / Δplx) would be 4πn / plx^4.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because I think I'm missing a step here. Let me think differently.

We have N = n * 4πd² * Δd.

Expressed in terms of plx, since d = 1/plx, and Δd = (Δplx)/(plx^2).

So substituting:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (Δplx / plx² )

So N = n * 4π * (Δplx) / plx^4.

So, the number of stars in a small range of plx (Δplx) around plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit plx is N/(Δplx) = 4πn / plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So, the count per unit plx is N per Δplx, which is ΔN = N / Δplx = (4πn Δplx / plx^4 ) / Δplx ) → 4πn / plx^4.

But wait, that would imply that the count increases as plx decreases, which makes sense because closer stars (smaller plx) are more numerous in a given plx range since they are closer together. Wait, but I'm getting this count as 1/plx^4, which would be option A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the relationship between distance and volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars in a shell of radius r and thickness dr is proportional to r² dr. So, for a given dr, the number increases with r². But when r increases (i.e., as you go to larger distances), the number of stars per shell increases.

But in terms of parallax, plx is 1/r. So, when plx is small (large r), the number of stars in a given dplx is higher because you're covering a larger volume. But wait, earlier calculation says it's proportional to 1/plx^4. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try to rederive it.

The number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr is N = 4πd² dr * n, where n is the number density.

Now, express this in terms of plx. Since plx = 1/d → d = 1/plx → dr = - (1/plx²) d plx.

So, substituting:

N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( - (1/plx²) d plx ) * n.

Wait, but the negative sign just indicates the direction of change, so when plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering the magnitude, we can take the absolute value.

So, N = 4π (1/plx²) * ( (1/plx²) d plx ) * n.

So,

N = 4π n (1/plx^4) d plx.

So the number of stars per unit plx interval (d plx) is 4πn / plx^4. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but that's the number per unit plx. So the number of stars per unit range of plx (each unit plx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4. So, looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4.

But wait, I'm getting a 1/plx^4 dependence. So, the number of stars per unit plx interval (like each 1 unit of plx) would decrease as plx increases, which makes sense because as you go to larger plx (closer stars), the same plx range would contain more stars since they're closer. Wait, no. Wait, higher plx corresponds to closer stars. So if plx increases, the number of stars per unit plx would increase, because each plx unit now represents a larger change in distance. Wait, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me think in terms of integrating. The number of stars in a range of plx from plx to plx + dplx would be proportional to 1/plx^4 * dplx. So, the number per unit plx would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the correct answer would be option A.

But wait, let me think again. If stars are uniformly distributed in space, then the number density is the same everywhere. So, the number of stars in a volume element is proportional to the volume.

But when you consider a unit change in plx, the corresponding change in distance is dr = - (1/plx^2) dplx. For a unit change in plx (dplx = 1), dr = -1/plx². So, the corresponding volume for a thin shell at d is 4π d² dr. Substituting d = 1/plx, dr = -1/plx².

So, the volume becomes 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) ) → 4π / plx^4.

So, the number of stars in that volume is proportional to 1/plx^4.

Hence, the number per unit plx (dplx=1) is proportional to 1/plx^4.

So, the correct answer would be option A: ~1/plx^4.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars is constant, and the number of stars in a given volume is proportional to the size of that volume.

For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( \Delta d \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 \Delta d \). The number of stars in this shell is proportional to \( 4\pi d^2 \Delta d \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the volume becomes \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \Delta d \). The change in distance \( \Delta d \) for a small change in parallax \( \Delta \text{plx} \) is approximately \( \Delta d = -\frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \). Taking the absolute value, \( \Delta d = \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \).

Substituting \( \Delta d \) into the volume expression, the number of stars in the shell becomes proportional to:

\[
N \propto 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{\Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = \frac{4\pi \Delta \text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is then:

\[
\frac{N}{\Delta \text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). This corresponds to option A.
