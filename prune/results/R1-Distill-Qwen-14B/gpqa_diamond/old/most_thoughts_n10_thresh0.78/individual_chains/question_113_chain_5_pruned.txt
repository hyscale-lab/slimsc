Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and it's been characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The task is to determine the chemical formula among the options given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

First, let's break down the information given from each technique.

Starting with the FTIR data. They mentioned a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Wait, but a very broad peak could also be due to an -OH group in a ketone? No, ketones don't have O-H. So more likely, it's either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, another possibility is an ester or something else. Hmm, but the broad peak is usually OH. 

Then, there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, but that's a bit lower. Or maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ketone, or maybe an ester. Wait, esters have two carbonyls? No, esters have one. Wait, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl system? Like a conjugated double bond next to a carbonyl. That would lower the wavenumber a bit. Or perhaps a conjugated carbonyl group, like in an aromatic ring with substituents.

Next, the 1H N
