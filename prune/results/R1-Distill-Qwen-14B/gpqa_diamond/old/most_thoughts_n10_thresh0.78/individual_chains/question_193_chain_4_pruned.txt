Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, the number of stars (let's call it N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. Wait, that's N ∝ 1/plx^5, which is the same as N ∝ plx⁻⁵.

Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star due to the Earth's movement around the Sun. The formula I recall is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So, plx = 1/d, which means d = 1/plx. 

Wait, so if d is inversely proportional to plx, then plx is proportional to 1/d. So plx = k/d, where k is a constant. Now, substituting that into the expression for N.

N is proportional to (plx)^-5. Since plx is 1/d, then (plx)^-5 is (1/d)^-5, which is d^5. So N ∝ d^5. 

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range of distance. So I think it's asking for the relationship in terms of r, the distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then as r increases, the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r.

Looking at the options, option B is ~ r^5. So that's the one.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's think about how parallax and distance relate. The formula plx = 1/d, correct. So plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by distance in parsecs. So if you go further away (d increases), the parallax decreases.

Now, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, which is the same as plx^{-5}. Substituting plx = 1/d, so N ∝ (1/d)^{-5} = d^5. So N increases as d^5. So for a given range of distances, say from r to r + dr, the number of
