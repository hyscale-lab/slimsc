Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically involves 1,5-dienes, right? The reaction forms a new six-membered ring. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so let me think this through carefully.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene means it's a norbornene structure. The numbering might be a bit tricky, but I'll try to draw it out. So, the bicyclo system has two rings: a five-membered ring and a six-membered bridge, but wait, no, actually, a bicyclo[2.2.1] has two bridges. Let me count the carbons. So the structure has a bridge with two carbons each on two sides and one on the third, making it a norbornene-like structure.

The substituents are 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo. So the azabicyclo part implies that one of the bridgehead carbons is a nitrogen. Wait, the numbering is 2-azabicyclo, so the nitrogen is at position 2. But wait, in bicyclo systems, the bridgeheads are usually the higher-numbered positions. Oh wait, no, the numbering in bicyclo[m.n.p] systems starts with the bridgehead as 1, and then goes around. So 2-azabicyclo would have a nitrogen at position 2. But in the bicyclo structure, position 2 is a bridgehead. Hmm, perhaps the structure has a bridge where one bridge is two carbons, another is two, and the third is one, making a norbornene skeleton.

So, the molecule is 2-vinyl, meaning a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) attached at position 2. Also, it's 2-azabicyclo, so position 2 is a nitrogen. Wait, no. The formula is 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo system has seven atoms. Let me think: 2.2.1 means bridges of lengths 2, 2, and 1. So the bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have a five-membered ring and a bridge. But with a double bond at position 5, so the double bond is in a certain part of the structure.

Wait, the arrangement of the double bond is crucial. The molecule is 5-ene, so the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6, perhaps? But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should look for
