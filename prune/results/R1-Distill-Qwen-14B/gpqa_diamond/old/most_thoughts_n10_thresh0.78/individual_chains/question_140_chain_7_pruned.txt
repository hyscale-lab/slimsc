Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y to produce gas W, a precipitate G, and when G is heated, it releases B. Also, there's some info about a keto acid reacting with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms. And we need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's start by trying to figure out what these substances could be.

First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. That makes me think of something that's commonly used in reactions and has isotopes. Maybe something like chlorine, which has isotopes, or maybe something like sodium or potassium? Or perhaps something more specific.

The reaction with liquid Y is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, a molecule where protons equal neutrons. Let me think, which gases have that? Hydrogen has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. Helium has 2 of each. But wait, if the molecule is something like H2O, but that's not the same. Oh, wait, maybe it's NH3? No, because N has 7 protons, and in NH3, each molecule would have 7+3*1 = 10 protons, but that's not equal to the neutrons. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe CO2? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, the molecule must have same number of protons and neutrons. Let me think of elements where the isotope has equal protons and neutrons. Chlorine has isotopes, but Cl-35 has 18 neutrons, 17 protons. Not equal. Wait, maybe it's something like O-16, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So if the gas W is O2, each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, so each molecule would have 16 of each. Oh wait, per molecule, the total protons would be 16 (if O has 8 each, two atoms), and the neutrons would be 16 as well. So O2 would fit because each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So, each molecule has 16 of each, making them equal. So gas W is O2?

Wait, but then what about the reaction? If X reacts with Y to produce O2, maybe Y is water or something else. Alternatively, perhaps W is H2 because H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons. But wait, H2's molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutronsâ€”so that's not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait another angle: the gas W has same number of neutrons and protons. Let me think of possible elements. Carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. So if W is CO2, each CO2 molecule would have (6+12) protons (from C and O) and (6+16) neutrons (if O is 16). Wait, but that's not equal. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another approach: each molecule of W has same protons and neutrons. So per molecule, sum of protons equals sum of neutrons. Let's see. For example, if W is CH4: C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's 12C), H has 1 each. So CH4 would have 6+4=10 protons, and 6 +4*0=6 neutrons. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps W is NH3? N has
