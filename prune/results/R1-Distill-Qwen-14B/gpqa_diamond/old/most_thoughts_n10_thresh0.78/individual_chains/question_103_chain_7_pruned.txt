Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A to D, each with a series of steps.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the structure would have a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, position 5 has a nitro group, and the ketone (ethan-1-one) is attached at position 1, which is the same as the para position relative to the ketone? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw this.

Wait, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one?), or wait, no. Ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, but wait, wait. No, wait. Ethan-1-one would be CH2-C(O)H? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (propan-2-one). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, acetone is propan-2-one. Ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO? No, wait, that's propan-2-one. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think. Ethan-1-one has the ketone group at the first carbon. So the structure would be O=C-CH2-. But wait, that's not possible as a ketone because a ketone needs two R groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. Oh, wait, no, because ethan-1-one would be (CH3)COH? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Maybe it's just a benzene ring with a ketone (acetophenone group) attached at position 1, and at positions 3 and 5, there's a Br and a nitro group respectively.

Wait, the
