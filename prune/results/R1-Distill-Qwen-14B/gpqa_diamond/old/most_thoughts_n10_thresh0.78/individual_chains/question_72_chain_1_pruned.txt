Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. So, let's take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from a specific compound and ending up with a product, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product.

First, I'll try to parse the reactions one by one.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a norbornene structure, which is a bridged bicyclic compound. The substituent here is a tert-butoxy group attached at position 7. So, the structure is norbornene with an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group.

Next, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. I think this is a radical substitution reaction. Sodium iodide (NaI) is a source of iodide ions, which are good leaving groups. The dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexadiene might undergo elimination, but with two equivalents, maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, another possibility is that this is a di-elimination to form some kind of diradical, which then combines with the norbornene. Alternatively, considering the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, each dibromomethyl group has two Br atoms on a CH2. So each CH2Br2 group.

When treated with NaI, especially at elevated temperatures, perhaps a double elimination occurs. The dibromomethyl groups might lose Br- (as I- is present), leading to the formation of double bonds. But wait, the starting compound is a cyclohexadiene, meaning it already has two double bonds. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, each dibromomethyl group (CH2Br2) can undergo dehydrohalogenation to form a CH2 group with a double bond. Wait, but each CH2Br2 would form a CH2 group if both Brs are removed. But considering each CH2Br2 is attached to a cyclohexene ring, perhaps each of these groups can eliminate two equivalents of HBr, releasing two molecules of HBr. But wait, each CH2Br2 has two Brs, so each would eliminate two times? But how?

Wait, maybe each CH2Br2 group, upon treatment with NaI, undergoes a substitution reaction. Wait, but NaI is a source of iodide, and Br is a better leaving group than I-. Oh wait, no. In the presence of NaI, perhaps it's an SN2 reaction where the bromide is replaced by iodide. But that would just swap the leaving group, which might not be the case here. Maybe it's a Finkelstein reaction? But that's for converting alkyl bromides to iodides in a polar aprotic solvent. However, in this case, sodium iodide is used in a reaction with a dihalide, possibly leading to coupling.

Alternatively, I'm thinking of the possibility of a coupling reaction via radical intermediates. The dibromomethyl groups could be undergoing elimination of Br atoms, generating radicals, which then combine.

Wait, another possibility: The Br atoms are good leaving groups. So, when treated with a base or something like that, the Br might leave, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes elimination to form a diyne? Because two X groups on a CH2 could lead to a triple bond if two HX are eliminated.

Wait, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two adjacent CH2Br2 groups. So,
