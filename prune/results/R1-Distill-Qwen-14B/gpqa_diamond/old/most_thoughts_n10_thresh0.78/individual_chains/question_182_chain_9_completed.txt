Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that the equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions. The equation given is J equals (9/8) epsilon mu V squared over L cubed. 

Wait, the question is asking which statement about the validity is true. The options are A to D. Let's think about what the Mott-Gurney equation requires.

From what I recall, the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under certain assumptions. Oh right, it's for a single-carrier device. So options mentioning two-carrier devices, like option D, probably aren't correct. Because if it's a two-carrier device, the behavior might be different, perhaps leading to the trap-assisted or something else, not the SCLC where Mott-Gurney applies.

The equation assumes that the space-charge effect is significant, which means the current is limited by the charge build-up in the space-charge region. So it's when the injected carriers are so much that they create a region where the electric field is modified. 

What are the other assumptions? Oh, the contacts should be Ohmic. Because if there's a barrier or a Schottky contact, that might introduce additional effects like injection barriers or different contact resistances. Wait, but wait: the Mott-Gurney case is typically when the contacts are Ohmic, so that the carriers can freely move without significant barriers. So a trap-free device is important because traps would complicate the current—allowing for more complex transport mechanisms like tunneling or impact ionization, which the Mott-Gurney equation doesn't account for.

So the equation applies when there are no traps—so the material is trap-free. Also, it's single-carrier because if both electrons and holes are involved, the derivation might change.

Now, about the current components: The equation neglects diffusion current, right? Because in SCLC, the current is dominated by drift and space-charge effects, and diffusion is considered negligible. Or wait, is it the other way around? No, in SCLC, the space-charge region is such that the electric field is strong, so drift is dominant, and diffusion is considered small. So the equation assumes that diffusion currents are negligible.

Wait, but let me think again. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the space charge is so dominant that the current is limited by the injection and the electric field due to the built-up charge. They assume that the current is space-charge-limited, which implies that the electric field is strong enough that the space charge dominates the potential. So in that case, the diffusion current would be much smaller than the drift current, so it's neglected.

So the equation is valid for a single-carrier, Ohmic contact, trap-free device, and negligible diffusion current.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, no, because the derivation includes drift current as the main component. It's the space-charge limited, so drift is significant, but diffusion is negligible. So A says negligible drift current, which would be incorrect.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier sounds like no built-in voltage, which would imply Ohmic contacts. So it's trap-free, single-carrier, Ohmic (so no injection barrier), and negligible diffusion. That seems correct.

Option C: Single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier, which would have an injection barrier, so that might not fit the Mott-Gurney assumptions. Because Mott-Gurney assumes Ohmic contacts, I think. So option C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Two-carrier, Ohmic, negligible diffusion. As we said, Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier, so D is out.

So the correct statement should be option B. Let me check the options again.

Option B: "no carrier injection barrier" – that would mean the contacts are Ohmic. Because an injection barrier would come from a Schottky contact or a p-n junction, which would prevent Ohmic behavior. Oh, wait, in an Ohmic contact, there's no built-in voltage, so no injection barrier. So yes, that makes sense.

So the correct answer is option B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current \( J \) versus voltage \( V \) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the charge carrier mobility, and \( L \) is the length of the device. The validity of this equation depends on specific assumptions:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The equation applies to single-carrier transport, as the derivation assumes only one type of charge carrier (electrons or holes). Two-carrier devices are not described by the Mott-Gurney equation.

2. **Trap-free material**: The equation assumes the semiconductor is trap-free, meaning there are no impurities or defects that could introduce additional transport mechanisms like tunneling or impact ionization.

3. **Ohmic contacts**: The device must have Ohmic contacts, meaning there are no built-in voltage barriers at the contacts. This ensures that the injected carriers can move freely without significant resistance.

4. **Negligible diffusion current**: The equation neglects diffusion current, as the SCLC regime is dominated by drift current in the space-charge region. Diffusion effects are considered negligible under these conditions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States "negligible drift current," which is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation relies on drift current being significant in the space-charge-limited regime. Thus, this option is invalid.

- **Option B**: States "trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current." This aligns with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. "No carrier injection barrier" implies Ohmic contacts, and "negligible diffusion current" is consistent with the SCLC regime. This option is correct.

- **Option C**: Mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a carrier injection barrier. This contradicts the assumption of Ohmic contacts required for the Mott-Gurney equation. Thus, this option is invalid.

- **Option D**: Refers to a two-carrier device, which is not described by the Mott-Gurney equation. This option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation is provided in **Option B**.
