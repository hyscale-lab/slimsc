Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered via the TTV method, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Oh wait, so the periods are like 1, 2, 2.5, 3.5, and 5 units? I guess each period is relative to the first planet, which has a period of 1. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, etc.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. And they have the same albedo, so albedo doesn't affect the ratio. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its orbital period. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but since albedo is the same for both planets, that term drops out when taking the ratio.

Wait, another thought. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis (a). Because the formula is T ∝ (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4), but I can simplify that. Since L (the star's luminosity) and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) are the same for both planets, the ratio of their temperatures depends on the square root of the inverse of their semi-major axes.

But how do I find the semi-major axes? Well, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So P² ∝ a³. Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3).

So the semi-major axis ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). Let me compute that. Wait, I have to find a4/a2.

Planet_2 has a period twice
