Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read through it carefully. Hmm. A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is, what's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. I remember that when objects move relative to each other, you have to consider how light's speed is perceived. But wait, isn't the speed of light constant in all inertial frames? Oh, right, that's Einstein's postulate. But wait, this is inside a medium, not a vacuum. So maybe that complicates things.

So, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity. The glass has an index of refraction n, so the speed of light within the glass should be c/n, right? Wait, but c is given as 1 here, so the speed would be 1/n. But wait, the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed in the lab frame?

Wait, so in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But the glass itself is moving at speed v relative to the lab. So in the lab frame, what do we observe?

I'm trying to remember the addition of velocities here. Oh right, for velocities in different frames, you use the Lorentz transformation. But wait, that's for objects moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. But here, v is the velocity of the glass. But the speed of light in the medium is 1/n, which is less than c (since n>1 for glass). So if v is much smaller than c, maybe we can use a non-relativistic approach, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the magnitude of v. So I think the correct approach would be to consider the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because even if v is small, the speed of light in the medium is 1/n. So when the glass is moving, we need to see how the light's speed transforms.

Wait, but the light's speed in the glass's frame is v_light' = c/n, where c is set to 1. So that's 1/n. Now
