Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, the question says that the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6, because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Okay, so the nucleus is a lithium-6 ion.

RHIC collides heavy ions, so I guess the energy here refers to the kinetic energy of the ion. But wait, the question is about the energy of the collider, which usually refers to the total energy, but sometimes people talk about kinetic energy. I'll have to be careful about that.

The speed given is 0.96c. I remember that at such high speeds, relativistic effects are significant. So I'll need to use the relativistic equations for energy.

The total energy of a particle is given by E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So I need to calculate gamma first.

Let me compute v²/c². v is 0.96c, so (v²/c²) is (0.96)^2. Let's calculate that: 0.96 * 0.96 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me be precise. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is 0.28, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.57142857... So around 3.5714.

Now, the mass of the nucleus is needed. Since it's Li-6, the mass of a single Li-6 nucleus is needed. I know that the atomic mass unit (u) is approximately 1.660539 × 10^-27 kg. The molar mass of Li-6 is 6 g/mol, so each nucleus has a mass of 6 u.

Wait, to clarify: The molar mass of Li-6 is 6 g/mol, so each mole has 6 grams. So one nucleus would have a mass of 6 u. So m = 6 * 1.660539e-27 kg. Let's compute that.

6 * 1.660539e-27 = approx 9.963234e-27 kg.

But wait, maybe it's better to use the mass in terms of energy directly, using the rest mass energy. Then, the rest energy m0c² is 6 * (931.5 MeV/c²) * c², which gives 6 * 931.5 MeV. Wait, 1 u is about 931.5 MeV/c², right? So 6 u would be 6 * 931.5 MeV = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV.

Wait, let me double-check: 1 u = 931.5 MeV/c², so m0c² for the nucleus is 6 * 931.5 MeV = 558
