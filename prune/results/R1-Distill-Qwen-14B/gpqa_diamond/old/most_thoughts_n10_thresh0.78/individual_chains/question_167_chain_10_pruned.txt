Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like Fock states or cat states.

The given state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So phi is the phase, alpha is the amplitude, and N is the normalization. The normalization N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha^2)). Wait, because when you have |alpha> and |−alpha>, their inner product is exp(-2|alpha|^2) because the coherent states are over the complex plane and |−alpha> is like the state at -alpha. So the normalization comes from that.

The problem is for phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, relative entropy, also known as Kullback-Leibler divergence, measures how different one distribution is from another. But in quantum terms, it's between the state's density matrix and a reference Gaussian state's density matrix. The non-Gaussianity is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the closest Gaussian state.

Alternatively, I think in some contexts, non-Gaussianity is measured by how much the state deviates from Gaussian, and relative entropy is a good measure for that. So the formula given makes sense.

But wait, the options include 0, which would imply that the state is Gaussian. Let me think: when is the state |psi> Gaussian? Coherent states are Gaussian, but a superposition of two coherent states (like a Schrödinger cat state) would be non-Gaussian. So regardless of the parameters, this state should be non-Gaussian, unless... unless the superposition is in a way that actually makes it Gaussian again. For example, if phi is 0, then the state is just |alpha>, which is Gaussian. But here, phi is -pi/4, which is not zero.

Wait, phi is the phase angle in the superposition. So cos(phi) and sin(phi) are the coefficients. Let's compute that: phi = -pi/4. So cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈0.707, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈-0.707. So the state becomes (0.707 |alpha> - 0.707 |−alpha>)/N.

Now, what is N? N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha^2)). Let's compute sin(2phi). 2phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)) = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)). Because alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5.

Compute exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So 1 - 0.6065 is 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

So the state is (0.707 |alpha> -0.707 |−alpha> ) / 0.627. So the coefficients are about 0.707/0.627 ≈1.127. Wait, but in reality, when you take the square of the coefficients, the probabilities would be (0.707)^2 + (0.707)^2 = 0.5 +0.5=1, but multiplied by 1/(N^2). Wait, N^2 is 0.3935, so 1/0.3935 ≈2.54. So the probabilities would be (0.707^2)* (2.54). Wait, 0.707 squared is 0.5, so each term is 0.5*2.54≈1.27. So 1.27 each, but that can't be right because the probabilities shouldn't exceed 1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state is normalized, so when you compute it, the sum
