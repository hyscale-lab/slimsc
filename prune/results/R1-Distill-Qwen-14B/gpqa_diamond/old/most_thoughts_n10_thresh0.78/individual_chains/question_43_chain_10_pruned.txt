Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of IUPAC naming. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents mentioned are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which I think is an aldehyde group, so -CHO), and a cyano group (CN). These three are all meta to each other. Wait, meta means each is separated by one position, right? So if I imagine the benzene ring, each of these groups is at the 1, 3, 5 positions? Hmm, no, wait. Meta means that they are adjacent in a triangular arrangement. So if one is at position 1, the next would be at position 3, then 5.

But wait, the question says they're all meta to one another, which probably means each is meta to the others. So perhaps each is two positions apart, forming a meta arrangement. So like, if one is at position 1, another at 3, and the third at 5? That makes sense.

Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). So, the carboxylic acid is at position, let's say, 1. Then ortho would be positions 2 and 6. So one substituent is OH and the other is N(CH3)2 in positions 2 and 6. But wait, which is which? The order matters for the naming.

Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). Para is position 4 if the carboxylic acid is at position 1. So OCH3 is at position 4.

Additionally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). So the nitrile must be in a position that's ortho to both OCH3 and OH. Let me think about that.

Wait, let me try to sketch this. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents:

- Carboxylic acid (COOH) at position 1.
- Then, meta to COOH would be positions 3 and 5. But wait, there are three substituents: COOH, CHO, and CN, all meta to each other. So all three should be at positions 1, 3, and 5.

Wait, no, that's not possible because each is meta to the others. Let me think again. If COOH is at position 1, then the next meta group would be at position 3. The third meta group would be at position 5.

So positions 1 (COOH), 3 (maybe CHO?), 5 (CN?), but I'm not sure. Or any combination of the substituents.

But wait, the other substituents are ortho to COOH: OH and N(CH3)2. So positions 2 and 6. Let me assign those. Let's say COOH is at 1, OH at 2, and N(CH3)2 at 6. Alternatively, it could be the other way around.

The methoxy group is para to COOH, so at position 4. Now, the hydroxyl (OH) is at 2, methoxy at 4, and the nitrile (CN) has to be ortho to both 2 and 4.

Wait, the CN is ortho to both OH (position 2) and OCH3 (position 4). Ortho to 2 would be positions 1 and 3. Ortho to 4 would be positions 3 and 5. So the only position that is ortho to both 2 and
