Okay, so I have this physics problem about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says we've got a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. 

Wait, T is isospin, S is spin, and L is orbital angular momentum. So, T = S + L + 1 mod 2. But the final NN state has T=0. So let's figure out what that implies.

The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0 means 2S+1 =1 → S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, which for S is 0. So initial state has S=0, L=0, so J=0.

Then, they emit a particle X. So the final state is the same two nucleons but in a different state, and X has some quantum numbers. The options give possible transitions where the NN goes to some state, and X is a p, f, etc. particle.

The problem requires considering conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli condition about T, S, L.

Wait, the initial NN state is 1S0. So, it's in a state with S=0, L=0, and J=0. After emitting X, the NN pair must be in a state that satisfies T= S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is given as 0 for the final state.

So for the final state, T=0. So 0 ≡ S' + L' +1 mod 2. Rearranging, S' + L' ≡ 1 mod 2. So either S' is 1 and L' is 0, or S' is 0 and L' is 1, or S'=1 and L'=0, etc., such that their sum is odd.

Wait, wait. Wait, S is the spin, L is orbital angular momentum. So for the NN system, which is a spin-0 system initially (since S=0), after emission, their spin could change? Or is their spin the same?

Wait, but when they emit a particle, the process must conserve angular momentum. So the initial state has J=0 (since L=0 and S=0). The final state must have J_final plus the angular momentum of X equal to the initial J, which is zero. So J_final plus L_X (the orbital angular momentum of X) must be zero. But since angular momentum is vectorial, perhaps the total angular momentum after should be zero? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial J is 0. The process is NN → NN' + X. So
