Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is a big deal in statistical mechanics because it helps calculate thermodynamic properties. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The system consists of three spins: S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Wait, J is probably a coupling constant, like ferromagnetic if J is positive or anti-ferromagnetic if negative. But for the partition function, the exact value of J's sign will affect the energy terms.

The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each state is a combination of the spins S1, S2, S3. Since each spin has two options, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to list all these states and calculate the energy for each, then sum the exponentials.

Let me list all possible states. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, I'll compute the energy.

The energy formula is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Let's compute each term.

1. All +1: S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.
8. All -1: S1S2=1, etc. Sum is 3. So E = -3J.

Wait, let me double-check some of these. For state 2: S3 is -1, so S1S3 is -1, S2S3 is -1. So 1 -1 -1: yeah, -1. So E is J.

So out of the 8 states, how many have E = -3J and how many have E = J?

Looking at the states, only states 1 and 8 have E=-3J, so that's two states. The other six states each have E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(β E). Because E is negative in the exponent when considering exp(-β E), wait no: Z is sum exp(-β E), right? Because the Boltzmann factor is exp(-E/(kT)) = exp(-β E).

Wait, the energy for state 1 is E=-3J. So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3Jβ). Similarly for state 8, same.

For the other six states, E=J. So Boltzmann factors are exp(-β*J) = exp(-Jβ).

Wait wait, no. Wait the energy is E = -J * sum, so for state 2, E is J (because the sum inside was -1, so E = -J*(-1) = J. So the Boltzmann factor for each of these 6 states is exp(-β * E) = exp(-β*J).

Wait wait, no! Wait, E is J, so -β E is -β J. So each of those 6 states contributes exp(-β J).

But wait, the other two states have E=-3J. So their Boltzmann factors are exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3β J).

So Z = 2 * exp(3β J) + 6 * exp(-β J).

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ), which doesn't match. Option B is 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ), which matches what I have here. Hmm, but wait no—wait, no, no, wait, I think I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, no, let's go back. Each state contributes exp(-β E). E for the two states is -3J, so exp(-β*(-3J))=exp(3Jβ). For the other six states, E is J, so exp(-β J) each.

So Z = 2 exp(3Jβ) + 6 exp(-Jβ).

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which is what we have. So that's the correct partition function.

Wait, but wait, option B is 2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}. Option A is opposite in exponents for the two terms. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but I should double-check. Let me recount how many states have each energy.

The two states where all spins are same: all +1 or all -1, so 2 states. Each gives sum of +3, so E = -3J.

The other 6 states: each has a sum of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = -1, so E = -J*(-1) = J. So each of these six contributes exp(-β E) = exp(-beta * J).

So Z is sum of these. So Z = 2 exp(3 J beta) + 6 exp(-J beta). That's exactly option B.


To determine the partition function \( Z \) for the given system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), we start by noting that each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right),
\]

where \( J \) is the coupling constant. The partition function is defined as:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} \exp(-\beta E),
\]

where \( \beta = 1 / (kT) \). Since there are three spins, there are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. Each state corresponds to a specific combination of \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). By explicitly calculating the energy for each state, we find:

1. **All spins \( +1 \) (State 1):** \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \). The energy is \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
2. **All spins \( -1 \) (State 8):** \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \). The energy is \( E = -J(3) = -3J \).
3. **Other states (States 2–7):** For these six states, the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \), so the energy is \( E = -J(-1) = J \).

Thus, there are two states with \( E = -3J \) and six states with \( E = J \). The partition function is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta),
\]

where the first term corresponds to the two states with \( E = -3J \) (contributing \( \exp(3J\beta) \)) and the second term corresponds to the six states with \( E = J \) (contributing \( \exp(-J\beta) \)).

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

\[
Z = 2 \exp(3J\beta) + 6 \exp(-J\beta).
\]

This matches **Option B**.

Answer: B
