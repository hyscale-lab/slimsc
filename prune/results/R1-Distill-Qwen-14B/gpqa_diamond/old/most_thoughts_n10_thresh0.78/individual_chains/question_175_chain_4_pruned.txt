Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The problem mentions that the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. So it's symmetric around z, which probably affects the radiation pattern.

The question is about the radiated power in the radiation zone. The power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, where theta is the angle from the z-axis. We need to find the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also figure out the possible form of f in terms of lambda.

Wait, I think I remember something about the radiation pattern for a dipole antenna. Dipole radiation has a maximum at the equator, meaning theta = 90 degrees, and it goes to zero along the poles (theta = 0 and 180). The radiation pattern is symmetric about the equator, so maybe it's a sin squared theta dependence. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the dipole's radiation is in the theta = 90 direction, but the intensity pattern depends on (sin(theta))^2, right?

Wait, more precisely, the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to (sin(theta))^2. So the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees, and it's zero at theta=0 and 180.

But wait, in this question, the shape is spheroidal, which suggests that perhaps it's a dipole-like radiation, but I'm not entirely certain. Although, a dipole is a quadrupole moment, but maybe the radiation is similar.

So the function f should depend on theta. Let's assume that the maximum power is A, which occurs at theta=90 degrees, so when sin(theta) is 1.

So the fraction at theta=30 degrees would be f(theta)/A. But wait, f is the power per unit solid angle, so the maximum power A is f(theta) at theta=90. So the fraction we're looking for is f(30)/f(90).

Wait, but f(theta) is the power per solid angle. So if the maximum occurs at theta=90, then f(theta=90) is A. So the fraction is f
