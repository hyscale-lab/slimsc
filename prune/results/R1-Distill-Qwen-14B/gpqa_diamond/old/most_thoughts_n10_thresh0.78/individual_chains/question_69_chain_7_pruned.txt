Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a particle X⁰ decaying into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They want to find the minimum resolution needed in the bubble chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, that's the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So when the particle is moving, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the bubble chamber) will be longer due to time dilation. The formula for the dilated lifetime is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, how do I find γ? The Lorentz factor depends on the velocity of the particle and the speed of light. To find γ, I need the velocity, which can be found using the energy and mass of the particle.

The energy given is 27 GeV, which is the total energy of the X⁰ particle. The mass energy is m c² = 3.41 GeV. So the kinetic energy is E_kin = E_total - m c² = 27 - 3.41 = 23.59 GeV. Hmm, but maybe I can find the gamma directly from the total energy.

Oh right! The total energy E is γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). Plugging in the numbers: E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ let's calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Well, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, because 3.41*7=23.87. Then 3.41 * 7.9 ≈ 3.41 * 8 = 27.28, which is a bit over. So 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.915 or so. Let me get a more precise calculation.

Wait, 3.41 * 7.9 = (3 *7.9) + (0.41*7.9) = 23.7 + 3.239 = 26.939. Oh, that's very close to 27. So 7.9 is approximately the gamma. So γ ≈7.9.

So, the dilated lifetime τ = γ τ₀ = 7.9 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.9 *8 = 63.2, so τ≈63.2e-16 s, which is 6.32e-15 seconds? Wait, no, 63.2e-16 is 6.32e-15? Wait, 1e-15 is a femtosecond. Wait, no: 63.2e-16 = 6.32 × 10^-15 seconds. So, yeah.

Now, the particles have some lifetime, but the question is about the resolution needed to observe the decay. I think the resolution refers to the time resolution of the detector or the spatial resolution. Wait, in bubble chambers, the resolution is often about the precision in position—so how close together two decay vertices can be distinguished. Or perhaps it's the minimum distance over which a decay can be detected, so that you can see the track.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another thought: the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the rest frame, but the observed lifetime is longer. So the particle moves a certain distance before decaying, and to detect the decay, the detector must have a resolution better than that distance so that the decay can be observed.

Ah, right. The minimum distance the particle travels before decaying (the length of the track) must be resolved by the detector. So the proper length is L = v * τ₀, but since in lab frame the lifetime is longer, the length is L = v * τ = v * γ τ₀.

But wait, I think the formula for the mean decay length is L = γ v τ₀. Let me think. The particle's lifetime in the lab is γ τ₀, so the average distance it travels before decaying is v multiplied by that. So L
