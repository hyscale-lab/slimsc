Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question involves reactions with reducing agents and determining the starting materials based on the products and the reagents used. 

Alright, first, let's read the problem carefully. The chemist did two reactions. Each reaction used a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. Wait, no, the way it's written is:

Reaction 1: A + LiBH4 + H+ gives (R)-4-ethyl...
Reaction 2: B + BH3 + H+ gives (S)-4-ethyl...

Wait, no, no, actually, looking again: 

The first reaction produces (R)-4-ethyl..., and the second produces (S)-4-ethyl... 

The question is to choose the correct starting materials A and B from the options given.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what the starting materials are for each reaction. Both reactions produce derivatives of pyran-2-one with different stereochemistryâ€”R and S configurations. 

I think this involves the reduction of ketones or maybe esters. Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they typically reduce different types of carbonyl compounds. Hmm, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones, aldehydes, esters, and amides. BH3 (like BH3-THF) is used in hydroboration, which is for alkenes, but wait, no, in some contexts, BH3 can be used for ketone reductions as well. Wait, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, actually, BH3 is not a strong enough reducing agent on its own for esters or amides. LiBH4 is more powerful. So perhaps in this case, the starting materials are ketones or something else. Wait, but looking at the products
