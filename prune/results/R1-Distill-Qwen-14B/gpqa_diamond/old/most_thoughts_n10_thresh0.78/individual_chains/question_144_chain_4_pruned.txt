Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance, and I'm supposed to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, mesons are subatomic particles, right? And decay distance usually has something to do with how far they travel before breaking apart. I remember something about particle physics and lifetimes. Oh right, the mean decay length is calculated using the particle's lifetime and its velocity.

Wait, the problem gives production energy, mass, and width. Let me jot down the given values:

E_X = 8 GeV
m_X = 1.2 GeV
Γ_X = 320 MeV

Wait, I should probably convert GeV and MeV to the same units. Oh, right, 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV.

I think the first thing to do is find the lifetime of the meson. The mean lifetime (tau) is related to the total decay width. I remember there's a formula involving the width and the lifetime. Oh yes! The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty in energy times the uncertainty in time is roughly h-bar over 2. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ is the decay width, which is the total width. So yes, the mean lifetime τ is ħ divided by Γ. So I'll calculate that.

But I need to make sure I have the units right. ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So in units of GeV and seconds, that's handy.

So τ = ħ / Γ. Let's plug in the numbers. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, and Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / 0.32 GeV = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 20.56875e-25 seconds. Wait, that's 2.056875e-24 seconds? No, wait, 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s? Wait, no. 6.582
