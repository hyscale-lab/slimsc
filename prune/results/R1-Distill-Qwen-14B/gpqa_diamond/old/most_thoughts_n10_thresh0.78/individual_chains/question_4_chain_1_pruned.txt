Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, the question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, which is different from our real world where magnets always have both poles. The question asks which of Maxwell's equations would look different in such a universe.

Wait, okay, in our universe, magnets are dipoles—meaning they have both a north and south pole. Magnets can't have just one pole because magnetic monopoles don't exist. But in this scenario, they can have isolated poles, so monopoles exist. That must change some of Maxwell's equations.

Let me recall Maxwell's equations. There are four main ones:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our world, the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, says that the divergence of B is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic charges (monopoles). But if monopoles existed, then Gauss's Law for magnetism would have a term similar to Gauss's Law for electricity.

So the equation would change. Instead of ∇·B = 0, it would be something like ∇·B = μ_m ρ_m, where μ_m is the magnetic permeability and ρ_m is the magnetic charge density.

Wait, so equation 2 would definitely change. What about the others? Let's think about the other equations. Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. In the real world, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. That arises because there's no magnetic current, but if monopoles exist, does that affect this? Or does Faraday's Law remain the same?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. If there are magnetic monopoles, perhaps there's a magnetic current density similar to the electric current. In Ampère's Law, we have the displacement current, but that's part of Maxwell's addition. So if there were magnetic current, maybe the Faraday's Law would change.

Wait, in our world, Faraday's Law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t because there's no magnetic current. But if there's a magnetic current, maybe the equation would have an extra term. Alternatively, perhaps the other equation (Ampère's) would pick up a term.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let's think about symmetry. If electric charges are sources for E, and magnetic monopoles
