Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about meson resonance decay. I remember that mesons are particles made up of a quark and an antiquark, right? They're bosons and can be either force carriers or something else. But in this case, it's about their decay.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, with some numbers in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. 

I think the mean decay distance is related to how long the particle exists before decaying. The longer it exists, the farther it can travel. But how do I calculate that?

I recall that the mean lifetime (which is the average time a particle exists before decaying) is related to its width. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ΔE is the energy uncertainty and Δt is the time uncertainty. But in particle physics, the width Γ is related to the inverse of the lifetime. So Γ is like the energy uncertainty in the rest frame of the particle.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Wait, no, I think it's τ = ħ_bar / Γ. Because the width Γ is the total decay rate, and from natural line width considerations, the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So the formula should be τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the mean lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Hmm, I think that's correct. So once I have τ, I can find how far the particle travels before decaying.

But wait, the particle is moving when it decays. So the mean decay distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So distance L = v * τ. But I need to find the velocity of the meson X.

But how do I find v? Since the particle is moving relativistically, I'll need to use the energy and mass to find the velocity. The production energy is given as E_X = 8 GeV. Oh, but wait, in particle physics, the energy given is the total energy, so maybe it's the total energy of the meson.

The total energy E of a particle is related to its mass and momentum by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So I can solve for the momentum p, then find velocity v from that.

First, let's compute p. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. Let me plug into E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

Wait, but let me get all the units correct. GeVs are units of energy, so for calculations, it's easier to work in units where c=1, but when plugging into formulas, I need to be careful with units. Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate everything in natural units (GeV, GeV/c, etc.) and then convert to meters at the end.

So, let me write E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV/c². Wait, no, m is given in GeV, but actually mass should be in GeV/c². Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed.

So, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV/c². Let's compute p c:

(pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2.

But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², I think the units would work out if I express everything in compatible units.

Wait, let's compute pc in units of GeV:

(pc)² = (8 GeV)^2 - (1.2 GeV/c² * c²)^2.

Wait, m c² is (1.2 GeV/c²) * c² =1.2 GeV. So (m c²)^2 = (1.2)^2 (GeV)^2 = 1.44 GeV².

So (pc)^2 = 64 GeV² - 1.44 GeV² = 62.56 GeV².

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV.

So p = (7.91 GeV) / c.

Hmm, so p = (7.91 GeV/c) divided by c? Wait, no, wait. pc is in GeV, so p = (7.91 GeV) / c^2? No, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, pc is GeV. So p is (7.91 GeV) / c.

Because, when you have E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, the units for each term must match. So E is in GeV, m c² is GeV, and pc is GeV as well. So p is GeV/c.

Wait, E in GeV, so (pc) is in GeV, so p is GeV/(c), because GeV = (GeV/c) * c → so (pc) is GeV. So yes, p = (7.91 GeV/c).

Now, to find velocity, we can use the relation:

E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

But we can also express this in terms of beta (β) and gamma (γ). Remember that β = v/c, and γ = E/(m c²).

So γ = E/(m c²) = 8 GeV / (1.2 GeV) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

So γ = 6.6667.

Then, β = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Wait, let me compute that. 1/γ² = 1/( (8/1.2)^2 ) = (1.2/8)^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

So β = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. Hmm, so v ≈ 0.9887 c.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * speed of light. Let's note that the speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to find the velocity from the momentum and energy.

Alternatively, since we have p = gamma m v / c, but perhaps using beta and gamma.

But maybe I can find the velocity from the beta. So beta is 0.9887, so v is 0.9887 * c.

Now, once I have the velocity, I can compute the lifetime τ, then multiply by v to get the mean distance.

So, τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. Let's convert that to GeV to match units. 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / (0.32 GeV).

But wait, ħ has units of GeV·s because when you multiply by GeV, you get GeV·s. Wait, no, ħ in units where c=1 is about 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me recall that ħ ≈ 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So, τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) ) ≈ (6.582e-25 / 0.32) s ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, let me compute that: 6.582 / 0
