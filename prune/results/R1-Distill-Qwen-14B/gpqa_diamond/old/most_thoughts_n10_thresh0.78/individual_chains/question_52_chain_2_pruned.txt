Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is about a star with certain characteristics. When the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, I remember that in stellar atmospheres under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the number of atoms in different energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature. When spots are present, part of the surface is cooler, and the rest is at the original Teff. So the overall photospheric temperature isn't uniform, but the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE. Oh, but the observed ratio is from the photosphere as a whole, which is a combination of the cooler spots and the hotter (original) regions.

Wait, but when the star has spots, 40% of its surface is covered by spots. So 60% is at 6000 K, and 40% is at the spot temperature. Wait, what's the spot temperature? The problem says the overall Teff is 5500 K. Hmm, but I think I need to find the temperature of the spots. Because when the spots are present, the combined effect of the hotter and cooler areas gives a lower overall Teff.

Wait, but how does the coverage of spots affect the total flux? Maybe I should think about the flux from each part.

The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted regions. So the total flux when spots are present would be (0.6 * σ T_hot^4) + (0.4 * σ T_spot^4), where T_hot is 6000 K, and T_spot is the temperature of the spots.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the total flux when spots are present must be the same as the flux if the entire star were at 5500 K. So:

Total flux (with spots) = σ (5500)^4 = 0.6 σ (6000)^4 + 0.4 σ (T_spot)^4.

We can divide
