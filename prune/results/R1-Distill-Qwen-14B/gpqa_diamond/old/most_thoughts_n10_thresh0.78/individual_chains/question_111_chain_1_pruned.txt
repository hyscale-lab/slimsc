Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. My task is to determine the major products of each reaction and then choose the correct option from the given choices.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, what's this about? I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so probably an elimination reaction is involved here. Maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation? Wait, but wait, the starting material is a ketone. Oh, right, when a ketone and an ester are present with a base, that could lead to a cross-aldol addition. But wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester, which is a Michael acceptor. So maybe it's a Michael addition?

Wait, another thought: the starting material is a cyclic ketone. So maybe it's undergoing some kind of ring expansion. Oh wait, another possibility is that the base deprotonates the alpha position of the ketone, leading to enolate formation, which can then attack the acrylate ester in a conjugate addition.

Wait, so the structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that. The cyclohexanone ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. So position 1 is the ketone, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group (since it's 2-ethyl, 2,6-dimethyl). Wait, no. Wait, 2-ethyl would be one substituent, and 2,6-dimethyl would have two substituents, meaning at position 2, there's an ethyl and a methyl, and position 6 has a methyl group. So the substitu
