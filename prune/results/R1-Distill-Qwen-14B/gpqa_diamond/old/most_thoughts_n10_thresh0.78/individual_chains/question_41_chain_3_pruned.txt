Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? The options are given as A to D, and the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But wait, that's the speed relative to the medium itself when the medium is stationary. But in this case, the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of light?

I think this is a problem involving relative motion between the medium and the observer. So, the glass is moving, which would mean that the medium is not stationary in the lab frame. So I need to figure out how the speed of light changes when the medium is moving.

Wait, but in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, noâ€”that's only if the frames are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Because in the problem, the glass is moving at velocity v, which could be much less than c. So maybe I don't need to use special relativity here, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So, the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer, same direction as the beam. So, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion.

Let me think about the frame transformations. Suppose in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But how does this look from the lab frame, which sees the glass moving at velocity v?

So, the glass is moving at v in the lab frame. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n. Since the glass is moving towards the observer (and the beam is in the same direction), we might need to perform a velocity addition.

Wait, velocity addition in special relativity is done using the Lorentz transformations. But wait, maybe v is small enough that we can use the classical addition. But the problem gives a general case, so I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. But in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. So the speed of the light as observed in the lab would be different.

Wait, but if the glass is moving, then from the lab frame, the light's speed depends on both the medium's motion and the light's speed within that medium.

Wait, maybe I should model it using the frame transformations. Let's say S is the lab frame, and S' is the rest frame of the glass.

In S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at v_light = c/n. The direction is same as the glass's motion in S, which is towards the observer in S. So the glass is moving at velocity v in S (let's say along the x-axis).

In S', the light's velocity is v_light = c/n in the same direction as the glass's velocity
