Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and see what clues I can gather.

So, the question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds, labeled A1 to A5. Each of these must be different compounds, so Y must form five different binary fluorides. Hmm, binary compounds usually mean two elements, so each A is YF_x where x varies.

Looking at the details given:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction would produce fluorine gas. That suggests that A1 is more stable when it breaks down into A2 and F2. Maybe A1 has a higher oxidation state of Y, and upon decomposition, it releases F2 and forms a lower oxidation state compound. 

Wait, but fluorine is the most electronegative element, so Y must be in a lower oxidation state when it's in A2. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let's think. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, like YF3 or YF4, and upon decomposition, it breaks into YF2 (A2) and F2 gas. So the decomposition would be something like 2 YF3 → 2 YF2 + F2↑. Or maybe YF4 → YF2 + F2↑. I'm not sure yet. But this decomposition releases F2, so A1 must be a higher fluoride.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas. Oxidizing it would mean that A1 is acting as an oxidizing agent, so it's in a higher oxidation state. For example, if A1 is YF6, which is a strong oxidizing agent. Then when it reacts with Xe, it could oxidize it. But let's hold that thought.

2. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So fluorination typically adds F2 to an element, increasing the oxidation state. So Y in A3 is likely in a +1 or +3 oxidation state? Wait, fluorination would involve adding F atoms; but since F is usually -1, then Y would be in a +n state. Let me think, when Y is fluorinated, it probably gains F atoms. So the formula would be YF_x. For example, if Y is Cl, then fluorinating Cl would form ClF3 or something, but wait, Cl's common oxidation states are +1, +3, +5, +7. But fluorine is more electronegative, so in ClF3, Cl is +3, F is -1 each. Hmm, but Y is another element that forms five binary fluorides, so perhaps Y is chlorine? Because chlorine has several fluorides: ClF, ClF2, ClF3, ClF4, ClF5. But wait, I'm not sure if all these are known. Or maybe Y is another element.

Wait, the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2 suggests that A1 is a higher fluoride. For example, if Y is chlorine, perhaps A1 is ClF3, which decomposes into ClF (A2) and F2. Or maybe higher. Wait, but let's think about the fluorides of other elements. For example, sulfur has SF2, SF4, SF6. But that's three, not five. I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen? No, oxygen with F would be O2F2, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe Y is iodine? Iodine has IF, I2F5, IF3, IF5. Hmm, but that's maybe four? Not five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is carbon. But carbon's fluorides are CF4 and maybe some others, but I'm not sure if there are five. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal. For example, some metals form multiple fluorides. Let me think: for example, iron forms FeF2, FeF3. But that's only two, so maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus fluorides include PF3, PF5, maybe others. But again, perhaps not five. Hmm, maybe I'm going down the wrong path here.

Wait, let me think about the decomposition of A1. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, and the oF (oxidation state of F) in A2 is 31.96%, which I think refers to the molar percentage of F. Wait, ɷF is given as 31.96%. Oh wait, maybe that's the mole fraction of fluorine in A2. Because 31.96% is close to 32%, which is the atomic weight of sulfur (32 g/mol), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it refers to the mole fraction, which is the percentage of moles of F relative to the total moles in A2.

Wait, let's calculate. Suppose A2 is YF_x. The mole fraction of F is (x * 1 mol F) / (1 mol Y + x mol F) ) = x / (1 + x) = 0.3196 (31.96%). So let's solve for x: x / (1 + x) = 0.3196 → x = 0.3196 (1 + x) → x = 0.3196 + 0.3196 x → x - 0.3196 x = 0.3196 → 0.6804 x = 0.3196 → x ≈ 0.3196 / 0.6804 ≈ 0.47. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because x should be an integer. Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Alternatively, maybe the formula is YF3, so x=3. Let's compute 3/(1+3)=3/4=0.75 → 75%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that can't be it. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the percentage is the mass percent of F in A2. Let's think about that.

If A2 has a mass percent of F as 31.96%, then let's assume A2 is YF_x. The mass percent of F is (x * 19) / (atomic_weight_Y + x*19) ) * 100% = 31.96%. Let's denote atomic weight of Y as M. So (19x)/(M + 19x) = 0.3196 → 19x = 0.3196(M +19x) → 19x = 0.3196 M + 6.0724 x → 19x -6.0724x = 0.3196 M → 12.9276 x = 0.3196 M → M = (12.9276 x) / 0.3196 ≈ (12.9276 /0.3196 ) x → approximately 40.43 x. So M ≈ 40.43 x.

So M must be around 40 times x. Let me think of possible Ys. For x=1: M≈40.43 → which is close to 40, which is Ca (40). But Ca is a metal, not a non-metal. Hmm, but Y could be Ca? Let's see. If Y is Ca, then for x=1, CaF's molecular weight would be 40 + 19 = 59. But that seems low. Alternatively, Y could be something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think of Y as a non-metal. Let's think, for example, if Y is chlorine, which has an atomic weight of about 35.5. If x is 3, then M = 40.43 *3 ≈121.3. But Cl is 35.5, so doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus, which has an atomic weight around 31. If x is 1: M≈40.43 → no. x=2: 80.86 → P has atomic weight ~31, so 31 + 2*19 = 61 g/mol. 61 is much less than 80.86. Hmm. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal with a higher atomic weight. Let's think of Y as barium (Ba, ~137): if x=3, M=40.43 *3=121.3. Barium's atomic weight is about 137, which is close. But 137 is higher than 121. So for x=3, M would be 121.3, but Ba is 137. Hmm, not matching. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps the 31.96% is the molar percentage, not the mass percentage. So if A2 is YF_x, then the mole fraction of F is 31.96%, which is 0.3196.

So for YF_x, the mole fraction of F is x/(1 +x) = 0.3196 → x = 0.3196*(1 +x) → x = 0.3196 + 0.3196x → x - 0.3196x = 0.3196 → 0.6804 x = 0.3196 → x ≈ 0.3196 / 0.6804 → which is approximately 0.47, which is not an integer. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the given data. Maybe the percentage is the mass percentage. Let me try that again.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that the substance A2 is YF3. For YF3, the molecular weight is Y + 3*19 = Y +57. The mass percentage of F would be (57)/(Y +57) *100%. Let's set this equal to 31.96%:

57/(Y+57) = 0.3196 → Y+57 = 57 / 0.3196 → 57 / 0.3196 ≈ 178 → Y ≈ 178 -57 = 121. Hmm, but that would suggest Y has an atomic weight of about 121, which is around tellurium (Te, ~128) or perhaps something else. But tellurium is a non-metal. Wait, but let's see: if Y is Te, then YF3 would have a molecular weight of 128 + 57 = 185. The F mass percent is (57/(185))*100 → 30.8%. That's close to 31.96%. Hmm, maybe. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, let's think of other possibilities. Suppose A2 is YF4. The mass percent of F would be (4*19)/(Y +4*19) *100% = 76/(Y+76) *100 =31.96 →76/(Y+76)=0.3196 → Y+76 =76/0.3196≈237.7 → Y≈237.7-76=161.7. That's way too high; no element has such a high atomic weight. So perhaps A2 is YF2.

For YF2: (2*19)/(Y+38)*100 =31.96 →38/(Y+38) =0.3196 → Y+38=38/0.3196≈118.8 → Y≈118.8 -38=80.8. That's close to strontium (Sr, ~87.6). Hmm, but 80.8 is between Y (89) and maybe some other metal. Alternatively, maybe Y is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's think about the fluorides of some elements and see which one has five binary compounds.

Wait, I remember that fluorine can form multiple fluorides with certain elements. For example, sulfur can form SF2, SF4, SF6. That's three. Maybe chlorine has more. Chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Wait, that's three. Maybe iodine? I think iodine forms IF, I2F5, IF3, IF5. That's four. Hmm, not five. Alternatively, perhaps another element.

Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal, like lead. Lead forms PbF2, PbF4, etc. But I'm not sure how many. Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus. Phosphorus has PF3 and PF5. Only two. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the decomposition reaction. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, and upon decomposition, it releases F2 and forms a lower fluoride. For example, if A1 is YF6, which upon decomposition forms YF4 and F2. Wait, but YF6 is a high oxidation state. Let's see: if A1 is YF6, then decomposing into YF4 and F2. The reaction would be 2 YF6 → 2 YF4 + F2↑. Let's check the fluorine balance: 2*(6) =12 F on the left. On the right: 2*(4) =8 +2 =10 F. Doesn't balance. So that can't be right. Maybe 4 YF6 → 4 YF4 + 3 F2. Let's check: 4*6=24 F on left; right: 4*4=16 F + 3*2=6 → total 22 F. Still not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF4, which decomposes into YF2 and F2. The reaction: 2 YF4 → 2 YF2 + F2↑. Let's check fluorine: 2*4=8 F on left. Right: 2*2=4 +2=6 → 8 F. So that works. So A2 would be YF2. Then, since A2 has a fluorine content of 31.96%, let's compute for YF2.

Mass percent of F: (2*19)/(Y + 38) *100 =31.96 → 38/(Y+38) =0.3196 → Y+38=38/0.3196 ≈118.8 → Y=118.8-38=80.8. So Y would have an atomic weight around 80.8. Strontium is about 87.6. Close, but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, maybe Y is barium? Barium has an atomic weight around 137. Let's see: YF2 would have (2*19)/(137 +38)=38/175=0.217 → 21.7%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the initial assumption about A1 is incorrect. Let's think again.

A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so for A1 to oxidize it, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. What is a strong oxidizing fluoride? Perhaps Y is an element that in a high oxidation state forms a strong fluoride. For example, if Y is chlorine, ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent. But ClF3 decomposes upon standing? Or perhaps Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: the problem mentions that five binary compounds exist. So Y must form five different fluorides. Let me think of elements that form five or more fluorides. I'm trying to think of one. Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine. Let me think about chlorine fluorides.

Chlorine fluorides include: ClF, ClF3, ClF5. Wait, that's three. Or maybe there are others, like ClF2 and ClF4? I'm not sure if ClF2 and ClF4 are stable. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen. But O forms OF2, O2F2; that's two. Not enough.

Wait, another thought: maybe Y is a transition metal that forms multiple fluorides. For example, lead forms PbF2, PbF4. Only two. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps Y is iodine. I know iodine forms IF, I2F5, IF3, IF5. That's four. Maybe another fluoride exists, like I3F? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe Y is tellurium. Tellurium forms TeF2, TeF4, TeF6. That's three. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a non-metal that forms more than three fluorides. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a transition metal that forms more fluorides. Wait, perhaps Y is molybdenum. I'm not sure about its fluorides. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me think about the decomposition again. A1 → A2 + F2. So A1 must be a higher fluoride than A2. Let's say A1 is YF6 and A2 is YF4. Wait, but earlier that didn't balance. Or maybe A1 is YF5, which decomposes into YF3 and F2. Let's see: 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2. Let's check F on both sides: 2*5=10 on left. Right: 2*3=6 +2=8. Not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF3, which decomposes into YF and F2. So 2 YF3 → 2 YF + 3 F2. Let's check: 2*3=6 F on left. Right: 2*1=2 + 3*2=6 → 8 F. Not balanced. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition equation is YF6 → YF4 + F2. Let's see: 2 YF6 → 2 YF4 + F2. F on left: 2*6=12. Right: 2*4=8 +2=10. Not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's 4 YF6 → 4 YF4 + 3 F2. F: 4*6=24 on left. Right:4*4=16 +3*2=6 → 22. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck on the decomposition part. Let's move to another clue.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 would be YF_x, probably the most common fluoride. For example, if Y is Cl, then A3 could be ClF3. A3 can interact with xenon. So perhaps A3 is a weaker oxidizing agent than A1 but still can react with Xe under certain conditions.

Then, the next clue: adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. A5 decomposes in water to form two substances. So A4 is a solution, likely a fluoride. When Y is added, A5 is formed. Then, when A5 is in water, it decomposes into two substances.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of a different compound. Let me think of possible A4. For example, if A4 is YF6, a concentrated solution. Adding Y (solid, perhaps) in 1:1 molar ratio. So for each mole of Y, one mole of A4 reacts. Let's suppose Y is Cl. Then A4 could be ClF6? Hmm, but ClF6 is not a known compound. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF5. Adding Cl (in 1:1 ratio) would produce ClF6? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF3. Adding Cl would produce ClF4? But ClF4 is a known compound. So when A4 is ClF3 and Y is Cl, adding in 1:1 ratio, perhaps produces ClF4. Then A5 is ClF4. When ClF4 is in water, it decomposes. ClF4 + H2O → products. The two substances formed could be HF and HClO4? Not sure about the exact products, but perhaps that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think of another scenario. If A4 is YF5, adding Y would produce YF6. Then, A5 is YF6. When YF6 decomposes in water, perhaps it forms Y(OH)F5 and HF, or something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF6, which is a strong oxidizing agent. Maybe the reaction with Y is to form a lower fluoride. Hmm, but I'm not making progress here.

Wait, going back to the decomposition of A1. Let's suppose that A1 is ClF3, which upon decomposition produces ClF and F2. ClF3 is known to be unstable and can decompose. The decomposition would be 4 ClF3 → 2 ClF + 3 F2. Let's check F: 4*3=12 left. Right: 2*(1) +3*(2)=2+6=8. Not balanced. Hmm, maybe 2 ClF3 → 2 ClF + F2. F: 6 left; right: 2 +2=4. Not balanced.

Alternatively, maybe the decomposition reaction is ClF3 → ClF2 + F2. Let's check: 2 ClF3 → 2 ClF2 + F2. F: 6 left → 4 +2=6. So that works. So A2 would be ClF2. Then, the mass percent of F in ClF2: (2 *19)/(35.5 + 38) =38/(73.5)= ~52%. But the given is 31.96%, so that's not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF5. Let's see decomposition: ClF5 → ClF3 + F2. Let's see: 2 ClF5 → 2 ClF3 + F2. F on left: 10 → right:6 + 2=8. Not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is ClF5, which decomposes into ClF3 and F2. Let's try 4 ClF5 → 4 ClF3 + 3 F2. F: 20 left → 12 +6=18. Not balanced. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the possible elements Y that form five binary fluorides. I'm not sure any common element does, but maybe it's a transition metal or a non-metal with multiple oxidation states.

Another approach: the problem gives five binary compounds (A1 to A5), so Y must form five different fluorides. Maybe Y is a transition metal that can have multiple oxidation states. For example, lead (Pb) forms PbF2 and PbF4, but that's only two. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a less common element.

Wait, perhaps Y is astatine, which is a halogen. Astatine forms AtF, AtF3, AtF5, AtF7. That's four, but I'm not sure if there's a fifth. Alternatively, perhaps it's another element.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a metalloid like tellurium. Te forms TeF2, TeF4, TeF6. Only three. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal that forms several fluorides. For example, molybdenum. Let me think: molybdenum can form MoF2, MoF3, MoF4, MoF5, MoF6. That's five. So Y could be molybdenum (Mo), which has an atomic weight of about 96.

If Y is Mo, then let's see what the fluorides would look like. So A1 could be MoF6. It might decompose into MoF4 and F2. Let's check the fluorine content in A2. If A2 is MoF4, then the mass percent of F is (4*19)/(96 +4*19) =76/(96+76)=76/172≈44.2%. But the given is 31.96%, which is lower. Hmm. So maybe A2 is MoF3. Let's compute.

For MoF3: (3*19)/(96 +3*19) =57/(96+57)=57/153≈37.2%. Still higher than 31.96%. Hmm.

Wait, maybe Y is another element. Let me think of Y as rhenium. Rhenium forms ReF2, ReF3, ReF4, ReF5, ReF6. That's five. So Y could be rhenium (Re), which has an atomic weight of about 186.7.

If A2 is ReF2, then the mass percent of F is (2*19)/(186.7 +38) → 38/(224.7)≈16.9%. That's lower than 31.96%. Hmm.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think differently. Let's get back to the problem. The question asks for the molecular weight range of A4.

The process to get A5 is adding Y in 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4. Then, A5 is formed, and when it decomposes in water, it forms two substances.

If A4 is a solution of a fluoride, perhaps it's a hexafluoride. For example, YF6. When Y is added, perhaps it reduces the fluoride to a lower state, like YF5. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is YF5. When Y is added, perhaps it reacts to form YF6. For example, YF5 + Y → YF6. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF4. Adding Y (solid) in 1:1 molar ratio could produce YF2. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF3. Adding Y (as metal) could produce YF2 via a displacement reaction. But again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps A4 is YF6, which is a liquid or a solution. When Y is added, perhaps it produces YF5 and HF. For example: YF6 + Y → 2 YF5. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another angle: the decomposition of A5 in water produces two substances. Let's think of possible A5 compounds that decompose in water. For example, if A5 is ClF5, it might react with water to form HClO3 and HF, but I'm not certain. Or maybe it's another fluoride.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a salt that decomposes into an acid and another compound. For example, if A5 is CaF2, it would decompose in water into Ca(OH)2 and HF, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a higher fluoride like YF6, which reacts with water to form Y(OH)F5 and HF. Or something else.

Wait, perhaps A5 is a higher fluoride, and when it decomposes in water, it forms a hydroxide and HF. For example, YF6 + H2O → Y(OH)F5 + HF. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a different compound, like Y2F6 (dimer of YF3?), which upon decomposition gives YF2 and HF. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is a metal fluoride that reacts with water to form an acid (like HCl) and HF. But I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try to focus on the initial part and see if I can find Y.

Another thought: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. If Y is in +3 oxidation state in A1, then in A2 it could be +1 or +2. Let me think. For example, if A1 is YF3, which decomposes into YF and F2. But that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps Y is in a higher oxidation state in A1. Let's think of Y as Cl. Then, A1 could be ClF3, which is a known compound. ClF3 decomposes into ClF and F2. The reaction would be 4 ClF3 → 2 ClF + 3 F2. Let's check fluorine: 12 left → 2 +6=8. Not balanced. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is 2 ClF3 → 2 ClF + F2. F: 6 → 2 +2=4. Not balanced. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the molecular weight of A4. The options are A) 140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

If I can find the molecular weight of A4, I can match it to the options.

If Y is Cl, then A4 could be ClF5. Molecular weight is 35.5 +5*19=35.5+95=130.5. So that's in the D range (110-130). But I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: Y is phosphorus. A4 could be PF5, which has a molecular weight of 31 +5*19=31+95=126, which is in D range. But earlier, when I thought A2 is PF3, the F mass percent was 57/(31+57)=57/88≈64.7%, which is higher than 31.96%, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, if Y is sulfur. Then, A4 could be SF6. Molecular weight: 32 +6*19=32+114=146, which falls into option A (140-160). But earlier, when I considered A2 as SF4, the F mass percent was (4*19)/(32 +76)=76/108≈70.37%, which is higher than 31.96%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is tin. Sn forms SnF2, SnF4. Only two, so not five. Hmm.

Another possibility: Y is carbon. Carbon forms CF4. Only one, so no.

Wait, perhaps Y is germanium. Germanium forms GeF2, GeF4, GeF6. That's three. Still not five.

Hmm, perhaps Y is iodine. I2F5 is a known compound. Let's see: I2F5 has a molecular weight of 2*126.9 +5*19=253.8 +95=348.8. That's in option B (220-240? No, 348 is higher. So no.

Wait, another approach: perhaps A4 is YF6. Molecular weight would be Y +6*19= Y +114. If Y is Cl (35.5), then YF6 is 35.5+114=149.5. That falls into option A (140-160). So that could be a possibility.

But earlier, when I thought Y was Cl, the decomposition of ClF3 into ClF and F2 didn't balance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is another element. Let me think: if Y is Br. Then, BrF3 is a known compound. Let's see, what's the F mass percent in BrF3?

Br has atomic weight ~79.9. BrF3: 79.9 +3*19=79.9+57=136.9. F mass percent: (57)/(136.9) → ~41.6%. That's higher than 31.96%. So A2 can't be BrF3.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a transition metal with a higher atomic weight. Let's think of Y as Y (the element). Y has an atomic weight of about 89. So YF2 would be 89 +38=127. The F mass percent is 38/127≈29.9%, which is close to 31.96%. Not exact, but perhaps possible. So Y could be the element Yttrium (Y).

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think. If Y is Yttrium (Y), then YF2 would have (38)/(89 +38) =38/127≈29.9% F. That's close to 31.96%. Hmm, maybe I'm off a bit, but perhaps it's Y.

If Y is Yttrium, then A2 is YF2. The decomposition of A1 (which is a higher fluoride, like YF4 or YF6) produces YF2 and F2.

Wait, let me think of YF6. If A1 is YF6, then the decomposition reaction could be 2 YF6 → 2 YF4 + F2. Let's check F: 2*6=12 → 2*4=8 +2=10 → not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is YF6 → YF4 + F2. Let me see: 2 YF6 → 2 YF4 + F2. F: 12 →8 +2=10. Not balanced.

Alternatively, maybe 4 YF6 → 4 YF4 + 3 F2. F:24 → 16 +6=22 → no.

Hmm, maybe the decomposition is different. Alternatively, maybe A1 is YF4. Decomposition: YF4 → YF2 + F2. Let's see: 2 YF4 → 2 YF2 + F2. F: 8 →4 +2=6. Not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, 4 YF4 → 4 YF2 + 3 F2. F:16 →8 +6=14. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the decomposition is 2 YF5 → 2 YF3 + F2. Let me check fluorine: 10 →6 +2=8. Not balanced.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think about A4. If A4 is YF6, its molecular weight is Y (89) +6*19=89+114=203. So that's in option B (220-240? No, 203 is below 220). So that's not matching any option. Alternatively, maybe A4 is another fluoride.

Wait, another possibility: A4 is YF5. Molecular weight: 89 +5*19=89+95=184. That's in option C (160-180). Hmm, 184 is just above 180, so it's outside option C. So option C's upper limit is 180, so 184 is over. So perhaps it's not Y.

Alternatively, maybe Y is a different element. Let's think if Y could be something else.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A5 in water gives two substances. If A5 is YF6, it might decompose into Y(OH)F5 and HF. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A5 is YF4, which in water forms Y(OH)2 and HF. Or something like that.

Hmm, perhaps I should stop getting stuck and make an educated guess based on the information I have.

Given that the options are A)140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

From earlier, if Y is Cl, A4 could be ClF5 with MW 130.5, which is in D (110-130). Or if Y is Yttrium, A4 could be YF6 with MW 203, which is not in any option. Alternatively, if Y is another element, perhaps YF3's MW falls into one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is astatine, which has an atomic weight of about 210. So A4 would be AtF5, which is 210+5*19=210+95=305, which is higher than any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again about the decomposition of A1. If A2 is YF2 with a F mass% of ~31.96%, then as earlier, Y's atomic weight would be about 80.8. Close to strontium (Sr, ~87.6). So Y is Sr.

So Y is Strontium (Sr, atomic weight ~87.6). Then, A2 is SrF2. Let's compute the F mass%: (2*19)/(87.6 +38)=38/(125.6)=30.26%. Close to 31.96%, but not exact. Maybe the actual value is a bit higher, but let's proceed.

So A1 decomposes into SrF2 and F2. Let's think of A1 as SrF4. Decomposition reaction: SrF4 → SrF2 + F2. Let's balance it. 2 SrF4 → 2 SrF2 + F2. F: 8 →4 +2=6. Not balanced. Hmm, perhaps 4 SrF4 → 4 SrF2 + 3 F2. F:16 →8 +6=14. No.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is SrF6. Decomposition: SrF6 → SrF4 + F2. Let's balance: 2 SrF6 →2 SrF4 + F2. F:12 →8 +2=10. Not balanced. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is SrF3. Let's see: decomposition into SrF2 and F2. Reaction: 2 SrF3 → 2 SrF2 + F2. F:6 →4 +2=6. That works. So A1 is SrF3, which decomposes into SrF2 (A2) and F2. SrF3 has a molecular weight of 87.6 +57=144.6. So A1 is SrF3.

Wait, but then A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Sr). So A3 could be SrF2, but that's the same as A2. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem says that A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So fluorinating Sr (which is in elemental form) would add fluorine, perhaps forming SrF2. But SrF2 is a known compound. So A3 is SrF2.

But then A3 can interact with xenon. Hmm, I'm not sure how SrF2 would react with xenon. Maybe as an oxidizing agent? But SrF2 is not a strong oxidizing agent.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's think differently.

Assuming Y is Sr, then:

A1: SrF3 (MW 144.6)
A2: SrF2 (MW 125.6)
A3: SrF (but SrF is not common; maybe SrF2)
A4: Some other fluoride, perhaps SrF6 (MW 87.6+114=201.6). That would fall into option B (220-240? No, 201 is below 220). So option A is 140-160, which is where SrF3 is (144.6). So perhaps A4 is SrF3, but then what is A4?

Wait, the question says adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. So if A4 is SrF5, which is not a common compound, but let's say it's possible. Then adding Sr metal would produce SrF6. But I'm not sure about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is SrF6, and adding Sr metal would produce SrF something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of YF6, and adding Y metal produces YF5. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is YF4 (SrF4, MW 87.6 +76=163.6). That's in option C (160-180). If A4 is SrF4, then adding Sr would produce what? If the reaction is SrF4 + Sr → 2 SrF2, then A5 would be SrF2. But then when SrF2 decomposes in water, it might react, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A4 is SrF5, which has a molecular weight of 87.6 +5*19=87.6+95=182.6, which falls into option C (160-180). So if A4 is SrF5, then adding Sr would produce SrF6. But SrF6 is not a common compound, but perhaps it's possible.

When SrF6 decomposes in water, perhaps it reacts to form Sr(OH)F5 and HF. But I'm not certain about that.

Hmm, despite all this confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option C (160-180), as the molecular weight of A4 would be around 163 (SrF4) or 182 (SrF5), both of which fall into option C.


The problem involves determining the molecular weight range of substance A4, given the context of five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Decomposition of A1**: A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine gas (F2). This suggests A1 is a higher fluoride, and A2 is a lower fluoride. The decomposition reaction must balance fluorine atoms. For example, if A1 is YF6, it might decompose into YF4 and F2, but balancing the equation proves challenging. Similarly, if A1 is YF3, it might decompose into YF and F2, but this also does not balance.

2. **Oxidation of Xenon**: A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. This suggests A1 is in a high oxidation state, such as YF6 or YF5.

3. **Fluorination of Y to Form A3**: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, likely forming a fluoride such as YF2 or YF3. A3 can also interact with xenon, suggesting it retains some oxidizing properties.

4. **Formation of A5**: Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. This suggests A4 is likely a higher fluoride (e.g., YF6 or YF5), and adding Y reduces it to a lower fluoride (e.g., YF4 or YF3).

5. **Molecular Weight of A4**: The molecular weight of A4 depends on the identity of Y and its fluoride. Several possibilities for Y are considered:
   - If Y is chlorine (Cl), A4 could be ClF5 (molecular weight ≈ 130.5), which falls into the range 110-130 (Option D).
   - If Y is sulfur (S), A4 could be SF6 (molecular weight ≈ 146), which falls into the range 140-160 (Option A).
   - If Y is strontium (Sr), A4 could be SrF4 (molecular weight ≈ 163.6) or SrF5 (molecular weight ≈ 182.6). SrF4 falls into the range 160-180 (Option C), and SrF5 is just above this range.

6. **Final Consideration**: Based on the decomposition reactions and the formation of A5, SrF4 (molecular weight ≈ 163.6) is a plausible candidate for A4, as it aligns with the reaction conditions and falls within the range 160-180.

**Answer: C**
