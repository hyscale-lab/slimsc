Okay, so I've got this biology problem here about creating a transgenic mouse model. The main goal is to study the role of the GADD45G protein in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're trying to overexpress this protein using a plasmid. But when they do the experiment, they can't get the protein to overexpress. They checked the construct's sequence and found something's wrong.

Let me think through what's going on. So, the construct's plus strand sequence is provided. The idea is that they added a hemagglutinin tag to the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. They transfected the plasmid into CHO cells, but the protein isn't overexpressing. They're looking for the reason why.

Looking at the options, the possible issues could be related to the construct's sequence. Let me check each option.

Option A says there's a missense mutation in the HA sequence. A missense would change an amino acid, but if the HA is at the N-terminus, maybe it's causing the protein to not be recognized for expression. But without knowing the exact HA sequence, I'm not sure if that's the case here. Plus, if the HA is missing or mutated, maybe the protein is expressed but not tagged, but why wouldn't it be overexpressed?

Option B suggests the ribosome stops early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If there's a UAA, UAG, or UGA somewhere, the ribosome would terminate. Let me look at the sequence for any in-frame stop codons.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Let me scan through for any of the stop codons: TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the DNA sequence, since it's the plus strand, the coding strand is the same as the mRNA (except T instead of U). So I need to look for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the triplets.

Wait, but the provided sequence is the coding (sense) strand, right? So the mRNA would be complementary. So each codon is in the mRNA as the same as written except T becomes U.

So let's go through the sequence to check for any TGA, TAG, or TAA codons.

The sequence starts with ATG, so that's methionine, start. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. Next is CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

That's a long sequence. Let me go through every triplet to see if any are stop codons.

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA.

Looking for any TGA: Let's see.

Looking at a few parts:

- The start is ATG, so no stop yet.

Further in, after ATG, there's TAC, then CCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, let me check for TGA:

Looking for TGA as a triplet.

Looking for any TGA:

Looking through the sequence:

- ATG: start
- TAC
- CC A (but I'm not sure, maybe I should write the mRNA sequence from the DNA.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to take the DNA sequence, which is the coding (sense) strand, so mRNA is same as DNA except T→U. So looking for any TGA in mRNA would be TGA in DNA, but perhaps I should make the mRNA version.

Wait, no. The DNA is the coding strand, so the mRNA is complementary to the template strand. So the coding strand is same as mRNA (with T→U).

So for the mRNA, any TGA in the DNA would be complementary to CAT in the template. No, sorry, wait: For a DNA sequence, the coding strand is same as mRNA, but with T instead of U.

So looking for TGA in mRNA would be TGA in the DNA coding strand. So let's look for TGA anywhere in the provided DNA.

Looking again:

Wait, in the DNA, each triplet is in the mRNA as T becomes U.

So looking for TGA in the DNA would translate to TGU in mRNA? Wait no, because the mRNA is synthesized from the template (non-coding) strand, which is the complement of the coding (given) strand.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The problem is that the coding (sense) strand is the same as the mRNA, except T→U. So any TGA in the coding DNA would correspond to TGA in the mRNA, which is a stop codon.

So I need to check if any triplet in the given DNA sequence is TGA.

Looking through:

Looking at the end of the sequence, I see ... AAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the last part is ...CGAGTGA. Let's see:

Last few bases: ...CGAGTGA. So that's CGA GTA. Hmm, no, wait, the triplet is GAG, TGA.

Wait, no, the triplet is the three nucleotides. Let me look for TGA in the DNA.

Wait, in the given DNA sequence, the last part is ...AGTGA3'.

Breaking it down:

...CGAGTGA3'

So that's CGA GTA. Wait, no, each triplet is three bases. So looking from the start:

Let me parse the sequence in triplets.

The sequence is:

5' ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCG GAT GCA GGG TGC CGG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA GTT GCT GCT GTC GGC GCA GCG TCA GGG CTG CTC ACT GCC GGC GTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting lost. Let me approach this differently. Let me look for any occurrence of TGA in the DNA sequence.

Looking through the sequence, perhaps I can find a TGA triplet.

Wait, let me look for the triplet 'TGA' in the DNA sequence.

Looking at the sequence:

Looking for T, G, A in a row.

Wait, I see 'TGA' in the middle:

Looking for TGA:

In the given DNA, I see ... GCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGG
