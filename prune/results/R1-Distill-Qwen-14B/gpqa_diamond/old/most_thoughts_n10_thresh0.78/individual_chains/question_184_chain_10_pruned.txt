Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these synthesis problems. Let's take it step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, I need to figure out the reaction sequence starting from benzene. Let me try to break down the structure.

First, the benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering goes in a way that the substituents get the lowest numbers possible. Let me visualize the structure: the tert-butyl is at position 2, nitro at position 3, and ethoxy at position 1. Or wait, maybe it's 2-tert-butyl, 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So the substituents are adjacent in a meta arrangement? Or maybe ortho and meta.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the substituents' positions. The numbering would have the ethoxy as position 1, then moving clockwise, the tert-butyl at position 2, and the nitro at position 3. So their positions are 1, 2, 3 in a row. That would make them meta to each other, but maybe not. Wait, no, because in benzene, each substituent is adjacent. So 1, 2, 3 would be in a row, but that's not possible because that would require three substituents in a line, which can be done via di-substitution and then another.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the directing effects of each substituent. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an ortho/para director, and tert-butyl is a bulky group, which I think is also a meta director but due to steric hindrance? Or wait, is tert-butyl a para/ortho director? Because tert-butyl is a strong activating group? No, wait, the tert-butyl group is a bulky
