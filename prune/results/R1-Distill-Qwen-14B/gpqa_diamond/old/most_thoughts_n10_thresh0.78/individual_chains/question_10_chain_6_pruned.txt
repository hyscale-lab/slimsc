Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. There are four options, a, b, c, d, each describing a different planet. The options provided are A to D, each corresponding to one of these exoplanets.

Let me first recap what I know about density and planets. Density is mass divided by volume. So, a planet's density depends on both its mass and its size (radius), because volume is proportional to the radius cubed. So, even if two planets have the same mass, if one is bigger, it'll be less dense.

Looking at the options:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, same as Earth. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, which is the same as option b's density. So a) is Earth-like.

b) 2 Earth masses, density 5.5 g/cm³. Hmm, same as Earth's density but more mass. Since density is same, but mass is higher, that suggests the volume must be higher as well. Because density = mass/volume, so if mass doubles and density stays same, volume doubles. But volume depends on radius cubed. So if volume doubles, radius is cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. Which is about 1.26 times. So a bigger planet than Earth but same density. So, what's the issue?

c) Same composition as Earth but five times Earth's mass. Wait, same composition implies similar density, right? Because composition determines density. So if it's same as Earth, which is about 5.5 g/cm³, then this planet's density is same as Earth. But wait, the question says "same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive". So same density, so it's similar to Earth but larger. So, higher mass but same density.

Wait, but if the composition is the same, the density remains the same. So this planet would have a higher mass, implying a larger radius, but same density as Earth. So same as option a's density perhaps? But no, option a is same mass and radius as Earth. But option c is larger, so higher mass but same density.

d) Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same composition implies same density as Earth, but smaller size. Because if mass is less but same density, the volume is smaller. So radius is smaller than Earth's.

Wait, but the question is about which planet has the highest density. So the densities of each option:

Option a: same as Earth. So 5.5.

Option b: given as 5.5. So same as a and c.

Option c: same composition as Earth. So 5.5 as well.

Option d: same composition as Earth, so 5.5.

Wait, if all of a, b, c, d have the same or different densities? Wait, no. Let me read the question again.

Wait, the question lists four options (a to d), each describing a planet's characteristics. The options A to D correspond to which of a to d is the correct answer.

Looking again:

Option a: Earth mass and radius →
