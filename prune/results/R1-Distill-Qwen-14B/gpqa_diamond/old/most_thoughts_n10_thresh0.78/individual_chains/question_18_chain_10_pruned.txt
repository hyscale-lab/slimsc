Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I remember that the notation [X/Y]_star means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundance compared to the Sun. Oh wait, right, it's log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun, which is the same as log10(nX/nY star / nX/nY sun) = [X/Y]_star.

The question gives me some data. Let's list what I know:

Star 1:
Mass: 1.5 solar masses
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe compared to the Sun.
[Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe abundance is same as Sun, because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) - solar log(nFe/nH). Wait, no, wait. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) in star minus same in sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, then nFe/nH is same as Sun.

Star 2:
Mass: 1.2 solar masses
[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. So Mg is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Si than in Sun.
[Mg/H]_2 = 0. So Mg is same as Sun.

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star 1 and Star 2 photospheres, so n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Wait, but how? Maybe I can express the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen in each star, then take the ratio.

Let me think about the Sun's composition first. The Sun's photosphere has:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nM
