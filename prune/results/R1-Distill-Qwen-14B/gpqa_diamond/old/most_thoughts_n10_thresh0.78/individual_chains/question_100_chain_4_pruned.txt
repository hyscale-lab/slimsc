Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the incorrect statement about the products in the reaction sequence. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question starts with Compound A, which has the formula C3H6. Hmm, that's either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, but considering the reactions, maybe it's propene because cyclopropane is pretty stable and might not react as readily in certain conditions.

Compound A undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh right, that's a typical dibromination, but wait, no—wait, carbon tetrachloride is a solvent. Bromination of alkenes usually uses NBS (which is for allylic bromination) or Br2 with a solvent. Wait, if it's CCl4, that's probably the classic addition reaction for alkenes. So if A is propene (CH2=CHCH3), bromination would add Br2 across the double bond. So the product B would be 1,2-dibromopropane, I think. So structure would be Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3.

Next, B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Oh, that's a dehydrohalogenation reaction. So the base would abstract a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene. Since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two equivalents of HBr. Wait, but 1,2-dibromopropane has two adjacent Br atoms. So upon elimination, it would lose two HBr molecules and form propene again? Or wait, no—wait, in such a case, the base could attack either of the adjacent carbons. Wait, but wait—if the structure is Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3, elimination would produce propene (CH2=CHCH3) because
