Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the speed of light in glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm. Let's see what the problem says.

Alright, the setup: a light beam is moving through a glass with an index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and toward the observer in the lab. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh wait, right, the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1 here.

Wait, so I need to find the speed of light in the glass from the lab frame's perspective. But wait, the glass is moving, so does that affect the speed of light inside it? I remember that in special relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium?

Wait, no. Wait a minute. The speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. But wait, that's the speed in the rest frame of the medium. But from another frame, like the lab frame where the glass is moving, does the speed change?

Hmm. So the glass is moving at velocity v. So I'm in the lab frame watching the glass move. But the light is inside the glass, so how does that affect its speed?

Wait, in relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. But wait, that's for objects with mass, not for the speed of light itself. Because the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, regardless of the motion of the source or the observer.

Wait, no. Wait, but that's in a vacuum. What about in a medium? Because the glass isn't a vacuum. So the speed of light in the medium is v = c/n in the rest frame of the glass. But from the lab frame, where the glass is moving, what's the speed of the light?

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's break it down. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So in the glass's rest frame, the light's speed is c/n. But the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab frame.

So, to find the speed of the light as observed in the lab frame, we need to apply the velocity addition formula. Because the light's velocity in the glass's frame is v_light = c/n in the direction of the beam. But wait, the direction matters because the glass is moving towards the observer.

Wait, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. Hmm. Wait, same direction as the beam. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass is moving. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n, which is 1/n since c=1. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be... I think we have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Oh wait, but wait. The velocity addition formula is for when you have two velocities u and u', and you want to find the observed velocity u'' in another frame.

Wait,
