Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about stability constants and coordination complexes. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, which is 0.01 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Wait, wait. First, I should remember what stability constants mean. The stability constant (β) for a complex ion indicates how stable the complex is. The higher the β, the more the complex will form.

So, the complexes we're considering are various forms of Co(II) with thiocyanate. Let's think about the possible complexes. Co(II) can form complexes with different numbers of SCN^- ions. For example, Co(SCN)^(n-), where n is the number of SCN ligands.

The given β values are for the complexes with 1 to 4 SCN ligands, I suppose. Because β1 is the stability constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So, the complexes are Co(SCN), Co(SCN)2, Co(SCN)3, and Co(SCN)4. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Like β1 is for the first complex (monomeric), β2 for the second (dimer?), or perhaps each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex, going step by step.

Wait, no, the stability constants are for each successive formation. So, β1 is the formation constant for the first step: Co^2+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)^+ with β1=9. Then β2 would be for the next step: Co(SCN)^+ + SCN^- ↔ Co(SCN)_2^(2-?), but wait, wait. Wait, each step adds another SCN^-.

Wait, wait, the stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So, each step adds one SCN^-.

So, the first complex is [CoSCN]^
