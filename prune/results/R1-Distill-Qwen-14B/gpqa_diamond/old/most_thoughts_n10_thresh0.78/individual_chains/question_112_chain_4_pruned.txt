Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, these are the standard spin-up and spin-down states along the z-axis.

The first part is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = ħ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, that's a 2x2 matrix then because it's for spin-1/2. Let me think about what that matrix looks like.

Since it's 2x2, the indices i and j can be 1 and 2. So, when i ≠ j, the elements are ħ/2. So the matrix would be:
[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, no, because for i=1, j=2, and i=2, j=1, these are the non-zero elements. So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are ħ/2. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the Pauli X operator multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so if you multiply each element by ħ/2, you get this A matrix.

The eigenstates of the Pauli X operator are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates |+x> and |-x> are the states where you'll get definite eigenvalues when measuring the X component of spin.

So, the problem is to find the probabilities that the state |alpha> is in each of these eigenstates |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, but the question says "the eigenstates of the operator". So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates. Then the probabilities will be the square of the absolute values of the coefficients.

First, I need to normalize |alpha>. Let's compute the coefficients. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, the coefficients are (1+i) for up, and (2-i) for down.

The normalization factor is the square root of the sum of the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients.

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So the sum is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7). Therefore, |alpha> is [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, I need to express this state in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+x> and |-x>.

What are |+x> and |-x> in terms of |up> and |down>?

The eigenstates of the Pauli X (σx) operator are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|up> − |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, alternatively, sometimes they are written with a phase factor. Let me confirm.

Yes, the standard eigenstates for σx are:

|+x> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down> )

|-x> = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> − |down> )

So, to express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |-x>, I can write:

|alpha> = a |+x> + b |-x>,

where a and b are the coefficients we need to find.

Alternatively, since |+x> and |-x> form an orthonormal basis, we can compute the inner products < +x | alpha > and < -x | alpha > to find a and b.

So, let's compute a = < +x | alpha >.

So,

a = < +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] * (1/sqrt(7)) ( <
