Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem states that we have a large ensemble of 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle undergoing the same conditions. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. The systems are such that when measuring the position of the particles, none were found where x is less than 1 or greater than 3. So, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a', and we have four options to choose from: A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density of finding a particle at a certain position. The probability of finding the particle between two points is the integral of the probability density between those points. Since the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, the total probability over this interval should equal 1. So, we can set up an integral of the wave function's modulus squared from x=1 to x=3 and set it equal to 1 to solve for 'a'.

Wait, but the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. That's a complex number. So the modulus squared would be the product of the wave function and its complex conjugate. The wave function is ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. The complex conjugate of ψ is (a / sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So when we multiply them, the imaginary parts will cancel out some terms.

Let me write that out: |ψ|^2 = [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i) ] * [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) + (0.5i) ].

Multiplying these terms, it should be (a/sqrt(1+x))^2 + (0.5)^2, because the cross terms (the ones with i) will be imaginary and when multiplied by each other, they'll give a real number. Wait, no, wait: actually, when you multiply (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (0.5i) and ( -0.5i ) * (a/sqrt(1+x)), those terms will add up. Let me see: the product is (a^2)/(1+x) + (a sqrt(1+x) * 0.5i * -0.5i) ) ? No, wait, perhaps I should compute it more carefully.

Let me compute (A - Bi)(A + Bi) where A is a/sqrt(1+x) and B is 0.5. So that's A² + B², right? Because (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + A*Bi - A*Bi - (Bi)^2. The middle terms cancel, and (Bi)^2 is (B^2)(i^2) which is -B^2. So overall, it's A^2 + B^2.

So |ψ|^2 = (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2. So, (a^2)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, that's interesting. So the probability density isn't just (a^2)/(1+x), but includes a constant term as well. But wait, that seems a bit odd. Because if the wavefunction is a sum of real and imaginary parts, the probability density is the sum of the squares of their magnitudes.

Wait, but wait a minute— the wave function must satisfy the normalization condition. So the integral of |ψ|^2 dx from x=1 to x=3 should be 1.

So the integral is ∫_{1}^{3} [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

Let me write that as the integral of (a²/(1+x)) dx plus the integral of 0.25 dx, both from 1 to 3.

So let's compute each part.

First, the integral of (a²)/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x| + C. So, the first integral becomes a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ) ].

Because when x=3, 1+x=4, and when x=1, 1+x=2. So ln(4) - ln(2) is ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So the first part is a² * ln(2).

Then the second integral is 0.25 * (3 -1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So adding these together, a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation becomes a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

Subtract 0.5 from both sides: a² ln(2) = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Wait, let me compute that. The natural logarithm of 2 is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 divided by 0.6931 is about 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

So a² ≈ 0.721, which means a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is close to that. So is that the correct answer?

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the wavefunction given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So when I compute |ψ|^2, it's (a²/(1+x)) + (0.5)^2, since the cross terms (from multiplying the real and imaginary parts) would be [ (a/sqrt(1+x)) * (-0.5i) ) + (similar terms) ] but when you multiply out, let me do it step by step.

Wait, ψ = A + Bi, where A = a/sqrt(1+x), B = -0.5. Then the complex conjugate is A - Bi, right? Because when you take the conjugate of a complex number A + Bi, it becomes A - Bi. So ψ* = A - Bi.

So |ψ|^2 = (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B².

Yes, that's correct. So the probability density is (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So when I integrate from x=1 to x=3, the integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5(3-1) = 1.

Wait, 0.5*(3-1) is 1, so a² ln(2) + 1 =1.

Wait, wait a minute—that can't be right because 0.5*(3-1) is 1, so the equation would become a² ln(2) + 1 =1 → a² ln(2) = 0 → a=0, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be right.

Oh no, I must have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, the integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.5, which I had earlier. But when adding that to the first integral:

The first integral was a² ln(2), and the second was 0.5. So the sum is a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a² ln(2) = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Yes, that's correct. So a squared is about 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721, so a is about 0.849. So the closest option is B) 0.85.

But wait, let me think again. Could the wave function be ψ = (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and perhaps the modulus squared is (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2?

Yes, that's correct. So the integral is indeed a² ln(2) + 0.5 =1.

So a squared is 0.5 / ln(2) ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721.

a is the square root of that, which is approximately 0.849, or 0.85 as in option B.

So the answer should be B) 0.85.


To solve the problem, we use the wave function provided, \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \), and the fact that the total probability of finding the particle between \( x=1 \) and \( x=3 \) must equal 1. The probability density is given by the modulus squared of the wave function, \( |\psi(x)|^2 \), which is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left( \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} \right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25
\]

The total probability is the integral of \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) over the interval \( x=1 \) to \( x=3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left( \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \right) dx = 1
\]

This integral splits into two parts:

1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \): The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \), so:

\[
\int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx = a^2 \left[ \ln(4) - \ln(2) \right] = a^2 \ln(2)
\]

2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \): The integral of the constant term is:

\[
\int_1^3 0.25 dx = 0.25 \cdot (3-1) = 0.5
\]

Adding these results, the equation becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.849
\]

The closest value to \( a \) among the options is \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.
