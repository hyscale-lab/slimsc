Okay, so I've got this question about a genetics experiment, and I'm trying to figure out what went wrong. Let me break it down.

The setup is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein. They're overexpressing it using an inducible system. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus, which is a common way to track proteins, maybe for affinity purification as the question states.

They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine, which is a common method for transfecting cells with plasmids. They selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and then tested the expression. But the overexpression didn't happen as expected. So, they must have done some tests and found that the problem lies in the sequence of the plus strand of their construct.

Looking at the options, the issue is probably something wrong with the sequence they introduced. Let's look at the given DNA sequence. The plus strand starts with 5' ATG... which is the start codon (methionine) in mRNA, but wait, DNA is double-stranded so the coding strand is the same as mRNA. So the plus strand here is the sense strand, which should be the same as the mRNA.

Hmm, let me look for stop codons. Stop codons in mRNA are UAA, UAG, UGA. So in the DNA, the complementary sequences would be ATT, CTG, TCA. Wait no, wait. Let me think: DNA is double-stranded, so the coding (sense) strand has the same sequence as mRNA except T for U.

Wait, the given sequence is the plus (sense) strand. So any stop codons in mRNA would be in the DNA as their complementary sequences.

Wait, let's scan the DNA sequence for possible stop codons. Let's look for the presence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA. Because in the mRNA, the stop codons would be UAA, UAG, UGA. So the plus strand's DNA would have the codons as TAA, TAG, TGA, but that's only if the DNA is in the coding (sense) orientation.

Wait, but wait: the DNA is double stranded. The coding strand is the same as mRNA (except Tâ†’U). The non-coding (template) strand is complementary.

So the given plus strand is the coding strand. So the mRNA is synthesized complementary to the template strand, which would be the same as the plus strand, except T becomes U.

So, in the plus strand, any TAA would become UAA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. Similarly, TAG becomes UAG, and TGA becomes UGA.
