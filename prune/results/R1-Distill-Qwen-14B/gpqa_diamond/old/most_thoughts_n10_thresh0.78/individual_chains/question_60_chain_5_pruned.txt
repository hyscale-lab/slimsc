Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So, there's a civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud sending a spacecraft to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. The options are various years or whether they die before getting there.

Wait, right, when you travel at such high speeds, time dilation comes into play. Time dilation is that effect where time moves slower for the moving observer (the astronaut) compared to a stationary one (like someone on Earth). So from Earth's perspective, the trip would take a really long time, but from the astronaut's point of view, it's shorter.

But wait, no, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, so that's the proper time. So we need to calculate the proper time for the journey.

I remember that the formula for time dilation is based on the Lorentz factor, gamma (γ). The formula is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is so close to c, gamma must be a large number. Wait no, wait: higher v means higher gamma, which means more time dilation. Oh wait, no, wait: actually, the moving clock runs slower. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock is ticking slower. But from the astronaut's frame, the time experienced is less.

Wait, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, so we have to calculate the proper time for the journey as per their frame.

Wait, but how do we calculate the proper time? The proper time τ (tau) is given by the spacetime interval divided by c squared, but
