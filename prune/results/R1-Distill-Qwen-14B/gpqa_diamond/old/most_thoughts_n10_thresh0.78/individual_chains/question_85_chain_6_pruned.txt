Okay, I have this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. So, two planets are orbiting a star. They used both transit and radial velocity methods to detect them. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff of 6300 K. 

Planet 1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet 2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits. 

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. 

Wait, but the problem gives some info about the Doppler shifts due to the planets. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. These shifts are due to the RV method, which measures the Doppler effect from the star's movement due to the planet's gravity. 

So, the RV shift relates to the mass of the planet and the distance between the planet and the star. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is something like K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ))^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(1/3) )) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so we can ignore that part. Also, since the planets are much less massive than the star, M_planet/M_star is negligible, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. 

But wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet * sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ). But since both planets are orbiting the same star, and the inclination i is the same (assuming it's the same system and i is the same for both, which is likely since both were detected via transit and RV), sin i is the same. So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (P^(1/3)). 

Wait, but the RV semi-amplitude K is given in terms of wavelength shift. Oh wait, no, K is a velocity. The shift in wavelength (Δλ) is related to velocity via the Doppler effect. The formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, where c is the speed of light. Wait, but when you have a small shift, you can approximate it as Δλ = λ * (v/c). 

The forbidden line is at 6300 Å, so λ = 6300 Å. Let's compute the velocities. 

For Planet1, Δλ = 0.03 Å. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2, Δλ=0.04, v2= (0.04/6300)*c. 

But the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's mass and orbital period. The formula for velocity semi-amplitude K is K = ( (G * P) / (2π) )^(-1/3) ) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ) * ( (1) / (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) 

Since e=0, and M_planet << M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ), maybe? Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of Kepler's third law. 

Kepler's third law says that P² = (4π²/G(M_star + M_planet)) ) * a³. Since M_planet << M_star, P² ≈ (4π²/(G M_star)) a³. So a³ = G M_star P²/(4π²). 

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) ), but again, M_planet is small, so K ≈ (v) ≈ ( (2π G)/(c P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )

Alternatively, another approach: the velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c) )^(-1/3) * (M_planet / M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 + M_planet/M_star )^(1/3) )) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express the ratio K1/K2.

Let me think: K is proportional to (M_planet) / (P^(1/3) M_star^(2/3) )

Since K1 is 0.03 Å shift, K2 is 0.04 Å shift. So
