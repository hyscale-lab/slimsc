Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I need to figure out what's going on. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of a crude peptidic compound shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals adding up to 1H. Hmm, so why would there be two peaks for the same proton? Spin-spin coupling was ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't fit that. So, what else could cause this?

Wait, another thing: the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass. So, same molecular weight, but two separate peaks. And the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule. So, same formula, but maybe different structures that have the same mass? Like isomerism.

Possible options are given. Let's look at them. 

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. The MS would show a different mass for a precursor. But both peaks have same mass, so probably not this.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so same molecular weight. But in NMR, enantiomers would show identical NMR spectra because they have the same environment. But here, the NMR shows two peaks. So maybe that's not the case.

Option C: Double coupling during amide formation. I'm not sure about this. Double coupling might cause splitting, but the question says it's ruled out as spin-spin coupling. So maybe this isn't the issue.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different peaks. For example, if the alpha-proton is in a different environment because of the stereochemistry, maybe each diastereomer has the same proton but in different environments, leading to two peaks. But wait, if there's a diastereomer, would that cause the same integral? Because each diastereomer would have the same number of protons, so the integrals would add up correctly.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two peaks integrate to 1H each, but together it's 1H? Or the total integral is 1H for both? The question says together they integrate to 1H, so each peak is about 0.5H. So, that suggests that each diastereomer has one proton split into two environments? Or maybe each diastereomer has a different number of protons? No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule exists in two diastereomeric forms, each with the same number of protons but in different environments. So, each diastereomer contributes a peak for the same alpha-proton but with slightly different shifts. That would cause two peaks with similar shifts because the environments are similar but not identical.

LC-MS shows two peaks of same massâ€”so same molecular weight. That makes sense with diastereomers because their molecular formulas are the same. So in the LC, if the diastereomers have different retention times, they'd show as separate peaks. Each has the same mass, same MS.

So putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton because it's a mixture of diastereomers, each with a slightly different environment. The LC-MS shows two peaks because they're two different diastereomers, same mass, so same m/z in MS.

Wait, but why would the NMR integrals add up to 1H? Because each diastereomer has one proton, but each contributes equally. So if you have equal amounts of both diastereomers, each would contribute 0.5H to the integral. So each peak is 0.5H, together 1H. That fits.

Another thought: what about epimers? Those are diastereomers, right? So if the synthesis led to a mixture of epimers at a particular stereocenter, the NMR would show different signals for the same proton in each epimer, but the integrals would add up. So yes, that fits.

So the options are B and D. B is enantiomers, which would have same NMR, so the NMR would show as one peak. So can't be B. So the answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

So the most likely explanation is D.


The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and the absence of spin-spin coupling as an explanation. Additionally, LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a distinct mass in the LC-MS. Since both peaks have the same mass, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: Mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are mirror images and have identical NMR spectra because they are superimposable. This would result in a single peak for the alpha-proton in the NMR, not two distinct peaks. Thus, this option is not consistent with the observations.

3. **Option C: Double coupling during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Therefore, this option is unlikely.

4. **Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties and can lead to distinct NMR signals for the same proton if their environments differ. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals, suggest that the alpha-proton exists in two different environments due to the presence of diastereoisomers. The LC-MS showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass spectrum further supports this explanation, as diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula but different structures.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, leading to the observed NMR and LC-MS data.
