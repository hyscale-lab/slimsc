Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a given Hamiltonian. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So n could be pointing in any direction, but it's a unit vector, which means its magnitude is 1. The ε is an energy constant.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are a set of three 2x2 matrices (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) which correspond to the spin in the x, y, and z directions. The dot product σ · n would then be a linear combination of these matrices weighted by the components of n. So σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

But for eigenvalues, maybe I don't need to get into the specifics of which components are present. Because when you take the dot product of σ with a unit vector, the resulting matrix is a spin operator in the direction of n. 

I also recall that the eigenvalues of a spin operator σ · n are ± ħ/2. Because for the Pauli matrices, each σ_i has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, wait, the Hamiltonian here has a coefficient ε. Oh, no, wait, no, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by ħ/2, right?

Wait, let me get this straight. The spin matrices σ_i (like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) each have eigenvalues ±1. So when you have a spin operator in the direction of n, the matrix σ · n is a combination of the Pauli matrices, each multiplied by n's components. The eigenvalues of this operator would be ±1 multiplied by the magnitude of the vector (but wait, n is a unit vector, so the magnitude is 1). So the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n. So the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by ±1. So H has eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, that would make the answer options B) +ε, -ε. But wait, wait, I thought the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but in the context of spin, the eigenvalues are ± (
