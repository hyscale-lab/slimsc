Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z for a given state. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

First, the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, but before anything else, I remember that the uncertainty principle tells us that the uncertainty in an observable is related to the expectation values of the operator and its square. So, ΔP_z would be the square root of (⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, to compute that, I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Since the state is given, I can compute these expectation values by using the matrix representation of P_z.

Looking at the matrix for P_z: it's a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [ħ, 0, 0], the second is [0, 0, 0], and the third is [0, 0, -ħ]. So, in matrix form, it's diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

The state vector is ψ = [-1/2; 1/√2; -1/2]. Let me denote this as a column vector. To find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ψ† P_z ψ. Let's compute that.

Wait, actually, ψ is given as a column vector. So ψ† would be the conjugate transpose. But looking at the components, there are no complex numbers here, so ψ† is just
