Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement is when a 1,5-diene rearranges, usually under heat or light, changing where the double bonds are. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out what the major products are.

Let's start with part A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Oh wait, let me draw that structure. So, benzene with a substituent: that substituent is a methylene group (CH2) attached to an oxygen, which is connected to a but-2-enyl group. The but-2-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No wait, but-2-enyl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? Wait no, but-2-enyl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, wait, but-2-enyl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no, but-2-enyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- something? No, wait, but-2-enyl is CH2CH2 but double bond is between C2 and C3, so it's more like 2-pentenyl maybe? Wait, maybe I should think of the substituent as (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl). So that would be:

The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, let's number it: 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-2-en-
