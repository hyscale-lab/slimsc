Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slowly.

So the problem starts with cyclohexanone. I remember cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first step is treating it with bromine, forming product 1. Hmm, bromine... in what conditions? For ketones, bromine usually adds in a nucleophilic addition or maybe some kind of substitution. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. When ketones react with bromine, I think it's an addition reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a diaddition, like adding across the carbonyl. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so adding bromine would probably give a dibromide. Oh right, the bromine adds to the carbonyl, making a bromohydrin? Or wait, no, in ketones, when you add bromine (like Br2 in a non-polar solvent?), maybe it's the same as the addition of HBr, but with double the bromine. Wait, no, I think when you add bromine to a ketone, you get a vicinal dihalide. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. When a carbonyl group reacts with bromine, maybe it's a dibromide. For example, cyclohexanone reacting with Br2 would form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Because the mechanism would be the bromine attacking the carbonyl carbon in a conjugate addition, but wait, no, wait, maybe it's an enol bromination? Or perhaps it's a bromohydrin formation? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone reacting with Br2 in a non-polar solvent like CCl4 would undergo a ring-opening. Oh wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder type reaction? No, no, that's for dienes. Hmm. Or maybe it's a bromonium ion formation. Wait, perhaps it's an epoxidation? No, that's with peracids. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up reactions. Let me think again. Adding Br2 to a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's an addition reaction where Br adds across the carbonyl
