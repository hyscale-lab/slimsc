Okay, so I need to figure out where the given density matrix lies in the qubit space. Hmm, the matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe quantum states, especially mixed states. Pure states are rank 1 matrices, but this one looks like a mixed state because it's a sum of two projectors multiplied by 1/2 each.

Wait, I think I remember that in the Bloch sphere representation, any single-qubit state can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in 3D space. Oh right, so the Bloch vector r determines the position on the Bloch sphere. But that's for pure states, right? Or does it apply to mixed states too?

Hmm, maybe the density matrix can be expressed in terms of the Bloch vector if it's a single qubit. Since this is a 2x2 density matrix, it's for a qubit. So let's try to write ρ in that form.

The general form is ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So I can expand this and compare it to the given ρ.

Wait, the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1|. |0><0| is a diagonal matrix with [1,0], and |1><1| is [0,1]. So adding them gives a diagonal matrix [1,1], and then multiplying by 1/2 gives [1/2, 0; 0, 1/2]. So ρ is the identity matrix scaled by 1/2. Because |0><0| + |1><1| is I, so ρ is I/2.

Wait, so ρ = (I)/2. Now, let's compare this to the Bloch form. The Bloch form is (I + r·σ)/2. So if I set these equal, I get:

(I)/2 = (I + r·σ)/2
