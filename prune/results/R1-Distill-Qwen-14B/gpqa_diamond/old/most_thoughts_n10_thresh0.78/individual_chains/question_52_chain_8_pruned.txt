Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that astronomers are studying a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So, the spots are making the star cooler on average.

The key part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…, which is in the near ultraviolet or maybe extreme ultraviolet? Hmm, not sure if that's relevant yet. Also, it's noted that the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which probably means I can use the Boltzmann equation.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp(- (E2 - E1)/(k*T)), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E is the energy difference, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when there are spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So when the star has spots, the temperature of the photosphere is lower (5500 K instead of 6000 K), which would affect the ratio.

Wait, but wait, the star's surface isn't uniformly at the same temperature when spots are present. Let me think. The spots are darker, meaning they're cooler. So the overall Teff is lower, but the unspotted parts are perhaps hotter than the average? Or maybe the spots are just cooler regions, and the rest of the surface is at 6000 K? Hmm, but the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall effective temperature drops. So I think the effective temperature is a sort of average, but how does that affect the photospheric temperature where the Ti atoms are?

Wait, but in the photosphere, the effective temperature is a measure of the total emitted flux. But when spots are present, the star emits less total flux because a part of its surface is cooler. But for the photosphere itself, which layer are we talking about? Maybe it's the average temperature of the photosphere that's decreasing, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots affects the observed flux but the actual photospheric temperature in the unspotted regions remains at 6000 K, while the spots are at a lower temperature.

Wait, but the problem says
