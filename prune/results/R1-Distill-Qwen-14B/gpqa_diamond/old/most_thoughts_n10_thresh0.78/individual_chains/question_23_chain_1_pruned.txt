Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, using TLC, they noticed that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which of the given options are the products.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to get a clear picture. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Breaking it down: the benzene ring has an ether group (O-). The other part is the butenyl group attached to the oxygen. Let me visualize that. So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let's think about the but-3-en-1-yl part. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 if it's 3-en-1-yl, but wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2O- attached to the benzene? Wait, but the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl. So the structure would be:

The butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond at position 3. Wait, wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH=CH2? No, but wait, butenyl is four carbons. But-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that would make the double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the butenyl group is as follows: the first carbon (attached to the oxygen) is C1. So the structure is C1 (with substituents), then C2, C3, C4. The double bond is between C3 and C4. And on C2, there are two methyl groups. So the structure would be:

O

O-benzene connected to O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no. Wait, butenyl is four carbons. So, for but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that can't be right because that would imply the double bond between C3 and C4. Oh wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But wait, but if it's but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2CH2-CH=CH2, but that's
