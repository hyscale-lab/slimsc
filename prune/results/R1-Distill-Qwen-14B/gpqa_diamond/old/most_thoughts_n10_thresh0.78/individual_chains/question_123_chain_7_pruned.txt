Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to wrap my head around it.

Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames, which I think means there's no acceleration involved, just constant velocity. So, that probably means I can use the basic kinematics equations without worrying about acceleration terms.

The key point here is that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but in reality, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, right? So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is coming towards it at 60,000 km/s. Conversely, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at that speed.

But wait, the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, I see. So the time elapsed is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, but we need to find how much the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Wait, is there a time dilation effect here because of the relative velocity between the frames? Because if the frames are moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, special relativity might come into play. Oh, but wait, the problem statement says to ignore gravity and
