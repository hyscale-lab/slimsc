Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about reacting (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, the researcher checked using TLC and found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots were formed. I need to determine which of the options A to D are the possible products.

Hmm, first, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let's break that down. The 'but-3-en-1-yl' part means a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 3. So numbering from 1, the structure would be CH2-CH(C)(C)-CH2, but wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: so the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has four carbons, so the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

But-3-en-1-yl: the substituents are at position 1 as the leaving group. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Hmm, but but only has four carbons. So the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, that can't be. Oh wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, that's but-1-en-4-yl. Wait, maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-O-Ph? No, wait, perhaps the substituents are on the double bond. Let me write it properly.

The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the but-3-en-1-yl group: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but but has four carbons, so the positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4. But that would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, which is impossible because that's a single bond. Wait, no, perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2, but that's but-1-en-4-yl. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a different arrangement. Wait, another approach: the substituents are on carbon 2 and 2. So the structure is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-O-Ph? No, wait, that's not right because the double bond is in position 3.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH-O-Ph, but that doesn't fit the substituents. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the structure of the starting compound.

The starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the but-3-en-1-yl group is attached to the oxygen. So the structure is:

O
||
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 ?

Wait, no, because the but-3-en-1-yl has four carbons, with a double bond starting at 3. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-CH=CH-O-Ph?

Wait, but with substituents at position 2. So if it's 2,2-dimethyl, then the methyl groups are on the second carbon of the butenyl group.

So, the structure is:

O
|
Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with substituents on the second carbon.

Wait, maybe it's better to write it as:

(2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene → the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

No, that's a five-carbon chain, but but is four. So the butenyl group is four carbons, with double bond between C3 and C4.

So, the substituent is on C2 (2,2-dimethyl), meaning the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH2-CH2-O-Ph?

Wait, no, but the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the structure should be CH2-CH(CH3)2-CH₂-CH₂? No, perhaps I'm getting it wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

No, but that ignores the double bond. Oh wait, the but-3-enyl group would be:

CH2-CH2-CH=CH-O-Ph, but with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure is:

CH₂–C(CH₃)₂–CH–CH₂–O–Ph, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons.

Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl would be:

CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. That would make the structure CH₂=CH–CH₂–O–Ph? No, wait, because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that can't be because but has only four carbons. So the structure should be:

CH₂–CH₂–CH=CH–O–Ph, but with substituents on C2. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂, but that's without the double bond. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: the butenyl group is four carbons long, with a double bond. The substituents (two methyl groups) are on C2. So the structure is:

CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂–O–Ph, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, which would mean the structure is CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons? Or perhaps CH₂–CH2–CH=CH-O-Ph with substituents on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure as:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the reaction.

The reaction is with HBr. So this is probably an addition reaction. Since the starting material is an allyl ether, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of acid-catalyzed addition. Wait, allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but in this case, the structure is Ph-O-CH₂–CH(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂? Wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me try again.

Wait, the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–CH(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂, but wait, but that's five carbons. No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl is four carbons with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–CH(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂?

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

The butenyl group is CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂, but with a double bond between C3 and C4, so CH₂–CH₂–CH=CH–O–Ph. And the two methyl groups are on the second carbon, so the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that would make the structure:

Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH2 with a double bond between the third and fourth? So it's:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ → but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the correct structure is Ph-O-CH₂–CH(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2–CH(CH2CH3)–CH2–CH2? No, maybe I'm mixing up the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as (but-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with two methyl groups on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ → but wait, that's five carbons. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reaction instead.

The reaction is with HBr. HBr is a strong acid and can act as an electrophilic reagent. In allyl systems, HBr can add via an acid-catalyzed mechanism, leading to either ring-opening or addition products.

Wait, the starting material is an allyl ether. Allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening, especially in cyclic ethers. But wait, in this case, the ether isn't cyclic; it's an allyl group attached to an oxygen connected to a benzene ring.

Hmm. So, maybe the reaction is allylic bromination. Alternatively, it could be an addition across the double bond.

Wait, when an allyl ether reacts with HBr, what typically happens? I remember that in some cases, allyl ethers can undergo acid-catalyzed ring opening, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, HBr can add to the double bond, leading to possible bromoalkyl products.

Wait, but the starting compound has a double bond in the butenyl group. So the reaction with HBr could be an acid-catalyzed addition of HBr to the double bond.

So, in such a case, the HBr would add across the double bond, leading to a bromide. But since it's an allyl group, maybe there's some possibility of rearrangement, like a carbocation rearrangement.

Wait, the addition of HBr to an allyl system can lead to the formation of the more stable carbocation. For example, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, adding HBr could form a carbocation at C3 or C4. But the substituents (methyl groups) would influence the stability.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are on C2. So the structure is Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So when HBr adds to the double bond, it would form a carbocation at C3 or C4.

Wait, but let me think about the addition. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So adding HBr would have H attaching to one end and Br to the other. The possible positions for carbocation formation would be at C3 or C4.

Alternatively, the addition could be in a way that the more substituted carbocation is formed, leading to more stable intermediates.

Wait, the starting structure is Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ → but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–CH(CH(CH3)₂)–CH₂?

No, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me try drawing it properly.

The group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, carbon 1 is attached to the oxygen. The structure would be:

1   2   3   4
O-CH2–C(CH3)2–CH2–CH2

Wait, but with a double bond between 3 and 4. So structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH2–CH₂ → but with double bond between 3 and 4, making it:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ → but double bond between C3 and C4, so:

Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ → but double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CH₂–CH(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂, but that doesn't include the double bond. Oh, wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the reaction.

When HBr adds to a double bond, it can do so in a way that follows Markovnikov's rule. So the H adds to the less substituted carbon, and Br to the more substituted.

Wait, but in an allyl system, the addition of HBr can lead to different products depending on where the addition occurs and whether there's any carbocation rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a bromination at the allylic position. But HBr is more likely to add than to cause allylic substitution, unless under specific conditions.

Wait, but the presence of HBr and an allyl ether might lead to ring-opening. For example, in epoxides, HBr can cause ring-opening. But in this case, it's a simple allyl ether, not an epoxide.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. But the oxygen is attached to the benzene ring, so it's an aryl ether, which is not typically a good leaving group. Unless there's some activation.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction is a cleavage of the ether. But I'm not sure how HBr would do that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is acid-catalyzed addition to the double bond. So the HBr adds across the double bond, leading to a bromoalkane. But since the starting material has a long chain, the addition would create two possible products based on where the H and Br add.

Wait, in an acid-catalyzed addition, the H adds to the less substituted carbon, and Br to the more substituted (Markovnikov). So, for the double bond between C3 and C4, adding H to C3 and Br to C4, or H to C4 and Br to C3.

But wait, in the case where the double bond is CH2–CH2–CH=CH–O–Ph, adding HBr would lead to two possible products, depending on the position of addition.

Wait, but the structure I'm visualizing is Ph-O-CH2–CH(CH3)₂–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So, when HBr adds, H adds to C3 and Br to C4, or H adds to C4 and Br to C3.

But wait, the substituent on C2 is a C(CH3)2 group, which is a bulky group. So, the carbocation formed would be on C3 or C4. The more substituted carbocation is more stable, so maybe the Br adds to the more substituted carbon.

Wait, let me think: adding HBr to CH2–CH(CH3)₂–CH2–CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the structure is Ph-O-CH2–CH(CH(CH2CH3))–CH2–CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Ph-O-CH2–CH(CH2CH(CH3))–CH2, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

But let's proceed. Suppose the double bond is between C3 and C4. Adding HBr would lead to a bromide at either C3 or C4.

But wait, after addition, the product would have Br at C3 or C4.

Wait, but perhaps there's also a possibility of carbocation rearrangement. For example, if the initial carbocation is formed at C3, perhaps it can shift to a more stable position, like C2, which already has a bulky substituent.

Wait, because C2 has two methyl groups, a carbocation at C2 would be tertiary, which is more stable than secondary at C3.

So when HBr adds to the double bond, the initial carbocation forms at C3 (since the double bond is between C3 and C4), but then it might shift to C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups.

Wait, but wait, the structure might be Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. So when H adds to C3, Br would be on C4, but that would form a secondary carbocation at C3. But since C2 has two methyl groups, maybe the carbocation could shift from C3 to C2 via hydride shift or alkyl shift, forming a more stable tertiary carbocation at C2.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the initial addition would place Br on C4 (if H adds to C3), but the carbocation would rearrange to C2, which is more stable.

Wait, but if the carbocation is at C3, adjacent to the C(CH3)₂ group on C2, perhaps it can shift.

So, the formation would be:

Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CH2–CH2Br (if Br is on C4) but with a carbocation at C3. Then, the carbocation might shift from C3 to C2, resulting in Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CHBr–CH3 (or something similar), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the initial structure after addition would be Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂Br. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the addition is such that the Br adds to the more substituted end, leading to a more stable carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to add H to C4 and Br to C3, making a carbocation at C3, which is secondary. But then, since C2 has two methyl groups, a carbocation at C2 would be more stable, so perhaps the carbocation would shift from C3 to C2, leading to a tertiary carbocation at C2.

So the product would have Br at C3, but then the carbocation rearranges to C2, leading to a structure where the Br is attached to C2.

Wait, but how would that work? Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The starting material is Ph-O-CH₂–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4.

2. HBr adds across the double bond. H adds to C3, Br adds to C4, forming a secondary carbocation at C3.

3. The carbocation at C3 can rearrange by a hydride shift to form a carbocation at C2, which is tertiary and more stable.

4. So the Br would end up at C2, but wait, that's not possible because the Br was added to C4.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the addition leads to Br at C2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the addition occurs in such a way that the Br ends up at a different position. Alternatively, perhaps the initial addition is not the main pathway.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could lead to two different products based on where the addition occurs. So, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, adding HBr could lead to Br at C3 or C4, but with rearrangements, perhaps leading to different structures.

Hmm, but the question states that two new spots appeared on TLC. So, the reaction must be forming two different products.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol and 4-(2,2-dimethylbutyl)phenol.

So, these are two phenol derivatives with substituents at positions 2 and 4.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So, one product is a brominated ether, and the other has a different double bond position.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.

These structures seem more complex, involving ring formations.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So, two brominated ethers, with Br at position 3 and 4 respectively.

Hmm. Let's think about possible products.

If the reaction is addition of HBr across the double bond, leading to two different products based on where the Br adds, perhaps the two products are bromides at different positions.

But wait, the starting material is an allyl ether. Another possibility is that the reaction is an acid-catalyzed cleavage of the ether, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the ether oxygen leaves, but that's unlikely unless the leaving group is activated, which it isn't in this case.

Wait, another possibility is that the reaction leads to a ring-opening of the ether. In allyl ethers, under acidic conditions, the ring can open. So the structure would break, and HBr would add, leading to a di-bromide or similar.

Wait, but that might not fit the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed bromination at the allylic position, leading to two possible products based on where the Br adds.

Wait, allylic bromination typically occurs via a radical mechanism, but HBr is more likely to add rather than undergo radical bromination. So maybe that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the butenyl group undergoing a bromohydrin formation, but that's more with H2O and HBr.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition to the double bond, leading to a diastereomeric products, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Wait, but the question is about an experiment where the reactant's spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, the reaction must have gone to two products.

Looking at the options, option B has two products: one is a brominated ether, and the other has a different double bond position. So perhaps the reaction led to different addition products.

Wait, but the starting material is Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4. Adding HBr could lead to Br at C3 or C4, but rearrangement could move the Br to a more stable position.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to two different positions of addition, but without rearrangement. So, perhaps the two products are where Br is added to either end of the double bond.

Wait, but if the double bond is between C3 and C4, adding HBr would have two possibilities: H to C3 and Br to C4, or H to C4 and Br to C3. But I'm not sure if those would be two different products or the same.

Wait, maybe not, because the structure is symmetric in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a certain symmetry leading to two different products upon addition.

Another possibility is that the reaction leads to the formation of a bromide and the corresponding phenol via some elimination, but that seems less likely.

Wait, but looking at option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.

These structures suggest some kind of ring formation, perhaps through an acid-catalyzed cyclization. So, maybe the butenyl group cyclizes to form a ring, incorporating the benzene ring and the butenyl group.

Alternatively, in an acid-catalyzed condition, the butenyl ether could undergo a ring-opening to form a different structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be a 1,2-addition and 1,4-addition. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the butenyl group is undergoing some kind of pinacol rearrangement, but that typically involves vicinal diols.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a diastereomer, but that usually doesn't produce two spots on TLC unless the diastereomers have different Rf values.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not an addition but a substitution, but I don't see how HBr would substitute the ether oxygen.

Wait, let's go back to the options.

Option C: 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.

Chromane is a bicyclic structure, and dihydrobenzofuran suggests a furan ring attached to a benzene. So perhaps the reaction is a cyclization where the butenyl group forms a ring with the benzene, leading to a chromane or dihydrofuran derivative.

But how would that happen? Maybe the acid (HBr) is causing the formation of a new ring via an intramolecular attack.

Wait, but the starting material is an allyl ether. In acidic conditions, perhaps the oxygen becomes protonated, making it a better leaving group. Then, the adjacent carbons could form a new bond, leading to ring formation.

If that's the case, the butenyl group could form a ring with the benzene, leading to a chromane or a dihydrofuran structure.

So, for example, the butenyl group could form a five-membered ring with the benzene, creating a structure like chromane or dihydrobenzofuran.

So, perhaps the reaction leads to two different ring products, each with different substituents.

Looking at option C, the two products are 3,3,4-trimethylchromane and 3-isopropyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran.

How would that happen? Maybe the butenyl group cyclizes in two different ways, leading to different ring structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a bromide and a phenol, but I don't see how that would fit with the options.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So, one product is a brominated ether, and the other is an ether with a different double bond position.

Wait, perhaps the addition of HBr to the double bond in the starting material leads to a bromide, but then the double bond could shift, leading to a different position of the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial addition of HBr leads to a bromide, and then an elimination occurs, leading to a different double bond position. So, for example, if HBr adds in one position, and then there's an E2 elimination, the double bond could move, leading to a different structure.

So, for instance, adding HBr to the starting material forms a bromide, and then elimination of HBr could form a new double bond elsewhere.

If that's the case, two products could form: the bromide and the new alkene.

Which matches option B: one brominated ether and a different alkene.

So the reaction would first add HBr, then eliminate to form a new double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromide is formed without elimination, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Markovnikov addition of HBr, leading to a bromide at the more substituted position, but that could then lead to a different structure upon rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction leads to a di-substituted product, but I think that's unlikely.

Wait, but the starting material is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. So, the butenyl group is Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4.

When HBr adds across the double bond, the Br can add to either end. Let's say it adds to C3, making Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)2–CHBr–CH3. But the carbocation formed at C3 could rearrange to C2, which is already substituted with two methyl groups, leading to a more stable carbocation.

So, after rearrangement, the Br would be at C2, leading to Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)2Br–CH₂, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps the Br adds to C4, leading to Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)2–CH2–CH2Br, but then the carbocation is at C4, which is primary, so it's less stable. So, perhaps the initial addition is more favorable to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, perhaps the initial addition of H+ to C3 and Br– to C4 forms a secondary carbocation at C3, which can rearrange to C2, making a tertiary carbocation there. So, the Br would end up at C2.

So, the product would be Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)2Br–CH2. Wait, but the structure would have Br on C2.

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the addition doesn't proceed via carbocation rearrangement, and the Br adds without it.

So, adding HBr could lead to two products based on where the Br adds: either at C3 or C4.

But in the starting structure, the double bond is between C3 and C4, and adding HBr could lead to either Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)2–CHBr–CH3 or Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)2–CH2–CH2Br. But then, the positions would be different, leading to two products.

Looking at the options, option D has (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So, the bromide is at position 3 and 4 in the butoxy group.

So, if the starting material is Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CH₂–CH₂ (with double bond between C3 and C4), then adding Br to C3 would result in (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, and adding Br to C4 would give (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So, that's two products, which matches option D.

But wait, the question mentions that the reactant spot diminished, and two new spots appeared. So, the reaction is likely forming two products from the starting material.

So, if the reaction adds HBr across the double bond, leading to bromides at either C3 or C4, then option D would be the correct answer.

Wait, but option D's structures are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So, the butoxy group would have the Br at position 3 or 4.

But in the starting material, the butenyl group is Ph-O-CH2–C(CH3)₂–CH2–CH₂ with a double bond between C3 and C4.

Adding HBr to this would result in two possible bromides, one at C3 and one at C4, leading to the products in option D.

So, the correct answer would be option D.

Wait, but I thought the initial addition would form a carbocation that could rearrange. But if the reaction doesn't involve rearrangement, then the Br would add directly without shifting, leading to option D.

Alternatively, if the reaction doesn't proceed via carbocation, but instead via a concerted mechanism without rearrangement, then option D is correct.

So, considering all this, I think option D is the correct answer.


The reaction involves reacting (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The starting material is an allyl ether with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 of the butenyl group, and two methyl groups attached to carbon 2. The reaction proceeds via acid-catalyzed addition of HBr across the double bond, following Markovnikov's rule, where the hydrogen adds to the less substituted carbon (C3), and bromine adds to the more substituted carbon (C4). This results in two possible products depending on the position of addition:

1. **Bromine adds to C4**: This forms (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.
2. **Bromine adds to C3**: This forms (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

The two new products correspond to the structures in **Option D**, which includes both (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. The TLC results showing the disappearance of the reactant spot and the appearance of two new spots are consistent with the formation of these two products.

Critical analysis of the other options:
- **Option A**: These are phenol derivatives, which are not consistent with the reaction mechanism involving HBr addition to the double bond.
- **Option B**: This includes a brominated ether and an ether with a different double bond position. However, the reaction does not involve a shift in the double bond position but rather direct addition of HBr.
- **Option C**: These structures suggest cyclization or ring formation, which is not supported by the reaction conditions or the starting material.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option D**, as it aligns with the expected products of HBr addition to the double bond in the allyl ether.

Answer: D
