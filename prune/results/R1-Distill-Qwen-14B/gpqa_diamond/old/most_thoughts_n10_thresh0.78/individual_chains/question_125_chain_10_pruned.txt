Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, right, I remember that in three dimensions, the potential is V(r) = ½ m ω² r², which is like a harmonic oscillator in each direction.

The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that same energy eigenvalue. Oh wait, I need to remember how the energy levels work in a 3D harmonic oscillator.

I think in three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, I've heard it expressed in terms of a quantum number n that's the sum of those, but maybe it's better to think in terms of each direction.

Wait, another approach: the energy levels can also be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the total number of quanta in all three directions, right? So n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each of n_x, n_y, n_z is a non-negative integer. So the energy depends on n, and for each n, the states are degenerate. 

But wait, the problem is about the third excited state. Oh, wait, the ground state is the lowest energy. So the ground state would be n=0, then first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. So the third excited state is n=3.

Wait no, wait: no, wait. In terms of the oscillator, the ground state is the lowest, which is n=0. First excited state is the next, which is n=1. Then second excited is n=2, third is n=3. So yes, the third excited state has n=3.

So the energy would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Oh, wait, no: wait, E = (n + 3/2) ħ ω. Because when n=0, E is (3/2) ħ ω, which is the ground state. So for n=3,
