Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond with the movement of pi bonds. The question gives three reactions and asks which products are formed. The options are A, B, C, D, each providing possible products for A, B, and C.

Let me take it step by step.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol, with H+ and heat. So, the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2CH2CHOH). Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2. Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is actually CH2CH2CH2OH but with a double bond. Wait, let me draw it correctly. But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, butenes are four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait, buten-3-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Wait, I might be getting this wrong. But but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH2OH with the double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2OH, but wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the structure CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-OH, but that's but-2-en-1-ol, right? Wait, but the
