Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the angular distance between the first two minima when light passes through an infinitely large N-sided polygon aperture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think this through.

Alright, so the setup is that the aperture is a regular N-sided polygon, and all the apothems (those are the distances from the center to the midpoint of a side, right?) are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field intensity pattern. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles involved are small.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, a polygon becomes a circle. So this is essentially a circular aperture problem. Oh right, in that case, the diffraction pattern is the familiar Airy disk. The minima in the diffraction pattern occur at specific angles.

In the case of a circular aperture, the first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at θ = 1.22λ/(diameter), I think. Oh wait, the formula is θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter of the aperture. But wait, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a polygon with N sides, when N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' would relate to the radius of the circle. Let me think: for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R. For a regular polygon, R is the distance from the center to a vertex. The apothem a is R multiplied by cos(π/N), right? But when N is very large, π/N is very small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), but since N is approaching infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1. So the apothem a is approximately R, the radius. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For a regular polygon, the apothem is a = R * cos(π/N). So for N approaching infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So the radius R is approximately equal to a when N is very large.

Wait, but the diameter D would be
