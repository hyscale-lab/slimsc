Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the setup is an atomic nucleus of mass M at rest, with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments, and nothing else. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of the rest masses of the two fragments is 99% of the initial mass M. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

The options are A to D in MeV. Let's break this down.

First, I need to model the situation. The nucleus is initially at rest, so total momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. So they'll have equal and opposite momenta. Let me denote the masses and velocities.

Let me denote the two fragments as m1 and m2. Since one is twice as massive as the other, let's say m1 = 2 m2. Wait, wait, the problem says the more massive is one fragment. So m1 is the more massive, m2 is the less. So m1 = 2 m2. But wait, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Substituting m1 = 2 m2 into that: 2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.99 M / 3 = 0.33 M. So m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. Wait, but 0.66 + 0.33 is 0.99, which matches. Okay, so that part makes sense.

But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the rest mass of the nucleus is M cÂ² = 300 GeV. But after fission, the rest masses are
