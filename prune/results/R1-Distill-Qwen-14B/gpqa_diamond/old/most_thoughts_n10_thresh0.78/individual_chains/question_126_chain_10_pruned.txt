Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The problem says an organic chemist does two reactions, Reaction I and II. Each reaction is treated with different reagents and then an acidic workup. After that, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each chromatogram will show.

First, I need to break down each reaction and see what products they form. Then, I'll consider how these products behave in the different HPLC setups.

Let's start with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3, so when reduced, it becomes a secondary alcohol at position 3. The molecule is (S) configuration, so the product's configuration will depend on the reduction. But wait, LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols without changing the configuration because it's a two-step process (addition, then workup). So the configuration at C3 would remain S. So the product would be (S)-3-hydroxy-5-methoxyhexan-1-one? Wait no, wait. Wait, wait: the starting molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO in the middle. So 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon. Oh wait, wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3? Wait no, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Hexan means six carbons. So 3-one is the ketone group at position 3. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon
