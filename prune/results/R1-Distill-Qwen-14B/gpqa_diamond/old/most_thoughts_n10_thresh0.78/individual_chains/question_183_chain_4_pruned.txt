Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also called the degree of unsaturation, tells us about the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes 1 to the index, and each triple bond counts as 2, I think. So I'll need to figure out the structure of the product first, then determine its degree of unsaturation.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main ring is a cyclohexene, so that's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering is such that the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, perhaps? Wait, cyclohex-3-ene would mean the double bond starts at carbon 3. So positions 3 and 4 are double bonded.

Then, substituents on the ring: at position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is a CHO group attached. And at position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CH₂=CH-, right? So that's another double bond. So, the starting molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and another in the vinyl group.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is usually involved in the hydrolysis of certain groups, but wait, I think it's more about the removal of certain functional groups. Oh wait, when you have a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and red phosphorus with HI, it's a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes. So the formyl group (CHO) would be reduced to CH₂OH? Wait, no, wait. Another thought: Clemmensen uses H2O and red phosphorus, but wait, no, Clemmensen is done with HCl and red phosphorus, and it reduces carbonyls to CH₂ groups. So the formyl would become CH₂.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material has a formyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring. So when we use red phosphorus and excess HI, which is the reaction condition for Clemmensen, the formyl group would be reduced to a methylene group (-CH₂-). So the CHO becomes CH₂.

So the starting molecule: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid group is at position 1, perhaps, since the numbering would be around the ring. After reduction of the formyl group, that becomes a CH₂ group at position 2. So the product would be 2-(methylene)-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Wait, but wait a second. The other substituent is the vinyl group at position 5, which is a CH₂CH₂ group with a double bond. Oh, wait, vinyl is CH
