Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? And when they decay, they don't travel very far because they're unstable. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson called X. 

The given data includes production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. I think the width is related to the particle's lifetime through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh right, the uncertainty principle says that the product of the energy uncertainty (which is the width Γ) and the time uncertainty (which is the lifetime τ) is on the order of ħ. So, Γ * τ ≈ ħ. Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. 

So the mean lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the lifetime by the velocity of the particle. But wait, what's the velocity? Since the meson is produced with energy E_X, I can find its velocity from that.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Calculate the mean lifetime τ using Γ.
2. Find the velocity v of the meson using its energy and mass.
3. Calculate the mean decay distance using τ * v.

Wait, but first I should get all the units right. The production energy is 8 GeV, mass is 1.2 GeV, and width is 320 MeV. Oh, I should convert everything into consistent units. Probably, I'll use GeV and seconds for time, meters for distance, etc.

Starting with the width Γ. Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. 

The Planck constant ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So using Γ * τ ≈ ħ, rearranged τ = ħ / Γ.

So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me calculate that. 6.582 divided by 0.32 is approximately 20.56875. So τ ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, that seems really short. But particles with short lifetimes don't travel far, which makes sense.

Next, find the velocity v. The meson's energy E is 8 GeV, mass m is 1.2 GeV. So I can use the relativistic energy formula: E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since we're working in units where c=1 (GeV and GeV/c²), the equation simplifies.

So E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Since E = 8 GeV and m = 1.2 GeV/c², γ = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I can solve for v. Alternatively, I can find β = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/γ^2)).

Wait, beta is v/c. Let's compute gamma squared: (8/1.2)^2 is (20/3)^2 ≈ 400/9 ≈ 44.444. So 1/gamma^2 is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 is 0.9775. The square root of that is sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So beta ≈ 0.9887, which means v ≈ 0.9887c. Close to the speed of light, which makes sense for high energy particles.

So v ≈ 0.9887 * c. The speed of light c is about 3e8 meters per second.

Now, the mean decay distance is L = v * τ. So let's compute that.

v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 seconds.

So L = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Multiplying 2.966e8 by 2.056875e-24: 2.966 * 2.056875 ≈ let's see, 3 * 2 is 6, but more accurately, 2.966*2.056875 ≈ 6.1106 (since 2.966 * 2 is 5.932; 2.966 * 0.056875 is about 0.168, so total around 6.10). So 6.10e8 * 1e-24 = 6.10e-16 meters.

Wait, that's 6.1e-16 meters. But none of the options are around 6e-16. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check each step.

First, calculating τ: 

Γ = 0.32 GeV.

ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-25 seconds? Wait, no, 6.582 divided by 0.32 is 20.56875, so 20.56875e-25 s is 2.056875e-24 s. Oh, correct. So that was right.

Next, the velocity v.

E = 8 GeV, m = 1.2 GeV.

E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 → so in units where c=1, E^2 = p^2 + m^2.

So p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

Then, momentum p is gamma m v, but maybe a better approach is to compute beta.

Alternatively, beta = v/c = (pc)/(E) → pc = sqrt(E^2 - m^2) = 7.91 GeV.

So beta = (7.91 GeV/c) / 8 GeV = 7.91 /8 = approx 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c.

So v ≈ 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Then, decay length L = v * τ = 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Multiply the numbers: 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) * 1e-16.

Calculate 2.966 * 2.056875:

Let me compute that:

2 * 2.056875 = 4.11375
0.966 * 2.056875 ≈ 0.966 * 2 = 1.932, 0.966 * 0.056875 ≈ ~0.055. So total around 1.987. So sum 4.11375 + 1.987 ≈ 6.10075.

So approximately 6.10075e-16 m.

But looking at the options, the closest is option A) 5.0223e-16 m, and C) 5.0223e-15 m. Hmm, wait, my calculation gives around 6e-16, but the options are lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating gamma or beta. Let me recheck.

Wait, E = gamma m c^2. So gamma = E/(m c^2). Since we're using units where c=1, then gamma = E/m = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666666... So gamma is 6.6667.

Then, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma squared is (6.6667)^2 = 44.444.

1/gamma squared is 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225.

1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775.

sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is correct.

So v is correct. Hmm. Maybe I messed up the calculation of L. Let's compute 2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Wait, 2.966e8 is 2.966 x 1e8.

2.056875e-24 is 2.056875 x 1e-24.

Multiplying 2.966 x 2.056875:

Let me compute 2.966 * 2 = 5.932.

2.966 * 0.056875 = let's see, 2.966 * 0.05 is 0.1483, 2.966 * 0.006875 = about 0.0204. So total around 0.1687.

So sum is 5.932 + 0.1687 = 6.1007.

So 6.1007e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1007e-16 m.

Hmm. So 6.1e-16 m. But the options are all lower than that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mean lifetime?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mean decay length is given by L = c * tau * beta. Since v = beta c, so L = beta c tau.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as L = (c * tau) * beta.

Wait, c is 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

c * tau = 3e8 * 2.056875e-24 = (3 * 2.056875) * 1e-16 = 6.170625e-16 m.

Then multiply by beta, which is 0.98875.

So L = 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.170625e-16 * 0.98875.

Let me compute 6.170625 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.170625 * (0.98 + 0.00875) = 6.170625 * 0.98 = approx 6.047, plus 6.170625 * 0.00875 ≈ 0.054. So total ≈6.047 + 0.054 =6.101.

So 6.101e-16 m, same as before. So same result. So why are the options not matching? Maybe the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the mean proper lifetime. Or perhaps the width is given as the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime. Wait, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime τ by τ = ħ / Γ. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is not the same as the energy of the meson. Hmm, wait, the meson is produced with energy E_X. So I think I used that correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the relativistic mean lifetime. Oh wait, the lifetime I calculated is the proper lifetime (tau_0). But when the particle is moving at high speed, the lifetime observed (from lab frame) is longer by gamma. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau_0.

Wait, that's a crucial point! I think I made a mistake here. Because the mean lifetime τ as calculated from Γ is the proper lifetime (tau_0), which is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. But in the lab frame, where the particle is moving, the lifetime is longer by gamma. So the observed lifetime τ_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So I should have multiplied tau by gamma. Oh, so I missed that factor earlier.

So let's correct that. tau_lab = gamma * tau_0.

So earlier calculation of tau_0 was 2.056875e-24 s. Then, gamma is 6.6667.

So tau_lab = 6.6667 * 2.056875e-24 s = 

6 * 2.056875e-24 = 12.34125e-24.

0.6667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ ~1.37125e-24.

So total tau_lab ≈ 13.7125e-24 s = 1.37125e-23 s.

Then, the velocity v is beta * c = 0.98875 c.

So L = v * tau_lab = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

Compute that:

0.98875 * 3e8 = 2.966e8 m/s.

Multiply by 1.37125e-23 s:

2.966e8 * 1.37125e-23 = (2.966 * 1.37125) * 1e-15.

2.966 * 1.37125 ≈ let's compute:

2 * 1.37125 = 2.7425.

0.966 * 1.37125 ≈ approximately 0.966 * 1.37 = about 1.318.

So total around 2.7425 +1.318 ≈4.0605.

So L ≈4.0605e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15 and option B is 4.0655e-15.

Wait, 4.06e-15 is very close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Compute 2.966e8 m/s * 1.37125e-23 s.

2.966e8 is 2.966 x 1e8.

1.37125e-23 is 1.37125 x 1e-23.

Multiply them: 2.966 * 1.37125 = ?

Let me compute 2.966 * 1.37125.

Break it down:

1.37125 = 1 + 0.3 + 0.07 + 0.00125.

2.966 * 1 = 2.966.

2.966 * 0.3 = 0.8898.

2.966 * 0.07 = 0.20762.

2.966 * 0.00125 =0.0037075.

Adding all together:

2.966 + 0.8898 = 3.8558.

3.8558 + 0.20762 = 4.06342.

4.06342 + 0.0037075 =4.0671275.

So 2.966 *1.37125 ≈4.0671275.

So L =4.0671275e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the given parameters: production energy \( E_X = 8 \, \text{GeV} \), mass \( m_X = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), and width \( \Gamma_X = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \). The decay distance is calculated using the relation \( L = v \cdot \tau \), where \( \tau \) is the lifetime and \( v \) is the velocity of the meson.

### Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The width \( \Gamma \) is related to the proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) by the uncertainty principle:
\[
\tau_0 = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}.
\]
Using \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\tau_0 = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Relate the proper lifetime to the lab frame lifetime
The proper lifetime \( \tau_0 \) is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. In the lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot \tau_0,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \). Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]
Thus:
\[
\tau_{\text{lab}} = 6.6667 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) is determined using the relativistic relation:
\[
\beta = \frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}.
\]
With \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):
\[
\gamma^2 = \left( \frac{8}{1.2} \right)^2 \approx 44.444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.0225, \quad 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx 0.9775.
\]
\[
\beta = \sqrt{0.9775} \approx 0.98875, \quad v = \beta \cdot c \approx 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mean decay distance \( L \)
The mean decay distance is:
\[
L = v \cdot \tau_{\text{lab}}.
\]
Substituting \( v \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and \( \tau_{\text{lab}} \approx 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{s} \):
\[
L = 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 1.37125 \times 10^{-23} \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated decay distance \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

**Answer: B**
