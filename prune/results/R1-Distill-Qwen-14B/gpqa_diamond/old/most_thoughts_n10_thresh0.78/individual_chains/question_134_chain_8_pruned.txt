Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The formula usually involves calculating the moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting.

The problem says we're mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, that's a bit unusual because usually you have just an acid and a base. Let me think about how they'll react.

First, I should calculate the moles of each acid and base present. Let's see:

For HCl: It's a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. The formula is HCl → H+ + Cl-. So each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

The volume is 500 mL which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So 0.2 mol/L * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol of HCl. So that's 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4: It's a strong acid too. H2SO4 → 2 H+ + SO4^2-. So each mole gives two moles of H+. The volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. So moles of H2SO4 are 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol. So moles of H+ from H2SO4 would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. When you mix acids and a base, the H+ ions from all acids will react with OH- ions from the base. So I need to find the total H+ and the total OH-.

Ba(OH)2 is the base. Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. So each mole gives two moles of OH-. The volume is 200 mL, which is 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M, so moles of Ba(OH)2 are 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol. Thus, moles of OH- are 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

Now, let's sum up the H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from acids: HCl gives 0.1 mol, H2SO4 gives 0.18 mol. So 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol H+.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 mol.

So the reaction will be H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reagent here is OH- because 0.28 > 0.2. So all OH- will react, and there will be excess H+.

The moles of H+ that react are 0.2, and moles of OH- are 0.2. So moles of H2O formed are 0.2.

The enthalpy of neutralization usually is per mole of H2O. I think the standard value is about -57.3 kJ/mol (or sometimes in calories, but the options have some in kJ and some in kcal, so I need to check units).

Wait, but wait, the problem says to calculate the enthalpy when these are mixed. So the total heat released will be based on how much H+ and OH- neutralize each other.

The enthalpy change is usually calculated as q = n × ΔH, where ΔH is per mole of H2O.

Wait, but how to find which is
