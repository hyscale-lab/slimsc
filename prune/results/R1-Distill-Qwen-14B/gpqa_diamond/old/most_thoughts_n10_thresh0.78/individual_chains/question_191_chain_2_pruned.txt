Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the structure of product 4 is. Let's take it step by step because I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, cyclohexanone (the 1-one part) with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group, which is -CH2OH, and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2 group attached to a double bond. So the structure would be CH2-C(CH2 something?) Wait, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2 where the double bond is between C1 and C2. No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- attached how? No, wait, the substituent is at the 2 position. So prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH3)-, right? Because propene is CH2=CH2CH3, so the substituent at position 2 is CH2=CH-CH2-? Wait, no, wait. The structure is CH2=C(CH2something else) or CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: prop-1-en-2-yl group is the same as isopropenyl. So it's CH2=C(CH3)-. So attached to the cyclohexane ring at position 5 is a CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-
