Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Right, the question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting the value 0 at a given time t.

The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but wait a secondâ€”I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, meaning their magnitude (or length) should be 1. Oh wait, wait, because the state vector must have a norm squared equal to 1. So I should check if this state is normalized. Let me calculate the sum of the squares of its elements.

So the state is a column vector: [-1, 2, 1]. The sum of squares is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2. That's 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh wait, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is about 2.45. So the state isn't normalized. That's a problem because in quantum mechanics, states are represented by unit vectors. But wait, maybe the problem assumes that the given vector is already normalized? Or perhaps I should normalize it before proceeding. Because without that, the probabilities would be wrong.

Wait, no, the problem statement just gives the state as (-1, 2, 1). Maybe it's normalized, but let's calculate. Let me compute the length: sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +
