Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an organic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, I remember that FTIR and 1H NMR are two main techniques used here. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the FTIR data: there's a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually mean O-H stretching. So, this compound probably has a carboxylic acid group because they have strong, broad O-H stretches. The other peak is at 1700 cm⁻¹, which is a strong absorption. That's in the range of carbonyl groups (C=O). For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that fits.

Looking at the NMR data: there are several signals, but none are vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds, which makes sense because the carbonyl is a C=O, not a C=C. The NMR has some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That sounds complicated, but I think it has to do with the neighboring protons and their splitting.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, this structure has two CH groups attached to two ethyl groups each. Then a CH2 and a COOH. The structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, each of the central CH groups is attached to an ethyl group and maybe some other substituents.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the central CH groups have an ethyl and another substituent. Wait, but wait: each C(H) is attached to another C2H5 group as well?

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So, each of the two central CH groups have a methyl group attached. So, it's CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. Structure: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, the central CH groups have a methyl and another substituent.

Wait, but I think I might have gotten that wrong. Let me double-check. For each option, the central part is two CH groups, each attached to two other groups.

Let me analyze the NMR signals. The problem states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens, so no coupling from adjacent CH2-CH2 or anything like that. The presence of ethyl groups would have their own signals, but perhaps the splitting comes from the adjacent groups.

In the NMR, the complex splitting suggests that each proton is next to multiple sets of protons. For example, a doublet of triplets of quartets would mean each proton is coupling with multiple groups. So, maybe in a structure where each CH group is near multiple different CH2 groups or other CH groups.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures. Let's consider option D first: the structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So, each CH has a CH2CH3 and a CH3 attached. So, the central CHs are each connected to an ethyl group and a methyl group. Or wait, no: each CH is connected to
