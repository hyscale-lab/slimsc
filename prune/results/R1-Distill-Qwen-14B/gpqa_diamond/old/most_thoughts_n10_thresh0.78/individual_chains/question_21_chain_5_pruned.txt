Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures are isomers. There are two types: constitutional and stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers differ in the bonding arrangement, like where the atoms are connected. Stereoisomers have the same bonding but different 3D arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

Now, the question has two parts, A and B. 

Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the transfer of a hydrogen and a shift in the position of double bonds, like in enols and ketones. So which of these compounds can undergo such a change?

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, right? So it's an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. For tautomerism, the molecule must have both a hydrogen alpha to a carbonyl and a carbonyl group. Wait, but in benzoquinone, each oxygen is attached directly to the ring. So each ketone is on the benzene ring. So can it undergo tautomerism? Like, can a hydrogen from the ring move? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't because the hydrogens are on the aromatic ring, which is pretty stable. So maybe it doesn't have alpha hydrogens, because the carbonyl groups are directly attached to the benzene. Wait, the structure of benzoquinone has two ketone groups attached to the benzene ring. So each O is double-bonded to a carbon on the ring. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like the
