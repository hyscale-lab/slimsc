Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually happens when there are double or triple bonds that can react with Br2. So, maybe these liquids have alkenes or alkynes? But wait, the mixture X doesn't decolorize anymore after some reaction. Oh, wait, no. The mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, and it forms mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, maybe X has some unsaturated compounds that get hydrogenated to become more saturated, making Y not react with bromine water anymore.

Wait, but the problem says that when mixture X is treated with platinum upon heating, it undergoes disproportionation to form mixture Y. Oh, wait, no, I think I misread. Let me read that part again. It says, "is treated with platinum when heated, then an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation." So, the reaction is a disproportionation reaction. So, in a disproportionation reaction, one element is both oxidized and reduced. Like, for example, in some redox reactions where the same species is split into different oxidation states.

So, perhaps the original mixture X has a compound that can undergo such a reaction. But wait, the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. So, maybe the starting material in X has some triple bonds which, upon hydrogenation, become double bonds? Or perhaps other functional groups.

Wait, no. Let's think about the hydrogenation part. The problem says that hydrogenation of both X and Y (using Pt under severe conditions) gives only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%. So, Z has a certain molecular composition.

Let me calculate Z's composition first. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So, if the molecular formula is CnHm, then the mass of H is m*(1/12n + m/1). Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe easier to compute the molecular formula based on the mass percentages.

Let me think: Z is a hydrocarbon, so it's C and H only. The mass fraction of H is 14.28% (which is 1/7 approximately). So, the mass of H is 1/7, so the mass of C must be 6/7. Because 6/7 + 1/7 = 1.

The molar mass of Z is 12n + m, where n is the number of C atoms and m the number of H. The mass of H is (m * 1) / (12n + m) = 1/7.

So,

(m) / (12n + m) = 1/7

Multiply both sides by denominator:

m = (12n + m)/7

Multiply both sides by 7:

7m = 12n + m

Subtract m:

6m = 12n → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n. That's the general formula for an alkene (each double bond reduces the number of H by two, but starting from 2n+2 for alkane, alkene is 2n), so CnH2n implies one double bond per molecule. But wait, wait. Let's see: For n=1, C H2 → methane, no, that's not right. Wait, n=1: CH2 would be, but that's not possible. So perhaps n=3? Let me see.

Wait, let's find small integers that satisfy m=2n. Let's try n=3 → m=6 → C3H6. What's the mass? C is 12*3=36, H is 6 → 36+6=42. So, the mass fraction of H is 6/(36+6) = 6/42 = 1/7, which is 14.28%. So yes, Z is C3H6. But wait, C3H6 can be either propene (an alkene) or propane (an alkane). But wait, propane is C3H8, so for C3H6, it's propene.

Wait, but wait: the problem states that hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only Z. So, when X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z. And Y, when hydrogenated, also becomes Z. So, perhaps X and Y are different compounds that hydrogenate to the same product.

Wait, but in the problem, Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction. So, perhaps X is a compound that can undergo both hydrogenation and some kind of addition or splitting, leading to Y.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to piece together the information.

So, mixture X contains two liquids which decolorize bromine water. So, maybe they're alkenes or alkynes. Then, when X is treated with Pt and heated, a disproportionation occurs, leading to Y, which doesn’t decolorize bromine. So, Y's compounds might have single bonds only, so no alkenes or alkynes.

Wait, but wait. If X was an alkene, hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bond, making it an alkane. But the problem says that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is C3H6. Wait, but that's propene, which has a double bond. No, wait, wait. Z is a hydrocarbon with H mass fraction 14.28%, which as calculated is C3H6. But wait, if X is an alkene (like propene), hydrogenation would give propane (C3H8), which is an alkane
