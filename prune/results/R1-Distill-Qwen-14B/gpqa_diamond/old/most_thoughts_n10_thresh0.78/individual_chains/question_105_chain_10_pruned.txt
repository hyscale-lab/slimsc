Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star with some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star has the same radius as the Sun, and an effective temperature of 6000 K. The spots are covering 20% of that hemisphere, and they're cooler by 1000 K. Because the star is rotating, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that could mimic an exoplanet transit. The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was an exoplanet causing the same brightness variation, what would the planet's radius be relative to the star's radius?

Hmm. So I think the key is to compare the change in brightness (the dip in light curve) caused by the spots to what would be caused by a planet. Since both scenarios produce a similar dip, their area-related factors must be the same.

Wait, but how does each situation affect the brightness?

In the case of the exoplanet transit, the planet blocks a part of the star's light. The dip in brightness is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. So the formula for the dip, I think, is (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet's radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

In the case of the star spots, the brightness variation is because the spots are cooler. As the star rotates, the spots come into view, causing a dip in brightness because those regions emit less light. The amount of dip depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

So first, I need to calculate the brightness dip caused by the spots, and then equate that to the dip caused by the planet.

Let me think about the spot scenario. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So one hemisphere (which is half the star's surface) has 20% of its area covered by spots. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (π Rstar² / 2), because a hemisphere is half the surface area. Or wait, the surface area of a sphere is 4π R², so a hemisphere is 2π R². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R².

But wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². So the spots cover 0.4π R² /4π R² = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly the effective area for the brightness change.

Alternatively, let me think about the flux. The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted areas and the rest.

The star's total flux without spots would be σTeff^4 * 4π R^2,
