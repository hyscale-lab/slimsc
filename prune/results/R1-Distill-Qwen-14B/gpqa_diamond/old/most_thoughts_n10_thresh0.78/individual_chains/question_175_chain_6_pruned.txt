Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and also a possible form of f.

Wait, so power per unit solid angle is like the intensity, right? And the maximum power A would be the total power, I think. Because the total power is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles. So if I can find out how the intensity varies with θ, I can find the fraction at θ=30.

I remember for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern has a specific angular dependence. Oh right, the intensity (or the power per unit solid angle) for an oscillating dipole varies as (sinθ)^2. So the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees (perpendicular to the axis) and zero along the axis (θ=0 and θ=180).

Wait, but the question is about a spheroidal charge distribution. Spheroidal suggests it's more like an ellipsoid, perhaps a dipole? Or is it a quadrupole? Hmm, but oscillating charges would tend to produce radiation, and the dominant term would depend on the multipole expansion. But for radiation, the dominant term is usually the dipole term, right? So maybe this is a dipole-like radiation situation.

Wait, but the problem says it's spheroid in shape. Spheroids can be oblate or prolate. I'm not sure if that affects the radiation pattern. Maybe it's similar to a dipole in terms of radiation characteristics.

So if the radiation pattern follows a sin²θ dependence, then the intensity is proportional to sin²θ, which for θ=30 degrees would be (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the intensity would be 1/4 of the maximum at that angle.

Wait, but the maximum intensity is at θ=90, right? So at θ=30, it's 1/4 of the maximum. But wait, the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A. Hmm, because A is the total power, which is the integral of the intensity over all solid angles.

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum power A is the maximum value of the intensity. Or is A the total power? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says: "the maximum power thus radiated is A". So A is the maximum value of the intensity, which occurs at θ=90 degrees. Because if the function f(θ) is the intensity per unit solid angle, then the maximum of f is A, so the maximum intensity is A. Then, the total power radiated would be the integral of f(θ) over all solid angles. But the question is about the fraction of A that's radiated at θ=30. So it's just f(θ)/A.

Wait, no. Let's read the question again. It says, "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30 degrees." So the question is, if the maximum power radiated is A, what fraction of that A is emitted at θ=30. But wait, that doesn't make sense because A is the maximum intensity. Or is A the total power? Hmm, I think I got this wrong.

Wait, let me read the question again. "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So the maximum power is A. The power per unit solid angle is f(λ,θ). So when f is at its maximum (probably at θ=90), that's A. So the question is, what fraction of A is the power at
