Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, the solution has a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, which probably isn't too relevant except for any activity coefficients, but I think we can ignore that for this problem.

The Ka values for H3PO4 are provided: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Let me think. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4, and it dissociates in steps. So, the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). So orthophosphate ion could refer to either HPO4^2- or PO4^3-—but I think in this context, it's PO4^3-.

But wait, the problem gives both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which is H2PO4^- with K+ as the counterion. Na2HPO4 is sodium dihydrogen phosphate, which is HPO4^2- with Na+ as the counterion. So when these two are dissolved in water, they'll contribute H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions.

Wait a second, so
