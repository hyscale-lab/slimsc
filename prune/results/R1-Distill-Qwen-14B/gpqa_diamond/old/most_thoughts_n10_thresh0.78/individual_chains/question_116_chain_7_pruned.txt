Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and it's a bit tricky. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

Alright, the question starts with compound A showing two signals in proton NMR. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, what does that tell me? I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others. The quartet suggests each proton is next to three others.

Looking at the integration: 6H as a triplet and 4H as a quartet. So maybe the molecule has two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think about structures that have such signals. A common case is a di-substituted cyclohexane, maybe with methyl groups adjacent to each other.

Wait, for example, if the structure is two CH2CH3 groups attached to a cyclohexane, each attached to adjacent carbons. Like cyclohexane with two ethyl groups in the cis or trans positions. Or maybe it's something else, like a diethyl group in a ring.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is likely from the CH3 groups in ethyl chains. Because each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two protons. So each CH3 would be a triplet. If there are two ethyl groups, each with a triplet of 3H, but in the NMR it's 6H as a triplet. That makes sense—each CH3 is 3H, and two of them would give 6H as a triplet.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm, which is around where CH2 groups in ethyl chains appear. So each CH2 is next to a CH3 and another CH2. Wait, no—CH2 in the middle of an ethyl group would be a quartet because each proton on CH2 is adjacent to two protons on one side (from the next CH2) and another two on another side? Or maybe in a different structure.

Wait, perhaps it's a cyclohexane with two ethyl groups attached. If the ethyl groups are adjacent, then their CH2 groups are next to each other. So the CH2 between the two ethyl groups would be a quartet because each of their protons is next to two protons from each adjacent CH2. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let's think of the structure as cyclohexane with two ethyl groups attached to adjacent carbons. So the structure would be (1R,2S)-cyclohexane with two CH2CH3 groups on C1 and C2. Then the CH2 groups (the ones attached to the ring) would be next to each other. So each of those CH2 groups would see two neighboring CH2 groups—wait, no. Each CH2 on the ring is connected to the ring and to the CH2CH3. So the CH2 attached to the ring would have neighboring CH2 groups from adjacent positions? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a structure like 1,2-dimethylcyclohexane, but with each methyl replaced by a CH2CH3. Or maybe it's a 1,2-dieethylcyclohexane. So, two ethyl groups on adjacent carbons. So each ethyl group's CH2 is attached to the ring and next to another CH2 from the adjacent ethyl.

Wait, that would mean that each of the CH2 protons (the ones on the ring) would be next to two protons from the adjacent CH2. So each CH2 would be a triplet? Or a quartet? Hmm, the NMR shows a quartet for 4H. So if each CH2 has two neighboring protons, each CH2 would be a triplet. Wait, but the quartet is 4H. Oh, wait, so maybe those 4H are from two equivalent CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the ethyl groups are on carbons that are next to each other, but the ring is such that the CH2 groups are adjacent. So each CH2 (the one attached to the ring) is next to another CH2. So each CH2 in the ethyl groups would be adjacent to two others. Therefore, each CH2 would be a triplet, but that doesn't fit with the quartet.

Wait, maybe I'm over
