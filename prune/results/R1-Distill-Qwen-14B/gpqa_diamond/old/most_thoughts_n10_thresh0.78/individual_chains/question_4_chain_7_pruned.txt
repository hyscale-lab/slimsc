Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, let me think about what I know regarding Maxwell's equations and magnetic monopoles.

Wait, Maxwell's equations in our universe are four fundamental laws that describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and originate from charges and currents. Two of them, I remember, are specifically about the divergence of the electric and magnetic fields. Oh right, Gauss's Law for electricity says that the divergence of E is proportional to the charge density, and Gauss's Law for magnetism says the divergence of B is zero. That's the one that leads us to think there are no isolated magnetic poles under normal circumstances.

So in this parallel universe, they do have isolated North or South poles. That would mean that the magnetic field's divergence isn't zero everywhere anymore. In our world, because of the divergence of B being zero, we get that magnetic field lines are always continuous, forming closed loops. But if there are isolated poles, then the divergence of B would be non-zero. So that must change one of Maxwell's equations, specifically the one related to the divergence of the magnetic field.

Wait, but what about the other equations? The other equations are Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition). Faraday's Law deals with the curl of the electric field, right? It says that a changing magnetic flux through a loop induces a circulating electric field. That doesn't directly relate to the existence of magnetic monopoles as far as I remember. It's about how electric fields and magnetic fields change over time and space, not about sources.

Ampère's Law, the one with Maxwell's addition, deals with the curl of the magnetic field. It relates the curl of B to the current density plus the displacement current. But if we're only adding magnetic monopoles, that affects the divergence of B. Does it affect Ampère's Law? Well, in our universe, Ampère's Law includes the displacement current because Maxwell added it to fix the inconsistency with electromagnetic waves. But the presence of magnetic monopoles would require adding a term to Gauss's Law for magnetism, not necessarily Ampère's law directly. Or wait, maybe it affects both the divergence and the curl?

Alternatively, I might be mixing things up. Let me think: Maxwell's equations in four parts are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's Law for E)
2. ∇·B = 0 (Gauss's Law for B, which would change)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's Law)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ (J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t) (Ampère-Maxwell Law)

If magnetic monopoles exist, then ∇·B would not be zero. So equation 2 would change. But what about equation 4? Well, in the presence of magnetic current, perhaps the curl of E would change? No, I think equation 3 is about the induced electric fields due to changing B fields, which doesn't directly involve sources.

Wait, but if magnetic monopoles exist, we would also need a magnetic version of Ampère's Law. No, that's not right. Wait, no, because Ampère's Law is about how the magnetic field circulates around currents. If there are magnetic currents (like a flow of monopoles), then perhaps the curl of E would have another term? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the existence of magnetic charge affects the divergence of B and also requires a term in the equation for the curl of E?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The presence of magnetic monopoles would modify Gauss's Law for magnetism, so equation 2. But what about Faraday's Law? In our universe, equation 3 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If B has a divergence, perhaps that equation remains the same because it
