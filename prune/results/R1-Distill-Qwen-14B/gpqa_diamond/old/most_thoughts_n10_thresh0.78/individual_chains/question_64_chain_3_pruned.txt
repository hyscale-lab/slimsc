Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the problem says.

Alright, the problem is about heating a mixture of two salts, A and B. They're equimolar, so their moles are the same. The total mass is 7.20 grams. When heated to 200°C without air, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through some tubes.

The first tube is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so it probably absorbs water. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that the gases contained water vapor, which was absorbed here.

The second tube has Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change. Wait, but Ca(OH)2 is a base, usually used to absorb CO2. If the weight didn't change, maybe there was no CO2 in the gas mixture. Or perhaps the amount of CO2 was zero, or maybe it's already been accounted for elsewhere. Hmm, not sure yet.

The third tube has red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80 grams, and CuO was formed. Red-hot copper probably reacts with certain gases. For example, CO would react with copper to form CO2 and Cu. Or maybe H2S, but I don't think so because H2S tends to smell like rotten eggs and I'm not sure about the reaction with copper here. Alternatively, SO2 might react, but I'm not certain. Wait, the product is CuO, so the gas must have been something that when reacted with copper gives CuO. Oh, like H2 reacting? No, because H2 would produce water, but that's probably already been captured in the first tube. Or maybe CO reacting with Cu. Let me think: CO is a reducing agent. When CO reacts with CuO, it produces Cu and CO2. But wait, in this case, the copper is red-hot, so maybe the gas is something else. Alternatively, maybe the gas is H2S, which upon reaction with hot copper produces S and water. But I'm not too sure. Hmm.

Then, after all this, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). So 2.24 L is a volume I should note. Since STP is 0°C and 1 atm, 22.4 L is 1 mole. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles.

Now, the question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, perhaps I should figure out what gases are being formed. Let's think about each step.

First, when salts A and B are heated, they decompose. Let me think about possible salt decomposition products. Maybe they release some gases. For example, if the salts are nitrates, they might release NO2 or other oxides. Or they could be sulfates decomposing to SO3 or something else.

The first tube, Mg(ClO4)2, absorbs water. So the gas mixture must contain H2O. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous, so it's a strong desiccant. When it absorbs water, it gains mass. So the initial gas has some water vapor.

The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas had CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the weight didn't change. So maybe no CO2 was present, or all of it was absorbed elsewhere. Or perhaps the amount was negligible. So maybe the gas doesn't contain CO2. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in the first and third tubes absorbed all CO2, so none was left to react in the Ca(OH)2 solution.

The third tube has red-hot copper. The gas passed through it caused the copper to increase in mass by
