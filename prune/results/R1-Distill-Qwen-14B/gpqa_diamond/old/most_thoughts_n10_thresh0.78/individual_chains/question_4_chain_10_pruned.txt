Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know about Maxwell's equations. Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws in electromagnetism. They describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and relate to charges and currents.

The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E is proportional to the charge density. Mathematically, that's ∇·E = ρ/ε₀.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero, ∇·B = 0. This implies that there are no isolated magnetic monopoles.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: The curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t.
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is equal to μ₀ times the current density plus the displacement current. ∇×B = μ₀(J + ε₀ ∂E/∂t).

Now, the question is about a parallel universe where a magnet can have an isolated North or South pole. So, in this universe, magnetic monopoles exist. The question is asking which of Maxwell's equations would look different because of this.

In our universe, Gauss's Law for magnetism says that the divergence of B is zero because there are no isolated magnetic monopoles. If there were magnetic monopoles, this equation would change. Specifically, the divergence of B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density. So equation 2 would be different.

But wait, let me think about the other equations. Faraday's law relates the curl of E to the time derivative of B. That equation deals with the curl, not divergence. Ampère's law relates the curl of B to current and displacement current. So those two equations might not be affected unless the existence of monopoles changes something else.

Wait, another thought: Maxwell's equations also have symmetry when magnetic monopoles are considered. If magnetic monopoles exist, not only does equation 2 change, but equation 3 might as well. Because without magnetic monopoles, Faraday's law is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. But if monopoles exist, perhaps there's a term involving the gradient of the magnetic scalar potential or something else. Alternatively, I might be mixing this up.

Wait, let me correct that. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, there would be an analogous Gauss's law for B, changing equation 2. Also, Faraday's law would have an additional term. Because, in such a case, the equations would mirror each other. For instance, if B has a divergence, then E's curl would have a term related to the magnetic current or monopole density.

Wait, I think I might be getting confused here. In our universe, the four equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×B = μ₀( J + ε₀
