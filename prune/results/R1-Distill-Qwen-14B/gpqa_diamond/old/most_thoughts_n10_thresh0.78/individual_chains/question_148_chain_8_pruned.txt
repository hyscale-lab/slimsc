Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully and break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. Let's see what each substance does.

So, the first substance is A1, which is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing something usually means it's a strong oxidizing agent.

Then there's A3, which can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y with fluorine. So, A3 is probably a binary compound of Y and F. Wait, but there are five binary compounds. So Y could be a diatomic element reacting with F in various oxidation states.

Next, adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4 produces A5. A5 then decomposes in water to form two substances. I need to figure out what A4's molecular weight range is.

Let me try to identify each compound. I think this might involve some common fluorine compounds.

A1's decomposition: when it breaks down, it produces A2 and F2. So, maybe A1 is a compound that releases F2 upon decomposition. Wait, but F2 is a diatomic molecule. So, if A1 is, say, YF3, maybe when it decomposes, it forms YF2 (A2) and F2. Or perhaps another possibility.

Wait, but A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive, but in this case, it's being oxidized. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, but it's in a compound here. So perhaps A1 is a compound where Y is in a high oxidation state.

Let me think of some compounds. For example, ClF3 is a known compound, but I'm not sure about Y. Wait, Y is an element forming binary compounds with F, so it's probably a halogen or maybe something else.

Wait, another thought: A4 is a solution, a colorless concentrated solution. When Y is added, 1:1 molar ratio, it forms A5. A5 decomposes in water into two substances. So maybe A5 is a salt that breaks down into something in water, perhaps releasing F- ions or something else.

Wait, if A4 is a solution, perhaps it's a hydrofluoric acid derivative. Or maybe it's a fluoride ion solution. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about the known reactions. Let's try to map the possible compounds.

A1 is a red substance that decomposes into A2 and F2.
