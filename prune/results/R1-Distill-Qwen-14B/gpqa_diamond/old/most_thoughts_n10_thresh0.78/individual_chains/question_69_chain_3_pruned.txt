Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are given in meters, from 1e-9 to 1e-3, so maybe it's something related to length, like the decay path or something.

Wait, I remember that the lifetime of a moving particle appears longer due to time dilation. So the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when it's moving, we have to consider the Lorentz factor γ, which is the time dilation factor. The observed lifetime τ is γ times τ₀.

So the first step is probably to find γ. To find γ, I think we use the relation between energy, mass, and momentum. Because E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Oh wait, because the particle is moving, its total energy is the sum of its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Right, so the energy given is 27 GeV, which is the total energy.

So m is 3.41 GeV/c². Let's plug into E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Let me write it properly. E = 27 GeV, m = 3.41 GeV/c². So,

E² = (pc)² + (m c²)²

We can rearrange for pc:

pc = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²)

But since E and m are in GeV, but I think the units will cancel out as we're looking for a ratio. Let's compute pc.

So,

(pc)² = E² - (m c²)² = (27)^2 - (3.41)^2 (GeV)^2

Calculating 27^2 is 729, and 3.41^2 is about 11.6281. So 729 minus 11.6281 is 717.3719 GeV².

So pc = sqrt(717.3719) GeV ≈ 26.787 GeV.

But wait, the units here: pc is in GeV * c? Because E is in GeV, and c is in m/s, but when using natural units, c is 1, so GeV*c would be equivalent to GeV multiplied by a unit conversion factor. Hmm, maybe I don't need to worry about the actual units because we'll be dealing with the ratio.

Wait, actually, the momentum p is (pc)/c², so p = (26.787 GeV) / c² * c , since pc is in GeV, p = (26.787 GeV/c²) * (1/c) ?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of βγ. Because γ is E/(m c²), right? So since E = γ m c², then γ is E/(m c²). So in this case, E is 27 GeV, m c² is 3.41 GeV, so γ = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.9178.

So γ is about 7.918.

That makes sense because E = γ m c², so yeah, the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Now, the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.918 * 8e-16 s = let's calculate that. 7.918 *8 is approximately 63.344, so τ ≈ 63.344e-16 s, which is 6.3344e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure whether that's the right approach. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Hmm, I think this refers to the minimum time resolution of the detector, such that at least 30% of the particles are detected before their decay paths cause them to be unobservable.

Wait, wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's about the minimum distance resolution required to distinguish the decay vertices. Because in the bubble chamber, when a particle decays, it leaves a track, and the length of the track before decay indicates the lifetime. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The number of particles that decay in the chamber is related to their lifetime. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The proper lifetime is τ₀, and the observed lifetime is γ τ₀.

So the average decay length L is c * τ in the lab frame. Because L = v * τ, where v is the velocity, and τ is the dilated lifetime.

But wait, v is approximately c for high-energy particles. So L ≈ c * τ.

So L = c * γ τ₀.

But wait, I think I should compute L correctly. Because v = β c, so L =
