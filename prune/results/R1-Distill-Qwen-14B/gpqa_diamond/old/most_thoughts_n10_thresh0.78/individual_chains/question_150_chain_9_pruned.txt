Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. But let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Wait, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get a sense of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X +N)/2. Wait, the formula is C8H9NO. So, substituting: C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a ring and some double bonds or something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): That's a triplet around 9.7. High ppm, likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually show up around 9-10 ppm. The triplet suggests it's next to two protons, maybe on a CH2 group or something. Wait, but wait—another possibility is an aromatic ring with substituents, but I don't think so. Another thought: maybe it's an acidic proton like from a phenol, but phenol protons are usually around 5-7 ppm. So probably an aldehyde.

- 6.98 (d, 2H): Two protons as a doublet. Maybe aromatic protons. If this is a para-substituted benzene ring, the two protons would be equivalent, giving a doublet if they're next to substituents. Wait, but para-substituted should have two sets of doublets if there are two substituents. Hmm, not sure yet.

- 6.51 (d, 2H): Also a doublet, two protons. Another set of aromatic protons. Maybe this is a meta-substituted ring? Or perhaps part of a conjugated system.

Wait, maybe the 6.98 and 6.51 are from two different aromatic rings. Let me consider that. So two aromatic rings, each with two protons as doublets. So each ring is para-substituted, perhaps. So if each is para-substituted, like two substituents on each ring.

Then, 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange or something like an enol, but wait, or perhaps adjacent to an oxygen. Alternatively, this could be an allylic position or part of a conjugated system. Wait, but the 'bs' could mean broad and singlet—maybe a diol or something with two adjacent protons next to an oxygen.

3.66 (d, 2H): A doublet, two protons. This could be a CH
