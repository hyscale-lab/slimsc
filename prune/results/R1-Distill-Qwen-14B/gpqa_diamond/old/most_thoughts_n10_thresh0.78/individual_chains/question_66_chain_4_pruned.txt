Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT.

Wait, let's start by recalling what each of these symmetries means. Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their constant velocity. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like moving from one point to another in space-time). But wait, are these two considered separate symmetries or related? Because I think Lorentz is part of Poincare. So if an operator respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz as well, but maybe the reverse isn't necessarily true.

CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). Charge conjugation flips the charge of particles, and parity inverts the spatial coordinates. CPT symmetry is the combination of C, P, and T (time reversal). I remember that in quantum field theory, the CPT theorem states that a Lorentz-invariant theory must be CPT-symmetric. So if a theory respects Lorentz symmetry, it automatically respects CPT.

Now, in SMEFT, the operators are constructed to be renormalizable or higher-dimensional but still respecting certain symmetries. The SMEFT is built by adding operators to the Standard Model that are invariant under the SM gauge symmetry (like SU(2) and SU(3)), but what about other symmetries like Lorentz and CPT?

Wait, all operators in SMEFT must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model, right? The Standard Model includes Lorentz symmetry, and since SMEFT is an effective theory, it must also respect Lorentz. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

What about Poincare symmetry? Oh, wait, the Standard Model itself is Poincare-invariant. But higher-dimensional operators in SMEFT are usually written in a way that respects
