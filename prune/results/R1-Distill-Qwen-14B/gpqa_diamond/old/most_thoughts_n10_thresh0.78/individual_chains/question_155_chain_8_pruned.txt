Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I'll need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩ for the given state.

Wait, but since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, what does that mean for P_z? If the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it might not be an eigenstate of P_z. So I'll have to calculate the expectation values directly.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this state as |ψ⟩.

First, I think I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in this state. That would be ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Then, for ⟨P_z²⟩, that's ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩. Once I have both, I can plug them into the uncertainty formula.

Wait, but wait. Let me write down the matrix form of P_z. The problem says it's diagonal because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So P_z is a diagonal matrix with entries (ħ, 0, -ħ).

So, the matrix looks like:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, okay. Now, how do we compute ⟨P_z⟩?

The state |ψ⟩ is a column vector ( -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ). Let me compute each component squared because when you take the inner product, you'll have to multiply components and so on.

Wait, but to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩, I think the calculation is:

Each component of the vector is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element of P_z, then summed.

Alternatively, since P_z is diagonal, when we apply it to |ψ⟩, each component just gets multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element. So P_z |ψ⟩ would be a new vector where each component is (ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/sqrt(2)), (-ħ)*(-1/
