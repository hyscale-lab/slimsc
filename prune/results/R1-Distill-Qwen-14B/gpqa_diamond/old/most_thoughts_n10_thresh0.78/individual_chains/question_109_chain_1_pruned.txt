Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let's try to unpack it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The Pauli statistics tell us that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state must satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Okay, so that's an equation involving the isospin (T), spin (S), and orbital angular momentum (L) of the NN system. 

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. The options are different transitions with specific angular momentum states for the emitted particle X. Each option has a term like 1S0 -> 3D1 + p, where the lowercase letters denote the angular momentum state of X. 

Wait, the problem also mentions that both angular momentum and parity are conserved. So I need to consider both conservation laws. Also, the term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), so I can break down each term into its components.

First, let's understand the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. So, for the NN system: the spin S is 0 (since it's S0), the orbital angular momentum L is 1 (since S represents the spectroscopic notation; S stands for 0, P for 1, D for 2, etc.), and the total angular momentum J is 0 because it's 1S0. 

But wait, wait. Oh, right, the term symbol is (2S+1)LJ. So 1S0 would mean 1 (from 2S+1 where S=0) S (L=0?) Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. 

Wait, the spectroscopic notation for L: S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, F is 3, etc. So 1S0 would imply L=0? Because S implies L=0? Or is that not right? Wait, no, wait. No, the term is (2S+1)LJ. So in 1S0, the 1 is 2S+1. So 1 = 2S + 1 => S=0. Then, the L is S in the symbol, but I think I might have messed that up. Wait, no, in the term symbol, the letter represents L. So 1S0: the S represents L=0. So for the initial state, the NN system has S=0 (spin), L=0 (orbital angular momentum), and J=0 (total angular momentum). 

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because
