Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question states that the molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, what's the fundamental state again? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state of the system. But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. So maybe the fundamental state refers to the lowest vibrational state with the lowest rotational energy.

So the molecule can absorb a photon and switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. I think that means the next higher energy state. But wait, which transition is that? Since the question is about the next state, perhaps it's a change from the ground state to the first excited state, but I'm not entirely sure.

The problem gives me the masses of X and Y, the bond length, and the angular frequency. Oh, right, the molecular bond length is R=2 angstroms, which I should convert into meters. Wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. Angular frequency is related to the vibrational energy. The energy levels for a harmonic oscillator are quantized, with each level being (n + 1/2) ħw, where n is the vibrational quantum number.

But wait, the question is about the transition when the molecule absorbs a photon. The photon's energy should match the energy difference between two states. Since it's the next state with the lowest energy, I think it's the first excited state. So the energy difference would be the difference between the first excited state and the ground state.

Wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1. The energy difference is (3/2 ħw - 1/2 ħw) = ħw. So the photon's energy should be ħw.

But wait, the problem is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is a combination of rotation and vibration. So maybe the molecule is in its vibrational ground state and the rotational ground state. Then, when it absorbs a photon, it could go to the next higher vibrational state, or the next higher rotational state. Which transition requires less energy?

Hmm. The energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. B is given by (ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (n + 1/2) ħw. So the difference between n=0 and n=1 is ħw.

So, what's the energy required for the next state? The next state could be either the next vibrational state (n=1) or the next rotational state (J=1). Which transition requires a lower energy photon.

Wait, what's the energy for the first rotational state? Let's compute it.

First, find the moment of inertia I. I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

The reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is
