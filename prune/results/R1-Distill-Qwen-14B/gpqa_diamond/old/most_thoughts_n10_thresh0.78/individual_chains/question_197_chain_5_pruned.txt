Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining what it becomes after reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A, B, C, D.

Alright, first, I should analyze the IR and NMR data to figure out what compound X is. Let's start with the IR.

IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretches. But wait, that region could also be from N-H or maybe even alkenes or alkanes. But the strong absorption around 3400-2500 might suggest an O-H group. Then there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, probably from a ketone or maybe an ester. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretches. So maybe the compound has an aromatic ring with substituents.

Looking at the NMR data now. Let's break down each peak.

1H NMR:
10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's pretty downfield. Could that be an aldehyde proton? But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. Or maybe an acidic proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have broad O-H signals, but this peak is a singlet. Alternatively, maybe an enol proton? Not sure.

8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, integrating to 2H. That's probably aromatic protons. Since it's a doublet, maybe part of a para-substituted benzene. Because in para substitution, the protons would be split into a doublet due to coupling with each other.

7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. So maybe another set of aromatic protons. If the benzene ring is para-substituted, perhaps with two substituents in the para positions, or maybe a substituent with two sets of protons.

Then, 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to an electronegative group. Could it be a CH next to a carbonyl?

1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe two protons. Perhaps part of a chain, like a CH2 next to something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of three protons, as a doublet? Wait, no, a doublet with integral 3H. That suggests a CH2CH3 group, maybe. Or a -CH(CH3) group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet for 3H. That's typical for a methyl group attached to a CH2, like in an ethyl chain. So maybe something like CH2CH3.

Putting this together. Let me sketch a possible structure.

The aromatic
