Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each integrating to 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm with a 2:1:1 integration. Hmm, okay.

I remember that in NMR, the integrations give the ratio of the number of protons in each peak. So the aromatic signals at 6.7 ppm are each a singlet, and they're in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, but waitâ€”each is a singlet and they're in a 1:1 ratio. So each of these signals must come from two different sets of protons, each set having the same number of protons. Because if they were in a 1:1 ratio, but each is a singlet, maybe each is a pair of equivalent protons?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The two singlets at 6.7 ppm have a 1:1 ratio. So each of these signals corresponds to a certain number of H's, and their areas are equal. So each is contributing an equal number of H's. For example, one might be a doublet of a certain integration, but in this case, they're singlets.

Wait, but the problem says the two signals are singlets and in a 1:1 ratio. So each integrates to the same number of H's. But the integrations are for the peaks, so if each is a singlet, the number of H's in each would be the same. So each peak would correspond to the same number of equivalent H's.

Wait, the aromatic region. For benzene derivatives, the splitting and integration depend on the substituents. If the molecule is symmetrical, certain protons become equivalent.

Looking at the possible options, all the compounds are tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Each of the options is a four-substituted benzene. Let me list them:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, no. Let me check each option:

Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Option B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

Option C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene.

Option D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, I need to think about the structure of each of these compounds and their expected NMR spectra.

So, starting with the aromatic region. Each of the two compounds contributes a set of aromatic protons. Wait, but the mixture is 1:1, so each component contributes equally. So the total NMR would show peaks from each component. But in this case, the question says that in the NMR, there are two signals in the aromatic region, each a singlet, and each integrated to 1:1. Hmm, that suggests each compound contributes a singlet in that region, and each is present in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but if the mixture is 1:1, then each component contributes equally. So, for each component, the number of aromatic protons would affect the integration.

Wait, perhaps each component has a singlet for their aromatic protons, and each singlet has the same integration. So each component contributes a singlet, and each has the same number of H's. Because in the NMR, their areas are in 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but each singlet in the aromatic region is integrating to the same amount. So for each compound, perhaps the aromatic protons are equivalent and give a singlet, and each contributes the same number of H's. So for example, if each compound has two equivalent aromatic protons, then each would give a singlet of 2H. Then, in a 1:1 mixture, each would contribute equally, so the total would be 2H from each, but since they're in a 1:1 ratio, the peaks would be in a 1:1 area ratio.

Wait no, the problem says two signals at 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. So each signal comes from one of the compounds, and each is a singlet. So each compound contributes a singlet in the aromatic region, and the two peaks are in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but in a 1:1 mixture, each component is present in equal amounts. So the integration of each aromatic peak should be proportional to the number of aromatic H's in each component.

Alternatively, perhaps each component has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons, which appear as a singlet.

Let me think about each possible compound.
