Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what each compound looks like and whether it can show optical activity.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them exhibit optical activity. The options are A to D, with numbers 5, 3, 2, 4 respectively.

First, I remember that optical activity arises when a molecule has chiral centersâ€”atoms with four different substituents. Alternatively, a molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral even if it has stereocenters. So, I'll go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
Wait, the structure here is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. The formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So it's Cl attached to the first carbon of a butene. But the configuration is Z. Let me draw this. The structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each double bond carbon would be Cl on C1 and CH(CH3) maybe? Wait, but I think for a double bond, each carbon has two substituents. So C1 has Cl and another group, perhaps. Wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would add Cl to the first carbon: Cl-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, but that's not correct. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first CH2. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond. So the structure must be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the
