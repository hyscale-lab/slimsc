Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question starts with Compound A, which has two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. So a triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three others.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. That probably means it's two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Because 6H divided by 3 (since each CH3 has 3H) would give two CH3 groups. And each of those CH3s is next to another CH2 group, maybe? Because the quartet has 4H. 4H could be two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH3 connected to another CH2.

Wait, let me think. The triplet (6H) could be a CH2CH3 group where each CH3 is attached to a CH2. Because the CH3 would have neighboring CH2's protons. So the triplet would be for the CH2 protons adjacent to a CH2CH3 group. Or maybe it's a diethyl group. Oh wait, diethyl ether perhaps? No, because I don't see an oxygen in the description yet.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Or maybe it's something like neopentyl? Wait, neopentyl has a central CH connected to four CH2 groups? No, that doesn't fit the NMR. Wait, neopentyl's structure is (CH2CH2)C(CH3)2? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to another group. Let's think about the splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (which is usually where CH3 groups are) is 6H, so that's two CH3 groups. Each of those CH3 groups is attached to a CH2, because the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H, so that's two CH2 groups, each with two Hs. So maybe the structure is CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2CH2)2CH. No, that's not right. Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to a CH2.

Wait, perhaps it's a structure where each CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is then attached to another group. Like maybe CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's butyl. Wait, but the quartet is for 4H, so maybe each of two CH2 groups. So maybe it's something like CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps it's cyclopropane with substituents? Or maybe it's a diethyl group attached to a central carbon. Wait, diethyl ether would be (CH2CH3)2O, but that would have the CH2CH3 groups as triplet. But the NMR in the question is for the proton, so the splitting would relate to adjacent groups.

Wait, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane derivative? Like two CH2CH3 groups attached to adjacent carbons. But I'm not so sure.

Wait, another approach. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) suggests two equivalent CH3 groups, each adjacent to a
