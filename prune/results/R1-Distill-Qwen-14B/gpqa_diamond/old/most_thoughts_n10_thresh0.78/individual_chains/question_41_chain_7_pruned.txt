Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me see what it's about. The question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is usually given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, this is when the medium and the source are at rest relative to each other. But in this case, the glass is moving. So I think this introduces a consideration of relative motion between the medium and the observer.

I've heard about the concept of relativistic velocities, but I'm not sure if this problem requires relativistic addition or if it's a simpler classical mechanics approach. Since the problem gives c=1, maybe it's expecting a non-relativistic approach, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's think about it. The light is moving through the glass, which itself is moving. So the speed of the light relative to the lab frame depends on both the speed of the light inside the glass and the speed of the glass itself.

In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed would be c/n. Because when the medium is stationary, the light's speed is c/n.

But the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer in the same direction as the light. So from the lab frame, which is the observer's frame, we need to find the speed of the light beam.

Wait, but velocity addition in relativity isn't just a simple addition. Oh wait, but if v is small compared to c, we can use a classical approach. But if v is significant, maybe we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

But the problem doesn't specify whether v is small or not. Hmm. The question just says "constant velocity v". So perhaps I should consider the relativistic approach.

Wait, let me recall the relativistic velocity addition formula. If an object has velocity u in the frame S', which is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then the velocity u' in frame S is given by (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/cÂ²). But wait, that's for when the two frames are moving relative to each other at velocity v, right?

Wait, in this case, the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. Inside the glass, the light's speed is c/n. So let's model this.

Let me define the frames. Let S be the lab frame, and S' be the rest frame of the glass. So in S', the light's speed is c/n. Now, the glass is moving at velocity v relative to S, so the glass's velocity in S is v.

Wait, no. Wait, the S' frame is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in S', the glass is stationary, and the light is moving at c/n in the same direction. But from the lab frame S, the light's speed is something else.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So using the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed u in the lab
