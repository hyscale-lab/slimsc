Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH to produce product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through solution 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethylsulfide, giving product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Hmm, I remember that when dibromo compounds react with a strong base like KOH, they typically undergo elimination. Since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, which is pretty rigid, the reaction might form an epoxide or something else. Wait, no, wait—the reaction of vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromoadamantane) with a base like KOH usually leads to an elimination reaction, forming an alkene. Oh wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a dihalide; it's not vicinal. Wait, no, wait: 1,3-dibromoadamantane—oh, wait, adamantane is a diamondoid with four bridgehead carbons. So, 1 and 3 are on adjacent bridgehead positions. So the structure is like two bromines on adjacent bridgeheads.

Wait, so when heated with KOH, what happens? Vicinal dihalides when treated with a strong base usually eliminate to form alkenes. But here, are the bromines on adjacent carbons? Let me think. Adamantane has four bridgehead carbons in a structure where each is connected to two others. So 1 and 3 might be on opposite ends of the structure. Wait, no, 1 and 3 in adamantane are actually not adjacent. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused
