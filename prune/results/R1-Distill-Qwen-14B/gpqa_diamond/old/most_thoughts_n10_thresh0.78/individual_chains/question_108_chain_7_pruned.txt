Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through step by step.

First, the question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and is 1 Tesla. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, right? So for electrons, m can be -1, 0, +1 maybe? Or is it related to the orbital angular momentum? Oh wait, I think for electrons, the orbital quantum number is l, and m can range from -l to +l. But the question says m is small, which probably means m is low, like m=0 or m=±1.

The problem asks to compare the paramagnetic coupling term (which I assume is the energy shift due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The transition has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series, right? Specifically, the Balmer-alpha line, which is the transition from n=2 to n=1, but wait no, wait, no, wait: the Balmer series is transitions down to n=2. Wait no, Balmer-alpha is from n=3 to n=2, I think. Oh wait, no
