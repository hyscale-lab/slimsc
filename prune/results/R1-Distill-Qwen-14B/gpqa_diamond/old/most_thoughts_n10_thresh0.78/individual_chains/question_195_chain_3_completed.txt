Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me read through it again. So, the question is about planets transiting and occulting their star. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. An occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, which might affect observations too.

The setup is that there are two planets. The first one has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star it's orbiting has a radius 1.5 times the Sun. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still showing both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and circular orbits.

So, what do I know? For a planet to transit, it must pass in front of the star. The transit impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) that the planet's path misses the star's center. A lower impact parameter means it's closer to the center, so more likely to transit. But wait, the impact parameter here is 0.2 for the first planet. So, that's 20% of the star's radius away from the center. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's, but I don't think the exact value matters for the calculation. Hmm.

Wait, but for both planets to transit, they must lie in the same orbital plane, as the question says. So, their orbital planes are aligned. But how does the orbital period relate to whether they both transit?

I think the key here is the concept of orbital periods and how their positions change over time. For both planets to transit, their orbital periods must be such that their positions align with our line of sight at the same time. But wait, the question isn't about them transiting at the same time, but each planet transiting on its own and also occulting. So, each must pass in front and behind the star.

Wait, but occultation is when the planet is behind the star. So, for it to be in occultation, it must be that the planet is on the opposite side of the star from our point of view. So, during transit, the planet is between us and the star, and during occultation, it's behind the star.

For a planet to both transit and occult, its orbit must be such that it can go in front and behind the star. So, this would require that the planet's orbital period allows it to come into the line of sight again after some time.

But wait, more importantly, for a planet to have both events, its orbital distance must be such that it can be in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star from our viewpoint. That is, the planet must orbit the star in a way that sometimes it's between us and the star (transit) and sometimes on the far side (occultation).

But the star's size matters here. The planet must be able to move in its orbit and pass both in front and behind the star. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, so the planet must have an orbital radius that allows it to swing behind as well. Wait, but for a planet to pass behind, I think the orbital distance needs to be larger than the star's radius, which it already is because all planets orbit outside the star.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the key concept here. Both planets transit, so each must have an orbital period that allows their orbits to be in alignment with the line of sight. But the question is about the maximum possible period for the second planet such that both transit and occultation happen.

Wait, maybe this is about the Doppler shift and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the concept is about the Hill sphere or something else, but I think I'm getting off track.

Wait, no, another approach: For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be edge-on (or close enough) to our line of sight. So, the inclination of the orbit must be such that the planet's path crosses in front of the star. For both transiting and occulting events, the planet must have an orbit that allows it to be in front and behind as seen from Earth.

Wait, but that's always possible if the orbit is edge-on. Because as the planet orbits, it goes around, so it alternates between being in front and behind. But wait, the key point is, perhaps, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that it can return to the same position relative to the first planet, so that both can be observed transiting and occulting. Or maybe it's about when the two planets can transit at the same time, but the question isn't about that.

Wait, the question says that the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation. So, each planet's orbit must be such that it can pass in front and behind the star. That's possible as long as the orbital plane is edge-on. So the orbital period of the second planet isn't directly constrained by that.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the transit condition. A planet transits if its orbit's inclination is such that the planet's path crosses the line of sight. The transit impact parameter (b) is the distance from the center of the star in units of the star's radius. If b is less than (R_planet + R_star) / R_star, but wait, the impact parameter formula is just b = (distance from star's center) in units of star's radius.

Wait, no, the impact parameter is the distance (in terms of the star's radius) that the planet's path is from the center of the star. So, if the planet's orbit is perfectly along our line of sight (b=0), the planet would pass directly in front of the center. But for the planet to actually transit, the planet must be close enough in terms of orbital distance such that its path crosses the star's disk. Otherwise, the planet is too far away in orbital terms, and the transit doesn't occur.

Wait, no. The impact parameter is more about the path's distance from the star's center, not the orbital distance. So, if the planet's orbit brings it into a position where its path is close enough to the star's center (as in, the impact parameter is low enough), then it will transit.

Wait, perhaps the key is the ratio of the orbital periods. Because if the two planets are in the same orbital plane, their orbital periods must be such that their orbital distances allow their transits to be observable. But perhaps the maximum period is determined by the first planet's period and the condition that the second can still transit and occult.

Wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the Hill sphere or the concept of orbital resonance. But perhaps that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the condition that the second planet's orbital period must be such that it doesn't take so long that we can't observe both events within the same observation window.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. The question is about the maximum period where both events can occur, regardless of the time it takes to observe them.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the Doppler method. For a planet to cause a detectable Doppler shift, the orbital speed must be such that the star's reflex motion is detectable. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, considering that both planets must transit (so their orbital planes are aligned), their orbital periods can be different, but perhaps there's a limit due to the star's habitable zone or other factors. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is that for a planet to transit, the orbital period must be such that the star's rotation (if any) doesn't affect the transit timing. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the maximum period of the second planet is determined by the condition that the orbital periods are in a ratio that allows their transits to be observed, but that seems unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the maximum period where the second planet's orbital distance allows it to transit and occult, given the first planet's data. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the star's rotation period, but the question doesn't mention it. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the concept is about the orbital period and the star's rotation affecting the transit timing. But again, the question doesn't mention star rotation.

Wait, perhaps it's about the orbital velocities. Since both planets are in the same system, their orbital velocities depend on their distances from the star.

The orbital period is related to the distance from the star via Kepler's third law. For a circular orbit, the period P is given by P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where 'a' is the semi-major axis (distance from star), and M is the star's mass.

But the problem is, we don't know the mass of the star. Oh, but the star's radius is given as 1.5 times the Sun's radius. But without knowing its mass, it's hard to apply Kepler's law. Unless perhaps we can assume it's a main-sequence star, so mass scales with radius. But that would require knowing the exact relation. Oh, but wait, main-sequence stars have mass and radius related, but it's not a linear relation. So I'm not sure if that's the intended approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is focusing on the relative sizes of the planets and the star, but I don't see the connection to the orbital periods.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the requirement that the second planet's transit occurs within the same time frame as the first. Or perhaps it's about the time between transits of the first planet.

Wait, the first planet has a 3-day period. So it transits every 3 days. The second planet must have a period that allows its transits to also be seen, perhaps in a way that their transits don't overlap too much. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: For both transits and occultations to be observable, the planet must be in a position where it can move from in front of the star to behind it. But considering that, the orbital period doesn't directly limit that, as long as the planet's orbit is such that it can move around the star.

Wait, maybe it's about the maximum period before the planet's orbit is too large to show both events. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the timing of the events. For both events to be visible, the orbital period must be such that the planet transits and then occults within a certain time frame that's observable. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the second planet must have a period that is an integer multiple of the first planet's period. But that's not necessarily the case; planets can have any orbital periods as long as they are in stable orbits.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the question is really asking. It's asking for the maximum orbital period of the second planet such that both transit and occultation can be observed.

Wait, perhaps the maximum period occurs when the second planet's orbital period is such that its orbital distance is just enough to allow it to transit (so the impact parameter is such that it just grazes the star). But the impact parameter in the question is for the first planet, not the second.

Wait, the first planet's transit has an impact parameter of 0.2. So the second planet's impact parameter would be determined by its orbital distance and the star's radius. But how does that tie into the maximum period?

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the requirement that the second planet must also transit. So, perhaps the maximum period is when the planet's orbital distance is as large as possible while still allowing a transit.

Wait, that makes sense. For the second planet to transit, its orbital distance must be such that when it's in front of the star, it doesn't have an impact parameter that's too large. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is when the planet just touches the edge of the star's disk from our perspective. So, the impact parameter would then be equal to the star's radius minus the planet's radius, scaled by the star's radius.

Wait, more accurately, the condition for a transit to occur is that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that, during its orbit, it crosses the line of sight. The maximum impact parameter occurs when the planet just barely touches the star's disk. So, the impact parameter (b) must satisfy b = (a * sin i) / R_star, where 'a' is the semi-major axis, and 'i' is the inclination of the orbit (90 degrees for an edge-on orbit). Wait, but for maximum period, the planet must still be able to transit, so the impact parameter can't be too large. But in this case, the impact parameter is given for the first planet, but the question is about the second.

Wait, maybe I need to relate the orbital periods of the two planets. Let's think about Kepler's third law, which says that (P1^2)/(a1^3) = (P2^2)/(a2^3), assuming the same star mass.

Wait, but the star's mass is not given, so perhaps we can't use that directly. Alternatively, perhaps the star's radius is given, and the transiting conditions for the first and second planets can be related through their radii and the star's radius.

Wait, the first planet has a radius of R_p1 = 1 Earth radius. The second has R_p2 = 2.5 Earth radii. The star has R_star = 1.5 R_sun. But how does the planet's radius affect the transit? Well, the depth of the transit depends on the planet's size relative to the star, but for the planet to transit, the orbital distance must be such that the planet's path crosses the star's disk. So, the impact parameter for each planet is determined by their respective orbital distances and the star's radius.

So, for planet 1, the impact parameter is b1 = (a1 * sin i) / R_star. But since the orbit is edge-on, sin i is approximately 1. So, a1 = b1 * R_star.

Wait, but wait, the impact parameter is the distance in units of the star's radius from the center. So, if the planet's path is at a distance 'd' from the center, then d = b * R_star.

But 'a' is the semi-major axis, which is the distance from the star, so for a circular orbit, a = d / (1 - e), but e=0 here. So, a = d. So, a1 = b1 * R_star.

So, a1 = 0.2 * R_star.

Similarly, for planet 2 to transit, it must have a semi-major axis a2 such that during its orbit, the impact parameter is small enough for the transit to occur. The maximum possible period (i.e., largest a2) would correspond to the case where the planet's path just touches the edge of the star. So, for planet 2, the maximum a2 is when the planet's path is such that it just barely transits. That would be when the impact parameter is such that the planet just touches the star's disk.

Wait, the impact parameter for planet 2 would be when the planet's orbit is such that the path is closest to the star's edge. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure how to compute that.

Wait, perhaps the maximum a2 occurs when the planet's orbit is such that the planet's path just touches the star's limb. So, the impact parameter for planet 2 would be b2 = (R_star + R_p2) / (R_p2) ??? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the transit occurs when the planet's position is such that it passes in front of the star. The impact parameter is the distance from the star's center in units of the star's radius. So, if the planet's orbital path is such that it just grazes the star's disk, then the impact parameter would be b = (R_star - R_planet) / R_star. Because the planet's radius is R_p, so the distance from the center would need to be such that R_star - b*R_star >= R_p. So, b <= (R_star - R_p)/ R_star.

Wait, no. Let me think. If the planet's path is at a distance 'd' from the star's center (d = b * R_star), then for the planet to transit, the planet's radius must be larger than the distance from the star's edge to the path. Wait, that's not right. Think of it as the planet must pass within the star's disk for the transit to occur. So, the condition is that d + R_p <= R_star.

Wait, no. The planet's disk must overlap with the star's disk. So, the distance from the center (d) must be less than R_star + R_p.

Wait, no, that's not right. For a transit to occur, the planet's path must cross the star's disk. So, the planet's distance from the center (d) must be less than R_star + R_p? No, that can't be right because R_p is much smaller than R_star.

Wait, perhaps I should consider this more carefully. The planet must pass in front of the star, so the distance from the star's center (d) during transit must be such that the planet's disk overlaps with the star's disk. So, d + R_p >= R_star. Wait, no. Let's model it.

Imagine the star is a circle of radius R_s. The planet is a circle of radius R_p, moving along a path that is a distance d from the center. For the planet to transit, their disks must overlap. So, the distance between their centers (d) must be less than R_s + R_p. But that can't be right because R_s is much larger than R_p. Wait, wait, no, the condition is that the planet's path intersects the star's disk. So, the minimum distance from the star's center that allows a transit is when the planet's path is just touching the star's edge. So, d = R_s - R_p.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So, for a transit to occur, the planet's path must be within a distance d = R_s - R_p from the star's center. Therefore, the maximum impact parameter for a transit is b = (R_s - R_p) / R_s.

So, for planet 1, the impact parameter is given as 0.2. So, 0.2 = (R_s - R_p1) / R_s → 0.2 R_s = R_s - R_p1 → R_p1 = R_s (1 - 0.2) = 0.8 R_s.

But wait, planet 1's radius is 1 Earth radius. Let me compute that. R_p1 = 1 * R_earth.

Wait, R_s is 1.5 R_sun. R_sun is about 109.1 R_earth, so R_s = 1.5 * 109.1 R_earth ≈ 163.65 R_earth.

So, R_p1 = 0.8 * R_s → 0.8 * 163.65 R_earth ≈ 130.92 R_earth. But the actual R_p1 is 1 R_earth. That's a problem because 0.8 * R_s is about 130 R_earth, but planet 1's radius is only 1 R_earth. So, my previous assumption must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the impact parameter is given as 0.2, which is the distance in stellar radii, but the condition for transit is that the planet's radius must be larger than (d - R_s) or something. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternative approach: Think about the condition for a transit. The planet must pass in front of the star, so the distance from the star's center (d) must be less than the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius. Wait, no, that's not correct. The correct condition is that the planet's path must cross the star's disk. So, the distance d must be less than (R_s + R_p) — but that can't be, because R_p is much smaller than R_s. So, perhaps the correct condition is d < R_s - R_p, so that the planet's disk overlaps with the star's disk.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me visualize it. The planet's orbital path is a circle around the star. For a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star. So, the minimum distance from the star's center that allows a transit is when the planet's radius just touches the star's edge. That is, d = R_s - R_p.

So, the maximum impact parameter for a transit is b_max = (R_s - R_p) / R_s.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the planet's orbital distance a is such that the impact parameter is b = a * sin i / R_s. For an edge-on orbit, sin i = 1. So, a = b * R_s.

But for the maximum period, the planet's orbit is such that a is as large as possible, which would correspond to the maximum possible impact parameter where the planet still transits. So, a_max = (R_s - R_p) / R_s * R_s = R_s - R_p.

Wait, no. Because a is the semi-major axis, which is the distance from the star. So, a must be greater than R_s (since the planet orbits outside the star). So, I'm getting conflicting information here.

Wait, perhaps I need to use Kepler's third law in terms of the star's radius and the planets' orbital distances. But without knowing the star's mass, I can't compute the exact period. Hmm.

Wait, unless the first planet's period can help us find the star's mass. Let me try that. The first planet has a period P1 = 3 days and a semi-major axis a1. Using Kepler's third law, (P1^2) * (M_star + M_planet) / (M_sun) = (4 π² a1^3) / (G M_sun), but M_planet is negligible compared to M_star. So, P1² = (4 π² a1^3) / (G M_star).

But I don't know a1 directly. However, from the transit impact parameter, perhaps I can find a1.

Wait, the impact parameter for the first planet is 0.2. So, b1 = (a1 * sin i) / R_s. Since sin i is 1 (edge-on), a1 = b1 * R_s.

So, a1 = 0.2 * R_s.

We can plug this into Kepler's third law: P1² = (4 π² a1^3) / (G M_star).

But without knowing M_star, this equation can't be solved directly. Unless we can find M_star in terms of R_s and some other information.

Wait, since the star's radius is given as 1.5 R_sun, perhaps we can model it as a main-sequence star. Main-sequence stars have a mass-luminosity relation, but perhaps a rough approximation can be made. A star with radius 1.5 R_sun is likely more massive than the Sun but not by a huge amount. Let's say for the sake of approximation, the star's mass is similar to the Sun, but I'm not sure if that's valid.

If M_star ≈ M_sun, then P1² = (4 π² (a1)^3) / (G M_sun).

But a1 is 0.2 R_s, and R_s is 1.5 R_sun.

So, a1 = 0.2 * 1.5 R_sun = 0.3 R_sun.

So, a1 = 0.3 R_sun.

Plugging into Kepler's law: P1² = (4 π² (0.3 R_sun)^3) / (G M_sun).

We know that for Earth's orbit (a = 1 AU ≈ R_sun * 215), the orbital period is about 1 year. Let's compute the ratio of P1² to P_earth².

But wait, Earth's period is about 365 days. P1 is 3 days.

Wait, let me compute this properly. Let me express the Kepler's third law in terms of solar units.

In units where G, M_sun, and R_sun are used, the formula becomes:

P^2 (in years) = a^3 (in AU) / (M_star in solar masses).

But in this case, a is in solar radii, and P is in days.

Wait, perhaps it's better to convert a into AU. Since 1 AU is approximately 215 R_sun (since R_sun ≈ 7e5 km, 1 AU is about 1.5e8 km, so 1.5e8 /7e5 ≈ 214.28 R_sun).

So, a1 = 0.3 R_sun = 0.3 / 215 AU ≈ 0.001395 AU.

Then, using P^2 = a^3 / M_star, with M_star ≈ M_sun.

So, P^2 = (0.001395)^3 ≈ (2.71e-7) AU^3.

But P is in years: 3 days is 3/365 ≈ 0.00822 years.

So P^2 ≈ (0.00822)^2 ≈ 6.76e-5.

Comparing a^3 / M_star to P^2: 2.71e-7 / 1 ≈ 2.71e-7. But P^2 is 6.76e-5. These are not matching, which suggests that M_star is much larger than the Sun. Because 2.71e-7 ≈ 6.76e-5 implies that M_star ≈ (2.71e-7 / 6.76e-5) ≈ 0.004, which is way too small. So, something's wrong with this approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversions. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 1 AU is about 215 R_sun. So, 1 R_sun = 1/215 AU.

So, a1 = 0.3 R_sun = 0.3 * (1/215) AU ≈ 0.001395 AU.

Cube of a1: (0.001395)^3 ≈ 2.71e-9 AU^3.

Kepler's third law: P^2 = a^3 / M_star.

So, P1 is 3 days. Convert to years: 3 / 365 ≈ 0.008219 years.

P1^2 ≈ (0.008219)^2 ≈ 6.756e-5.

So, 6.756e-5 = (2.71e-9) / M_star → M_star ≈ 2.71e-9 / 6.756e-5 ≈ 4.01e-5 M_sun.

But that can't be right because a star with M ≈ 4e-5 M_sun is a brown dwarf or a very low-mass star, but the star's radius is given as 1.5 R_sun, which is much larger than the Sun's. So, this suggests that the star's mass must be much larger than the Sun's. Because with M = 4e-5 M_sun, the star would be much smaller in radius than the Sun, but here it's 1.5 R_sun. So, this approach is flawed.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't assume M_star is similar to the Sun. Then, how else can I find M_star? Without knowing it, I can't proceed with Kepler's law. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't require knowing the star's mass, and instead relies on a different approach.

Let me think again about the problem. The second planet must have a period P2 such that it can also transit and occult. The maximum period would be when the second planet's orbital period is as long as possible while still allowing it to transit the star.

The maximum a2 occurs when the second planet just barely transits the star. So, the impact parameter for the second planet would be b2 = (R_s - R_p2) / R_s.

Wait, but earlier I tried this and it didn't make sense. Let's try again.

Given R_s = 1.5 R_sun, R_p2 = 2.5 R_earth.

Compute R_s in Earth radii: R_sun ≈ 109.1 R_earth, so R_s = 1.5 * 109.1 ≈ 163.65 R_earth.

R_p2 = 2.5 R_earth.

So, (R_s - R_p2) = 163.65 - 2.5 = 161.15 R_earth.

So, b2 = (161.15 R_earth) / (163.65 R_earth) ≈ 0.984.

Wait, but that's the maximum impact parameter for a transit. Because if the impact parameter is larger than this, the planet's path doesn't intersect the star's disk, so no transit occurs.

So, for the second planet to transit, its impact parameter must be ≤ 0.984. But the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2, which is much smaller. So, in this case, the second planet's impact parameter is much larger than the first's. But does that affect anything?

Wait, but each planet's impact parameter depends on their own a and R_s. So, for the second planet to have maximum period, a2 is maximum when b2 is maximum, i.e., 0.984.

Then, a2 = b2 * R_s.

R_s is 1.5 R_sun. So, a2 = 0.984 * 1.5 R_sun ≈ 1.476 R_sun.

Wait, but that seems larger than the star's radius, which makes sense because the planet orbits outside the star.

Now, using Kepler's third law to find P2. Again, P² = (4 π² a³) / (G M_star).

But without M_star, I can't compute P2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can relate P1 and P2 using their a1 and a2.

From Kepler's law: (P1² / P2²) = (a1³ / a2³).

So, P2 = P1 * (a2/a1)^(3/2).

We have a1 = 0.2 R_s, a2 = 0.984 R_s.

So, a2/a1 = 0.984 / 0.2 = 4.92.

So, (a2/a1)^(3/2) = (4.92)^1.5 ≈ sqrt(4.92^3) ≈ sqrt(119.8) ≈ 10.95.

So, P2 = 3 days * 10.95 ≈ 32.85 days.

Looking at the options, option C is ~33.5 days, which is close to this value. So, the answer should be C.


To determine the maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows it to exhibit both transit and occultation events, we analyze the conditions for transit and use Kepler's third law to relate the orbital periods and semi-major axes of the two planets.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Transit Condition for the Second Planet**:  
   For a planet to transit, its orbital path must intersect the star's disk. The maximum impact parameter for a transit is given by:  
   \[
   b_{\text{max}} = \frac{R_s - R_p}{R_s}
   \]  
   where \(R_s\) is the star's radius and \(R_p\) is the planet's radius.  
   - The star's radius is \(R_s = 1.5 R_\odot\), and the second planet's radius is \(R_p = 2.5 R_\oplus\).  
   - Converting \(R_s\) to Earth radii:  
     \[
     R_s = 1.5 \times 109.1 R_\oplus \approx 163.65 R_\oplus
     \]  
   - Substituting into the formula for \(b_{\text{max}}\):  
     \[
     b_{\text{max}} = \frac{163.65 - 2.5}{163.65} \approx 0.984
     \]  
   This means the second planet's semi-major axis must satisfy:  
   \[
   a_2 = b_{\text{max}} \times R_s = 0.984 \times 1.5 R_\odot \approx 1.476 R_\odot
   \]

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:  
   Kepler's third law relates the orbital period \(P\) and semi-major axis \(a\) of a planet to the star's mass \(M_s\):  
   \[
   P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G M_s}
   \]  
   For simplicity, we assume the star's mass is close to the Sun's mass (\(M_s \approx M_\odot\)) and use the ratio of orbital periods and semi-major axes to find \(P_2\):  
   \[
   \frac{P_2^2}{P_1^2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^3
   \]  
   - The first planet's semi-major axis is derived from its transit impact parameter \(b_1 = 0.2\):  
     \[
     a_1 = b_1 \times R_s = 0.2 \times 1.5 R_\odot = 0.3 R_\odot
     \]  
   - The ratio of semi-major axes is:  
     \[
     \frac{a_2}{a_1} = \frac{1.476}{0.3} \approx 4.92
     \]  
   - Substituting into the period ratio:  
     \[
     \frac{P_2^2}{P_1^2} = (4.92)^3 \approx 119.8
     \]  
     \[
     P_2^2 = 119.8 \times P_1^2
     \]  
   - The first planet's orbital period is \(P_1 = 3 \, \text{days}\). Substituting:  
     \[
     P_2^2 = 119.8 \times 3^2 = 119.8 \times 9 \approx 1078.2
     \]  
     \[
     P_2 \approx \sqrt{1078.2} \approx 32.85 \, \text{days}
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:  
   The maximum orbital period of the second planet that allows it to transit and occult is approximately \(32.85 \, \text{days}\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(33.5 \, \text{days}\).
