Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the electrophilic substitution reactions of different benzene derivatives with excess bromine. Each substance is a benzene ring with a substituent, and we're supposed to find out the order of their para-isomer yields based on their weight fractions.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct the incoming electrophile to specific positionsâ€”either ortho, meta, or para relative to themselves. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, the reaction might be more or less favorable.

Wait, the question is about which position the substitution occurs. The para product's yield depends on the substituent's directing effects. If a substituent is a strong activating group, it would direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions, leading to more para product. But if it's a deactivating group, it might direct differently.

Wait, I think activating groups are electron-donating, which make the ring more reactive and direct incoming groups to ortho and para. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing, which make the ring less reactive, but depending on whether they are meta or para directors, the substitution occurs in different positions.

So for each substituent, I need to determine if it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta-directing.

Let's list the substituents from 1 to 6:

1) CH3 (methyl)
2) COOEt (ethoxy carbonyl)
3) Cl (chlorine)
4) NO2 (nitro)
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, no, substituents are:

1) C6H5-CH3 is toluene. So substituent is CH3, which is an activating, ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5 is benzoyl ethyl ester? Wait, the substituent is -COOEt. The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. Wait, COOR groups are meta directors because they are deactivating (due to the carbonyl's electron-withdrawing effect) but the ester group is an activating group? Wait, no, esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, but wait, the ester group has an oxygen, so maybe it's slightly activating? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta directors. Methoxy groups are activating and ortho/para directors. So, for the ester group, like OCOEt, the substituent is -O-CO-OEt? Wait no, the substituent is O-CO-OEt? No, the structure is C6H5-CO-OEt. So the substituent is -CO-OEt. Wait, the group is an ester, like ArCOOR. So the substituent is a carbonyloxy group attached to benzene.

Ester groups (like -COOR) are electron-withdrawing because the carbonyl is more electronegative. So they are deactivating. But are they meta or para directors? Wait, I think that esters are meta directors because they are electron-withdrawing groups. So substituent 2 is a meta director.

3) C6H5-Cl: substituent is Cl. Chlorine is a halogen. I think halogens are unique because they're deactivating (since they're more electronegative) but they are ortho/para directors because they can donate electrons through resonance (like inductively withdrawing but ortho/para directors). So Cl is a meta director? Wait, no, I remember that halogens are ortho/para directors. Because despite being electron-withdrawing through induction, they can donate electrons through resonance when the ring is activated
