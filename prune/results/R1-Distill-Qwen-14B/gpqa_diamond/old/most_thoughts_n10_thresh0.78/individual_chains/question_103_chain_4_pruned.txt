Okay, I need to figure out which sequence of reactions will give me 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Let me start by breaking down the target molecule.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has two substituents: a nitro group and a bromine, and there's a ketone (ethan-1-one) attached. Let me draw the structure in mind. The ketone is on one carbon, and the benzene is attached to it. On the benzene, the nitro is at position 5 and bromo at position 3 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, actually, let me clarify the numbering. Benzene is a ring, so the substituents are in specific positions. Since the ketone is at position 1, the benzene attached to it would have substituents at positions 3 and 5. So, the ketone is on the first carbon, and the benzene is connected to it. The benzene itself has a nitro group at position 3 and a bromine at position 5, or is it the other way around? Wait no, the substituents are on the benzene ring attached to the ketone. So, the benzene ring has a nitro group at position para to the ketone or meta? Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the order of substituents.

Wait, benzene has three substituents: the ketone (attached as a side chain), nitro, and bromo. Let's see: the ketone is at position 1, so the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the point of attachment. Oh wait, actually, the ketone is at position 1, which is connected to the benzene. So, the benzene ring has the nitro group at position 3 and bromine at position 5. Or wait, no, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Let me think: the benzene ring is attached to the ketone at position 1, and then the nitro is
