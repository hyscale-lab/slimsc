Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I need to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun with some spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, but it has dark spots covering 20% of one hemisphere. The effective temperature of the star is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. The astronomers are observing this star and seeing brightness variations because the spots rotate into and out of view. The question is comparing this situation to an exoplanet causing similar brightness variations. We need to find out what the radius of the planet would need to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm. So the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness caused by the planet transiting the star and compare it to the change caused by the spots. Wait, no, actually, the star's spots cause a dip in brightness as they rotate into view, but when the spots are on the far side, the star appears brighter because the spots are blocked. Wait, no, wait—when the star rotates, the spots come into view, making the star appear dimmer because the spots are cooler. So the brightness would dip periodically.

But wait, the problem says that the situation resembles an exoplanet. So when a planet transits the star, it blocks some light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of the dip depends on the area of the planet relative to the star. So the question is, what planet radius would cause the same amplitude as these spots?

I think I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (ΔF) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same ΔF.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The star's brightness dip due to the spots is because the spots are cooler and thus emit less light. When the spots are on the near side (facing us), the total light we receive is less. But when the star isn't spotted towards us, the brightness is higher. So the variation in brightness is due to the spots' presence in our line of sight.

Wait, but the problem says that the brightness variation is due to rotational
