Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem states that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. We're told the temperature is 25°C. The question is asking about the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in the solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are also provided: Ka1 is 7.5x10^-3, Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8, and Ka3 is 1.8x10^-12.

Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Orthophosphate (PO4^3-) is the deprotonated form, and I think it's the conjugate base of HPO4^2- which comes from the second dissociation step of H3PO4. So, the phosphate ion is formed when HPO4^2- loses another proton.

Wait, but when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, I think it might form a buffer solution. Right, because KH2PO4 is H2PO4^- when dissolved, and Na2HPO4 gives HPO4^2-. So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are adjacent species in the dissociation series of phosphoric acid. That usually means a buffer situation, where the pH is determined by the pKa of the relevant step.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, the orthophosphate. I'm a bit confused because I thought PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, and in most solutions, especially at neutral pH (since 25°C is around neutral), it's not the dominant species. Wait, the pKa values might give a clue.

Let me list the dissociation steps:

1. H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- ; Ka1 = 7.5e-3 → pKa1 ≈ 2.12
2. H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- ; Ka2 = 6.2e-8 → pKa2 ≈ 7.21
3. HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- ; Ka3 = 1.8e-12 → pKa3 ≈ 11.74

So, the first dissociation is around pH 2, the second around pH 7, and the third around pH 12. Since the solution is at 25°C, which is pH around 7, the predominant species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is asking about PO4^3- concentration. Since the solution is neutral, the third dissociation is not really happening much. So would PO4^3- even be present in significant amounts? Probably not, but the problem is asking, so I must consider it.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so maybe the pH is around pKa2 of 7.21, which is close to neutral. In that case, the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low because it's the third dissociation step, which requires a very high pH.

Wait, but let's think about how the solution is prepared. We have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me compute the moles of each.

First, for KH2PO4: molar mass is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.00734 mol. Since the volume is 0.2 L, concentration is 0.00734 / 0.2 ≈ 0.0367 M.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00g. Molar mass is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005605 mol. Concentration ≈ 0.005605 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028025 M.

Wait, but what are the species in solution from these salts?

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

These two are adjacent in the dissociation steps. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which is the second and third species (since H3PO4's first dissociation is H2PO4^-).

So using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]), where A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

Wait, in this case, HA is H2PO4^-
