Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question to solve. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR is mostly as expected, except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. They have similar shifts and equal integrals adding up to 1H. So, each peak must be about 0.5H, right? But wait, the integral is 1H together, so they're both from the same proton.

The question says it's the same alpha-proton, so maybe there's some splitting happening. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh wait, spin-spin coupling would mean they're next to each other, but here the peaks are duplicates without coupling as a reason. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then looking at the LC-MS, it shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, which is the expected. So same mass, same retention time? Or maybe same mass but different retention times? Wait, the question says LC-MS at elevated temperature. Oh, sometimes higher temps can cause some isomers to elute differently but same mass. But in this case, the peaks are clearly defined. So same mass, same m/z, but two separate peaks. That suggests maybe two different compounds with same mass, but that's not possible because the mass is same. Or perhaps they're constitutional isomers, but same mass? Hmm, but the question says the same mass spectrum, so same molecular formula.

Wait, same mass and same formula implies same compound. But why two peaks? Maybe they're enantiomers or diastereomers. Enantiomers would have same mass, same retention time in some cases, but maybe in chiral columns, they would split. But wait, LC-MS is based on the mass, so the same mass would elute together if the column can't separate them. Or perhaps the MS part is the same, but the LC is showing two because of a separation based on some
