Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere, the Boltzmann equation comes into play. Let me try to think through this.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, the Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right?

Wait, so the ratio of populations between two energy levels is given by that exponential term. In this case, the excited state is higher energy. Let's say the excited level is level 2 and the lower is level 1. So, the ratio (n2/n1) would be proportional to exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) ), where ΔE is E2 - E1.

Given that, for star_1, n2/n1 is 2, and for star_2, it's 1 (since star_1 is twice as excited). Or wait, no, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for star_1, the ratio is 2, and for star_2, perhaps it's 1, but that might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe star_2's ratio is 0.5, because star_1 is twice as excited as star_2. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read again.

"iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, for the same energy level, star_1 has twice the excitation compared to star_2. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, maybe it's about the excitation in a specific level. So, n_i is the number in a certain energy level. So, for star_1, n_i is twice that of star_2. But wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. So, the same ΔE for both stars.

Wait, actually, the energy difference is the same for both because it's the same transition in
