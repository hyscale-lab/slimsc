Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain point and time. The setup is that a point charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's this vector d which is the displacement from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity at the generation time tr is v. And the time t is greater than tr, which means we're looking at the field after the charge has passed that point.

I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields. The scalar potential V is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential A with the magnetic field. The potentials are functions of position and time, and they depend on the sources, which in this case is the moving charge.

Wait, in the case of a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward. It's V = q/(4πε₀ r), right? But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of the motion's effects, like current and magnetic fields.

Oh right, when the charge is moving, it's like a current element. The magnetic field due to a moving charge (current) would contribute to the vector potential. So the potentials aren't just the static solutions; they must account for the motion.

I think the general expressions involve both the charge's position and velocity. Maxwell's equations come into play here. The potentials are determined by the charge and current distributions.

Wait, the retarded time comes into play because the fields at a point depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time. So the scalar potential V would depend on the charge's position at tr, and the vector potential A would involve the velocity at that time.

Let me think about the exact forms. For a charge moving with velocity v, the scalar potential is still similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded position. So maybe V is q/(4πε₀ |r - d|), where d is the displacement vector from the origin to the charge's position at time tr. But wait, what's d in the problem statement? The vector d is from the field generating point to r. So r is the observation point, and d points from where the field was generated (charge's position at tr) to r. So the distance between the charge at tr and r is |r - (r - d)| = |d|, right? So the distance is |d|, so V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|).

Wait, but looking at the options, the denominators are expressions involving d and v. So maybe there's a correction due to the charge's velocity.

Wait, another thing comes to mind: when the charge is moving, the potentials might have terms that involve the velocity. So the vector potential A is proportional to the velocity v.

I remember that for a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀/(4π)) times (q v)/(c²) divided by the distance, or something like that. Because A is related to the current.

Wait, the current due to a moving charge is J = q v δ³(r - s(t)). So the vector potential A would come from integrating J over space, but since it's a point charge, it's a delta function.

The general expression for the vector potential due to a charge moving with velocity v is A = (μ₀/(4π c²)) (q v) / r, where r is the vector from the charge's position to the observation point. But in terms of the options given, perhaps r is equivalent to d in this context.

Wait, another approach: The potentials satisfy the wave equations and are functions of the retarded time. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) / |d|, but when the charge moves, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the velocity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what each option represents.

Option A says V is static, and A is v squared over c squared times V. Hmm, having v squared in A seems odd because A should be linear in velocity, I think.

Option B has V as static and A as v/(c²) times V. That seems plausible because A is usually proportional to velocity and V is 1/(4πε₀ r) terms.

Option C: V has qc in the numerator and denominator has (d c - d·v). Similarly for A, it's proportional to v times mu something. Hmm, maybe that's the right form when considering the motion.

Wait, maybe the potentials are Lorentz-invariant expressions. The scalar potential is static-like, but the vector potential adds a term due to motion.

Wait, I think the correct expressions involve the term (d · v) in the denominator. Because when the charge is moving, the displacement isn't just the spatial separation but also accounts for the movement over time.

The formula for the vector potential, I think, involves the velocity and the vector d.

Wait, from what I remember, the vector potential A for a moving charge is given by:

A = (μ₀ q)/(4π c²) (v / (r)) 

But r is the vector from the charge's position to the observation point, which is d. Wait, no, d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so the distance would be |d|.

Wait, the denominator in the options for V and A in option C and D have terms like (d c - d·v). Hmm, that looks like a Lorentz-invariant term, something like (ct - r)·(ct - r) = (ct)^2 - r^2, but scaled maybe.

Wait, another thought: The inverse of (d c - d · v) would appear in expressions involving the electromagnetic potentials when considering the motion of the charge. Because the denominator is (distance c multiplied by time delay) minus the dot product of displacement and velocity.

Wait, let's think in terms of the Liénard potentials. I'm vaguely recalling that when charges are moving, the potentials include terms that account for the charge's velocity and the time delay.

The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) / (|d| (1 - (v·d)/(c²|d|)) )

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the denominator is sqrt( (d c - (d · v))^2 + (v × d)^2 )? No, that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe it's the other way: when you have a moving charge, the expression for the potential involves the inverse of (d c - d·v), because the denominator comes from the dot product of (d - v (t - tr)), but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, considering the time it takes for the field to propagate, the charge's position at time tr is at some point, and the observation is at a later time, so the displacement must include the movement during that time.

Wait, another approach: The potential expressions are solutions to Maxwell's equations with the charge and current as sources. The scalar potential V is determined by Gauss's law, and the vector potential A by Ampère's law.

The current due to a moving charge is J = q v δ³(r - s(tr)), and the charge density is ρ = q δ³(r - s(tr)). But since we're considering potentials from a single charge, the expressions should come from integrating these, but since it's a point charge, it's more straightforward.

Wait, the scalar potential V is found by solving ∇²V = - (ρ/ε₀). For a point charge, that would be V(r,t) = (q/(4πε₀)) / |r - r'| where r' is the charge's position at the retarded time tr.

Wait, but the problem states that the vector d is from the field generating point to r. So the field generating point is at r' = r - d. Because d is the vector from r' to r. So r' = r - d. So the distance between the
