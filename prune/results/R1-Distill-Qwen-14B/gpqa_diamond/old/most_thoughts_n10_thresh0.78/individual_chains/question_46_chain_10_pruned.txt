Okay, so I have this question about Grubbs catalyst and the products formed from racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my organometallic reactions, but let's try to work through this.

Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis, right? Metathesis means breaking and reforming of double bonds. So when a diene or an alkene reacts with Grubbs, it can undergo ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis, depending on the structure.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Racemic implies it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers. But wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene has a double bond at position 1. Let me draw its structure. The formula would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the positions. No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch on the third carbon. So it's CH₂=CHCH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂? Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Pent has five carbons. 1-ene is double bond between C1 and C2. So structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, let me think again. The formula for 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, that can't be because pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl on the third carbon. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, that's four carbons. Oh wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me line it up:

Carbon 1: CH₂-
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)-
Carbon 4: CH₂-
Carbon 5: CH3?

Wait, maybe it's CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that would be 5 carbons, but that's pent. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=
