Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I'll have to calculate both values.

First, let's tackle the initial dilution. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. The formula for dilution is M1V1 = M2V2. Here, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³, and V2 is 40 cm³ because we added 20 cm³ of water. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, so when we dilute it, it dissociates more. But for the initial pH calculation, maybe I can just use the diluted concentration for now. Although when titrated, the solution will change.

Now, the titration with NaOH. NaOH is a strong base, so it will react with acetic acid in a neutralization reaction. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the equivalence point is where moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the initial moles of acetic acid. Volume is 40 cm³ (since 20+20) and concentration is 0.025 M, so moles = 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Or wait, wait a second. Wait, the initial solution before adding water was 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, so moles before dilution are 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. When you dilute, the moles stay the same. So yes, 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

At equivalence point, moles of NaOH added will be 0.001, because it's a 1:1 reaction. The volume of NaOH needed would be moles divided by concentration. So 0.001 moles / 0.1 M = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. But wait, the question doesn't directly ask about the volume; it's about pH at 25% titration and equivalence point.

Wait, 25% titration means 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH. So 25% of 0.001 moles is 0.00025 moles of NaOH added.
