Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass, and the glass is moving too. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, wait, same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, that's a bit confusing. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer. Or is the light moving in the same direction as the glass? Let me clarify. Oh right, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam is going towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them at velocity v.

The question is: what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer? And the options are A to D. The speed of light in vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, when light travels through a medium, its speed is c/n, where n is the refractive index. So in the glass, the speed is v_light = c/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass, right? Because the glass is moving, I think we need to consider how the glass's motion affects the observed speed of light in it.

Wait, maybe this is a case where we need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because the glass is moving, and light's speed in the glass would be measured differently in the lab frame.

Right, in special relativity, when you have two frames moving relative to each other, the velocities don't just add linearly. The formula is (u + v) / (1 + (u*v)/cÂ²), where u is the velocity in the moving frame and v is the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The speed of light in the glass's rest frame is c/n. So in the lab frame, which is moving at velocity v relative to the glass, we need to find the speed of the light beam.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving at v towards the observer. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is
