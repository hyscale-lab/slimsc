Okay, so I've got this question about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question mentions that the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix given by c multiplied by S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π) right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So putting that together, Ay would be (c * 0, c*(-i)) in the first row and (c*i, c*0) in the second row.

Wait, let me write that out. So S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So when multiplied by c = h/(4π), Ay becomes:
[ 0   -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))   0 ]

Wait, no, actually, each element of S is multiplied by c, so Ay is c multiplied by S. So yeah, the matrix is:

Row 1: 0 and (-i c)
Row 2: (i c) and 0.

So the matrix Ay looks like:
[ 0       -i c ]
[ i c     0   ]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Let's think about the eigenvalues. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ.

For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So let's compute the determinant:

| -a      -i c    |
| i c     -a     |

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, what's (-i c)(i c)? Let's compute that. Multiply -i * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) =1. So it's (1) * c * c = c². So the determinant is a² - c² = 0.

Wait, no, because the determinant is (a^2) - ( (-i c) * (i c) ) = a² - ( (-i)(i) c² ). Since (-i)*(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So determinant is a² - (c²) =0. So a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but the options are talking about 'a' as the eigenvalue. Let's look at the options.

Option A says the imaginary part of eigenvalues are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). But wait, our eigenvalues are real. Because a is ±c, and c is real. So the eigenvalues are real numbers, not complex. Because c is a real constant (h is Planck's constant, so real). So any eigenvalues should be real.

Hmm, looking back, the matrix
