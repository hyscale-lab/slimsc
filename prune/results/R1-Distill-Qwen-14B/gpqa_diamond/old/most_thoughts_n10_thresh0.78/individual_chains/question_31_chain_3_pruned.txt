Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions and determining molecular symmetry. Let's break it down step by step.

The problem says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to make product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. The question is about the molecular symmetry of product 3.

Hmm, I remember that nitric acid and sulfuric acid are typically involved in nitration reactions. Toluene undergoes nitration, so product 1 is likely nitrotoluene. But wait, where does the nitro group attach? Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. The nitro group is a meta-directing group, right? So when nitration occurs, the nitro group would add to the meta position relative to the methyl group. Wait, no, wait. Toluene's methyl is an activating group, which directs incoming substituents to the ortho and para positions. Oh right, nitration is a meta direction for the next substitution if there are multiple substituents, but in the first nitration, the methyl directs where the nitro goes.

Wait, no. Wait, when you nitrate toluene, the methyl group is an ortho/para director. So the nitro group will attach in either the ortho or para position relative to the methyl group. So product 1 is probably para-nitrotoluene, which is more stable because of the para position's symmetry. Or maybe meta? Wait, no, nitration of toluene gives a nitro group in the para position as the major product because it's more stable than ortho. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Next step, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent. For nitrotoluene derivatives, I think MnO2 would typically oxidize the methyl group. Para-nitrotoluene has a methyl attached to the benzene ring, and under oxidation, the methyl can be oxidized. The oxidation of a methyl group adjacent to a nitro group usually leads to a
