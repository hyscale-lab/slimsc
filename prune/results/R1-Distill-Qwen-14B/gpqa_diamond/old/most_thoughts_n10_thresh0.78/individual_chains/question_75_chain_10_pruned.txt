Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, I'm a bit new to molecular biology, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. The researcher inserted a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus of the GADD45G protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and are selecting colonies, but they can't overexpress the protein. They're trying to figure out why.

The construct's plus strand sequence is given. I need to analyze this sequence to find the issue. The options suggest possible reasons like a mutation in the HA tag, early termination, proteolysis due to a missing linker, or a missing tRNA for UAA.

First, I should look at the sequence to see if there's a stop codon or any issues with the reading frame. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the sequence starts with the HA coding region followed by GADD45G.

Looking at the sequence, let's find the start and see where it might end.

The HA tag is a short peptide, usually around 11 amino acids, but the coding sequence is important. The HA tag is often added as a epitope for detection, so its sequence would be something like YPYDVPDYA, but the DNA sequence would be the coding strand for that.

Wait, but the construct starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So the HA tag is right after that. Let me look at the beginning:

The sequence starts with 5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA TCC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC ACA GCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCC TCA CTC CGG CGG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ... etc.

Wait, I'm seeing the start codon ATG at the very beginning. So the HA tag starts right after that.

Wait, but the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. So the HA sequence is part of the coding sequence for the protein.

I should check if there's any in-frame stop codon in the HA region or elsewhere.

But looking at the initial part:

The first few codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), CCC (Pro), ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), ATG (start), etc.

Wait, but hold on. The presence of an ATG (start codon) in the middle would signal another start, but since the ribosome scans for the first start codon, maybe that's not the issue. But the HA coding sequence might have a stop codon.

Wait, the HA tag is usually a short peptide, so the coding sequence is probably a short stretch. Let me see: 'YPYDVPDYA' is the HA epitope, so the DNA coding sequence would be TAC TAT CCC TAT CGA TGT TCA GAA TTA CGC CAA ATG... Hmm, I think the initial part of the given sequence matches that.

Wait, the first codons after ATG are TAC (Tyr), then CCC (Pro), ATA (Ile), CGA (Arg), TGT (Cys), TCC (Ser), AGA (Arg), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), CAA (Gln), ATG (start again?), which may not be intended.

Wait, that's a problem. The ATG after CAA would be another start codon, which might cause the ribosome to restart, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's coding sequence is longer. Or perhaps the HA tag isn't correctly included, leading to a frame-shift.

Wait, but in the given sequence, the HA
