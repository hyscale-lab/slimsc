Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but let's take it slow.

The problem states that we have an electron in a state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, first off, I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So these are the standard basis states for spin-½ systems, right? So |up> is (1,0) and |down> is (0,1) in vector terms.

But the state isn't normalized yet, it's just proportional. So I need to find the normalization factor. The state is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, which I can write as a vector [1+i, 2-i]^T. The norm squared is the sum of the absolute squares of each component.

Calculating that: |1+i|² is (1² + 1²) = 2. |2-i|² is (2² + (-1)²) = 4 +1 =5. So the sum is 2+5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7))*(1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>.

Next part: the operator has a matrix representation where Aij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, this would look like:
[0   hbar/2]
[hbar/2  0 ]

Wait, that's not right. Because the operator is 2x2, so the diagonal elements are 0, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Oh wait, no, wait. The way it's written, Aij is hbar/2 when i != j, else 0. So the matrix is [[0, A12], [A21, 0]], with A12 = A21 = hbar/2.

So this operator is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix, I think. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0 1],[1 0]]. So this operator is (hbar/2) * σ_x. Or wait, maybe it's (hbar/2) times the Pauli sigma x.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are usually defined as having 1s in off-diagonal. So yeah, this operator is indeed (hbar/2) times σ_x. That's a key point because knowing the eigenstates and eigenvalues of σ_x might help.

Wait, but the question is to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σ_x, right? Because A is proportional to σ_x.

So the eigenstates of σ_x are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), but wait, wait. Let me think again. The eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for these states.

But wait, let me double-check. The Pauli X matrix σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and the corresponding eigenvectors are |+x> and |−x>, which are (1,1)/sqrt(2) and (1,-1)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x, which would have eigenvalues (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1). So the eigenvalues of A are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the problem is to find the probability of measuring each of these eigenvalues when we measure the operator A on the state |alpha>.

Wait, but wait. The state |alpha> is in the z basis, and the operator A is in the sigma x basis. So we can either express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, or find the expectation value and probabilities accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value and the probabilities by working with the states.

So, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7). So, to find the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue of A, we need to project |alpha> onto each eigenstate of A.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, perhaps we can find the expectation value and the probabilities using the expectation value formula.

But first, let's approach the probabilities. The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue λ is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenstate in |alpha>.

So, let me define the eigenstates of A as |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of σ_x. So, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the state |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> all over sqrt(7). So, we need to write this in terms of |+x> and |-x>.

Let me compute the components:

Let me write |alpha> = c_{+x} |+x> + c_{-x} |-x>.

So, substituting |+x> and |-x>:

|alpha> = [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ] * c_{+x} + [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ) ] * c_{-x}.

So, let's group the terms:

= [ (c_{+x} + c_{-x})/sqrt(2) ) ] |up> + [ (c_{+x} - c_{-x})/sqrt(2) ) ] |down>

But |alpha> is also [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7).

So, equating coefficients:

( c_{+x} + c_{-x} ) / sqrt(2) = (1+i)/sqrt(7)

( c_{+x} - c_{-x} ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

So, we have a system of two equations:

1) (c_{+x} + c_{-x}) = (1+i) / sqrt(2) * sqrt(7) ?

Wait, wait. Let me correct. Because the right side is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so:

( c_{+x} + c_{-x} ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i) / sqrt(7)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

c_{+x} + c_{-x} = (1 + i) * sqrt(2) / sqrt(7) = (1+i) * sqrt(2/7)

Similarly, second equation:

( c_{+x} - c_{-x} ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(2):

c_{+x} - c_{-x} = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

So now, we have:

Equation 1: c_{+x} + c_{-x} = (1 + i) * sqrt(2/7)

Equation 2: c_{+x} - c_{-x} = (2 - i) * sqrt(2/7)

We can solve for c_{+x} and c_{-x}.

Let me add these two equations:

Adding equation 1 and 2:

2 c_{+x} = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)

Simplify numerator:

(1 + i + 2 - i) = 3

So,

2 c_{+x} = 3 * sqrt(2/7)

=> c_{+x} = (3/2) * sqrt(2/7) = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

Equation 1 minus equation 2:

2 c_{-x} = [ (1 + i) - (2 -i) ] * sqrt(2/7)

Compute numerator:

(1 + i - 2 + i ) = (-1 + 2i )

So,

2 c_{-x} = (-1 + 2i) * sqrt(2/7)

=> c_{-x} = [ (-1 + 2i ) * sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7) )

So now, the probability of measuring +x is |c_{+x}|², and similarly for -x.

Compute |c_{+x}|²:

c_{+x} = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

So, |c_{+x}|² = (9 * 2) / (4 *7) ) = 18/(28) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857...

Similarly, |c_{-x}|² is | (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) / (2 sqrt(7)) |^2.

Compute the numerator: sqrt(2) * | -1 +2i | = sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 +4) )= sqrt(2)*sqrt(5). So squared is 2*5=10.

Denominator: (2 sqrt(7))² =4*7=28.

So |c_{-x}|² =10/(28) =5/14 ≈0.357142...

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is about 0.357
