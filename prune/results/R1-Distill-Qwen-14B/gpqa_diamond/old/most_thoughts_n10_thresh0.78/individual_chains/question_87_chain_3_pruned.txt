Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. So the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Wait, 6-membered aromatic ring so that's a benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene. Total of 8 carbons in the molecule. The benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. So each substituent probably has one carbon each, or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? Wait, no, because di-substituted implies two substituents, each attached to the ring. So each substituent must be a group with one or more carbons, but the total is 2 substituents adding up to 2 carbons.

Wait, the benzene has 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 more, so all together 8. So each substituent probably has one carbon each, because 6 + 2 =8. So each substituent is a single carbon group.

Wait, but the substituents can't be too big because that would exceed the 8. Alternatively, maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none, but that would make it mono-substituted, not di. Oh wait, no, di-substituted just means two substituents, each attached to different positions on the ring. So each substituent is, for example, a methyl group? Or maybe something else.

But wait, the FTIR shows a carbony
