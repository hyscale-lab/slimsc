Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky varies with distance. They observed that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. The options are A to D, each with different exponents.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1 / r, where r is in parsecs. Wait, wait, actually, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So if the distance r increases, the parallax decreases. So plx is inversely proportional to r. So plx = 1/r, or r = 1/plx.

The number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So substituting r into that, since plx is 1/r, 1/plx^5 would be 1/( (1/r)^5 ) which is r^5. Because 1/(1/r)^5 is r^5. So the number of stars N is proportional to r^5. That suggests that as the distance r increases, the number of stars in that region increases with the fifth power of r.

Wait, but the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, that's the differential. So it's about the number of stars per unit distance (like how many more stars you get when you move a little further away). So maybe I need to think about the derivative here.

Let me think. If the number of stars N is proportional to r^5, then the rate of change of N with respect to r, dN/dr, would be 5*r^4. Because dN/dr = d(r^5)/dr =5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases with r^4. So the answer would be proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C is r^4. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Another way to approach this: if N ∝ 1/plx^5, and since plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars up to a distance r is proportional to r^5. But when the question says 'per unit range of distance', that implies the derivative, the slope, which is dN/dr. So yes, that's 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as r^4. So option C is correct.


The question involves determining how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance, given that the number of stars varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Parallax (\(\text{plx}\)) is inversely proportional to distance (\(r\)), such that \(\text{plx} = \frac{1}{r}\). Substituting this into the given relationship, the number of stars becomes \( N \propto r^5 \).

The question specifically asks about the change in the number of stars per unit range of distance, which corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \). Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4 \). This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
