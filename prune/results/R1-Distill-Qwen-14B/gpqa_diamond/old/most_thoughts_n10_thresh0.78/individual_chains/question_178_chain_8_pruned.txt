Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my QFT, but let me think through this.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu], right? So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices.

I remember that in QFT, each term in the Lagrangian has to have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units. So each term's dimension should be 4.

So, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. Let's break down the dimensions of each part of the term.

First, ψ is a spinor. The mass dimension of a Dirac spinor ψ is 3/2, right? Because in 4 spacetime dimensions, fields have dimensions based on their degree of freedom. For a scalar field φ, it's 1. For a vector field A_mu, it's 2. Spinor ψ is 3/2.

So, ψ̄ is the adjoint, which has the same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

σ_{mu nu} is made from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices themselves are dimensionless, I think. Because they're just matrices, like the Pauli matrices. So the commutator [γ_mu, γ_nu] is also dimensionless. Thus, σ_{mu nu} has dimension 0.

Now, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. Each derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So each term in F has dimension [∂][A], so since A has dimension 1, [∂][A] is 1*1 = 1. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, but F^{mu nu} is a tensor, and in the Lagrangian term, it's being used as part of the term. So in the term, we have ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ multiplied by F^{mu nu}.

Wait, actually, the term is ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}. So let's figure out the dimensions.

So, each ψ̄ and ψ contributes 3/2 each. So ψ̄ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

σ_{mu nu} is dimensionless, so that doesn't add anything. So ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ is dimension 3.

Then, F^{mu nu} is dimension 2. So the entire term is 3 + 2 = 5? Wait, but the Lagrangian term needs to have dimension 4. Because when you integrate the Lagrangian density over spacetime, the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions, so each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, no, that's right. The integral ∫ d^4x L must be dimensionless. So each L must have dimension 4.

But the term here is L_int = κ times ψ̄ σ F. So L_int has dimension 4.

So let's compute the dimensions of each part.

κ has some mass dimension [κ]. The other part is ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let me compute that.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ has 3/2, so together that's 3. σ is dimensionless, so that remains 3. Then F has dimension 2.

So ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 = 5. So the term κ multiplied
