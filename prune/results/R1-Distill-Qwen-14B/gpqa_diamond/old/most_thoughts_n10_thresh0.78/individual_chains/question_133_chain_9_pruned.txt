Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts here. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: We have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, so I might not need to worry about temperature effects beyond standard conditions. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm. Right, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the conjugate base after H3PO4 has lost three protons. But wait, in solution, phosphate exists in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons, each with its own Ka.

Now, the solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it should dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate (but the formula might have two sodiums and a dihydrate). Wait, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the question is about PO4^3- concentration. So, how do we get PO4^3- from these salts? I think that PO4^3- is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-, which in turn is the deprotonated form of H2PO4^-.

But wait a second, in solution, the phosphate species can shift based on the pH. So the solution is a buffer system here, involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But how does that relate to PO4^3-?

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Let me consider that H3PO4 is a weak acid, so in solution, it can lose protons step by step. The first dissociation is H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1). The second is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2). The third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3).

So, each
