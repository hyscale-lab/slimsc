Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets compare. Both planets are around stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a mass similar to Neptune. So their masses are about the same, I think.

The question gives me the shift in the spectral lines for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstroms. I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit.

Wait, the formula I think is related to the velocity semi-amplitude, K. The formula for K is K = (v * sin i), but wait, for circular orbits, sin i is 1, so K = v. The velocity of the star is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass of the planet. But wait, no, actually, the formula I remember is the one that relates the velocity semi-amplitude to the planet's mass and the orbital period.

The formula is something like K = [ (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ] * (1/(P * (1/(2π))^(1/3))) ), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, I think the RV velocity amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the mass of the star.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for the RV method which relates the semi-amplitude K to the mass of the planet and the star's velocity. The formula is K = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet / (M_star)^(2/3)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Wait, another approach. The RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the mass of the planet and the planet's orbital period. Since both stars have the same mass (like the Sun) and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), their mass ratio M_planet / M_star is the same. So the mass terms in the formula for K would be the same for both planets.

So the velocity semi-amplitude K is proportional to (P)^(−1/3). Because in the formula, K is proportional to (P)^(-1/3). Let me think. Because velocity is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius, but using Kepler's third law, radius is proportional to (P^2 * M_star)^(1/3). So radius R = ( (G M_star P^2 )/(4 π²) )^(1/3 )

So velocity v = 2 π R / P. Substituting R gives v = 2 π ( ( G M_star P^2 )^(1/3 ) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) / P.

Wait, maybe I should just recall the formula for the RV semi-amplitude. The formula is K = (v) = [ (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M
