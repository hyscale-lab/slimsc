Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think about it step by step. 

The system consists of three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor, which is exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). 

Wait, right, the Boltzmann factor for each state is e^(-βE). So I need to calculate E for every possible combination of S1, S2, S3 and then sum e^(-βE) for all those states.

Each spin has two possible states, so there are 2^3 = 8 total states. Let's list them all. But maybe there's a smarter way. The energy depends on the products of the spins. Maybe group states by their total energy.

Let me think about the terms in E. The energy is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote each term: S_i S_j. Each term is +1 or -1, right? Because each S is ±1, their product is also ±1. So each of the three terms in the sum can be either +1 or -1.

Wait, so the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be... Let me compute that for all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3. Alternatively, maybe I can find how many states lead to each possible value of the sum.

Alternatively, maybe find the number of states with each possible value of the sum (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3) and multiply by the Boltzmann factor for that sum.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible values of the sum. Let me compute possible values.

Each term S_i S_j can be 1 or -1. So the sum can range from -3 (if all terms are -1) to +3 (if all terms are +1), but perhaps not all those in between are possible. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3. Wait, let me check.

Wait, for example, if all three terms are 1: sum is 3. If two are 1 and one is -1: sum is 1. If one is 1 and two are -1: sum is -1. If all three are -1: sum is -3. Hmm, so the possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3. So the energies would be E = -J * (sum), which becomes E = -J * s, where s is 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, so E can be -3J, -J, J, 3J. Hmm, let me see. So for each possible s value, how many states have that sum?

Let me think: for each state, the sum s = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. 

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the number of states for each s.

Let me calculate all possible states and their s.

Each spin is +1 or -1. There are 8 states. Let me enumerate them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
s = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 +1 +1 =3. So E = -J*3 = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
s = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 =-1. E = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
s = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
s = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1. E= J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
s = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 =-1. E= J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
s = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
s = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) =1 -1 -1 =-1. E= J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
s = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) =1 +1 +1=3. E=-3J.

Wait, so looking at these 8 states:

- States 1 and 8 have s=3, so E=-3J each. That's 2 states.

- The other 6 states have s=-1. So E= J each. So 6 states.

Wait, wait a second, no. Wait, for state 2: s=-1, E= J.

Wait, no: E = -J * s. So if s is 3, E is -3J. If s is -1, E is J. Because E = -J * s.

Yes, so E is J for s=-1,
