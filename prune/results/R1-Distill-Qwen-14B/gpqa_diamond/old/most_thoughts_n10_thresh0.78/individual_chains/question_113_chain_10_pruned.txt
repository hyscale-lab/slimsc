Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says that the compound was characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹, which I remember is usually indicative of O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is probably a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or something like that. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ring, or perhaps an amide, but since the options don't have nitrogen, maybe it's something else. 

Looking at the 1H NMR, it mentions several peaks including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound probably has a double bond. 

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what would give that. Common fragments at 45 could be from certain groups. For example, (CH3)2CHO- is 45, but wait, (CH3)2CHO is 45? Let me calculate: (CH3)2CHO has a molecular weight of 12*(2+1+1) + 1*(6 + 0) = no, wait, (CH3)2CHO is actually (CH3)2CHO⁻, which is C3H7O⁻. The molecular weight of that would be 3*12 +7*1 +16 = 36+7+16=59. Hmm, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene or something else. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH3COO⁻, which is 60, but that's not matching. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be from a CH2=CH group. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3CH2CHO fragment? No, that's 58. Wait, perhaps the fragment is a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, the peak is at 45, so maybe it's a CH3CO+ ion? Let me compute: CH3CO+ would be (12*2)+(1*3) + 16? Wait, no, CH3CO+ is C2H3O+, which is 2*12 +3 +16=43. Oh, that's not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the molecular weight would be around 102, 106, 122, or 126. Let me calculate each:

- C6H12O: 6*12 +12 +16 =72+12+16=100
- C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=98
- C6H10O2: 72 +10 +32=114
- C6H12O2:72+12+32=116

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45. So the molecular ion (M+) would be one of these options. If the M+ is, say, 100 (C6H12O), then a fragment losing 55 might give 45. Alternatively, maybe it's a smaller fragment.

Wait, what about the IR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ could be an -OH group. So the compound is either an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid, but carboxylic acid O-H is usually broader and around 2500-3300. The other peaks: 1700 and 1650. If there's a carbonyl, like a ketone (around 1700), and another peak at 1650, which could be conjugated double bonds or maybe an ester. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl groups.

The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so there's a double bond somewhere. And the presence of O suggests either an alcohol, ester, ketone, etc.

Putting it together: maybe the compound has both an -OH group and a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester. So the formula could have two oxygen atoms. Let's look at the options: options A and C have two oxygens.

Option A: C6H12O2. Molecular weight 116.

Option C: C6H10O2. Molecular weight 114.

What about the mass spec fragment at 45. Let's think: for C6H12O2, if the molecular ion is 116, a fragment breaking off could be 116-45=71. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the 45 comes from a specific part of the molecule.

Wait, another approach: maybe the fragment is from a common group. For example, if the molecule has a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like in an ester. The ester group O-CO-O-R. Wait, but the fragment might come from a different part.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak at 45 is from a CH3CH2CO+ group? No, that's 59. Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a CH2CO fragment. CH2CO is 44, but that's not 45. Wait, maybe COCH3? That would be 43 (12+16+12+3=43). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is from a ketone. Like, if the molecule has a (CH3)2CO group. The molecular weight of (CH3)2CO is 58. But the fragment is 45. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The presence of a carbonyl group (1700 cm⁻¹) and another peak (1650) could indicate conjugation. So perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl acetate or something similar. Wait, but phenyl groups would have their own NMR signals, but the question mentions vinyl hydrogens, so perhaps it's a vinyl ester or something with a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone, but that might not necessarily have a vinyl group.

Another thought: the IR peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the molecule has an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1740-1700, but sometimes lower if conjugated. The 1650 could be from conjugation, like a conjugated carbonyl or a double bond. So perhaps the molecule has both an ester group and a double bond.

If the compound is an ester, the formula would have more oxygens. Let's see: an ester is R-O-CO-O-R? No, wait, an ester is R-O-CO-R. So the formula would be something like CxHyO2. For example, ethyl acetate is C4H8O2.

So looking at the options, options A and C have two oxygens. So the formula is either C6H12O2 or C6H10O2.

The molecular ion would be either 116 or 114. So the mass spec fragment at 45 could be a part of the molecule. Let's think about 45. 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2CHO- (which is 45: 12*2 + 3*1 + 12 + 16 = 24+3+12+16=55? Wait, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let's compute (CH3)2CHO: C3H5O. Molecular weight: 3*12=36, 5*1=5, 16=16. Total is 36+5+16=57. Hmm, not 45. So that's not it.

Wait another approach: 45 can be CH3CH2CHO (propanal?), but that would be 58. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from a ketone group, like (CH3)CO+. Let me see: (CH3)CO is 43. So that's why I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, 45 could be the molecular ion of another compound. Wait, what's the molecular weight of acetone? It's (CH3)2CO, which is 58. Hmm, maybe the fragment comes from a different group.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a benzene ring. Wait, but the options don't have benzene rings necessarily. Let's think about another angle.

The FTIR has a broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. That's consistent with an -OH group. So the compound could be an alcohol. But then, the peaks at 1700 and 1650 suggest a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a ketone alcohol? Wait, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, as I thought before.

Wait, another possibility: the compound is a carboxylic acid. The broad peak would be the O-H stretch of the acid. The 1700 would be the carbonyl, and 1650 maybe an overtone or something else. But then the molecular formula would have two oxygens. Wait, a carboxylic acid has the formula RCOOH, which is CnH2nO2. So for n=6, it'd be C6H12O2. That's option A. But wait, would that fit the other data?

Looking at the NMR: presence of vinyl hydrogens. So the molecule must have a double bond. A carboxylic acid with a double bond somewhere. Like, say, hexenoic acid. But would that fit the mass spec?

Wait, the mass spec in such a case would show a fragment at m/z 45. For example, if the acid is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. Then, perhaps the fragment could be CH2=CHCH2+ or something else. Wait, but 45 is a small fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's the carbonyl group breaking off
