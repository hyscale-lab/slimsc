Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are four different chemical formulas, all with six carbons and varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

First, I'll break down each piece of information given and see what they tell me.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The first peak is a very broad absorption at around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks around that region usually indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, a very broad peak might suggest a hydrogen bond, which is more typical of something like a carboxylic acid. But wait, sometimes alcohols also show broad peaks, but maybe if it's a strong acid, like a carboxylic acid, the peak is broader and maybe even more intense.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. The 1700 region is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in a conjugated carbonyl or an aromatic ketone. Wait, but if there's a carbonyl, then the compound likely has an O in it. So that fits with the options given, which have O in them.

Looking at the NMR data: several peaks including vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests the compound has a double bond somewhere, maybe part of a ring or a substituent. So the molecule probably has an alkene group.

The Mass Spec part: a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, I should think about what fragments give this mass. 45 is a common mass. Let me think, the molecular ion (M+) is often broken down into smaller fragments. So 45 could be a fragment like a methyl group attached to something else... Wait, wait, 45 is the molecular weight of CH3COOH (which is 60, no, wait, wait
