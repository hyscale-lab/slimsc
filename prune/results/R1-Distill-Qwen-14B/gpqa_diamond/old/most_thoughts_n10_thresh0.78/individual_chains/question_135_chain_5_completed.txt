Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let's see.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, that's a bit confusing. Oh right, that's the interaction Lagrangian, right? So the boson X is interacting with fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and we need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

So, bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if the mass of the boson is greater than twice the mass of the fermion. Because energy and momentum conservation require that the mass of the boson is at least twice the mass of the particles it's decaying into. So, for each possible fermion pair, I need to check if X's mass is more than twice that fermion's mass.

Wait, what fermions are we considering here? The problem includes things like quarks (like u, d, s, c, b, t), and leptons (e, mu, tau). But each of these has different masses.

So first, I think I should list the masses of all the possible fermions.

Quarks:
- up (u): around 2.2 MeV (so 0.0022 GeV)
- down (d): similar to u, about 3.5 MeV (0.0035 GeV)
- strange (s): about 95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- charm (c): around 1.5 GeV
- bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV
- top (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV, but that's way above 6 GeV.

Leptons:
- electron (e-): 0.000511 GeV
- muon (mu-): ~0.105 GeV
- tau (tau-): ~1.78 GeV
- neutrinos are massless (for most practical purposes, like in decays, since their mass is negligible compared to others here).

Wait, but in the decay X→ff-bar, the fermion must have mass less than X/2. Because E is at least 2m_f (if the fermions are at rest), so m_X must be ≥ 2m_f.

So for each fermion f, check if 2m_f ≤ m_X. X is 6 GeV, so 2m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So which fermions have mass ≤3 GeV?

Let's see:

u: 0.0022 GeV → yes
d: 0.0035 → yes
s: 0.095 → yes
c: 1.5 → yes
b: 4.5 → 4.5 >3 → no
t: 173→ way too big, no

Leptons:

e: 0.0005 → yes
mu: 0.105 → yes
tau: 1.78 → yes

So allowed fermions would be u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

Wait, but the question is about which decay channels are allowed. So the decay X→ff-bar is allowed if f has mass ≤3 GeV. So the possible pairs are:

u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: X→ b b-bar, s s-bar, u u, d d, tau, e+ e-.

But wait, b is 4.5 GeV, so 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So b can't be decay product. So option A is incorrect because it includes b.

Option B: c c-bar, s, u, d, tau, mu, e.

Yes, because c's mass is 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV ≤6 GeV. So c is allowed. So B includes c, which is fine.

Option C includes t t-bar, which is impossible because t is too heavy. So C is out.

Option D: includes b and tau, mu, e, u, d, s.

Wait, D includes b, but b is 4.5 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. So can't decay into b. So D is incorrect.

So the correct options are B and perhaps another, but let me check all options again.

Wait, the options are:

A) X→b s u d tau e (so includes b, which is no)

B) X→c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e (all allowed since c's 2m=3 GeV ≤6)

Option C includes t, which is too heavy. So C is incorrect.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy. So D is wrong.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but what about the original Lagrangian? The interaction term is given as L(y) = -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the fermions involved are the ones in the matter field ψ_f(y). So maybe the fermions that X can decay into are the ones that are part of the interaction.

Wait, the interaction term is written as -λ f f-bar ψ_f (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps I should parse this correctly. Wait, perhaps the interaction is Yukawa-like, so X couples to fermions ψ_f. So the fermions ψ_f could be any fermion, but in the problem statement, perhaps all are allowed. So the possible decay products are any fermion-antifermion pairs where 2m_f ≤6 GeV.

But then, the fermions available are: u, d, s, c, e, mu, tau.

So the possible decay channels are X → u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar, tau tau-bar, mu mu-bar, e e-bar.

So the correct option would list all these except b, t, etc.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: X→ c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. That's exactly the list I have, except tau is included.

Wait, but wait, in option B, it's written as "c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-".

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option B.


To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f (y).
\]

The boson \( X \) can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) if the mass of \( X \) is at least twice the mass of the fermion (\( m_X \geq 2m_f \)). The fermions considered include quarks (\( u, d, s, c, b, t \)) and leptons (\( e, \mu, \tau \)).

### Fermion Masses (in GeV):
- \( u \): \( 0.0022 \)
- \( d \): \( 0.0035 \)
- \( s \): \( 0.095 \)
- \( c \): \( 1.5 \)
- \( b \): \( 4.5 \)
- \( t \): \( 173 \) (negligibly light compared to \( X \))
- \( e \): \( 0.000511 \)
- \( \mu \): \( 0.105 \)
- \( \tau \): \( 1.78 \)

### Allowed Fermions for Decay:
For \( X \rightarrow f \bar{f} \), the condition \( m_X \geq 2m_f \) must hold. Thus:
- \( u \): \( 2m_u = 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( d \): \( 2m_d = 0.007 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( s \): \( 2m_s = 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( c \): \( 2m_c = 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( b \): \( 2m_b = 9.0 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (forbidden)
- \( t \): \( 2m_t = 346.0 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (forbidden)
- \( e \): \( 2m_e = 0.001022 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( \mu \): \( 2m_\mu = 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)
- \( \tau \): \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed)

Thus, the allowed fermion pairs are \( u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, s \bar{s}, c \bar{c}, e^+ e^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, \tau^+ \tau^- \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden since \( 2m_t > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
