Okay, so I have this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm. I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. Let me try to break this down.

Wait, the question gives me the masses of the stars, but I'm not sure if mass directly affects the elemental ratios here. Maybe the mass is a distractor. The important part is the given elemental abundances.

They provided [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1. Oh right, [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So positive means X is more abundant than Y compared to the Sun.

For Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. Since it's 0, nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. The Sun's [Fe/H] is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, wait, no, the Sun's value is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH_sun = 10^(-4.5). So Star_1 has the same [Fe/H], so nFe/nH is same as Sun.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms, which is nSi/nH for each star. So I think I need to compute [Si/H] for both stars and then take the ratio.

Wait, no. Let's see. The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 would be (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2), right? So that's (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) = (nSi_1 * nH_2) / (nH_1
