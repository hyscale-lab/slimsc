Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. 

The setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One photon goes in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors... Oh right, the Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass change in special relativity. Gamma equals 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to calculate velocities here. 

First, I should think about the conservation laws here. Since the system is isolated, both energy and momentum must be conserved. 

The initial momentum comes from the electron and the positron. Electrons and positrons have the same mass, but the positron is moving in the opposite direction. So their momenta need to be considered.

Wait, but wait. The positron has the same mass as the electron, right? And they both have Lorentz factors given. So their relativistic momenta can be calculated. 

The electron is moving to the right (since it's coming from the left and moving along the axis). The positron is moving to the left (since it's coming from the right). But wait, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So maybe their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momenta are opposite in direction.

So let's calculate their relativistic momenta. The momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, in terms of units, it's more convenient to calculate p as gamma * m
