Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reaction steps, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The main structure given is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Hmm, I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. So this molecule has a substituent at position 7, which is a tert-butoxy group. The tert-butoxy is like an oxygen attached to a tert-butyl group, so O-C(CH2CH3)3, but wait, no, wait—tert-butoxy is O-C(CH3)3, right? Because tert-butyl is (CH3)3C-.

So the starting material is a bicyclic compound with a substituent that's a tert-butoxy group.

Then, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Hmm, sodium iodide with dibromomethyl groups. Oh, wait, I think this is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Dibromomethyl groups are likely leaving groups. The molecule 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two -CH2Br2 groups on the cyclohexene? Or wait, no. Wait, di-substituted dibromomethyl would mean each Br is on a CH2 group attached to the cyclohexene.

Wait, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexene is 1,3-diene, meaning it's a conjugated diene in the ring. At positions 5 and 6, each has a -CH2Br group. Wait, no—bis(dibromomethyl) means each substituent is a CH2Br2? Because dibromomethyl is CH2Br2. So each substituent is a CH2Br2 group attached to the cyclohexene.

So when this reacts with sodium iodide, perhaps it's a substitution where the Br leaves. But wait, sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which are good nucleophiles. But wait, the starting material has two bromine atoms on each CH2 group. So each substituent is CH2Br2. So when treated with NaI, maybe each Br is replaced by iodide?

Wait, but 2 equivalents of that compound are used. So each molecule of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene would have two Br groups; so two equivalents would mean four Br atoms in total
