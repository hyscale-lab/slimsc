Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The problem says that there are three planets: Planet1, 2, and 3. They found the equilibrium temperature ratios between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 it's 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. Wait, no, actually, equilibrium temperature ratio for 1 and 2 is 1.4. Does that mean T1 is 1.4 times T2, or the other way around? I think it's T1 over T2 is 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 * T2.

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So M1/M2 = 1.15, and M2/M3 =1.35. So M1 = 1.15*M2, and M2 =1.35*M3. So M1 is 1.15 * 1.35 * M3. Let me calculate that. 1.15 *1.35 equals... 1.15 *1 is 1.15, 1.15*0.35 is about 0.4025. So together, 1.5525. So M1 = 1.5525 * M3.

We're asked about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So the question is, what's the factor by which the period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's? The options are A) ~10.4, B) ~3.2, C) ~4.4, D) ~33.4.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to its orbital period (distance from the star) and its star's luminosity. The formula is T = [ (L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4), where D is the distance from the star. But wait, another way to think about it is the inverse square law for flux. The flux received is proportional to L/(D^2), so the equilibrium temperature depends on that to the 1/4 power since it's blackbody radiation.

But wait, the equilibrium temperature formula for a planet is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). Hmm, maybe it's better to think in terms of the proportionality. Let me see. The equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (L(1 - a) )^(1/4) ) / D^(1/2). Because the flux F is L/(4πD²), and the equilibrium temperature T is [ F*(1 - a) / (4σ) ]^(1/4), which simplifies to [ L (1 - a) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4). So T is proportional to [ L^(1/4) (1 - a)^(1/4) ) ] / ( D^(1/2) ). 

But in this problem, all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), so (1 - a) is the same for all. Also, I assume the star's luminosity L is the same for all planets, since they orbit the same star. So the ratio of temperatures between the planets depends on their distances.

So, T1/T2 = [ (D2 / D1) ) ]^½. Wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D). So T1 = T2 * sqrt( D2 / D1 ). Because T1 is proportional to 1/sqrt(D1), T2 is proportional to 1/sqrt(D2), so T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So if T1/T2 = 1.4, then sqrt(D2/D1) =1.4. Squaring both sides, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So D2 = 1.96 * D1.

Wait, but wait. I think I got that backwards. Let me think again. If Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2, then its temperature would be higher. So if T1 is higher than T2, D1 must be smaller than D2. Because T is higher when D is smaller (since it's 1/sqrt(D)).

So T1 is 1.4 times T2. So the ratio D2/D1 would be (T1/T2)^2. Let me check that. Since T1 = T2 * sqrt( D2 / D1 ), from T1 = (L/(16 pi sigma D1^2))^(1/4), same for T2. So, T1^4 = L/(16 pi sigma D1²) * (1 - a). Similarly, T2^4 = L/(16 pi sigma D2²) * (1 - a). Taking the ratio T1^4 / T2^4 = (D2² / D1²), so (T1/T2)^4 = (D2/D1)^2. So T1/T2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2). So yes, D2/D1 = (T1/T2)^2. So for T1/T2 = 1.4, D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

Similarly, T2/T3 is 2.3. So, T2 = 2.3 * T3. So, D3/D2 is (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = about 5.29. So D3 = 5.29 * D2.

So we have D2 = 1.96 * D1, and D3 =5.29 * D2. So D3 =5.29 *1.96 * D1. Let me compute that: 5.29 *1.96. Hmm, 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is about 10.3684. So D3 ≈10.37 D1.

So the orbital period is related to the distance via Kepler's third law. The period P is proportional to D^(3/2) / (M_star^(1/2)), assuming the star's mass is much larger than the planets. Wait, the formula is P² = (4π²/(G M_star)) * D³. So P is proportional to D^(3/2) / (M_star^0.5). But since all planets orbit the same star, M_star is same, so P is proportional to D^(3/2).

But wait, the problem gives us the mass ratios between the planets. How does that affect the period? Oh, wait, the period depends on the mass of the star, not the planet. Hmm, wait a second. Kepler's third law is P² ∝ (D³)/(M_star). So the planet's mass doesn't come into play here. So the planet's mass doesn't affect the orbital period in this context. So the period is only a function of the distance from the star and the star's mass.

So since all planets orbit the same star, the period only depends on D^(3/2). So the ratio of periods would be (D3 / D1)^(3/2).

We found D3 ≈10.37 D1. So P3/P1 = (10.37)^(3/2).

Let me compute 10.37^(3/2). Let's break it down. The square root of 10.37 is about 3.22 (since 3.2²=10.24, 3.22²= about 10.36). So 10.37^(1/2) ≈3.22. Then, 10.37^(3/2) = (10.37^(1/2)) * (10.37) )= 3.22 *10.37 ≈33.4. So P3/P1 is approximately 33.4.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, 10.37 is approximately (10.4). Let me compute 10.4^(3/2). The square root of 10.4 is about 3.224. Then, 3.224 * 10.4 = approx 33.5. So that's around 33.4, which corresponds to option D.

Wait, but why are the masses given then? Because the problem states that the mass ratios are given. But according to Kepler's law, the period doesn't depend on the planet's mass. So I think the masses are a red herring here. The answer comes purely from the distances, which in turn are derived from the temperature ratios.

So the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1 is approximately 33.4. So the correct option is D.
