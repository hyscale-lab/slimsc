Okay, so I'm looking at this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. From what I remember, when substances react violently, it's often a rapid reaction, maybe something like an acid reacting with a carbonate, or perhaps a metal reacting with an acid. But I'm not sure yet.

The reaction releases a gas W, whose molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, same number of neutrons and protons? Oh, right! That's either a noble gas or maybe H2 because H has one proton and one neutron? Wait, no, H has one proton but only one neutron for deuterium. Wait, another thought: the gas W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let me think about common gases.

Hydrogen gas is H2. Each H has 1 proton and 1 neutron (if it's deuterium). So each molecule of H2 would have 2 protons and 2 neutrons, so same number. That fits. Alternatively, Helium? Helium is He, which has 2 protons and 2 neutrons in He-4. So He has 2 each. So He could be the gas W. But wait, He is a noble gas and doesn't usually react. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: CO2? No, because CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. But the number of protons and neutrons in each molecule? No, that's more complicated. Let me think again. Maybe it's H2 or He. But the reaction is violent, so perhaps H2 is produced, like when metals react with acids. Wait, but when metals react with acids, they produce H2 gas, right? So maybe it's H2.

Wait, let's think about the precipitate G. When heated, it releases B, and B's melting point is close to 277 K. What's 277 K in Celsius? Let me
