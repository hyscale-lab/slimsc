Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, remembering that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices, I think. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that the operator Ay is given by c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, c is a constant, right. And S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is [0, -i] and the second row is [i, 0]. Wait, that looks familiar. Oh yeah, that's the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by i or something like that? Let me think. The Pauli matrices are usually sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Sigma_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], right? So S here is exactly sigma_y. So S = σ_y.

So the operator Ay is c * σ_y. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But wait, the options don't all require calculating the eigenvalues. Let's see the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). Wait, eigenvalues of what? Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvalues should be ± something, because spin-1/2 systems have eigenvalues ± ħ/2 for each component. But wait, wait. Let me compute the eigenvalues.

The matrix Ay is (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i],[i,0]]. To find the eigenvalues, I can solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

But let's compute the eigenvalues of σ_y first. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So σ_y has eigenvalues ±1. So when we multiply by c, the eigenvalues become ±c. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be ± (h/(4π)) * 1.

Wait, but wait another thought. c is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π). So the real parts would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π), but wait, are there any imaginary parts? Because the eigenvalues of σ_y are ±i, no
