Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive than Star_2. Interesting. Then, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I think that relates to their temperatures. Because for a black body, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's law, which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So both stars have the same temperature? That's an important point.

Wait, but then the question is about their luminosities. So I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I remember is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So since both stars have the same temperature, but Star_1 has a larger radius, its luminosity should be larger.

But wait, the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. The options are given, and we need to find which factor it is.

Wait, but there's another part. The radial velocities are given: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 has 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity—so if a star is moving towards or away from us, that would cause a Doppler shift in its emitted light. But wait, how does that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, because of the Doppler effect. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, meaning the wavelength decreases. Conversely, moving away, redshifted, longer wavelength.

But earlier, the problem says that the stars' brightest wavelengths are the same. So maybe we have to correct for the Doppler shift when determining their temperatures. Because the observed peak wavelength might not be the actual emitted wavelength.

Wait a second, that's a crucial point. Let me think. If a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted. So
