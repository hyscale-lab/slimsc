Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The question describes a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, forming a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1.

Hmm, what does that IR peak indicate? The 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So product 1 is likely a ketone or an ester. But considering the reaction conditions: KOH is a strong base, and heating with dibromide—maybe an elimination reaction.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has two bromine atoms across an adamantane structure. Heating with KOH (a strong base) probably leads to dehydrohalogenation. But wait, two Br atoms—could it be a double elimination, forming an alkene? Alternatively, since it's KOH, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution, but with two leaving groups, perhaps elimination is more likely.

Wait, but the product after KOH is a solid with an NMR showing a carbonyl. So maybe it's an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have carbonyls. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane under elimination would form a diene, since removing two Br atoms would form a double bond. Wait, but in the structure of adamantane, if two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond.

Wait, let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo implies that the two Brs are on adjacent positions. When KOH is added, each Br is a leaving group. So perhaps two E2 eliminations happen, leading to a conjugated diene. But wait, the product has a carbonyl group. Hmm, maybe that's not right.

Wait, maybe the KOH is causing a substitution reaction. Let me think: heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH could lead to a substitution, but with two Br atoms, perhaps it's a double substitution. But substitution typically results in an alcohol or some oxygen-containing compound. Alternatively, maybe it's elimination followed by some reaction.

Wait, let's look at the
