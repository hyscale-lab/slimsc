Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two parts, reactions A and B, and we need to find the correct products and mechanisms from the options given. The options are A, B, C, D. Each option gives possible products for A and B.

First, let's break down reaction A:

Reaction A is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. So, what's happening here? I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ is probably a proton source later on.

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, usually oxygen. The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol would be a spiro junction where one ring is a 5-membered and the other is a 3-membered? Wait, no, wait. Wait, spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Let me think: the "non" indicates a 9-carbon chain. So, the spiro is between a 3-membered ring and a 5-membered ring. Hmm, wait, no. Spiro[m.n]something means that the spiro has two rings: one with m carbons and the other with n carbons. So in spiro[3.5], the main chain would have 3 + 5 + 2? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the spiro system is formed by two rings connected at a single atom. The numbering is such that the spiro atom is position 1. So, the compound is 1-vinyl, meaning a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is attached to the spiro carbon (position 1). The structure would be a spiro system where one ring is a 3-membered and the other is a 5-membered. So the spiro is at carbon 1, which has the vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like this: the spiro connects a cyclopropane (3-membered) ring and a cyclopentene (5-membered) ring. But I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

But the reaction conditions are THF, KH, H+. I remember that strong bases like KH can deprotonate certain acidic hydrogens. In alcohols, the alpha hydrogens are acidic, but wait, the starting material is an alcohol. Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro...en-1-ol. So the spiro carbon (1) is attached to an OH group and a vinyl group. So, the structure would be a spiro ring with the OH on C1 and a CH2=CH- group also on C1.

In such cases, the alcohol is a primary alcohol but attached to a spiro system. But wait, is the OH on a bridgehead? Let me think. The spiro system has two rings connected at one carbon, so that carbon
