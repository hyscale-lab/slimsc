Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions of bromine with various benzene derivatives. The question is about determining the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for each of the six substances. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, substituents on the benzene ring can activate or deactivate the ring towards electrophilic attack. Also, substituents can direct the incoming electrophile to certain positionsâ€”like ortho, meta, or para positions.

Each substituent has a directing effect. Electron-donating groups (EDGs) like -OCH3, -NH2, -OH are strong activating groups and typically direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. On the other hand, electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) like -NO2, -COOH, -COOR, -Cl are deactivating and can direct the electrophile to meta positions.

Wait, but wait... I think some EWGs are meta directors. Like nitro groups (-NO2) are strong deactivating and meta-directing. While substituents like -Cl are deactivating but ortho/para directors because they can donate electrons through resonance when the ring is activated in certain positions, but overall, they are deactivating because the inductive effect is stronger. Hmm, perhaps I should double-check that.

Cl is a deactivating group because of its electronegativity (strong inductive effect), but it's ortho/para-directing because the lone pairs on Cl can participate in resonance, making the ortho and para positions more activated.

So for each substituent in the given compounds:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group, which is an EDG. So it's activating and ortho/para-directing.
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: The substituent is an ethyl ester, COOEt. This is an EWG because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. So this is deactivating, and since it's an EWG, I think it's meta-directing.
3) C6H5-Cl: Cl is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group.
4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro group is a strong EWG, so deactivating and meta-directing.
5) C6H5-C2H5: The substituent is ethyl group, which is an EDG (activating, ortho/para-directing).
6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group. That's a strong EWG, so deactivating and meta-directing.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think the -COOH group is a strong EWG, so it's meta-directing. Similarly, the ester group in compound 2 is also EWG, so meta-directing. So compounds 2,4,6 have substituents that are meta-directing, while 1,3,5 are ortho/para directors.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So the more the substituent directs to para, the higher the para yield. But when the substituent is a meta director, the para isomer is not formed (or is it?), or is it?

Wait, no. For meta directors, the substituent directs incoming groups to the meta positions relative to itself. So the incoming electrophile would go to meta positions, meaning that the product would be meta-substituted. But in this case, each starting molecule has a substituent. For example, in compound 1, the benzene has a methyl group. When bromine adds, it can attack either ortho, meta, or para relative to the methyl group.

Wait, no. Wait, in bromination, the substituent on benzene directs where the bromine will add. So, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the major products are the ortho and para isomers. For meta directors, the major product is the meta isomer.

But wait, no. The meta director directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position relative to itself. So if the substituent is in position 1, the incoming group will go to positions 3 or 4 (but wait, benzene is a ring with 6 positions. Let me think: substituent in position 1, ortho would be 2 and 6, para is 4. So for a substituent in position 1, an ortho/para director would have the incoming group add to 2,4, or 6. But when the substituent is a meta director, the incoming group adds to 3 or 5 (which are meta positions relative to 1).

Wait, but the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. So for each compound, we need to find the percentage of the para product.

So, let's go through each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: Methyl group is ortho/para director. So the major products are ortho and para bromobenzene. So the para isomer is one of the major products, but the ratio between ortho and para depends on the steric hindrance. The para isomer is generally more favored than ortho because of less steric hindrance. So for compound 1, the para isomer would have a relatively high yield.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: The substituent is an ester group, which is EWG and meta director. So the incoming Br would add to the meta position relative to the ester group. So the product would be
