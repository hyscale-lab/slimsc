Okay, so I have this question about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. The reaction involved compound X, which is C11H12O, reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, they provided the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the product. I need to figure out which option (A-D) is the original compound X.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in deprotection reactions. Oh wait, specifically, it's used to open epoxides. Because under basic conditions, epoxides can ring-open. But wait, the product here is the result after the reaction. So maybe compound X is an epoxide, and upon reaction, it opens up to form something else. But wait, the product's NMR is given, so perhaps compound X is the starting material which is then converted into something else.

Wait, actually, the question says that the NMR is of the resulting product. So the product is the result of the reaction between X and the base. So X must be the starting material, and the product is something else.

Wait, but looking at the options, all of them except maybe D seem to be epoxides. Let me check each option:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an epoxide with a styryl group attached. The structure would be an oxirane (epoxide) ring connected to a styryl group at the 2 position. The styryl group is a benzene ring attached via a CH2-CH2? Wait, no, styryl is the vinylbenzene group, like CH2=CHPh. So the oxirane is attached to the CH2 group in CH2=CHPh.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the substituent is a propene group where the substituent is on the 1 and 2 positions. Wait, let me visualize: it's a three-carbon chain, with a double bond between C1 and C2. The substituent would be phenyl on C1. So it's like Ph-C(CH2-Oxirane)=CH2? Or wait, more accurately, the structure would be Oxirane attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to a CH that's double-bonded to another CH2, and the end having a phenyl. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, it's Oxirane attached to a group where the substituent is a 1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl group. Hmm.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has substituents at positions 2 and 3. At position 2, a methyl group, and at position 3, a styryl group. So the structure would be an epoxide ring where one oxygen is connected to a methyl group and the other to a styryl group.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So that's an epoxide where one of the oxygens is connected to a styryl group. So the structure is styryl-O-C-O-CH2? Wait, no, the epoxide is a three-membered ring. So it's an epoxide with a styryl group attached at the 2 position. So the ring has two carbons, each connected to adjacent oxygens. Wait, no, the epoxide is O between two carbons. So if it's 2-styrylepoxide, the substituent is on one of
