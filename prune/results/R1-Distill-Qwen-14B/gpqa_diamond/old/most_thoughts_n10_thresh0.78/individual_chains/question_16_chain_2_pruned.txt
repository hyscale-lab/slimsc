Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? And that typically happens when a compound has chiral centers, which are carbons attached to four different groups. Alternatively, it could have some sort of internal plane of symmetry, but wait, if there's a plane of symmetry, the compound would be achiral, so I need to look for the opposite. 

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. The first compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Hmm, so the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. But-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond. Wait no, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure would be Cl attached to C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it. Let me think. The formula is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 but with a double bond starting at C1. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, wait, because the substituents on each carbon of the double bond would need to determine the Z configuration. So, for the double bond, C1 is CH2Cl and C2 is CH(CH3). Wait, no, wait, the structure would be CH2Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a CH(CH3) group. So the groups on either side are CH2Cl on C1 and on C2, we have CH(CH3) and two Hs. Wait, no, wait, but wait, but the structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. So the correct structure is CH2Cl
