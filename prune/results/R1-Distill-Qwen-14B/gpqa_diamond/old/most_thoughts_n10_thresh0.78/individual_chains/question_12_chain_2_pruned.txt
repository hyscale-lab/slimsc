Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the kinetic energy of particles after a decay. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so that should simplify things a bit.

Wait, the reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle decays, energy and momentum have to be conserved. Since the pion is at rest initially, its momentum is zero. That means the total momentum of the products after the decay must also be zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, almost massless, right? So I can probably assume the neutrino is massless for this problem. Oh wait, no, wait. The muon has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV, and the pion is 139.6 MeV. So the pion's rest mass is larger, so there's decay energy available.

The rest mass of the neutrino is negligible, so we can treat it as massless. So the neutrino's energy will be related to its momentum by E = |p|c, but since we're working in units where c=1, E = |p|.

But wait, the muon has a rest mass, so its energy and momentum will relate through E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Again, since c=1, E² = p² + m².

Let me jot down the given data:

Mass of Pi: m_π = 139.6 MeV/c²
Mass of mu: m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
Neutrino: treated as m_nu ≈ 0.

The pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. So, the muon and neutrino must have opposite momenta: p_mu = -p_nu.

Let me denote p_mu as vector p, then p_nu is -p.

So, the total energy must be the sum of the pion's rest energy, which is m_pi c², but wait, the pion is at rest, so its energy is just its rest mass energy. So total energy before decay is m_pi c².

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino.

So, energy conservation: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

But E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units are in MeV. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1. So E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Similarly, E_nu = p, because for a massless particle, E
