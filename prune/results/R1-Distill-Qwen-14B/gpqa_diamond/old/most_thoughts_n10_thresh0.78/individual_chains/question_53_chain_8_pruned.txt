Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to think carefully.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The given data includes FTIR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, let's look at the FTIR part. It shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹ due to the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, the compound has an ester functional group.

Now, the 1H NMR spectrum has six signals. Let me parse what each signal implies.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern can influence the NMR signals. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would split into two sets. Maybe two doublets or two singlets depending on symmetry. If they are ortho or meta, the splitting would be different. Wait, but di-substituted can also lead to more than two signals if the substituents are not symmetrical. In this case, two signals mean that the aromatic protons are split into two environments. So perhaps it's a para substitution because that symmetry would lead to two sets of two equivalent protons each, giving two singlets? Or maybe each proton is split into two different environments. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure but the key is that there are two signals.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, like in an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group and often an adjacent ethylene group. Wait, maybe the structure has an ester group attached to a double bond somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a vinyl group attached to the aromatic ring. 

Wait, the ester group is O-C-O, right? So, an ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, that's not right. An ester is R-O-CO-R'. So, the structure might be something like a benzene ring with two substituents, one of which is an ester group. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is another group, like an ethylene group or something else.

Wait, but the NMR has two vinyl-H signals. Vinyl protons are on a double bond. So maybe the substituents are an ester and an ethylene group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that one is an ester and the other is an ethenyl (vinyl) group.

Wait, but let me think about the ester group's structure. Esters are like RCOOR'. The R and R' can be alkyl or aryl. If the ester is attached to the benzene ring, the RCOOR' part would be the substituent.

But in the NMR, the two vinyl-H are a doublet and a doublet of quartets. That suggests coupling between two sets of protons. So, maybe there's a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an ester.

Wait, perhaps the ester is part of a substituent that has a double bond. For example, if the substituent is something like OCOCH2CH2O... No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's an allyl ester. Or perhaps the substituent is an ester with a

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says.

The question is about an aromatic compound. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered ring, so it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which means there's an -O-CO-O- or an ester functional group. Wait, no, esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R, but in IR, the carbonyl (C=O) stretch is a strong peak around 1700 cm⁻¹, and the ester usually has a peak around 1250 cm⁻¹ for the C-O stretch. So the presence of these indicates an ester.

Looking at the NMR data: 1H NMR shows six signals. Wait, six signals, each with different multiplicities. Let's unpack this.

The six signals are:
1. Two aromatic H signals.
2. Two vinyl H signals: one is a doublet, the other is a doublet of quartets.
3. Two –CH3 groups.
No –CH2 groups, so that's important.

Hmm. So the structure must have an ester group, and the ring has two substituents.

Let me think about possible structures. A di-substituted benzene with ester groups? Or maybe one substituent is an ester group and the other is something else.

Wait, but esters are typically substituents like RCOOR'. So if the ring has two substituents, perhaps one is an ester group and the other is something else. Or maybe both substituents are part of the ester.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ester is part of a substituent on the ring. For example, maybe one substituent is an ester group, like OCOOR, and the other substituent is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are both part of a larger group, like a vinyl group.

Wait, but in the NMR, there are two signals for vinyl H. That suggests perhaps two sets of vinyl protons, maybe from two different substituents. Or maybe one substituent has two types of vinyl protons.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester, and another is a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR indicates two aromatic signals, so the di-substituted benzene has two distinct sets of aromatic protons. That implies that the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two different types of aromatic Hs. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic Hs would be equivalent, but if they are ortho or meta, maybe not. Wait, wait, if it's di-substituted, the ring's symmetry depends on the substituents.

Wait, for example, if the two substituents are para, the aromatic protons would be in two sets (like in para-substituted benzene, you get two sets of Hs if the substituents are in positions that make the ring less symmetric). Wait, no, in para substitution, the structure is symmetrical.
