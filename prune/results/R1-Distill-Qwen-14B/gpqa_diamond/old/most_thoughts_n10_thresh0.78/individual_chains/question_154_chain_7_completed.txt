Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist found an unnamed white solid and wants to identify it using spectral data. The data provided includes mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and 1H NMR. The options given are four different compounds, so I'll need to match the spectral data to one of them.

First, looking at the mass information: the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, so the molecular formula probably has a molecular weight of 156. The 158 peak is 32%, which is about a third. That makes me think of something with an isotopic peak. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35, and bromine is higher, but wait, the molecular weight is 156. Let me think about possible molecules.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually suggest O-H stretching. But where? It could be an alcohol (broad around 3300), a carboxylic acid (very broad around 2500-3300), or maybe an aldehyde (sharp around 2800-2700). Wait, the peak is broad, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid because their O-H is very strong and broad. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. For a carboxylic acid, that peak is usually around 1700-1725 cm^-1, and it's a strong, sharp peak. So maybe this is a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is a strong singlet. That's probably the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid, which typically appears as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet. Wait, but in D2O, carboxylic acid protons exchange and can appear as a singlet, or maybe in some cases, it's sharp. Alternatively, could it be an aldehyde proton? Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm, but this is higher, so more like a carboxylic acid.

The other NMR signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These are aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a coupling between protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, the two protons on either side will couple with each other, leading to doublets. Wait, but if two sets of doublets are present, maybe it's a substituent in the para position, but that's not directly clear. Alternatively, maybe there's an electron-withdrawing group causing deshielding. Let me think.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Its structure would have a hydroxyl (phenolic) group and an aldehyde group on the benzene ring. The aldehyde proton in NMR is around 9-10 ppm, but in this case, the peak is at 11.0, which is a bit high for an aldehyde but fits a carboxylic acid. Also, the IR has a peak at 1720, which would support a carbonyl like a carboxylic acid. However, this option has an aldehyde, so the IR should show a peak around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1 for the aldehyde C-H stretch, which isn't mentioned. So maybe this isn't the best fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure would have a Cl in the para position relative to the COOH group. In IR, that would have a broad peak for the O-H (carboxylic acid) and a strong C=O at ~1720 cm^-1. The NMR would have the COOH proton around 11 ppm as a singlet. The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets because of the para substitution. For benzoic acid derivatives, the aromatic protons ortho and para to the COOH would typically be deshielded. For example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two H's adjacent to Cl (in the para position) would be a doublet each, but wait, the substituents are Cl and COOH in para positions. So the aromatic ring would have two H's next to COOH and two next to Cl. But the substituents are in the para, so the ring would have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the NMR data given: 8.02 (d) and 7.72 (d). The chemical shifts make sense too. The COOH is deprotonating in D2O, but in the NMR, the singlet at 11.0 is probably the OH, but wait, benzoic acid's OH is usually broader. Unless it's a salt, but then why a singlet? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is OCl-CO-O-Ph. The molecular formula would be C6H4ClO2CO2Cl? Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The molecular formula would be C6H5O2CCl. Wait, the molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate would be C6H5 (77) + Cl (35.5) + (CO2) (44) but wait, the structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=2*16=32. Total: 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. Oh, but the molecular ion is at 156. So that's about 156.5, so maybe the exact mass is 156. So that's possible.

The IR of chloroformate would have a strong C=O stretch around 1720 cm^-1. Also, the O-Cl stretch is around 800 cm^-1, which is a medium peak. But what about other peaks? The O-CH2Cl in chloroformates may have other stretches, but in this case, the IR doesn't show peaks in those regions. Wait, the IR data given shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is O-H stretch? But phenyl chloroformate doesn't have an O-H group. Hmm, that's a problem because the IR shows a broad peak in that region, which suggests O-H.

So maybe option C is not correct because it lacks an O-H group. So the IR doesn't fit.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl in the ortho position relative to the COOH group. In IR, same as option B: broad O-H, strong C=O. NMR: the COOH proton would be at 11 ppm as a singlet. The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. But for 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are in ortho positions (Cl and COOH). The aromatic protons would be more deshielded. The coupling would be between the two H's next to Cl and the two next to COOH. Let me think about the NMR shifts. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's adjacent to Cl (ortho) would be at higher ppm than the H's adjacent to COOH (since Cl is a stronger de-shielder than COOH? Or maybe the opposite. Alternatively, the ring current could affect this.

Wait, in benzoic acid derivatives, the protons ortho to the COOH group are typically more deshielded, so their chemical shifts are higher (around 8.0-8.3 ppm). For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is in the ortho position relative to COOH. So the H's next to Cl (meta to COOH) might be at lower ppm than the H's next to COOH (which is ortho to Cl). Hmm, perhaps the NMR data shows 8.02 and 7.72, which are both lower than that. Wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the protons ortho to Cl would be in positions 3 and 5, and para to COOH. Maybe their shifts would be in the 7.7-8.0 range.

Wait, let's think again about the NMR peaks. The 8.02 (d) and 7.72 (d) each integrate to 2H. For para-substituted rings, the two ortho H's to substituents would each be equivalent. But in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, there are two substituents: Cl and COOH in para positions. So the ring has two sets of equivalent H's. The H's adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be deshielded, and the H's adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would also be deshielded but maybe less so than the Cl-adjacent ones. Alternatively, the COOH is a stronger de-shielder. So maybe the H's next to COOH (ortho) would be at higher ppm than those next to Cl. But in the given NMR, both are at 8.02 and 7.72, which are both in the higher range. Hmm.

Looking back, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are at positions 2 (Cl) and 1 (COOH) (if the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 2). The H's would be in positions 3,4,5,6. Wait, no, in benzene, numbering would be such that COOH is at position 1 (assuming the Cl is at 2). So the H's would be at positions 3,4,5,6. But in this case, the substituents are at 1 and 2, so the H's at 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl, and H's at 4 and 5 would be meta to Cl and ortho to COOH? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, let me imagine the structure. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, Cl at position 2. The H's would be at positions 3,4,5,6. H3 and H6 are adjacent to Cl (position 2), and H4 and H5 are opposite. So H3 and H6 would be ortho to Cl, and H4 and H5 would be para and meta to Cl, and maybe ortho to COOH. 

The NMR would show two doublets: one for H3 and H6 (ortho to Cl, which is at position 2), and another for H4 and H5 (meta to Cl and ortho to COOH). The H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, but in this case, H3 and H6 are ortho to Cl. Wait, perhaps in this scenario, the H3 and H6 would be more deshielded than H4 and H5, so their chemical shifts would be higher. 

So, in the NMR, the higher ppm (8.02) would correspond to H3 and H6 (ortho to Cl), and the lower ppm (7.72) would be H4 and H5 (meta to Cl, ortho to COOH). But wait, in this case, the H4 and H5 are next to COOH, which is a strong de-shielder. So their chemical shifts would be higher, not lower. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in the para positions, as in option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid), then the Cl is at position 4, and COOH at position 1. So the H's at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and H's at 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl. 

In this scenario, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5). So the NMR would show a doublet at around 8.02 (for positions 2 and 6) and another at 7.72 (positions 3 and 5). That fits the data given. So option B would have this pattern.

But wait, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, so the substituents are para. So the H's at 2,6 (ortho to COOH) would be more deshielded (higher shift) than H's at 3,5 (ortho to Cl). So in the NMR, the 8.02 would be the ones ortho to COOH, and 7.72 ortho to Cl. That makes sense.

But then let's think about the mass spectrum. The molecular ion is at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight of 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Chlorine adds 35.45, so the molecular weight would be 12*7 + 1*6 + 16*2 + 35.45 = 84 +6 +32 +35.45 = 157.45. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156, so that's a little off. But perhaps the molecular formula is something else.

Wait, let's calculate the exact molecular weight. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula is C7H5ClO2. The molecular weight is: (12*7) + (1*5) + (35.45) + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.45 +32 = 156.45. So the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which matches. The other peak at 158 is 32% abundance. Let's see, the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. The possible isotopes would be Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the molecular ion would have a peak at 156 (Cl-35: 75% abundance) and 158 (Cl-37: 25% abundance). But wait, the given data has the peak at 158 at 32%, which is a bit higher than 25%. Hmm, that's a bit conflicting, but perhaps considering other factors, it's acceptable.

Looking at the options, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let's check the IR. It would have a broad O-H peak (carboxylic acid) and a strong C=O peak at 1720 cm^-1, which matches the given data.

The NMR: singlet at 11 ppm (the COOH proton, which is broad but in this case, perhaps it's a sharp singlet because it's exchanged in D2O?), and two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 ppm. This fits with the para substitution, as explained earlier.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Its molecular weight would be the same as B: same formula (Cl is in a different position, but molecular weight is same). So for the mass spec, both B and D would have same molecular ion. But the NMR would differ.

In option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), the H's ortho to Cl would be in positions 3 and 6, perhaps. Let's say the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 2. Then the H's at 3 and 6 are ortho to Cl, and H's at 4 and 5 are meta to Cl and ortho to COOH. So the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be adjacent to COOH. Wait, position 6 is adjacent to Cl and position 1 (COOH). So H6 would be between Cl and COOH. Hmm, that might cause greater deshielding, making its shift higher.

In that case, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded, so their NMR peaks would be higher ppm. So in this scenario, the H at position 6 would be ortho to both Cl and COOH, leading to a higher shift. So perhaps the two doublets would be at higher and lower ppm than in option B.

But in the given NMR, the higher shift is 8.02 and lower is 7.72. Now, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be at higher ppm than those ortho to Cl. So the 8.02 ppm would be those H's, and 7.72 would be the H's next to Cl, like positions 3 and 5. But wait, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, position 3 is adjacent to Cl, so that H would be in a different environment.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to look at the coupling in the NMR. The two doublets each have 2H, which suggests that the aromatic protons are in a para-substituted pattern. Or perhaps, it's a meta substitution but that's less likely.

Wait, maybe the splitting is due to coupling between adjacent protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the H's adjacent to substituents (ortho) would couple with each other, creating doublets. But in a para-disubstituted benzene, each substituent has two ortho H's, but in this case, since the substituents are in para positions, the H's would be in such a way that each substituent's ortho H's are across from each other.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the substitution pattern. If the substituents are para, the H's would be in two sets of two, each set being equivalent. So, the NMR would have two doublets each integrating to 2H, which matches the data.

So, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The H's at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and H's at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl. The H's at 2 and 6 would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than H's at 3 and 5. So in the NMR, 8.02 would be H2 and H6, and 7.72 would be H3 and H5.

That fits the data. So the NMR suggests that the substituents are in para positions.

Now, looking at the mass, the molecular ion is 156, which fits the formula C7H5ClO2. The other peak at 158 is 32% which is likely the Cl-37 isotope. Cl has about 75% abundance of Cl-35 and 25% of Cl-37. So the molecular ion peak for Cl-35 is 156 (75%), and for Cl-37 is 158 (25%). But the given data shows 32% for 158, which is 25% plus perhaps some fragment? Or maybe the fragments are contributing. Alternatively, maybe there's another peak in the mass spectrum, but that's not relevant for the molecular ion.

Wait, the question says the molecular ion is at 156 (100%) and another at 158 (32%). So the 158 peak could be the M+2 peak due to Cl. So the molecular ion is 156, and then 158 would be M+2 (Cl-37). The abundance is 32%, which is a bit higher than expected for Cl's 25% natural abundance. But perhaps other factors like isotopic contribution from other elements are at play, but I think it's acceptable for the purpose of this question. So the molecular ion data fits options B and D.

So, putting it all together, the IR suggests a carboxylic acid (broad O-H, strong C=O). The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (COOH proton), and two doublets in aromatic region, indicating a para-substituted benzene. The mass fits a molecule with Cl and molecular weight 156, which points to 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) or 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D). However, the NMR splitting suggests para substitution, so option B is the better fit.

Wait, but option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid, which is an ortho substituent. So if the substituents are in ortho, would the aromatic protons still appear as two doublets?

Let me think again. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are adjacent (positions 1 and 2). So the H's at positions 3,4,5,6 would all be in different environments. The H's at 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl (position 2), and H's at 4 and 5 would be para to Cl. Wait, no, in 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So H3 is next to Cl, H6 is next to COOH. H4 is adjacent to H3 and H5. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the NMR would show more than two sets of peaks if the substituents are ortho, but in the given data, there are only two doublets. So that suggests that the substituents are para, leading to two sets of equivalent H's.

Thus, the correct structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid, option B.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%) and a peak at m/z = 158 (32%) suggest a molecular weight of 156 with a chlorine atom (Cl-35 and Cl-37 isotopes). The IR spectrum shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR data includes a singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H), consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H) and 7.72 ppm (2H), suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains both a hydroxyl and an aldehyde group. However, the IR spectrum does not show peaks characteristic of an aldehyde (e.g., C-H stretches around 2800-2700 cm⁻¹), and the NMR peak at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton than an aldehyde proton. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the para position. The IR spectrum matches the broad O-H stretch and the strong C=O stretch. The ¹H NMR data also aligns: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the substituents, respectively. The molecular weight of 156 matches the molecular ion peak, and the 158 peak corresponds to the Cl-37 isotope. This option fits all the data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   Phenyl chloroformate lacks an O-H group, so the broad IR peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹ cannot be explained. Additionally, the NMR data does not support this structure, as it would not produce a singlet at 11.0 ppm. This option is inconsistent with the spectral data.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the ortho position. While the molecular weight matches, the NMR data does not fit. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would not produce two equivalent doublets, as the substituents are not para. Instead, the NMR would show more complex splitting patterns. Thus, this option is less likely than B.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular weight, IR peaks, and NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern explains the two equivalent doublets in the NMR, and the IR and mass spectrometry data align with this structure.

Answer: B
