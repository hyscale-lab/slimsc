Okay, so I have this question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that allows converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, specifically involving the matrix exponential function approximated by a fractional approximation.

Hmm, let me think. I remember that in solving PDEs, especially heat equations, the finite difference method is commonly used. But when dealing with higher dimensions, the problem becomes more complex. Parallel splitting is a method to solve such problems by breaking them into smaller parts that can be computed simultaneously, thus speeding up the process.

The question mentions the matrix exponential function. Matrix exponentials often come into play when solving systems of linear differential equations, like those arising from discretized PDEs. The idea is that the solution can be expressed as e^(At), where A is a matrix derived from the finite difference approximation.

But how does this relate to parallel algorithms? Oh right, if the matrix can be decomposed or split into parts that are independent of each other, then each part can be exponentiated separately. This is where methods like parallel splitting or domain decomposition might come into play. 

Wait, the question is about the key factor in converting the algorithm to parallel. The options are A to D. Let's go through them.

Option A: Stability analysis. Stability is crucial for ensuring that the numerical solution doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. But is stability the key factor for making the algorithm parallel? I'm not sure. I think stability is more about the correctness of the method rather than enabling parallelism.

Option B: Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions. Nonlocal boundary conditions are a bit tricky, but I'm not immediately seeing the connection to parallelism. I'm more familiar with nonlocal conditions being about having dependencies on other parts of the domain, which might complicate things but not directly enable parallel processing.

Option C: Complex roots of fractional approximation. Fractional approximation methods, like those used in exponential splitting, involve using functions that approximate the exponential. If these have complex roots, that might affect the stability or the accuracy of the approximation. But how does that enable parallelism? Maybe if the approximation can be broken down into components that can be handled in parallel, perhaps because the matrix is diagonalizable or has certain properties. Wait, if the approximation leads to a situation where the matrix can be split into independent parts, that could allow parallel computation.

Option D: Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation. Partial fraction decomposition is a technique used to break down complex fractions into simpler parts. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of simpler terms, each of which can be computed independently, then that would enable parallel processing. For example, if the matrix exponential can be written as a sum of exponentials of smaller matrices, each part can be computed in parallel.

So, the key factor is about whether the approximation allows the matrix to be split into parts that can be processed independently. Option D suggests a linear partial fraction decomposition, which would allow each term to be handled separately, hence enabling parallelism.

Wait, let me think again. Another angle: in parallel splitting methods, the algorithm is split into parallel subtasks. For that, the method must allow the problem to be decomposed. For example, in the method of lines, after discretizing the spatial derivatives, you get a system of ODEs. Solving these ODEs in a parallel way might involve something like the exponential of a matrix that can be split into a sum of operators that commute, allowing each to be exponentiated separately.

If the fractional approximation of the matrix exponential can be expressed as a sum of exponentials of these operators, that would require that the approximation can be decomposed into a partial fraction. So, if the approximation's form allows for such a decomposition, that would enable parallel computation of each part.

So, option D is about the linear partial fraction of the fractional approximation. That seems to fit. Alternatively, complex roots (option C) might influence the form of the approximation, but perhaps it's the decomposition that allows parallelism.

Another thought: when you have a matrix exponential e^{At}, if A can be written as a sum of matrices that commute, you can compute the exponential as a product of exponentials of each part. But in reality, matrices usually don't commute, so this isn't always possible. However, if the approximation method (like a fractional method) allows the exponential to be approximated as a sum of terms that can be computed in parallel, then that would help.

Wait, the question says the matrix
