Okay, so I have this question about stars and parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. The bigger the parallax, the closer the star is, right? Parallax p is in arcseconds, and the distance d is in parsecs, with d = 1/p. So when parallax increases, distance decreases.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So I'm thinking about the distribution of stars in space. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the same number of stars exist in each volume of space, but of course, how many we observe depends on their distance from us.

Wait, but the question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So that implies that in every unit volume, there's the same number of stars. Or maybe that they're spread out uniformly in space. So when we look at the sky, their distribution depends on how their distances translate into apparent positions.

I remember that the number of stars you can see (or the number in a certain volume) depends on the distance. The volume of a sphere increases with the cube of the radius. So as you go further out, each shell of thickness dr contains more volume, hence more stars if they are uniformly distributed.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax p is inversely proportional to distance d, since p = 1/d. So if d is in parsecs, then p is 1/d. So larger d means smaller p.

Let me think about the number of stars in a certain range of parallax, say from p to p + dp. Each parallax range corresponds to a distance range. So if p goes from p to p + dp, then d goes from d = 1/p to d = 1/(p+dp). But wait, for very small dp, this approximation might be manageable. Alternatively, since dp is small, the change in d can be approximated as dd = -1/(p^2) dp, since d = 1/p, so dd/dp = -1/p².

But wait, maybe I should approach this by considering the number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr.

The volume of the shell is 4πr²
