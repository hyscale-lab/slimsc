Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh wait, maybe that's a typo. I think it's more likely 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Because sometimes the numbering gets a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? No, I think 2-d might stand for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromobenzene with a deuterium substitution? Or perhaps it's a typo and should be 2-dimethyl? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the reaction. NaNH2 in ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, and in ammonia, it's often used for deprotonation reactions. Also, in aromatic substitution, NaNH2 can act as a base to abstract protons, especially in directing groups.

Wait, benzene rings with substituents undergo reactions depending on the directing nature of the substituent. So, in this case, the substituents are bromine and another group. Wait, the molecule is 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Hmm, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine at position 1 and another substituent at position 2. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, meaning the benzene has a Br at position 1 and two methyl groups at position 2? Or maybe it's a typo, and the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe 1-bromobenzene-2-d is a typo for 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. But perhaps it's more straightforward. Let me look up the structure. Oh wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d could be a benzene ring where position 1 has a Br and position 2 has a deuterium. Or maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, where the 'd' stands for dimethyl. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene, but that's stretching it.

Alternatively, maybe the 'd' is a typo, and the actual substituent is another group. But since the question is about the product of a reaction,
