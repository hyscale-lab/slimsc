Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potential energy between a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are all in terms of k, q, R, and d, so I must be missing something about the system's configuration.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... I remember that when you bring charges together, you do work against the electric field, and that work becomes the potential energy. But here, it's a charge and a conducting sphere, so maybe the method is different.

Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any excess charge would reside on the surface. But wait, the sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the Earth, so any induced charges can flow into the ground. Oh right, because a grounded conductor allows charges to move freely to maintain zero potential on the conductor.

So when I place a charge q near the conducting sphere, the sphere will have induced charges. But because it's grounded, those induced charges won't stay on the sphere. Wait, no, the sphere being conducting and grounded allows charges to move, but in this case, since the sphere is neutral to begin with. Let me think: when a charge q is placed near the sphere, it induces opposite charges on the near side and same charges on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the far side's induced charges can leave the sphere, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Or perhaps the sphere, being grounded, can lose any excess charge. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: potential energy between two charges. But the sphere is conducting, so maybe I can model the potential energy as that between the charge q and the induced charge on the sphere. But wait, because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface must be zero. So the potential due to all charges on the sphere must be zero on its surface.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of image charges. I remember that for a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be modeled using image charges. But then again, since the sphere is grounded, maybe the image charge approach isn't directly applicable.

Wait, the potential at a point outside a conducting sphere is
