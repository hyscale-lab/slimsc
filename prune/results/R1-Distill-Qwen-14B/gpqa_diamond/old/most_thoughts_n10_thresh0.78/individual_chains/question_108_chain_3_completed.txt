Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to unpack what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. Oh right, Oz is the z-axis in a 3D coordinate system. The magnetic field is 1 Tesla, which is a pretty strong field, but I remember that in physics problems, 1 T is often used as a standard value.

The question is about the paramagnetic coupling term and how it compares to the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom. The options are about whether the coupling term is much bigger, smaller, or similar in magnitude.

Wait, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? I think it's related to the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and the external magnetic field. Oh right, the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is something like H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g * (e/(2m)) * ħ * m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, e is the charge, m is the mass, ħ is the reduced Planck's constant, and m_s is the spin quantum number.

Wait, but the problem mentions the orbital magnetic quantum number m, but I think in the Zeeman effect, it's the spin that's more relevant for paramagnetism. Oh wait, maybe it's the spin coupling here. Because the orbital part is usually called the normal Zeeman effect, but paramagnetism is more about electron spin.

So the paramagnetic term is the spin part of the Zeeman Hamiltonian. The energy would then be E = μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by the product of the Bohr magneton and the spin quantum number m_s. Wait, no, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), and for an electron, the spin magnetic moment is μ = μ_B * m_s, where m_s can be ±1/2.

So the energy due to the magnetic field is E = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, and the spin is in some direction, but in the Zeeman term, the expectation value would be proportional to m_s * B. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused between m (orbital) and m_s (spin). Oh, the problem states "small values of m", but I think m here refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. Hmm, but paramagnetism is about spin, so maybe m here is the spin quantum number. Wait, the question says orbital magnetic quantum number m has small values. Oh, but wait, m can be -1, 0, +1 for orbital angular momentum l=1, but for spin, m_s is ±1/2.

So, the paramagnetic coupling term's energy would be proportional to m_s * μ_B * B. But wait, the spin doesn't depend on the orbital quantum numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the spin-orbit coupling, but that's a different thing. No, the paramagnetic coupling is specifically the spin in the magnetic field.

So let's compute the magnitude of the paramagnetic term. The Bohr magneton is about μ_B ≈ 9.274 × 10^-24 J/T. So if B is 1 T, then the energy is E = μ_B * m_s * B. Since m_s can be ±1/2, the maximum value for m_s is 1/2.

So E = (9.274e-24 J/T) * (1/2) * 1 T = approx 4.6e-24 J.

Now, what's the transition energy ΔE for the hydrogen atom with wavelength 0.4861 μm? Oh, that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which transitions from n=2 to n=1, but wait no, n=3 to n=2. Wait, the Balmer series is transitions ending at n=2, so the H-alpha line is from n=3 to n=2. Let me confirm: the wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which is about 486 nm. So yes, that's the H-alpha line.

The energy of a photon is E = hc / λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is ~3e8 m/s. So λ is 486e-9 meters.

Let's compute E_photon: (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (486e-9 m) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (486e-9 m) = roughly 4.08e-18 J.

Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately. Let me compute 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 486e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.86e-7 = approximately 4.08e-19 J? Wait, let me compute the exponents: 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.86e-7 = (1.9878 /4.86) )e-18. 1.9878 /4.86 ≈ 0.409, so about 0.409e-18 J, which is 4.09e-19 J.

Wait, wait, my initial calculation said 4.08e-18, but now I get 4.09e-19. Let me recheck. Oh, wait, 486e-9 is 4.86e-7 meters. So 1.9878e-25 / (4.86e-7) = (1.9878 /4.86) * 1e-25 /1e-7 = (0.409) * 1e-18 = 4.09e-19 J.

So the transition energy ΔE is about 4.09e-19 J.

Earlier, for the paramagnetic term, I had about 4.6e-24 J. So the paramagnetic energy is about 4.6e-24 J, and the transition energy is about 4e-19 J.

Comparing the two: 4.6e-24 vs 4e-19. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller. So ⟨H⟩, which is the paramagnetic term, is much less than ΔE.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the paramagnetic term is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. So that would be the energy we just calculated, which is about 4.6e-24 J. The transition energy is about 4e-19 J. So the paramagnetic term is about 4.6e-24 /4e-19 = (4.6/4) * 1e-5 = about 1.15e-5 times smaller. So paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the question is asking whether ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the answer would be option C, which says ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Looking at the options:

A) ⟨H⟩ = ΔE → no, they're in different orders.

B) ⟨H⟩ much greater than ΔE → no.

C) ⟨H⟩ much less than ΔE → yes.

D) ⟨H⟩ > ΔE → no.

So the correct answer is option C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two quantities:

1. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field. The energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m_s
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength, and \( m_s = \pm 1/2 \) is the spin quantum number. Substituting these values:  
   \[
   E_{\text{paramagnetic}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot (1) \cdot (1/2) = 4.6 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]

2. **Transition Energy of Hydrogen Atom**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) corresponds to the energy of a photon with wavelength \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \). Using the relation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} = 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
   \]

3. **Comparison**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( 4.6 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \), while the transition energy is \( 4.09 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \). The ratio of the two is:  
   \[
   \frac{E_{\text{paramagnetic}}}{\Delta E} = \frac{4.6 \times 10^{-24}}{4.09 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 1.12 \times 10^{-5}.
   \]  
   This shows that the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

4. **Conclusion**:  
   Among the options provided, the correct choice is that the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy:  
   \[
   \langle H \rangle \ll \Delta E.
   \]
