Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem talks about an operator P which has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has a matrix form given in a basis of eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis vectors are the eigenstates of P_z. 

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, right, the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square of the operator minus the square of the expectation value of the operator. So for P_z, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, first I should probably write down the state vector. Let me note that the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ]. But I need to check if this vector is normalized. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values.

So |−1/2|² is (1/4), |1/√2|² is (1/2), and |−1/2|² is another 1/4. Adding them: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So the vector is normalized. Good.

Now, since the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, the matrix for P_z is diagonal. Looking at P_z's matrix:

The first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second row is (0,0,0), third row is (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ corresponding to the basis vectors |1⟩, |2⟩, |3⟩ respectively.

So the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me write |ψ⟩ as a combination:

|ψ⟩ = a|1⟩ + b|2⟩ + c|3⟩.

From the vector components, a is -1/2, b is 1/√2, c is -1/2.

But wait, the first component is a, right? Because the first basis vector is [1,0,0], so the first entry is a. So a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in state |ψ⟩, we can compute it as ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of |a|² * eigenvalue + |b|² * eigenvalue + |c|² * eigenvalue.

Wait, more precisely, for each component, the coefficient squared (times the eigenvalue) because in the eigenbasis, the expectation is the sum of probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

So eigenvalues for P_z are: λ1 = ħ (for |1⟩), λ2 = 0 (for |2⟩), λ3 = -ħ (for |3⟩).

So let's compute |a|²: ( (-1/2) )²=
