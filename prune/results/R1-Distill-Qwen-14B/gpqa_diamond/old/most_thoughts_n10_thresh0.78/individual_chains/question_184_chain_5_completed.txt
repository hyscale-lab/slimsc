Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. So, the task is to determine the correct sequence of reactions that would lead to the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

Hmm, I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds with multiple substituents, the order of adding groups is crucial because of the directing effects of the substituents. Benzene is an aromatic ring, and each substitution affects where the next substituent will attach.

Looking at the target molecule: 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let me try to draw this structure mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are numbered 1, 2, 3. So, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro.

Wait, actually, no. Wait, in benzene, numbering depends on the substituents. Let me make sure I get the positions right. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, but which is which? Let me think: the name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So, on the benzene ring, substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, they're all meta to each other in a way, but not exactly.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent. So, the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, substituents are in a row? Like 1, 2, 3 are adjacent positions. So, the ring would have ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro in adjacent positions, but wait, no, that's not possible because benzene is a ring. Wait, no, positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a way that each is next to the next. Wait, perhaps it's a meta arrangement? No, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent in a straight line on the ring. Maybe it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the directing effects of each substituent. The substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and ortho/para or meta directors.

Let me list the substituents:

1. Ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3). That's an activating group because it's an electron-donating ether. It's a strong activating, ortho/para director.

2. tert-Butyl group (-C(CH3)3). That's a bulky alkyl group, which is activating (since alkyl groups are electron-donating by induction, but in aliphatic groups, they are activating). Wait, but wait, in aromatic substitution, alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through sigma bonds. So, t-butyl is an activating group, and since it's bulky, it's more of an ortho/para director but because of its bulk, maybe it directs incoming groups to the para position more, but in reality, for alkylation, it's typically ortho/para but ortho is hindered due to steric effects, making para more favorable. Hmm, but in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, tert-butyl is actually a good candidate because it's less likely to cause carbocation rearrangements.

Wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, nitro is a meta director.

So, the target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. But the order in which they are added will determine their positions.

Now, the synthesis starts from benzene. So, we need to add substituents one by one, considering the directing effects each time.

I think the key is to figure out the order of substitution. Since nitro is a strong deactivating group, adding it last might be better because once nitro is present, the ring is deactivated, making further substitutions harder. Alternatively, if we add nitro early, we have to consider how the subsequent substituents will direct.

Wait, but looking at the substituents in the target, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Let me imagine the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that each is in a position directed by the previous substituent.

Let me think about the steps. The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro. So, the order in which these are added will determine their positions.

Wait, but I need to see which substituent is added first, second, third.

Another approach: the positions are 1, 2, 3. So, when adding the substituents, each new group is added relative to the previous ones.

Let me think about possible sequences.

Option 1: Add ethoxy first. Ethoxy is activating, ortho/para director. Next, add nitro. But nitro is deactivating, so after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, making further substitution harder. Then add tert-butyl. But Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating ring, so perhaps adding tert-butyl as the last step might not work if the ring is deactivated.

Alternatively, maybe add tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro. Or nitro first, but that's unlikely because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the most activating group first, then the next, then the deactivating group last. Because once the ring is deactivated by nitro, adding more groups would be difficult.

So, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. Or perhaps tert-butyl first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, but let me think about how each substituent affects the ring. For example, ethoxy is a strong activating group. If I add ethoxy first, the ring is highly activated, so the next substitution can be done easily.

Then, adding tert-butyl: Friedel-Crafts alkylation requires an activating group. If ethoxy is present, the ring is activated, so it's suitable for alkylation. So, adding tert-butyl next would be possible.

But where would the tert-butyl group attach? Since ethoxy is an ortho/para director, the next substituent (tert-butyl) would enter either ortho or para to the ethoxy group.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the tert-butyl is adjacent to the ethoxy. Let me see: ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are in positions 1, 2, 3. So, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the third substituent (nitro) needs to be added in a position that is para to either ethoxy or ortho to tert-butyl, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to go through each option's reaction sequence and see which path leads to the correct structure.

Looking at the options:

Each option lists a series of reactions.

Looking at the steps, the reactions include:

- Friedel-Crafts alkylation (using tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3)
- Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4)
- Sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) — but wait, sulfonic acid groups are strong meta directors. But in the target molecule, there's no sulfonic acid group. Wait, so perhaps that's a red herring. Alternatively, sulfonation might be part of the synthesis but not retained in the final product. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the target molecule doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So, any sulfonation step would require a subsequent reaction to remove it. For example, sulfonation followed by desulfonation. But I don't see any steps that involve removing a sulfonic acid group here.

Wait, looking at the options, after sulfonation, there are steps like NaNO2/HCl and H3O+ etc., which might be diazotization and hydrolysis, perhaps for introducing substituents through a diazonium salt.

Wait, let's think about what each reaction does.

1. Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds an alkyl group (like tert-butyl).
2. Nitration: adds a nitro group.
3. Sulfonation: adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is a strong meta director and deactivating.
4. Fe/HCl: maybe a catalyst for some reaction, like for the nitration or sulfonation.
Wait, no, Fe/HCl is often used in the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it could be part of a Sandmeyer reaction or something else.
5. NaNO2/HCl: diazotization, typically used to convert an amine to a diazonium chloride.
6. H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis of a diazonium salt, perhaps to introduce a hydroxyl group.
7. NaOH and EtBr: probably an SN2 reaction, like an ethoxy group substitution. Wait, but ethoxy is OCH2CH3. So, maybe introducing an ethoxy group via an SN2 mechanism. But wait, benzene doesn't have a good leaving group unless it's attached to something else.
Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an etherification reaction, like using an alkyl halide in presence of a base, but that's more of an aliphatic substitution. Alternatively, perhaps through a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's less common.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction, but I'm a bit confused about the exact steps here.

Wait, perhaps the steps are as follows: Let's think about each substituent.

First substituent: ethoxy group. To add an ethoxy group to benzene, one method is via the ethoxylation of a diazonium salt. But usually, that's done by first forming a nitro group, then reducing it to an amine, converting to a diazonium salt, and then substituting with an ethoxide ion. Alternatively, perhaps Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be activated towards nucleophilic attack, often through having strong electron-withdrawing groups. For example, if the ring already has a nitro group, which is a strong meta director, but then again, how do we get the ethoxy group in the right position?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after activating the ring. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule again. It has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups in positions 1, 2, 3. Let's imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon with positions 1, 2, 3 adjacent.

So, ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3.

Wait, perhaps we can figure out the order in which substituents are added based on their directing effects.

The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing. So, if nitro is added last, then the previous substituents would have directed the incoming nitro group.

Alternatively, if nitro is added first, then the next substituent would be directed by the nitro group.

Wait, if nitro is added first, the next substituent would be directed to the meta position relative to the nitro group. But the target has ethoxy and tert-butyl in positions adjacent to each other and to the nitro group.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added as the last substituent. Then, the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups would have been added earlier, each directing the nitro to the correct position.

Wait, but nitro groups are meta directors. So, if the nitro is added last, it would go to a position meta to one of the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the sequence is: add ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

Let me think through that scenario.

1. Add ethoxy group: benzene → ethoxybenzene.

Now, ethoxy is ortho/para director. Next substituent would be added to ortho or para positions.

2. Add tert-butyl group. Since ethoxy is ortho/para, the tert-butyl could be added either ortho or para to ethoxy.

If we add tert-butyl ortho to ethoxy, then the ring would have ethoxy at position 1 and tert-butyl at position 2. Now, the next substituent (nitro) would need to be added.

3. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2). The next substituent is nitro. Since the ring currently has an ethoxy group (activating, ortho/para director) and a tert-butyl group (activating, ortho/para), but the ring is getting more substituted.

Wait, but once you have two substituents, their combined directing effects determine where the next substituent will go.

So, ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. The next substituent (nitro) is a deactivating, meta director. But when adding nitro, which is a strong deactivating group, it should be added in a position that is para to one substituent and meta to another.

Alternatively, when adding nitro, the existing substituents (ethoxy and tert-butyl) would direct the nitro group to certain positions.

Wait, but the ring is already bearing two substituents. The third substituent's position will be influenced by where the other two are.

Let me imagine the ring with ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2. The remaining available positions are 3,4,5,6. But considering the directing effects, the nitro group would be added in a position that is meta to one substituent or ortho to another.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. So, it would tend to add in positions that are meta to existing substituents.

Let me draw this on paper mentally. Ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. So, position 3 is adjacent to 2. If the nitro group is added to position 3, which is meta to ethoxy (position 1 is meta to position 4, but ethoxy is at 1, so position 4 would be meta). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the position meta to ethoxy (position 1) would be position 4. Alternatively, if considering the directing effect of the tert-butyl, which is at position 2, its meta positions would be 5 and maybe 5 (since position 2's meta would be positions 5 and 6? Wait, no. Wait, for position 2, the meta positions are 5 and perhaps another.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think of each substitution step.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Then, the ring is deactivated, making further substitution difficult. But in that case, adding ethoxy and tert-butyl after might not be feasible because the nitro group is deactivating.

Hmm, that might not be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are added in the order of nitro, tert-butyl, ethoxy. But again, adding nitro first would make the ring less reactive.

Wait, but in any case, considering the target molecule, nitro is in position 3, which is adjacent to tert-butyl at 2 and ethoxy at 1. So, perhaps the nitro is added last, directed by the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe another approach. Let's look at each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option D: the steps are i) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), ii) Fe/HCl, iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3, iv) HNO3/H2SO4, v) NaNO2/HCl, vi) SO3/H2SO4, vii) dilute H2SO4, viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat, ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, that seems complicated. Let me parse each step.

i) Nitration: benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl: perhaps a reduction step? Fe and HCl in a mixture might be for dissolving or perhaps for some kind of substitution. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, Fe/HCl is used in the hydrolysis of nitro groups to amines, but I'm not sure.

iii) Alkylation with tert-butyl chloride and AlCl3: Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but after nitration. But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't proceed. So, this step might not work. So, option D's step iii is probably not feasible because after nitration, the ring is deactivated, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation isn't possible.

So, option D is probably incorrect.

Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Breaking this down:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Sulfonation: tert-butylbenzene → tert-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. But sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive.

But then, step iii is nitration. After sulfonation, the ring is deactivated, so nitration would be difficult. So, the nitration might not occur. So, perhaps this option isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, the sulfonic acid group is removed. But the target doesn't have it, so that must happen. So, after sulfonation, they might do something to remove the sulfonic acid group. Let's see. Steps after sulfonation: iv) Fe/HCl. I'm not sure what that does. Maybe it's a way to remove the sulfonic acid group. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid is converted into something else.

Wait, but in any case, this seems complicated and perhaps not the correct path.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4.

So, steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: tert-butylbenzene → tert-butyl nitrobenzene. But where does nitro attach? The tert-butyl group is an ortho/para director. So, nitro would go ortho or para to the t-butyl. Let's say para.

iii) Fe/HCl: possibly a reduction of nitro group to amine? Fe/HCl with nitrobenzene might not do that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a step to prepare for something else.

iv) Nitration again: another nitro group? But the target has only one nitro group. So this seems off.

So, option B seems to introduce two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, the steps:

i) Friedel-Crafts: benzene → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: tert-butylbenzene → tert-butyl nitrobenzene. Nitro at para to t-butyl.

iii) Sulfonation: add sulfonic acid group.

iv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl): but on what? If the compound has a sulfonic acid group and nitro, perhaps the amine is present. Wait, maybe a nitro group is reduced to amine first. But in this sequence, step iv is NaNO2/HCl, which is for diazotization. So, the compound must have an amine group. But after nitration, we have nitro groups, not amines. So perhaps step iii is something else.

Wait, perhaps I missed steps. Option A: after i and ii, the compound is tert-butyl nitrobenzene. Then step iii is sulfonation: adding a sulfonic acid group. Then step iv is NaNO2/HCl. But without an amine, this step can't be diazotization. Hmm, perhaps the sulfonic acid is a problem here.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to think about the steps differently.

Wait, perhaps these steps are for introducing substituents in a specific order.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via an SN2 reaction. But for that, the benzene ring would need a good leaving group, which isn't the case unless it's part of a larger substituent.

Wait, another approach: to introduce the ethoxy group, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, the ring must be activated towards nucleophilic attack, often by having electron-withdrawing groups. For example, if the ring has a nitro group, we can perform such a substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation, followed by a reduction. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a substitution of a nitro group. For instance, if you have a nitro group, you can reduce it to an amine, then perform a diazotization, and then substitute with an ethoxide.

Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Let me think again. The target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups. Let me imagine the order of addition.

Option A's sequence is:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation (t-butyl)
ii) Nitration
iii) Sulfonation
iv) Diazotization
v) Dilute H2SO4
vi) H3O+ heat
vii) NaOH, EtBr
viii) Fe/HCl
ix) HNO3/H2SO4

Wait, that's a lot of steps. Let me try to track.

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts: tert-butylbenzene.
2. Nitration: adds nitro group para to t-butyl → tert-butyl nitrobenzene.
3. Sulfonation: adds sulfonic acid group. Where? The ring has two substituents: t-butyl (para to nitro). Sulfonation is a meta director, so the sulfonic acid would add meta to one of the existing groups. Let's say meta to t-butyl, which is position 2. Or maybe meta to nitro, which would be position 4.

But I'm not certain where the sulfonic acid would go. Let's say it's added meta to the t-butyl group, so position 3.

Now the ring has t-butyl (position 1), nitro (position 4), and sulfonic acid (position 3).

Wait, but I'm not sure. Sulfonation is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So, when adding the sulfonic acid group, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. The sulfonic acid would be added meta to one of these. Let's say meta to t-butyl, which is at position 1. So, meta would be position 4, but that's already taken by nitro. So, perhaps the next available meta position is position 5.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe after sulfonation, the ring is heavily deactivated, making further substitution hard.

Next step iv: NaNO2/HCl. But without an amine, this can't be diazotization. Wait, perhaps the nitro group is reduced to an amine. So, prior to step iv, we have a nitro group which is reduced to amine. But where is that step in the sequence?

Looking at option A, after step iii (sulfonation), step iv is NaNO2/HCl. But without an amine, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the steps are for introducing the ethoxy group via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via SN2, but that's not likely on benzene. Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy comes from a substitution of a leaving group like a tosylate, but that would require the ring to have a good leaving group, which isn't the case unless it's part of a substituent.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of another approach.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy (1), t-butyl (2), nitro (3). Let's consider their positions.

If the ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, then the nitro group is adjacent to t-butyl and ethoxy. Since nitro is meta-directing, but in this case, it's adjacent. Hmm, perhaps the nitro group was added last, directed by the ethoxy and t-butyl groups.

Wait, the ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) would direct the nitro group to certain positions.

When both ethoxy and t-butyl are present, their combined directing effect would be to positions that are ortho/para to one and ortho/para to another. But perhaps the most activated positions are where they're both directing.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added in a position that is para to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl.

Wait, position 3 would be ortho to the t-butyl (position 2) and meta to the ethoxy (position 1). Hmm, but nitro is a meta director, so perhaps it would be added meta to one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Add ethoxy group first, activating the ring.
2. Add t-butyl group next, which is directed by the ethoxy group to ortho or para.
3. Then, add nitro group, which is directed by the ethoxy and t-butyl groups.

But how would nitro be added third? Because the ring is still activated by ethoxy and t-butyl, so nitration is possible.

Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so adding it last would deactivate the ring, but perhaps it's necessary for the structure.

So, the steps would involve:

- Friedel-Crafts ethoxylation? Or perhaps using another method to add ethoxy.

Wait, Friedel-Crafts is for Alkylation and acylation. To add an ethoxy group (ether), perhaps it's introduced via another method, like nucleophilic aromatic substitution.

Wait, but perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced by first adding a nitro group, then reducing it to an amine, then doing a substitution. Let's think.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after the ring has been activated by electron-withdrawing groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a tosylation. For example, introducing a tosyl group, which is a good leaving group, then substituting with ethoxide.

But tosyl groups are usually introduced via sulfonation (adding a sulfonic acid group) followed by something else.

Wait, let me think about each step in option B.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration → adds nitro group para to t-butyl (since t-butyl is ortho/para director).

iii) Fe/HCl → perhaps this is for some reduction. Wait, nitro groups can be reduced to amines with Fe/HCl. So, step iii would convert nitro to amine. So, t-butylbenzene nitro → t-butyl aniline.

iv) Nitration → adding another nitro group? That's not needed in the target. So option B's sequence is adding two nitro groups, which is incorrect.

So, option B is out.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butylbenzene.

ii) Sulfonation → adds sulfonic acid group.

iii) Nitration → adds nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction of nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amine.

vi) H3O+ heat → hydrolysis of diazonium salt to hydroxyl group.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → ethoxy group via SN2 substitution.

viii) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation again?

ix) Dilute H2SO4 → ?

Wait, let me try to follow this.

1. Friedel-Crafts: benzene → t-butylbenzene.

2. Sulfonation: t-butylbenzene → t-butylbenzenesulfonic acid. Now, the ring has two substituents: t-butyl and sulfonic acid (SO3H). The sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

3. Nitration: Since the ring now has t-butyl (activating, ortho/para) and sulfonic acid (deactivating, meta), the nitro group would be directed by the dominant effect. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivator, so the ring is deactivating overall. But the t-butyl is activating. So, it's possible that nitration occurs where the activating substituent (t-butyl) directs. So, nitro would be added ortho or para to t-butyl. Let's say para.

4. Fe/HCl: reduces nitro group to amine. So, now we have t-butyl, sulfonic acid, and amine (from nitro reduction). Wait, but the target doesn't have an amine. Hmm, perhaps this isn't the right path.

5. NaNO2/HCl: diazotization. But where is the amine? From step iv, we have an amine group. So, converting it to diazonium chloride.

6. H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salt to form a hydroxyl group. So, now, the ring has t-butyl, sulfonic acid, and hydroxyl groups.

7. NaOH, EtBr: perhaps a Williamson ether synthesis, where the hydroxyl group is converted to ethoxy. But for that, you need a good leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's an SN2 substitution, replacing a leaving group with ethoxy. But if the hydroxyl is on the ring, it's not a good leaving group unless it's activated. Hmm, perhaps this is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that's not common. So, I'm not sure if this step works.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl group is converted into a tosylate (using EtBr and a base) to make a good leaving group, then replaced with ethoxide. But I'm not certain.

Continuing, step viii: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation again, which adds another sulfonic acid group. But the target doesn't have this, so this might not be correct.

Step ix: dilute H2SO4 → perhaps removing the sulfonic acid group via acid treatment. But I'm not sure how that works.

This sequence seems complicated and may not lead to the desired product.

Let me check option A again.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: benzene → t-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: adds nitro group para to t-butyl → t-butyl nitrobenzene.

iii) Sulfonation: adds sulfonic acid group. Now, the ring has t-butyl, nitro, and sulfonic acid.

iv) NaNO2/HCl: diazotization requires an amine. But the compound has nitro groups, not amines. So, unless there's a step I'm missing, this doesn't make sense. So, perhaps this sequence is incorrect.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is introduced as a leaving group. So, after sulfonation, the sulfonic acid is converted into a good leaving group, perhaps via treatment with a base, and then substituted with an ethoxide.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonic acid group is removed in a later step.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve introducing substituents in a way that allows for multiple directing effects.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me think of an alternative approach. The target molecule has three substituents. Let me imagine the steps as:

1. Add ethoxy group first.
2. Add tert-butyl group next.
3. Add nitro group last.

So, the steps would be:

i) Introduce ethoxy group → ethoxybenzene.

ii) Introduce tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts → ethoxy and tert-butyl in positions 1 and 2 (ortho to each other).

iii) Then introduce nitro group in position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to tert-butyl.

But how is the nitro group added? Since the ring has ethoxy and tert-butyl groups, which are both activating, the ring is activated, so nitration is possible.

So, step iii would be nitration, which adds nitro group in a position directed by both substituents.

But where would that be? Let's say ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2. The next substituent (nitro) would be added where?

Ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2. The available positions are 3,4,5,6. Ethoxy (activating) directs to ortho (2 and 6), para (4). Tert-butyl (activating) directs to ortho (1 and 3), para (5).

So, the common positions directed by both would be position 3 (ortho to t-butyl) and position 6 (ortho to ethoxy but meta to t-butyl). Or position 4 (para to ethoxy but meta to t-butyl). Hmm, but the desired position is 3.

So, if the nitro group is added to position 3, which is ortho to t-butyl and meta to ethoxy, which might be possible.

So, the steps would be:

i) Ethoxylation.

ii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-butyl.

iii) Nitration.

But how would that happen in the reaction sequences given in the options?

Looking at the options, none of them directly match this sequence. Let me check each option again.

Option A starts with Friedel-Crafts (t-butyl), then nitration, then sulfonation, etc.

Option B starts with t-butyl, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, then another nitration.

Option C starts with t-butyl, then sulfonate, then nitrate.

Option D starts with nitrate, then Fe/HCl, then t-butyl, etc., which seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is adding ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro. But the options don't have that exact sequence.

Wait, but none of the options start with ethoxylation. So, perhaps the correct sequence is to add tert-butyl first, then nitro, then ethoxy.

But that would mean either the ethoxy is added last, perhaps via some substitution.

Wait, but how would you add ethoxy last? Because ethoxylation via Friedel-Crafts isn't possible after nitration, since nitro deactivates the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a different method, like nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring.

Wait, maybe the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after a leaving group is introduced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution of a nitro group. For example, nitro group is present, then reduced to amine, then substituted with ethoxy.

Wait, but the target doesn't have a nitro group in a position that would allow that. Hmm.

Another thought: the ethoxy group might be introduced via a Williamson ether synthesis, but that requires a good leaving group on the oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps through an aromatic substitution.

This is getting a bit too confusing. I think the key is to find which option correctly places the substituents in the desired positions.

Wait, the target has substituents at 1, 2, and 3. So, in terms of directing, after adding ethoxy at 1, the next substituent (t-butyl) would be at 2 (ortho), and then nitro at 3 (meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl). But how to achieve that.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups, but that would require the ring to be activated, which it is because both substituents are activating.

So, the nitration step would be possible.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add t-butyl → ethoxybenzene with t-butyl in ortho or para.

3. Nitration → adds nitro group.

But the options don't have this order. Let me see which option may have this.

Looking at the options, option B has steps:

i) t-butyl

ii) nitrate

iii) Fe/HCl (maybe reduce nitro to amine)

iv) nitrate again

v) diazotize

vi) hydrolyze

vii) NaOH, EtBr (possibly introduce ethoxy)

But I think option B adds two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option D: steps are nitrate, reduce, alkylate, nitrate again, etc. Also seems wrong.

Option A: t-butyl first, nitrate, sulfonate, then diazo, etc.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but for that, the ring must have a good leaving group. How can that be achieved?

Perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution of a nitro group. Let's see:

- Add nitro group → nitrobenzene.

- Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

- Diazotize → diazonium salt.

- Hydrolyze to hydroxyl group → phenol.

- Then, perform a nucleophilic substitution with ethoxide → ethoxy group.

But in that case, the nitro group is replaced by ethoxy, which would change the position. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction, but that's for introducing acyl groups, which would then be reduced to CH2 groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution on a tosyl group. So, the steps would be:

1. Tosylate the ring → tosyl group.

2. Substitute with ethoxide → ethoxy group.

But how to get the tosyl group onto the ring.

Wait, perhaps the tosyl group is added via sulfonation (adding a sulfonic acid group) followed by treatment with a base to convert it into a tosylate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the option where the nitro group is added last, and the substituents are directed correctly.

Looking at option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro group para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group. But this is incorrect.

So, option B is out.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → SO3H group.

iii) Nitrate → nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) diazotize → N2+Cl-.

vi) H3O+ heat → hydroxyl group.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → substitute with ethoxy.

So, after step vii, the ring would have t-butyl, sulfonate, and ethoxy. Then, step viii is sulfonate again, which is not needed. So, this option may not be correct.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The target molecule has nitro at position 3. When adding the nitro group, it should be meta to one substituent and ortho to another.

Wait, another possibility: The nitro group is added second, and the ethoxy group is added third. But that would require the ring to have two substituents, one of which allows the nitro group to be added in the correct position, and then the ethoxy group added in another.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is: first nitro, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. But nitro is deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts alkylation (for tert-butyl) difficult.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first add ethoxy, then nitro, then tert-butyl. But ethoxy is activating, nitro is deactivating, but tert-butyl is added via Friedel-Crafts which requires an activating ring.

Wait, but after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts won't work. So, that's not possible.

Thus, the only feasible way is to add the deactivating group (nitro) last, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, which are activating.

So, the sequence would be:

1. Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

2. Add tert-butyl → ethoxy and tert-butyl in positions 1 and 2.

3. Add nitro → position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

But how to achieve this in the options provided.

Looking at the options again, perhaps none of them explicitly follow this order, but one of them might have the correct step sequence.

Wait, looking at option B, the steps are:

i) Friedel-Crafts (t-butyl).

ii) Nitration → nitro para to t-butyl.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group (probably not correct).

So, option B introduces two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option A:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro para.

iii) Sulfonation → sulfonic acid.

iv) NaNO2 → but no amine present.

Hmm, not correct.

Option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl.

ii) Sulfonate → SO3H.

iii) Nitration → nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → amine.

v) diazo → N2+.

vi) H3O+ → OH.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → ethoxy.

So, after step vii, the ring has t-butyl, sulfonate, and ethoxy.

Then, step viii is sulfonate again, which is not helpful.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl.

iv) Nitration → another nitro.

But that's incorrect as well.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is present.

So, the sequence could be:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro para to t-butyl.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize.

5. Hydrolyze to hydroxyl.

6. Substitute with ethoxy.

So, steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts (t-butyl).

ii) Nitration.

iii) Reduction (Fe/HCl).

iv) Diazotization.

v) Hydrolysis.

vi) NaOH, EtBr.

Looking at the options, which option has this sequence?

Looking at option B: steps i to vii.

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl (reduces nitro to amine).

iv) Nitrate again → which would be incorrect, as we don't want another nitro.

So, option B is out.

Looking at option C:

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

iv) Fe/HCl (reduce nitro to amine).

v) Diazotize.

vi) H3O+ → hydroxyl.

vii) NaOH, EtBr → ethoxy.

So, after step vii, the ring has t-butyl, sulfonate, and ethoxy.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonate group, so steps to remove it would be needed.

But option C's step viii is sulfonate again, which seems wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is removed in a later step. But option C's step ix is dilute H2SO4, which might protonate sulfonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate is removed via acid treatment, but the steps don't show that.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is in option B, but I'm missing something. Let me re-examine option B.

Option B:

i) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl.

ii) Nitration → nitro para.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iv) Nitration → another nitro group (not desired).

So, option B is not correct because it adds two nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps step iv in option B isn't a nitration but something else. Let me read the steps again.

Option B's step iv is HNO3/H2SO4, which is nitration. So, it's adding another nitro group, which is incorrect.

So, option B is out.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should think about what each option's final structure would look like.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has substituents at 1,2,3. So, if the first substituent is t-butyl, the second is nitro, and the third is ethoxy.

Wait, so the ethoxy group is added last.

But how? Because after adding nitro, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution of a nitro group. For example:

1. Add t-butyl.

2. Nitrate → nitro para.

3. Reduce nitro to amine.

4. Diazotize.

5. Hydrolyze to hydroxyl.

6. Substitute hydroxyl with ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitrate.

iii) Reduction.

iv) Diazotization.

v) Hydrolysis.

vi) Substitute.

Looking at the options, option B includes steps i to vii.

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Nitrate.

iii) Fe/HCl (reduction).

iv) Nitrate again. (No, this is not desired.)

So, option B is not correct.

Option C includes steps up to vii, which would be:

i) Friedel-Crafts.

ii) Sulfonate.

iii) Nitrate.

iv) Reduction.

v) Diazotize.

vi) Hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH, EtBr.

So, after step vii, substituents are t-butyl, sulfonate, and ethoxy.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonate group, so perhaps sulfonate is removed in a later step, but option C's steps don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is introduced as a temporary group to direct the nitration, then removed.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is option B, but I'm not fully understanding it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is option D.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitro.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

Which would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

So, option D is incorrect.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that perhaps none of the options are perfect, but perhaps option B is the closest.

Wait, perhaps option B's step iv is a nitration, but it's not adding a new nitro group. Maybe it's a different nitration condition.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the directing effects.

Wait, perhaps the nitration in option B's step iv is in a different position.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B.

Wait, no, since option B's step iv adds another nitro group, which is not desired.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the target molecule's nitro group is introduced via a different pathway, such as using a diazonium salt to introduce it in the right position.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added via a meta director from another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups, but that would require the ring to be activated, which it is because both substituents are activating.

So, the steps would involve:

i) Add ethoxy → ethoxybenzene.

ii) Add t-butyl → directed by ethoxy to ortho or para.

iii) Nitrate → nitro group added in a position directed by both substituents.

But none of the options have this sequence.

Wait, perhaps option B is the answer, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps option D is the correct one.

Wait, option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → t-butyl aniline.

iv) Nitrate → adds another nitro group. No, that can't be right.

So, option D is out.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all options, and perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, going back to the target molecule, the substituents are 1-ethoxy, 2-t-butyl, 3-nitro.

So, for the nitro group to be at position 3, it must be directed by an activating group to a meta position.

If the ring has ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2, then the nitro group would be added at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl.

But how to achieve that in the options.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on the analysis, I think the correct option is option B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the substituent's directing effects.

The target has:

- Ethoxy (ortho/para)

- t-butyl (ortho/para)

- Nitro (meta)

So, the nitro group is meta to one substituent and ortho to another.

Wait, the nitro group is at position 3. Let's imagine the ring:

1: ethoxy.

2: t-butyl.

3: nitro.

So, nitro is ortho to t-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

So, when adding nitro, the ring has ethoxy (activating, ortho/para) and t-butyl (activating, ortho/para). The nitro group is added meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl.

So, the nitro group is added in a position that's ortho to t-butyl and meta to ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add ethoxy.

2. Add t-butyl.

3. Add nitro.

The nitro group is added third, directed by the existing substituents.

But looking at the options, only option B starts with t-butyl, then nitrate, which might achieve that.

Wait, but in option B, after adding t-butyl and nitro, the steps then reduce the nitro to amine, which isn't desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is not covered in the options, but among the given options, option B is the closest.

But I'm not fully confident. After a lot of thinking, perhaps the correct answer is option B.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the order of adding substituents is critical due to the directing effects of the substituents. The target molecule has three substituents: an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at position 1, a tert-butyl group (-C(CH3)3) at position 2, and a nitro group (-NO2) at position 3. The ethoxy and tert-butyl groups are activating (ortho/para directors), while the nitro group is deactivating (meta director). The sequence of reactions must ensure that each substituent is added in the correct position relative to the others.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely para to the tert-butyl group.
   - **Step iii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is not present in the target molecule.
   - **Steps iv–ix**: These steps involve diazotization, hydrolysis, and other reactions, but the introduction of the ethoxy group is unclear and inconsistent with the target structure.
   - **Conclusion**: The sulfonic acid group introduced in step iii is not part of the target molecule, making this option incorrect.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely para to the tert-butyl group.
   - **Step iii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iv**: Another nitration step is performed, which introduces an additional nitro group, inconsistent with the target molecule.
   - **Conclusion**: The introduction of two nitro groups makes this option incorrect.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
   - **Step ii**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group (-SO3H), which is not present in the target molecule.
   - **Step iii**: Nitration adds a nitro group, but the position is unclear due to the presence of the sulfonic acid group.
   - **Steps iv–vii**: These steps involve reduction, diazotization, and hydrolysis, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the correct substitution pattern.
   - **Conclusion**: The sulfonic acid group introduced in step ii is not part of the target molecule, making this option incorrect.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
   - **Step ii**: Fe/HCl reduces the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds the tert-butyl group.
   - **Step iv**: Another nitration step is performed, introducing an additional nitro group, inconsistent with the target molecule.
   - **Conclusion**: The introduction of two nitro groups makes this option incorrect.

### Final Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences fully align with the desired substitution pattern for the target molecule. However, **Option B** comes closest to the correct sequence, as it involves adding the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration. While it introduces an additional nitro group, it is the most plausible sequence among the given options.

**Answer: B**
