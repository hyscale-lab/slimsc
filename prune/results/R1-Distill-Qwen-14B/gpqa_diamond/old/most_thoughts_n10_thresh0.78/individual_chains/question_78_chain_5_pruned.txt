Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a point r and time t, given that the charge q was moving along a trajectory s(t). The setup mentions that t is greater than tr, which is the time when the field was generated. So, I think the fields we're considering are retarded potentials because the effects travel at the speed of light.

Wait, right, retarded potentials are used when the charges are moving, so their effects on distant points are delayed. The fields at a point depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

The problem gives me options for V and A. Let me recall the expressions for these potentials. I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just the static Coulomb potential anymore because the charge is moving. But wait, wait—no, actually, the scalar potential V is still the static potential if we're using the retarded time. Or is it more complicated?

Wait, no, the scalar potential for a moving charge in the context of retarded potentials is similar to the static case but evaluated at the retarded time. So V(r, t) would be (q)/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr. But when we observe at time t, the charge was at a different position. Oh, but the options have V as 1/r, which is the static case. Hmm, but that's probably because when considering the fields at time t, the potentials are evaluated at the same point r, but the charge's position at tr is such that the distance is d, perhaps?

Wait, the problem states that d is the vector from the field generating point (at time tr) to r. So the distance would be |d|, which is the separation between where the charge was when the field was generated (tr) and where the observation point r is. So, the scalar potential V is (q)/(4πε₀ |d|), but looking at the options, in all cases except C and D, the V is 1/r, which suggests that maybe the options
