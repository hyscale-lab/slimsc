Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through.

Wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each has spin up or down. But since they're in a 1D infinite well, which is a box, the particles are fermions, right? Because spin-1/2 implies they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each quantum state can hold only one electron with a specific spin. But wait, wait—no, wait. Each spatial state can have two particles, one with spin up and the other down. Oh right, that's the thing. So for each energy level, you can have a maximum of two particles.

The potential well is one-dimensional and of length L. The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are given by the formula E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And I think the problem defines E as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is just n² times E. So E_1 = E, E_2 =4E, E_3=9E, etc.

Now, the particles are four in number. Since they're fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion, which means each spatial state can hold up to two particles (with opposite spins). So to find the ground state, we need to fill the lowest energy states with as many particles as possible.

Ground state: All four particles would be in the lowest possible energy levels. Let's see. The first energy level (n=1) can hold two particles. Then the next level (n=2) can also hold two particles. So in the ground state, two particles are in n=1 (spin up and down) and two in n=2. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Oh no, wait. Wait, no—each energy level can hold two particles, one spin up and one spin down. So for four particles, the first two levels would be filled with two particles each.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. Each n can hold two particles. So for four particles, the first two n levels (n=1 and n=2) would each have two particles. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. Therefore, the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. So each of the n=1 particles contributes E, each of the n=2 contributes 4E. So two E's and two 4E's.

So total energy of ground state: 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Because when you have multiple particles, the energy is just the sum of each particle's energy. So each n=1 gives E, each n=2 gives 4E. So two E's and two 4E's: 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option C says the ground state is 4E, first excited 10E, second 15E. But wait, perhaps I'm getting the ordering wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the count. Let me recount. Each n can hold two particles. We have four particles. So n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So the total energy is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E? But looking at the options, option C's ground state is 4E, which doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I've confused the order of the states. Wait, the ground state for four particles would be the lowest possible configuration. Hmm, let's think of the particles filling the lowest energy states. So n=1 can have two, then n=2 can have two, so that's all four. So the total is 2*(1^2 E) + 2*(2^2 E) = 2E + 8E=10E. So the ground state is 10E.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option C says the ground state is 4E, but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the particles are bosons? No, because spin-1/2 implies fermions. So they have to obey Pauli exclusion.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the lowest possible energies, considering that each state can be filled by two particles. Let me think about the possible configurations.

Wait, perhaps in the ground state, all four particles are in the same n level? But wait, that's impossible because each n can hold a maximum of two particles. So four particles can't all be in n=1.

So ground state must have n=1 with two particles and n=2 with two particles. So the total energy is 10E.

Then the first excited state would be when we promote one particle to the next available state. Wait, but how do the excited states work? The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement where the particles are in higher energy states but the lowest possible.

Wait, perhaps the ground state is the lowest possible configuration, which is two particles in n=1 and two in n=2, leading to 10E. Then, the first excited state might be when one of the n=2 particles is promoted to n=3. Let me calculate.

Wait, n=3's energy is 9E. So if we have three particles in n=2 and one in n=3? No, wait, no. Because each n can hold two particles. So the initial state is n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). To get the first excited state, perhaps one particle from n=2 moves to n=3.

So now, the distribution would be n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So the total energy would be 2*E + 1*4E +1*9E = 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Wait, but wait, that's three particles. No, we have four particles, so maybe two
