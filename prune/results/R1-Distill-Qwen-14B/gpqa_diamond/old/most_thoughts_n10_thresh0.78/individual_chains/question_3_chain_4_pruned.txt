Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. 

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ plus sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. And the operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. We need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ where O is the operator. So I need to calculate that for this state and the given operator.

Let me break this down. The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. That is, 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So to find ⟨σz⟩, I can calculate it as the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, so the probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2. Let me compute that: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. So 0.25* (+1) + 0.75*(−1). So 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. It's represented as [[0,1],[1,0]], right? Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |−x⟩, which are (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2) and (|↑⟩ - |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and −1, respectively.

But wait, our state is a superposition in the σz basis. So to calculate ⟨σx⟩, maybe it's easier to express the state in terms of σx eigenstates, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can compute ⟨σx⟩ directly using the given state.

Another approach: The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ† σx ψ. Let's compute this.

ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as a column vector. In the basis |↑⟩, |↓⟩, the state is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is [0.5*, (sqrt(3)/2)*] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute this step by step. Let me denote ψ as [a, b], so a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

The matrix multiplication σx * ψ is [[0,1],[1,0]] [a; b] = [b; a].

Then, ψ† σx ψ is the dot product of [a*, b*] with [b, a]. So a* b + b* a.

So ψ† σx ψ = a b* + b a*.

Wait, a is 0.5, which is real. So a* = a. Similarly, b is sqrt(3)/2, which is real, so b* = b.

So the expression becomes a*b + b*a = 2ab.

Compute ab: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4 ≈ 0.43
