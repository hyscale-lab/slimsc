Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. Also, the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Å, and the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE).

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation for population ratios of energy levels. The Boltzmann factor relates the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels to the temperature. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g's are the statistical weights, E's are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. Does that mean that the ratio n2/n1 is lower when the star is cooler?

Wait, but the ratio depends exponentially on the inverse of temperature. So, if the temperature decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, making the ratio n2/n1 smaller. So, when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n2/n1 decreases. That's consistent with what's given in the problem.

So, the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K) compared to when it does (T=5500 K). So, the factor is (n2/n1)_6000 / (n2/n1)_5500.

But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, (n2/n1)_6000 is larger than (n2/n1)_5500. So the factor would be greater than 1.

We need to compute the ratio of the two ratios.

But wait, the energy difference between the two levels is given in terms of the wavelength of the transition. The transition corresponds to a wavelength λ of 1448 Å. So, the energy difference ΔE = hc/λ.

Let me calculate ΔE. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So ΔE = hc/(
