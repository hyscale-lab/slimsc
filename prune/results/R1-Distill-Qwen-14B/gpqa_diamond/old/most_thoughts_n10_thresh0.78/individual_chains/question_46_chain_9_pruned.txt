Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and figuring out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

First, I need to remember what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I recall, Grubbs is a catalyst used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So, essentially, it breaks and reforms double bonds by swapping substituents between the carbons involved in the double bond.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have a double bond starting at carbon 1. The structure would be CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-... Hmm, wait. No, wait. Let me think again. Pent has five carbons, so numbering from 1 to 5. 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So structure is:

Carbon 1: double bond to C2. So C1 is CH₂=, C2 is CH-, C3 is CH(CH3), and then C4 and C5 are CH2 and CH3?

Wait no, wait. Let me write it out:

Structure for 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Carbon 1: CH2= (since the double bond starts at 1). Then Carbon 2: CH- (since pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, but with a methyl branch on carbon 3. So for 3-methyl, carbon 3 has a CH(CH3) group.

Wait, so correct structure: CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, wait, wait. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)(CH2CH3)? No, wait, no. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. 3-methyl would add a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that would make five carbons? Let me count: 1 (CH2=), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3). So yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait another point. The molecule is racemic, which means it's a 50:50 mixture of enantiomers. So, since the starting alkene is a chiral molecule, it has two enantiomers. But wait, is the starting molecule actually chiral?

Hmm. Let's look at the structure again. Structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂-CH3. Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must have a stereogenic center. So looking at carbon
