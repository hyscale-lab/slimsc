Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and take notes.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and based on that, I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

First, I'll try to outline what's happening in each reaction.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I remember that when something reacts in a molar ratio, the number of equivalents can give a clue about the formula. So 8 equivalents suggests that maybe B is a diatomic gas, because 8 would come into play with something like O2 or Cl2.

Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. 2 equivalents again might hint at diatomic D. So maybe D is a diatomic gas like O2 or something else?

Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid. So when C reacts with H2O, it breaks down into A, F, and G. Strong and weak acids—could this involve something like the decomposition of a salt into a strong acid and a weak acid? Maybe if C is a nitrate salt, like a nitrate with another anion. For example, if C is a nitrate that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid (like HNO3) and a weak acid. Or perhaps it's a sulfide or carbonate? Wait, but the products are acids. Let me think.

Wait, when a salt of a weak acid and a strong base is hydrolyzed, it can produce weak acid. Alternatively, maybe the salt is of a weak base and a strong acid, which would release a strong acid when reacted with water. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about reaction 3 again. C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So perhaps C is a nitrate or sulfate that when it breaks down, releases HNO3 (strong acid) and another weak acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfite, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I can think of a specific example. For instance, if C is Cu(NO3)2, and when it reacts with water, it might decompose, but that's not right. Alternatively, maybe C is a transition metal compound. Wait, another approach: maybe C is a metal nitrate. Let's think about the reaction where a nitrate reacts with something else.

Wait, another clue: Reaction 3 produces two different acids. So, perhaps the salt C is a nitrate and another anion. For example, maybe C is something like Cu(NO3)2. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes into Cu(OH)2 (which would be A, a solid?), and HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid. Wait, but how? Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate of a heavier metal. Wait, perhaps it's a nitrate that when heated or in water, it decomposes into a metal hydroxide, water, and nitric acid. Hmm, but that might not produce two acids.

Wait, another angle: reaction 3 produces two different acids. So maybe one is HNO3 and another is H2SO4? Or maybe HClO4 and something else? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a salt like (NH4)2Cr2O7, which upon decomposition produces H2Cr2O7 and NH4OH. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate of a transition metal. Let me think about how nitrates decompose. For example, when a nitrate of a metal decomposes upon heating, it typically forms the metal oxide, oxygen, and nitrogen. But reaction 3 involves reacting with water, not heating. So maybe it's a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrate is converted into an acid.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal nitrate, and when it reacts with water, it produces a strong acid and a weak acid. For instance, if C is NaNO3, but that's a sodium nitrate, which upon hydrolysis might not produce two acids. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrate that when hydrolyzed produces HNO3 (strong acid) and another acid. Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate of a metal that is amphoteric. Let's say C is Al(NO3)3. When Al(NO3)3 reacts with water, it might hydrolyze into Al(OH)3 and HNO3. But that's only one acid. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of C with water produces two acids. So maybe the salt C is something like (NH4)2SO4, which would decompose into NH3 (a weak base, but not an acid) and H2SO4 (strong acid). But that's only one acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's probably more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe C contains two different anions. For example, if C is a salt like NaNO3 and NaHCO3, but that's a bit of a stretch.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrate and carbonate. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a mix of two salts, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me think about the other reactions. Let's see reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. H is a solvent, so what's D and B? B is a gas that when reacted with D in 1:1 ratio gives a solvent. If D is something like HCl (a gas), and B is something else. Wait, B is a gas that reacts with D in 1:1. If B and D are both diatomic, then their ratio is 1:1, but more likely, perhaps they are the same gas but reacting in a way that combines.

Wait, D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let's think about possible diatomic gases. For example, if B is O2 and D is Cl2, then 1:1 would produce ClO2? But ClO2 is a liquid at room temp, but maybe not. Alternatively, if B is Cl2 (gas) and D is O2 (gas), reaction could produce something else. Or maybe B is O2 and D is H2, but that's 2:1 in H
