Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. So, the experiment involves creating a bicistronic vector with these two proteins, then testing their expression in a mouse model. The problem is that when they look under the confocal, they don't see any green signal. I need to figure out why.

First, let me understand the setup. They made a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, each protein should have a fluorescent tagâ€”ligand with mCherry and receptor with eGFP.

Looking at the regulation: the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, often used for overexpression. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so it can drive expression of the downstream gene without a second promoter. So, the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor from the IRES.

Now, the stops. Between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. That means in the absence of Cre, the stop cassette prevents expression of mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before eGFP. Wait, the vector is lox-Cre, so when Cre is present, it will recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes.

But wait, the vector is bicistronic, so when Cre is introduced, which lox sites get cut? LoxP and lox2272 are different; Cre can only recognize loxP sites. Lox2272 is a variant that Cre can also cut, but sometimes with different efficiencies. So, when Cre is present, it will remove the loxP stops and the lox2272 stops.

Wait, the question says they used a lox-Cre vector. So in the presence of Cre, the vector will excise the stop cassettes. So, the ligand is under CBA, which is a promoter, so it should be expressed. The receptor is after IRES, which is an internal ribosome entry site, so it doesn't need a promoter because IRES allows translation initiation without a promoter in some contexts.

Wait, but in the vector, the ligand ORF is first, followed by a stop cassette, then the receptor ORF, which has its own stop cassette. So, without Cre, the ligand would be expressed (since its promoter is active), but the receptor wouldn't be because it's behind the stop
