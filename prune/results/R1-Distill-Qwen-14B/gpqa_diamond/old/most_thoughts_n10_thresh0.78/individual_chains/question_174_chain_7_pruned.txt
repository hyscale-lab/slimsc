Okay, so I've got this physics problem about nuclear fission, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the nucleus has a mass M at rest, with rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy T1 of the more massive fragment and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. Right, so when a nucleus fissions, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and because of the conservation of energy and momentum, they'll move in opposite directions with some kinetic energy. Since the original nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission should be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV → E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission:

- Let the masses be m1 and m2, where m2 = 2 m1.

- m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → m1 + 2 m1 = 0.99 M → 3 m1 = 0.99 M → m1 = 0.33 M, m2=0.66 M.

Wait, but wait. The sum of the rest masses is 0.99 M. So the rest mass after fission is 0.99 M, so the rest mass energy is 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the mass has decreased, meaning that the mass defect (E=mc²) has been converted into kinetic energy.

So the total energy after fission is initial rest energy plus any kinetic energy. But wait, because the initial nucleus is at rest, its total energy is just its rest mass energy, 300 GeV. After fission, the total energy is the sum
