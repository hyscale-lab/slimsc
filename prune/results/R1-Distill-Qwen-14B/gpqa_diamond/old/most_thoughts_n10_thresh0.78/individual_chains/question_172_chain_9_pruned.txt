Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, let's try to understand what's being asked here.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to those in star_2. Oh wait, right, the energy levels in atoms are quantized, and their excitation depends on temperature. Since the stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), I can use the Boltzmann distribution to relate the excitation levels to temperature.

The energy difference between the considered energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. Wait, 1.38e-23 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, right, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. Interesting, so the energy difference ΔE is equal to k times some temperature factor? Or wait, no, the energy difference is ΔE itself, and we relate it to the excitation probability.

The Boltzmann factor tells us the population ratio between two energy levels. The formula is n_upper / n_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Wait, no, wait. The Boltzmann distribution says that the ratio of the number of particles in two energy levels is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So if the upper level is higher by ΔE, the ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

In this question, the excitation is higher in star_1. So star_1 has twice as many atoms in the excited state as star_2. Let me denote the ratio as (n_upper)_1 / (n_upper)_2 = 2. But using the Boltzmann factor, the ratio of excitation between the two stars would be:

(n_upper)_1 / (n_upper)_2 = [ (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_1)) ] / [ (g_upper / g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k T_2)) ) ]

Assuming the statistical weights g_upper and g_lower are the same for both stars, they cancel out. So the ratio simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k T_2) - ΔE/(k T_1) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let's write that again. The ratio is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Wait no, because (n_upper)_1 / (n_upper)_2 = 2. So:

exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Let me denote for each star:

For star 1: n1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) 
For star 2: n2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

So the ratio n1/n2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2)
