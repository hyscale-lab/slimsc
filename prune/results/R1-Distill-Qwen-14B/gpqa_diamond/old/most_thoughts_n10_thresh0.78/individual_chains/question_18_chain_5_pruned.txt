Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about elemental abundances in stars. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun, respectively. But wait, the problem is about their elemental abundances, so maybe the masses aren't directly relevant here. Although, sometimes mass can affect things like where the elements are produced, but in this case, since the question is about the photospheric composition using LTE and EW method, I think I can focus on the given abundance ratios.

The given data:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5

Wait, I think I got that right. Let me double-check. Yeah, because 12 is the base for the logarithm; I remember that from solar abundances.

The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2]? Or the ratio of Si in Star1 to Si in Star2.

Wait, no. The ratio is (n_Si, Star1) / (n_Si, Star2). Because the question is the ratio of silicon atoms in the two stars' photospheres.

But to get that, I think I need to find the abundance of Si in each star relative to the Sun, and then take the ratio.

Wait, let's think about the definitions of the abundance ratios. The square brackets [] here represent logarithmic abundance ratios relative to another element,
