Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Both stars have masses more than our Sun, but I don't think the mass directly affects the elemental ratio, unless it's about something like evolution, but the question says to use the EW method for elemental abundances, so maybe mass isn't a factor here.

Alright, the given data: Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. That means the abundance of silicon relative to iron in Star_1 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3 dex. Then, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2. So, magnesium to silicon ratio in Star_2 is higher than in the Sun by 0.3.

Wait, but wait. The notation can be a bit confusing. The brackets [X/Y] mean log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. So, for example, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that (Si/Fe)_star1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun. Same for the others.

Also, given [Fe/H]_1 = 0 and [Mg/H]_2 = 0. So, the iron to hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. Same for Star_2's Mg to H ratio. H is hydrogen.

The Sun's photosphere has 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5. Wait, let me parse that. That equation is 12 + log10(Fe/H) = 7.5. So log10(Fe/H) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So Fe/H = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, the equation is 12 + log10(Mg/H) =7. So log10(Mg/H) =7-12= -5. So Mg/H =10^-5.

Wait, but wait, the notation can be a bit tricky. Let me make sure I get this right. The question says "[Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex". That means (Fe/H)_star1 = (Fe/H)_sun. Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So 0 means same as Sun.

Same with [Mg/H]_2 =0, so Mg/H in Star2 is same as Sun.

So, for Star_1, [Fe/H] = 0 → Fe/H = 1 (since 10^0=1). Wait, no, wait. [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1=0 → log10(Fe/H)_1 = log10(Fe/H)_sun. So (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. Similarly for Star_2.

So for the Sun: log10(Fe/H) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → Fe/H = 1e-4.5. Similarly, log10(Mg/H) = 7 -12 =-5 → Mg/H =1e-5.

Wait, but let me think again. The Sun's photosphere composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) =7.5-12 =-4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^-4.5. Same for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7 → log10(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

So for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H. But the Sun's Fe/H is 1e-4.5. So Star_1's Fe/H is same as Sun. So, Star_1's Fe abundance is same as Sun relative to H.

Now, Star_1's [Si/Fe]_1=0.3. So (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun. Because [X/Y] is log((X/Y)_star / (X/Y)_sun). So (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (Si/Fe)_sun.

But wait, what's (Si/Fe)_sun? Let me see. We know (Fe/H)_sun is 1e-4.5, and (Mg/H)_sun is 1e-5.

Wait, but I'm not given (Si/Fe)_sun. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can compute it. Because I know the photospheric composition of the Sun, with the given nFe/nH and nMg/nH. But what about Si?

Wait, the Sun's composition is given for Fe and Mg. So I think we need to assume that the Sun's [Si/Fe
