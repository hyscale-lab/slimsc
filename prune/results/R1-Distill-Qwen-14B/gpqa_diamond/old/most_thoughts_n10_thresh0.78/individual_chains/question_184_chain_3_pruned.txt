Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the high-yield synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. They've given four options, each with a sequence of reactions, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, on the benzene ring, there are three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure to clarify. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position numbering: if position 1 is ethoxy, then position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro.

But wait, when numbering substituents on benzene, the lowest possible numbers are used. So if the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3, that's correct.

Now, I need to think about how to introduce these groups in the right order. Each substitution (nitration, alkylation, ethoxylation) has specific conditions and may require activating or deactivating the ring.

Benzene is the starting material. Let's think about the directing effects of each group:

1. Nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating.
2. Ethoxy groups are activating (since O- is an electron-donating group) and ortho/para directors.
3. tert-Butyl groups are bulky and are deactivating (as alkyl groups are weakly activating but can be deactivating if bulky?), but wait, no, alkyl groups are actually activating (since they donate electrons via inductive effect). Wait, no, wait: alkyl groups are activating because they donate electrons through the sigma bonds (inductive effect), making the ring more reactive. Wait, but the substituents' activating or deactiv
