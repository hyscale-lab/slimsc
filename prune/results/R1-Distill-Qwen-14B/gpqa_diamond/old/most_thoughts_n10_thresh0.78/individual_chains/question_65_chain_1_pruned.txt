Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out the major products for each. Let's take them one at a time.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol treated with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. But wait, in the presence of H+ after, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by something else.

Wait, the starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom. The structure here is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, the spiro is between two rings: one is a three-membered ring? Or wait, spiro[3.5] would mean two rings, one with 3 carbons (like cyclopropane) and the other with 5? Or maybe the spiro is between a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring. Hmm, maybe the structure is more like a bicyclic system but connected at a single atom.

Wait, the molecule is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So, non means nine carbons. Spiro[3.5] implies one ring of 3 carbons (probably cyclopropane) and another of 5 carbons (cyclopentane?), connected at the spiro atom. Wait, but the formula is non-5-en-1-ol. So, the main chain is nine carbons, but the spiro might be part of that.

Alternatively, maybe it's a spiro structure where the two rings are connected. The 1-vinyl group is attached to the spiro atom, which is a secondary alcohol (since it's an -ol). So, the structure probably has a cyclopropane ring and a cyclopentene ring connected at one carbon, with a vinyl group attached to that same carbon.

When this is treated with a strong base like KH in THF, which
