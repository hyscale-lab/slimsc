Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me see what it's about. Hmm, four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy E is given as pi^2 hbar^2/(2mL^2). The options are A to D, each with different multiples of E.

Wait, I remember that for a particle in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula is E_n = (n²) * E, where E is the base energy unit. So each particle's state is determined by its quantum number n.

But wait, these are identical particles with spin-1/2. Oh right, that means they are fermions. So the Pauli exclusion principle applies. Fermions can't occupy the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, including spin.

In a 1D well, the quantum state of a particle is described by its quantum number n and spin. Since spin-1/2 has two possible states, up and down, each n can hold two particles with opposite spins.

So for four particles, I need to figure out how their n values are assigned, considering the spin.

Let me think about the ground state first. The ground state would be the lowest possible energy configuration. So the first two particles would occupy the lowest energy level, n=1, each with opposite spins. Then the next two particles would go into the next available level, n=2, again with opposite spins. Wait, but n=2 can hold two particles as well. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

So the total energy would be 2*(n=1) + 2*(n=2) = 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, that would be the total energy for four particles.

Wait no, the question says calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited, etc., so perhaps each state refers to the system's total energy? Or per particle? Hmm, the question says "energies of the ground state... of the system", so the total energy of the system. So yeah, sum of all particles' energies.

So ground state: two in n=1, two in n=2. So 2*(1E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E = 10E. Wait, but that can't be, because for four particles, the sum is 10E. So the ground state energy would be 10E? Or wait, no, wait. Each particle's energy is n² E, so two particles in n=1 contribute 2*(1E) and two in n=2 contribute 2*(4E). So 2E + 8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait but looking at the options, option C has 10E as the second excited state. Let me think again.

Wait no, perhaps I miscalculated. Let me think about the possible states for four fermions.

In a 1D well, each n can have two particles (spin up and down). For four particles, the first two go into n=1 (both spins), next two into n=2 (both spins). So the ground state is when all four are filled up to n=2. So the total energy is (1² +1² +2² +2²) * E = (1+1+4+4) E = 10E.

Wait, but if the particles are identical fermions, the only way to have the lowest energy is to fill the lowest orbitals. So the ground state is 10E.

What about the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible arrangement. So how do you get the first excited state?

In the ground state, we have two particles each in n=1 and n=2. To get the first excited state, perhaps we promote one particle from n=2 to n=3. But wait, wait, no. Let me think. The total energy of the system in the ground state is 10E. The first excited state would be the next possible configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the ground state is when all four are in the lowest possible states, meaning n=1 and n=2. The next possible state would involve the next available n. Let me think about the possible configurations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the system in terms of the possible ways to fill the orbitals. The ground state would have the first four lowest possible states: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles). So that's 2*1E + 2*4E = 10E.

What's the next possible state? The first excited state would have one particle promoted to a higher n. So to get the next energy, perhaps replace one n=2 with n=3.

So in the first excited state, three particles are in n=1 and one in n=3. Wait, but wait, no. Because each n can hold maximum two particles. So if you have four particles, you can have n=1 (2), n=2 (2) as ground. To get the first excited, perhaps you have n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). But wait, can you have that? Because each n can hold two particles.

Wait, no. For four particles, the next state after n=2 is filled would be adding a third particle to n=3. Because n=1 is filled (2), n=2 filled (2), so next is n=3 (2). But wait, wait, no, because we have four particles. So ground state: 2 in n=1, 2 in n=2. To go to first excited, perhaps one of the n=2 electrons is promoted to n=3. So now, you have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3. Wait, but that's still four particles.

So the energies would be 2*(1E) +1*(4E) +1*(9E) = 2E +4E +9E =15E. Hmm, so the first excited state's energy is 15E. But looking at the options, option C lists the second excited as 15E. Hmm,
