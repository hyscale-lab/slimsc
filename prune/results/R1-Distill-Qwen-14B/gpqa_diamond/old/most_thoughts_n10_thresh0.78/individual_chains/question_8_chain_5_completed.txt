Alright, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants related to their resistance against anthracnose, a fungal disease. Hmm, okay, I'll need to figure out which conclusion is correct based on the given data.

Let me start by understanding the setup. They've performed an experiment where they knocked out three genes: G1, G2, G3. Then they made some double mutants as well. The idea is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So transcription factors usually regulate the expression of other genes, right?

The results show the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type, which is 100%. The lower the percentage, the more susceptible the plant is to the disease.

Let's list out the data:

- g1: 75% → So, its resistance is a bit lower than wild-type but not super susceptible. Maybe partially compromised.
- g2: 0% → This plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So this gene is probably critical for resistance.
- g3: 50% → This is halfway. So the gene product is maybe contributing but not essential on its own.
- g1g3: 10% → Very low. This is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. Interesting.
- g2g3: 0% → Same as g2. So when both are mutated, it's as bad as g2 alone.
- g1g2: 0% → Same as g2. So, when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, it's as susceptible as g2 alone.

I remember that in genetics, when a double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype than either of the single mutants, it's called epistasis. So, the gene that's epistatic masks the effect of the other gene. Also, if a double mutant is more severe than either parent, it might suggest additive or synthetic effects.

Let me think about what each single mutant tells me.

g2 has 0% resistance. That's very severe. So G2 might be a key gene, probably a transcription factor since the question says at least one is. If G2 is a TF, it would regulate other genes involved in resistance. If G2 is knocked out, those downstream genes aren't expressed, so the plant can't resist the pathogen.

g1 is at 75%. So when G1 is knocked out, the plant is less resistant but not as bad as g2. Maybe G1 is involved in the same pathway as G2 but not as critical, or perhaps it's part of a parallel pathway.

g3 is at 50%. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance but not as much as G2. So G3 might be another gene downstream or part of a different pathway.

Now, the double mutants. Let's see:

g1g2: 0% → Same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are out, it's as bad as when G2 is out. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because when G2 is missing, the effect of G1's absence doesn't matter anymore. So in other words, G2 acts upstream of G1. Because if G2 is gone, the pathway is broken regardless of G1.

g1g3: 10% → Lower than either single mutant. Wait, g1 is 75, g3 is 50. Together, they're at 10. That's much worse. Hmm, that's interesting. So knocking out both G1 and G3 makes the plant much more susceptible than either alone. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their functions might be additive or something.

g2g3: 0% → Same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, adding G3 doesn't change the outcome. So G2 is epistatic over G3 as well. So G2 is upstream of G3.

Putting this all together:

- G2 is a transcription factor because it's the most upstream and when knocked out, everything fails. The fact that the double mutant g1g2 is as bad as g2 suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. So G2's function is required for G1's function. So without G2, G1 doesn't matter. That fits with G2 being a transcription factor regulating G1.

- The g2g3 and g1g2 both being 0% suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G3 and G1. So G2 is upstream of these genes.

Now, looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their functions contribute additively. Like, each contributes a part, and together they're worse, but each alone isn't too bad. Or maybe they are redundant, but their redundancy is only partial.

Wait, but g1 is 75 and g3 is 50. So when both are out, it's 10. That's even worse than either. So maybe they're acting in parallel pathways. If both are knocked out, the plant can't do either pathway, so it's much worse. Alternatively, perhaps they function in the same pathway but their effects are additive.

Alternatively, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking out both would have a more severe effect than each alone. So that would fit with g1g3 being worse. But if they were in the same pathway, you might expect the effect to be similar to the more severe single mutant. Hmm, but 10% is much worse than either, so maybe they're in parallel pathways.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember what gene redundancy means. Redundant genes are those where each can compensate for the other. So if you knock out one, the other can take over, but knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype.

So for example, if G1 and G3 are redundant, then g1 would have the same resistance as wild-type (since G3 is active), and g3 would as well. But in reality, g1 is at 75 and g3 is at 50. So that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe they're partially redundant but not fully.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but their functions are additive. So each contributes a part. So if both are gone, resistance is worse than either alone.

Another thought: if G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G1 would reduce resistance but not eliminate it entirely, as G3 would still be active. Similarly, knocking out G3 would leave G1 active, but since G1's function is less effective than G3 (since g3's resistance is 50, which is worse than g1's 75), maybe G2 activates another gene that's better than G1 but G3 is not as good. Or perhaps G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2, but their functions are separate.

Wait, but the question says that at least one is a transcription factor, which we think is G2.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, but we thought G2 is the TF, so this option is probably wrong.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic towards G1.

Same promoter? That would mean they are potentially co-regulated. But I don't see anything about promoters in the data. Also, whether G3 is epistatic, let's think. If G3 is epistatic over G1, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3 (50%). But in our case, g1g3 is 10, which is worse, so perhaps not. So maybe B is not correct.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits. Not sure how that applies here. Also, G1 being epistatic towards G3. So if G1 is upstream of G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1, which is 75. But our data shows g1g3 is 10. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy would mean they can compensate for each other. So if both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either alone. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as the more severe of the two. But g1 is 75, g3 is 50, so the double mutant might be 50. But data shows 10. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm not thinking this correctly. Let's reevaluate.

If G2 is the TF, then it's upstream of others. So G2's product is needed to activate other genes (like G1 and G3). So without G2, those downstream genes (G1, G3) can't function, leading to no resistance (as in the g2, g2g3, g1g2 cases).

So, G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. Now, looking at the double mutant g1g3: 10% resistance.

If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, then perhaps they contribute to the same function. So if both are missing, the pathway is completely inactive, which is why it's 10%. But if they were in parallel pathways, then each would contribute, so losing both would reduce resistance more than either alone.

Wait, another thought: if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but functionally redundant. So each can do the same job. Then, knocking out one (g1 or g3) would have a partial effect, but knocking out both (g1g3) would be more severe. That fits with the data: g1 is 75, g3 is 50; together, 10, which is much worse. So that would suggest that G1 and G3 are redundant, but each contributes different levels of resistance.

Wait, but redundant genes usually have similar functions. If they were in the same pathway and redundant, then each alone would be okay. But here, g1 is at 75, which is better than g3's 50. Hmm, that complicates. So perhaps they are not fully redundant. Alternatively, maybe they are in parallel pathways that contribute to the same overall resistance.

Another approach: let's model the possible pathway.

G2 (TF) → activates G1 and G3.

G1 and G3 might be in the same pathway, or perhaps in parallel pathways.

If G1 and G3 are in the same pathway downstream of G2, then each contributes to the same process. So knocking out both would have a more severe effect than either alone.

But in the case of g1, the plant is 75% resistant, and g3 is 50%. So G2 is active, so G1 and G3 are expressed. So, without G1, resistance is 75, which is worse than wild-type (100). Without G3, 50. So perhaps G1 is a better contributor to resistance than G3.

Wait, but if G2 is a TF activating both, then in wild-type, both are present. So why is the resistance of the wild-type 100? Perhaps because both are functional. So the knockout effects are because each contributes to the system.

So the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% → since G2 is knocked out, neither G1 nor G3 are active, so no resistance.

g2g3: same as g2 → same reasoning.

g1g3: 10% → both G1 and G3 are knocked out, so the downstream resistance is very low. But wait, if G2 is active, wouldn't G1 and G3 be expressed? No, because in the g1g3 mutant, G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is functional. Wait, no: in the double mutant g1g3, G2 is wild-type, but G1 and G3 are knocked out. So without G1 and G3, but G2 is active. But G2 is a TF, so it's supposed to activate downstream genes. But if G2 is active, but the downstream genes (G1 and G3) are knocked out, then the resistance pathway is not functional. So the plant can't resist, which would mean 0% resistance. But the data says 10%, which is a bit confusing. Hmm, so maybe my model is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the double mutant g1g3 doesn't have G2 knocked out. Let me check: the question says the double mutants are g1g2, g1g3, and g2g3. So in g1g3, G2 is wild-type. So G2 is active, but G1 and G3 are knocked out.

If G2 is a TF that activates downstream genes, but those downstream genes (say G1 and G3) are not functional (knocked out), then the downstream resistance genes wouldn't be expressed. So the plant would have no resistance (0%). But in the data, g1g3 is 10%. Hmm, that's a problem for my model.

Wait, perhaps G2 is upstream of a different gene, say G4, which is the actual resistance gene. But I don't have data on G4. Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 are the actual resistance genes. Wait, but in the case of g2, which is 0%, that suggests that without G2, G1 and G3 can't function. So G2 must be required for G1 and G3's function, not just their expression.

Wait, maybe the presence of G2 is necessary for the activation of G1 and G3, but once activated, G1 and G3 are always on? No, because the single mutants have lower resistance.

Alternatively, perhaps G2 is a TF that activates a different gene, say X, which is the actual gene that confers resistance. So if G2 is knocked out, X isn't expressed, so resistance is 0. But then why would G1 and G3 have some effect?

Hmm, perhaps G1 and G3 are also TFs that regulate X, but in a way that's redundant or additive.

Wait, maybe G2, G1, and G3 are all part of a regulatory network. For instance, G2 activates both G1 and G3, which in turn activate other genes (like X) that provide resistance. So if G2 is out, G1 and G3 aren't expressed, hence X isn't expressed, leading to 0% resistance. If G1 is out, then G3 is expressed, but maybe G3 alone isn't enough to activate X fully, hence 75% resistance. Similarly, if G3 is out, G1 is expressed, but perhaps it's only half as effective, leading to 50% resistance.

Now, when both G1 and G3 are out (g1g3), X isn't activated at all. But wait, the data shows that in g1g3, the resistance is 10%. That's really low. So perhaps without G1 and G3, the actual resistance gene X is only weakly expressed, giving 10% resistance.

Alternatively, maybe G1 and G3 each contribute to the expression of X, and their combined knockout leads to very low expression.

Now, looking at the double mutant g1g3: without G1 and G3, but G2 is active. So G2 would activate G1 and G3, but since they're knocked out, perhaps G2 can't do anything else. Or maybe G2 has another target that can provide a small amount of resistance, hence 10% instead of 0.

But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the data shows that without G1 and G3, the plant's resistance is only 10%, which is worse than either of the single mutants. So if G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, and their effects are additive, then the double mutant would be worse than either single.

Now, looking at the options again.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the effect would be same as the more severe single mutant. But in our case, g1 is 75, g3 is 50, but the double is 10. So that's more severe than either, which doesn't fit with epistasis. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe I'm getting epistasis backwards. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another. If G1 is epistatic over G3, then when G1 is non-functional, the effect of G3 doesn't matter. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g1. But our data says 10, which is worse than g1. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as g3, which is 50. But the data is 10, so that doesn't fit either.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe G2 is not the transcription factor but another gene is.

Wait, the question says that at least one of the genes is a transcription factor acting upstream. So G2 is the most likely candidate because its knockout is the most severe. So G2's product is essential for resistance.

Now, considering that, what do the other options suggest?

Option A: G1 is a TF. But from the data, g2 is more severe, so G2 is more likely the TF.

Option B: G2 is TF. Okay, that fits. G1 and G3 have same promoter; perhaps they are co-regulated. G3 is epistatic towards G1.

If G3 is epistatic, then in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as g3, which is 50. But data is 10. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Pleiotropy would mean that G1 and G3 affect multiple traits, but in this case, all the data is about resistance. Not sure. If G1 is epistatic, then in g1g3, the resistance would be same as g1 (75), but data is 10. Doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Redundancy: when both are knocked out, effect worse than either. So that fits. But the epistasis part is confusing.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance is same as g1 (75), but data is 10. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps none of the options are perfectly fitting, but I must choose the best one.

Wait, another approach: let's rank the options.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So knocking out both leads to worse phenotype than either. Which matches the data (g1g3 is 10, which is worse than 75 and 50).

If G1 and G3 are redundant, then in the double mutant, the resistance is worse. So that makes sense.

Additionally, the option says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But wait, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the resistance would be same as G1's single mutant (75). But in reality, the double is 10. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the epistatic relationship.

Wait, maybe G2 is epistatic towards both G1 and G3. Because in the double mutants involving G2, like g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is same as g2. So G2 is epistatic, as per the data.

Now, looking at the options again, which option correctly states that G2 is a TF and epistatic?

Option A: G1 is TF, so no.

Option B: G2 is TF. It says G3 is epistatic towards G1. So in the g1g3 double, the resistance would be same as G3's, which is 50. But data is 10. Doesn't fit.

Option C: G2 is TF. G1 is epistatic towards G3. So g1g3 would be same as G1's, 75. Doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have redundancy. G1 is epistatic over G3.

If G1 is epistatic, but the double mutant is worse, perhaps the redundancy isn't complete, and their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype. That might make sense.

Wait, redundancy implies that each can compensate for the other. So if you lose both, the effect is worse than either. Which fits the data. So G1 and G3 are redundant.

Additionally, G2 is the TF. So from the data, the epistatic relationships are:

- G2 is epistatic towards G1 (since g1g2 is same as g2).

- G2 is epistatic towards G3 (since g2g3 same as g2).

So in the options, which option says G2 is TF and that G2 is epistatic towards G1 and G3?

Looking at the options:

Option A says G2 is epistatic towards G1. Yes, but G1 is TF in option A, which is unlikely.

Option B: G2 is TF. G3 is epistatic towards G1. But that would mean g1g3 is same as G3, which is 50. But data is 10. So no.

Option D: G2 is TF. G1 and G3 have redundancy. G1 is epistatic towards G3. Not sure.

Wait, but the option says that G1 is epistatic towards G3. So in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance would be same as G1's, which is 75. But data is 10. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. The fact that the double mutant g1g3 is 10% suggests that both G1 and G3 are necessary for a higher level of resistance. So without either, resistance is reduced, and without both, it's much worse.

Which would fit with G1 and G3 being in the same pathway and perhaps their functions are additive.

But the options don't seem to directly address this. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Gene redundancy: when both are knocked out, effect is worse than either. So that's correct.

But the epistatic part: if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then in the double mutant, the effect would be same as G1's single mutant (75). But the data is 10, so that's not correct.

Hmm, perhaps the option is not entirely correct, but given the options, I have to choose the best one.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic part in the option is not referring to the double mutant of G1 and G3 but to their relationship in another way.

Wait, perhaps the correct conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are in the same pathway downstream. The double mutant g1g3 is worse than either, suggesting they are additive, not redundant. So perhaps they are in the same pathway but their functions are additive.

But none of the options directly say that. Let's look again.

Option D: G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So when both are out, the effect is worse. That fits.

But the epistasis part is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D because it correctly identifies G2 as the TF and that G1 and G3 are redundant, even though the epistasis part doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning. Let me think again about the epistatic relationships.

If G2 is a TF upstream of both G1 and G3, then in the pathway: G2 → G1 and G3 → resistance.

So G2 is upstream of both. So G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3.

Which of the options mention that G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3?

Looking:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → correct for G1, but G2 is also epistatic towards G3 (as seen in g2g3 and g1g2).

Option B: G3 is epistatic towards G1 → no.

Option C: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → no.

Option D: G1 is epistatic towards G3 → no.

So none of the options directly say that G2 is epistatic towards both G1 and G3. But in the options, some do say G2 is TF.

Looking again, the correct conclusions should be:

- G2 is the TF.

- G2 is epistatic towards G1 and G3.

- G1 and G3 may be redundant or additive.

Looking at the options, which one fits this.

Option D says G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

But G1 being epistatic towards G3 doesn't fit the data. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that makes G1 the TF, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the double mutant g1g3 being more severe than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 have additive effects, not redundant. So if they are in the same pathway and their effects are additive, then their double knockout is worse than either. So that would suggest that they are in the same pathway, but not redundant.

But the options don't directly address that. Let's look at the options again.

Option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So that would mean that when both are knocked out, the effect is worse than either. Which fits. But the epistasis part doesn't fit.

So perhaps the best fit is Option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option D because it correctly identifies G2 as the TF, and the other parts may not directly correspond but are the best fit.

Wait, the question is about the interaction among the genes. So, the conclusion is about whether they show redundancy, pleiotropy, or something else, and their epistatic relationships.

From the data, the only thing we can definitely conclude about G2 is that it's epistatic over G1 and G3. So in the options, the correct one must have G2 as TF and G2 epistatic.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G2 is epistatic towards G1 → correct but not towards G3.

Option B: G2 is TF, but G3 is epistatic towards G1 → incorrect.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 epistatic towards G3 → does g1g3 data fit? No.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 redundant, G1 epistatic towards G3 → the redundancy part is correct but the epistasis is not.

Hmm. None of the options perfectly fit except perhaps Option D, which correctly identifies G2 as a TF and the redundancy between G1 and G3, even though the epistatic part might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Option D because G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. Their double knockout leads to a more severe phenotype than either single. So that makes sense.

As for the epistasis part, perhaps the option is not entirely correct, but given the options, it's the best fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps G1 and G3 are not in the same pathway but are in parallel pathways. So their knockout leads to a more severe phenotype because both pathways are affected. That would fit with the g1g3 data. But none of the options mention parallel pathways.

Wait, looking at the options, option D says G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. So if they are redundant, knocking out both would be worse than either. So that fits, and the fact that g1g3 is 10% makes sense.

So the conclusion is that G2 is a TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant. Now, about epistasis: G1 is epistatic towards G3. But if G1 is epistatic towards G3, then the double mutant g1g3 would be as severe as G1's single mutant (75%). But data says 10, so that's not matching. So perhaps the epistasis part is not correct, but the redundancy is.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistasis part in the option is a distraction. The main points are G2 is TF, G1 and G3 are redundant.

So looking again at the options, the correct option would be D.


The experiment investigates the role of three genes (G1, G2, G3) in anthracnose resistance in white lupine. The data shows resistance levels of single and double mutants compared to the wild-type (100% resistance). The key findings are:

1. **Single mutants**:  
   - **g1**: 75% resistance (partially compromised).  
   - **g2**: 0% resistance (completely susceptible).  
   - **g3**: 50% resistance (moderately compromised).  

2. **Double mutants**:  
   - **g1g2**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  
   - **g1g3**: 10% resistance (worse than either single mutant).  
   - **g2g3**: 0% resistance (same as g2).  

From this data, the following conclusions can be drawn:  
- **G2 is a transcription factor (TF)**: Its knockout (g2) results in complete susceptibility (0% resistance), indicating it is critical for resistance. Additionally, G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3, as seen in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, where the resistance is the same as g2.  
- **G1 and G3 show gene redundancy**: Knocking out both G1 and G3 (g1g3) results in resistance (10%) much worse than either single mutant (75% for g1 and 50% for g3). This suggests that G1 and G3 can compensate for each other to some extent, but their combined loss leads to a more severe phenotype.  

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that G1 is a transcription factor and G2 and G3 show pleiotropy. This is incorrect because G2 is the transcription factor, as evidenced by the complete susceptibility of g2.  
- **Option B**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 have the same promoter, and G3 is epistatic towards G1. There is no evidence of G1 and G3 sharing the same promoter, and the data does not support G3 being epistatic towards G1.  
- **Option C**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the data does not support pleiotropy or G1 being epistatic towards G3.  
- **Option D**: States that G2 is a transcription factor, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. This is the best fit: G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, and the data supports gene redundancy between G1 and G3, as their combined knockout (g1g3) results in a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. However, the claim that G1 is epistatic towards G3 is not fully supported by the data, as the resistance of g1g3 (10%) is worse than g1 (75%), contradicting the idea of epistasis. Despite this, Option D is the most accurate overall.  

### Conclusion:
The best-supported conclusion is that G2 is a transcription factor, and G1 and G3 show gene redundancy. While the claim about G1 being epistatic towards G3 is not fully consistent with the data, Option D is the most accurate overall.  

**Answer: D**
