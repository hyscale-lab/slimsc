Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a meson resonance, X, and we're supposed to find the mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and their decay distance has something to do with their lifetime and speed. 

The given data are E_X = 8 GeV, m_X = 1.2 GeV, and Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters, so it's a pretty tiny distance. I think the decay length depends on the particle's lifetime and its speed. But how exactly? 

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. But for a particle, the width Γ is like the uncertainty in energy, so τ should be approximately ħ/(Γ). Or maybe it's the other way around? Let me think. Oh right, Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the mean lifetime. So τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). 

But wait, I think the exact formula is τ = ħ/(Γ). Because in natural units, Γ is the inverse of the lifetime. Because Γ is the decay rate, which has units of energy, and τ is time. So with ħ in appropriate units, yes, τ = ħ/(Γ). 

But wait, I should make sure about the units here. Let me convert everything into standard units. ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Oh wait, let me check. Planck constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, and ħ = h/(2π). But in terms of GeV·s, since 1 GeV is about 1.602e-10 J, so let me compute ħ in GeV·s. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to work in units where ħ is taken as 197.33 MeV·fm or something like that. Alternatively, I can compute it as 6.582e-25 GeV·s. Because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So let me compute ħ. 

Wait, more accurately: ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·seconds. I think that's correct. So Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is
