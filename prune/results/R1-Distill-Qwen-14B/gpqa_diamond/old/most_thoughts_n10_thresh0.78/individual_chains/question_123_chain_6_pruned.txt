Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. The options are given, but I'll need to work it out step by step.

Wait, the problem mentions that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames are non-accelerating, so no acceleration to worry about. That probably means I can use special relativity here. Because when frames are moving at constant velocities relative to each other, special relativity applies.

The key here is probably time dilation and length contraction. Or maybe it's about how time measurements differ between the two frames. Let me think. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. But in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is coming towards it at the same speed, right? Because speed is relative.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact approach. So, the problem is about how much distance the ejecta travels from the galaxy's perspective when a certain time has passed in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, so the time experienced in the ejecta's frame is different from the galaxy's frame due to time dilation.

Wait, but the question says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the corresponding time in the galaxy's frame, or
