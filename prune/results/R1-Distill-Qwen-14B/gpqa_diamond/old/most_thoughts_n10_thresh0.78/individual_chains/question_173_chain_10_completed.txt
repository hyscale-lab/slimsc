Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Let me think. The principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Right, and Δp is the uncertainty in momentum.

But the question is asking about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Oh wait, I think there's a connection between momentum uncertainty and energy. Since the electron is moving at a certain speed, maybe I can find its momentum first.

The speed v is given as 2e8 m/s along the x-direction. The mass of an electron is about 9.11e-31 kg. So momentum p is mass times velocity, right? So p = m*v. Let me calculate that.

m = 9.11e-31 kg
v = 2e8 m/s
p = 9.11e-31 * 2e8 = 1.822e-22 kg·m/s.

But wait, that's the actual momentum. But the uncertainty principle uses the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. So using Δx and Δp relation.

Given Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

Using Heisenberg's formula: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Let's solve for Δp.

Δp ≥ ħ/(2Δx)
ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So plugging in the numbers:
Δp ≥ (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) )
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10
= 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait. The actual momentum is 1.822e-22 kg·m/s. So the uncertainty in momentum is 5.27e-25, which is much smaller than p itself. So the percentage uncertainty would be (Δp/p) * 100. Let me see: (5.27e-25)/(1.822e-22) ≈ 0.029 or about 2.9% uncertainty. So it's a small fraction, but perhaps that's necessary for the calculation.

But the question is about the uncertainty in energy. Hmm. So how does momentum relate to energy? For a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m). So maybe the uncertainty in energy comes from the uncertainty in p.

Wait, but if energy is a function of p, then the uncertainty in E, ΔE, can be estimated using the uncertainty in p, Δp. Since E = p²/(2m), the derivative dE/dp is p/(m). So the uncertainty in E would be roughly (dE/dp) * Δp.

So ΔE ≈ (p/(m)) * Δp.

Let me compute that. p is 1.822e-22 kg·m/s, m is 9.11e-31 kg.

p/m = (1.822e-22) / (9.11e-31) ≈ 2.0e8 m/s.

Wait, but that's the speed. So (p/m) is v, right? Because p = mv, so p/m = v. So yeah, that makes sense.

So ΔE ≈ v * Δp.

v is 2e8 m/s, Δp is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

So ΔE = 2e8 *5.27e-25 = 1.054e-16 J.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation:

2e8 * 5.27e-25 equals (2 * 5.27) * 1e8 * 1e-25 = 10.54 * 1e-17 = 1.054e-16 J.

So the uncertainty in energy is about 1.05e-16 J. Looking at the options, option D is ~1e-16 J, which matches.

But wait, I thought the minimum uncertainty would be using the Heisenberg equality, so I think this calculation is correct. So the answer should be option D.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron, we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which relates the uncertainties in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp) as:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Here, the given values are:
- Δx = 0.1 nm = \(1 \times 10^{-10}\) m
- \(\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}\) J·s

Rearranging for Δp, we get:

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta p \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Next, the relationship between energy and momentum is given by the kinetic energy formula for a non-relativistic particle:

\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m}
\]

The uncertainty in energy ΔE can be approximated using the uncertainty in momentum Δp:

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{p}{m} \cdot \Delta p
\]

The momentum \(p\) of the electron is calculated as:

\[
p = m \cdot v = (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) \cdot (2 \times 10^8) = 1.822 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{kg·m/s}
\]

Thus, \(\frac{p}{m} = v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting this and \(\Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}\) into the formula for ΔE:

\[
\Delta E \approx v \cdot \Delta p = (2 \times 10^8) \cdot (5.27 \times 10^{-25}) = 1.054 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{J}
\]

This value matches option D, which is approximately \(10^{-16}\) J. Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in the energy is:
