Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I probably don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with charges and their potential energy, it's related to the electric potential energy between them. Since all the particles are identical and have the same charge, this must be a problem involving the potential energy of a group of point charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at point P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, the setup is like this: one charge at the center (fixed), and 12 charges arranged around it, each at a distance of 2 meters.

Wait, but how exactly are these 12 charges arranged? Are they placed in a circle around P, each 2 meters away, but perhaps with some angular separation? Or is the arrangement not specified beyond each being 2 meters from P?

I think the arrangement beyond their distance from P might not matter because, for the potential energy calculation, each pair contributes to the total potential energy. But wait, in a system of multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But calculating each pair individually could get complicated. However, perhaps there's a simpler approach when considering the configuration.

Wait, but the problem asks for the minimum energy. So, perhaps this is the minimum potential energy of the system. Since all the charges are the same sign (each is 2e), they repel each other. So, the potential energy will be positive because bringing them closer would require work, but if they're already placed apart, maybe that's the minimum possible.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. If all the charges are repelling, then the potential energy would be higher when they are
