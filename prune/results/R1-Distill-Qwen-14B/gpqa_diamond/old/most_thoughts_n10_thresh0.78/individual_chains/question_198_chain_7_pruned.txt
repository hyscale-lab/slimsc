Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentrations are c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, wait, I think β refers to the formation constants for each complex. So each β is for a different complex.

The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics, but I think dithiocyanato refers to a complex with two SCN- ligands. Wait, no, wait. I think the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is 2, maybe? Or maybe it's a specific one. Alternatively, perhaps the blue color is associated with a particular complex, like [Co(SCN)_4]^2- or something else. But I'm not entirely sure about that. But the question is about the percentage of that particular complex, so I need to find which β corresponds to it.

Wait, wait. The stability constants are given as β1 to β4. I think each β corresponds to the complex with a different number of ligands. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (since Co^2+ plus two SCN- would be neutral), β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^–, and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2–. But I might have that wrong. Alternatively, maybe the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) and the β values increase up to a point and then decrease. Hmm, but the given β's are 9,40,63,16. Oh, so β3 is the highest. So the most stable complex is the one with three SCN- ligands? Or wait, maybe the higher β means more stability, so the higher the β, the more the complex will form. So β3=
