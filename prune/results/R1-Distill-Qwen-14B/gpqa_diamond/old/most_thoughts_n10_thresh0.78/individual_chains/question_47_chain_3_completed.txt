Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about what that implies.

First, the molecular formula: C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, X is zero here. So it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. Let me compute that: (18+2=20, minus 11 is 9, plus 1 is 10) divided by 2 is 5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring and a double bond or maybe two rings, or other combinations. But since the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. So that's likely a double bond or a carbonyl.

Now looking at the IR data: medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325. Those are usually N-H stretches, like amide or amine groups. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl, maybe an ester or amide or ketone. But the presence of N-H suggests maybe an amide or amine. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That suggests a CH2CH3 group, maybe an ethyl group attached to something that causes splitting into triplet. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl amide.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could be from NH2 protons, but wait, the integration is 2H. Hmm, or maybe it's an OCH2CH3 group. Wait, 4.0ppm is more typical for OCH2 groups, but why a singlet? Alternatively, could it be a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N, but why a broad singlet? Maybe it's NH group? But in that case, if it's an amide, the NH would usually show up as a broad peak, but integration of 2H might suggest a -NH-CH2- structure.

Next peak: 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. A quartet with 2H suggests coupling with another two protons. So maybe a CH2 group next to an O, like an ester's ethyl group. For example, in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would split the neighboring group into a quartet. Let me think: in ethyl esters, the OCH2 is usually around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, but here it's 4.5. Hmm, perhaps it's a more deshielded environment. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide's OCH2 group.

Then, the aromatic region: 7.0 ppm doublet (d) 2H and 8.0 ppm doublet (d) 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Each doublet has two protons, so they are adjacent to each other in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe a para-substituted benzamide or something similar.

Putting it all together: the molecule likely has a benzene ring with a substituent at the para position. The substituent could be an ester group or an amide group, given the IR and NMR data.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the meta position. But the aromatic protons would probably not be para if the substituent is meta. Wait, wait. If the substituent is ethoxy in the meta position, then the amide is in another position, perhaps. Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the benzamide substituent is in para position with an ethoxy elsewhere? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the phenyl group has an ethoxy at the para position, and the formamide is attached as a substituent on the benzene. So the structure would be HCONH-C6H4-OEt (para). Wait, but formamide is HCONH2. So if it's N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, the structure would be Ar-NH-C(O)-H, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Ar-OEt and a formamide substituent. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. I'll have to think more.

Option C:4-aminophenyl propionate. This would be a benzene ring with NH2 at para and a propionate (CH2CH2COO-) group attached. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. But the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: C9: benzene has 6 C, then the substituents: NH2 (adds 1N, doesn't add C), and propionate is CH2CH2COO-, which is 3 C. So 6+3 =9 C, correct. But let's see the NMR. The 4.0 ppm singlet is 2H, maybe the CH2 next to O. But the propionate would have a CH2CH2 group. The 1.20 triplet would be from a CH2CH3, but wait, the propionate would have a CH2-CH2-COOH or ester. So maybe the structure is OEt, but I'm not sure.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So structure is OEt-O-CO-NH2 attached to benzene in para positions. Wait, no. 4-aminobenzoate would be benzene with NH2 and a COOEt group in the para positions. So the substituents are NH2 and COOEt in para. Let's think about the NMR for that.

So in the NMR, the ethyl ester group would have the OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm, but maybe due to the adjacent amide or something else.

Let me consider the IR. Strong peak at 1720 cm-1 is likely an ester carbonyl (ester C=O). So the presence of an ester group would suggest option D. Also, the NH2 group would show N-H stretches in IR. So the IR shows N-H stretches, which would fit an amine or amide. But in option D, it's 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester with an amine. So the IR would have N-H stretches (from the amino group), which matches the data.

Looking at the NMR for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure is benzene with NH2 and OCOOEt in para positions.

The ethyl ester would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (CH2CH3), which is present.

The OCH2CH3 group: the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but in the data, it's at 4.5 ppm as a quartet (2H). So maybe that's the OCH2.

Wait, but the data has 4.5 ppm as a quartet (2H), which is probably the -OCH2- in the ester. The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2 group, but wait, that doesn't make sense. NH2 protons are usually broad, but they'd be a singlet if not split. Alternatively, maybe it's another group.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is not NH2. Let me think: in ethyl ester, the OCH2 is around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. But in the data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit higher. Maybe the substituent is affecting the chemical shift.

Looking back, the aromatic protons in option D would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the NMR data at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. The substituent groups would cause this. The amine in para would cause the ring to have two doublets for H on either side.

So, in the NMR, the 4.5 quartet (2H) is the OCH2 of the ethyl ester. The 1.20 triplet (3H) is the CH2CH3 of the ethyl group.

Then, what about the 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H)? Hmm, maybe that's from the amino group. Wait, in the compound ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is -NH2. But in the NMR, amines usually show broad signals, but as singlets. However, the integration is 2H, which would be for two protons. So if it's an NH2 group, the protons would be a singlet, but why the broadness? Because NH protons can exchange and appear as broad.

Wait, but in the IR, the strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are likely N-H stretches. So the presence of an NH2 group would explain that.

Putting it all together: the ethyl ester would account for the 1.20 triplet and 4.5 quartet. The aromatic protons are para-substituted, so two doublets. The NH2 would show up as a broad singlet at around 4.0 ppm, integrating to 2H. That fits.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet. So if it's an NH2 group, then it's two protons, but NH2 is usually a broad peak. But sometimes in DMSO, amines can appear as singlets.

But looking at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have an NH2 group and an ester group. So the IR would have strong N-H stretches (correct), the ester C=O at 1720 (correct), and the NMR would show the ethyl groups and aromatic protons as described.

Alternatively, option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. That would have a formamide group (HCONH- attached to the benzene). The IR would have a C=O from the formamide, which would be around 1650-1700, maybe. The strong 1720 suggests maybe more like an ester or amide. But formamide is usually a bit lower. Alternatively, maybe it's not the formamide.

Wait, the IR also shows N-H stretches, which would be present in both amides and amines. Let me think about the NMR for option B.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is Ar-OEt with a formamide (HCONH-) attached. So the structure would be OEt and HCONH- in the para positions.

Then, the NMR would have the ethoxy group as OCH2CH3, which would be a quartet around 4.1. Also, the formamide group would have NH protons, which could appear as a broad peak. The 4.0 ppm in the data is a broad singlet of 2H, which might correspond to the NH of the formamide. But formamide has two NH protons, which are usually around 8-9 ppm as a broad singlet. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Also, the 4.5 quartet would be from the OCH2 of the ethoxy group.

Wait, but in the data, the quartet is at 4.5, which would make sense for the OCH2. The ethoxy's CH2CH3 would be a triplet at 1.20.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets, which fits.

But the formamide's NH would be a singlet around 8-9 ppm, but in the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet. Doesn't match.

So maybe option B isn't the answer.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy at meta. Benzamide is CONH2 attached to benzene. So the substituents would be ethoxy at position 3 and CONH2 at position 1, making the ring have substituents in meta positions. Then, the aromatic protons would be in a different arrangement. Let's think about the NMR.

In this case, the aromatic region would have more than just two doublets. Because substituents are meta, the splitting could be more complex. But the data shows two doublets, which suggests para substitution. So maybe option A is not the correct structure.

Option C:4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure would have NH2 at para and a propionate group as COOEt attached. Wait, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the propionate would be attached as an ester. Alternatively, as a carboxylic acid, but probably as an ester.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. If it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, the structure would be PhNH2 with a propionate ester. So the propionate would be CH2CH2COOEt. Let me count the carbons: benzene (6C) + NH2 (no C) + propionate (3C, assuming it's -OOCR where R is CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So that's three carbons in the propionate. So 6+3=9, which matches.

The NMR would have the ethyl group from the propionate. The OCH2CH3 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but the data has a quartet at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps it's the OCH2 from the propionate.

Wait, propionate ester would have the structure OCH2CH2COOEt. Wait, no, the propionate would actually be OCO-O-R. Wait, if it's an ethyl propionate, the structure would be CH2CH2COOEt. So the OCH2 would be in the ester group.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-examine the options.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That's the benzamide where the amide is at para to NH2? Or is it a propiono group attached as an ester to the benzene with an NH2 in para.

Alternatively, perhaps it's benzene with NH2 and a propionoate (CH2CH2COO-) group in para positions. So the structure would be PhNH2 with COOEt attached in para.

Then, the NMR would have the ethyl ester as OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be a quartet at ~4.1-4.3, but the data shows a quartet at 4.5. Hmm. Also, the 1.20 triplet would be the CH2CH3 of the ethyl group.

The aromatic protons would be para to each substituent, so two doublets, which matches.

What about the 4.0 ppm singlet? If the substituent is a propionate ester, perhaps the CH2 next to the carbonyl would be a triplet, but in the data, it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, but in option C, the substituent is the propionate ester. So the protons on the ethyl group would be at 1.20 (t) and 4.1 (q). But the data has 4.5 (q), which is a bit higher than typical. So maybe it's not the ethyl ester. Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is attached in a different way, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm singlet is the NH2 group. But in the NMR, the NH2 protons are usually broad and might not split into a singlet. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the options, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene ring with NH2 and OCOOEt in para.

The NMR would have the ethyl ester's OCH2 as a quartet at around 4.1, but in the data, it's 4.5. Hmm, but maybe the presence of the amino group nearby causes the OCH2 to shift upfield or downfield. Not sure.

Alternatively, the 4.5 quartet could be from a different group. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an acetylamino group or something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's check the integration of the NMR signals. The 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, like an ethyl group. The 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) must be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, perhaps O or N.

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) is a broad singlet of 2H. Could this be an -NH- group? But that's usually a singlet. Or perhaps it's a -CH2- group next to a functional group.

Wait, the 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet is 2H. Maybe it's a CH2 adjacent to an N. For example, in an amide group, the CH2 could be next to N. But how would that look?

Looking at the options again, perhaps option A or B have such a group.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (CONH2) with ethoxy at meta. Then, the ethoxy group would have OCH2CH3. The CONH2 would have NH2 protons which might appear as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet of 2H. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about option D again: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-OEt, with the amine on the benzene in the para position.

Wait, no, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate is Ph-O-CO-OEt with NH2 in para. Wait, no, wait, benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So benzoate would be O-CO-OEt attached to benzene. But 4-aminobenzoate would have NH2 in para to the ester group.

So the structure is benzene with NH2 and OCOOEt in para positions.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The ethyl ester: 1.20 (t,3H), 4.5 (q,2H).
- The aromatic protons: two doublets, as the substituents are para, so the adjacent protons are each a doublet.
- The NH2 group: broad singlet around 4.0 ppm (2H). 

Wait, but in reality, the NH2 protons are typically around 1-5 ppm and can appear as a broad peak. So 4.0 ppm seems plausible.

But wait, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet, which would fit an NH2 group. But in some cases, like if the amine is deprotonated, it might not show up or appear differently, but I think in this case, it's a singlet.

So putting it all together, the NMR data fits option D.

Wait, but let me make sure. The NMR shows 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H). If it's an NH2 group, those protons would typically be a broad peak, possibly integrating to 2H. So that would fit.

Another point: the IR has strong N-H bands, which would be from the NH2 group in option D.

So, the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would fit all the data.


The compound has the molecular formula **C9H11NO2**, which corresponds to **5 degrees of unsaturation**. The IR spectrum shows strong absorption bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹**, indicative of **N-H stretches**, and a strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a **carbonyl group** (likely an ester or amide). The **¹H NMR data** includes:

- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet, consistent with a **CH2CH3 group** (ethyl group).
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet, likely from **NH2 protons**.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet, corresponding to a **CH2 group** adjacent to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen in an ester).
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets, indicative of a **para-substituted aromatic ring**.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   This compound has a **benzamide group (CONH2)** and an **ethoxy group (OCH2CH3)** at the meta position. The aromatic protons would not produce two simple doublets due to the meta substitution, and the IR spectrum would not match the observed data. This option is inconsistent with the NMR data.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   This compound has a **formamide group (HCONH-)** and an **ethoxy group (OCH2CH3)** at the para position. The formamide NH would typically appear as a broad singlet around **8-9 ppm**, which is not observed in the NMR data. Additionally, the IR spectrum would likely show a carbonyl stretch slightly lower than 1720 cm⁻¹ for a formamide. This option does not fit the data.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   This compound has an **NH2 group** and a **propionate ester (CH2CH2COOEt)** at the para position. The ethyl group of the propionate ester would produce signals similar to those in the NMR data, but the **1.20 ppm triplet** and **4.5 ppm quartet** are more consistent with a simple ethyl ester rather than a propionate. This option is less likely.

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   This compound has a **benzoate ester (COOEt)** and an **NH2 group** at the para position. The **1.20 ppm triplet** corresponds to the **CH2CH3 group** of the ethyl ester, and the **4.5 ppm quartet** matches the **OCH2 group** of the ethyl ester. The **4.0 ppm broad singlet** is consistent with the **NH2 protons**, and the **7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm doublets** match the aromatic protons of a para-substituted benzene. The IR spectrum aligns with the presence of an **N-H** group and a **carbonyl** from the ester. This option fits all the data.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data is most consistent with **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**. 

**Answer: D**
