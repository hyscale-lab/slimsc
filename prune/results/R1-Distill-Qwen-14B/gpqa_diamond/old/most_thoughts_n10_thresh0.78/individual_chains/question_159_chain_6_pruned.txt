Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about cosmology. The question involves a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum, with a peak at 790 nm and a drop in flux below that. The question is about determining the comoving distance of the quasar from Earth given certain cosmological parameters. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to remember what the near infrared and optical spectrum tell us about the quasar. The peak at 790 nm and the drop below suggests something about the redshift. Wait, I think I remember that the Lyman break is a feature in quasars' spectra. The Lyman series is from hydrogen, and the Lyman limit is around 912 Angstroms, which is about 91 nm. But wait, this is in the ultraviolet. So if a quasar's spectrum shows a peak beyond that, maybe it's because of redshift. If the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, that would mean that the UV emission has been redshifted into the optical or infrared. So the Lyman break would be observed at a longer wavelength than it was emitted.

How do I calculate the redshift from that? Well, the Lyman break is at about 912 Angstroms (0.0912 micrometers) in the rest frame. When observed, it's at 790 nm, which is 7900 Angstroms. So the redshift z would be (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1. Let me calculate that: 7900 / 912 ≈ 8.658. So z ≈ 7.658, which I'll round to approximately 7.66.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm a bit confused about the exact location. Oh right, the Lyman series for hydrogen transitions has the Lyman-alpha line at about 121 nm (1216 Angstroms), and the Lyman limit is at 91 nm. So if the quasar has a peak at 790 nm, perhaps that's where the Lyman-alpha line is observed. Because when the quasar emits in the UV, but due to redshift, it moves into the visible or infrared. So if the Lyman-alpha line is at 121 nm rest frame, and observed at 790 nm, then z = (790)/121 - 1.

Calculating that: 790 divided by 121 is about 6.5289. So z is approximately 5.5289. Hmm, but wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So which is it? The peak being the Lyman break or the Lyman-alpha line.

The question states that there's a peak at about 790 nm and flux drops below that. The Lyman break is the point beyond which the flux drops because the intergalactic medium becomes opaque to UV light. So the peak at 790 nm might be the Lyman break. So in that case, the observed wavelength is 790 nm, rest is 912 Angstroms (91 nm). So the redshift z is (790 nm / 91 nm) - 1 = 790/91 ≈ 8.68, so z ≈ 7.68.

Wait, but wait, 912 Angstroms is 91.2 nm, so 790 nm is much longer. So that would make a higher redshift. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman-alpha emission line. But the Lyman-alpha line is at 121.6 nm. So if it's observed at 790 nm, then z is (790 / 121.6) -1 ≈ 6.496 -1 ≈5.496. So z≈5.5.

This is a bit confusing. The question is about the near infrared and optical spectrum. So maybe the peak is in the optical, but the drop is into the infrared. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is the Lyman break, which for quasars is important because beyond a certain redshift, the Lyman break moves into the optical.

Wait, perhaps I should think about quasar spectral energy distributions. Quasars typically have a big blue bump in the UV, which is emitted but then redshifted. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's in the near infrared, which suggests that the UV emission has been redshifted. So if the rest-frame peak is in the UV, then the observed peak is in the infrared.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is the Balmer break, which is in the optical. But the Balmer break is at about 365 nm. Wait, no, the Balmer limit is around 365 nm, so if observed at 790, that would suggest a redshift of 790/365 ≈ 2.16, so z≈1.16. But in that case, the drop would be into longer wavelengths, but the question says the flux drops at shorter wavelengths than 790. So if the peak is at 790, and the flux drops below, that would mean that the emitted peak is in the UV, which is now redshifted to 790 nm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key here is that the quasar's spectrum shows a peak in the near infrared and a drop in flux at shorter (bluer) wavelengths than that peak. That suggests that the peak is the Lyman break, which is the cutoff in the UV due to the intergalactic medium. So the rest frame Lyman break is at 91 nm. The observed wavelength is 790 nm, so the redshift would be (790 nm) / (91 nm) - 1 = 8.68 -1 = 7.68. So z≈7.7?

But wait, the Hubble constant is given as 70 km/s/Mpc. The cosmological parameters are H0=70, Omega_m=0.3, Omega_lambda=0.7, and flat. So I need to compute the comoving distance at a=1 (i.e., now) to a source at redshift z≈7.7.

Wait, but wait, the comoving distance is a function of the redshift. For high redshifts, the comoving distance can be approximated using integrals of the inverse Hubble parameter over redshift. But exact calculation would require knowing the specific cosmological model.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that certain redshifts correspond to certain distances. For example, z=1 is about 2 Gpc at H0=70, but higher z would correspond to larger distances.

Wait, but let me think: the comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). For a flat universe, Omega_m + Omega_lambda =1, which they are (0.3 + 0.7=1).

So to compute D_C, the integral is from 0 to z of [1 / E(z')] dz', multiplied by c/H0.

Wait, the formula is D_C = (c / H0) *
