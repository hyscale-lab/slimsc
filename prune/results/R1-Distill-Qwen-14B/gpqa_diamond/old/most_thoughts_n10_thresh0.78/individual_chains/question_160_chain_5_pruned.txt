Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is coming along the z-axis and falls vertically on the aperture. It creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. They also mention that the angles are small, so we can use tanθ ≈ θ approximation.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is related to the diffraction pattern created by a circular aperture, but since the aperture is a polygon with infinitely many sides, it's effectively a circle. Wait, but if N is infinite, then the polygon becomes a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. The question says it's an N-sided polygon, but all apothems are the same length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side in a regular polygon. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon turns into a circle with radius equal to the apothem 'a'? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

Wait, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the side. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) of the circumscribed circle. The formula is a = R * cos(π/N). But when N is very large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So in the limit as N approaches infinity, the apothem 'a' is approximately equal to the radius of the circle. So the aperture is a circle with radius 'a'.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is given by a = (s)/(2 tan(π/N)), where 's' is the length of a side. Alternatively, the radius R (distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). So as N becomes
