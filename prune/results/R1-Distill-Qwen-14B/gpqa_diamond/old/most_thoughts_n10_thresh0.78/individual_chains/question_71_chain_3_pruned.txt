Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature has something to do with the distance from their star and the star's luminosity, right? But wait, the question says all planets have the same albedo, so albedo is the same for all, so that should cancel out in the equation. 

The problem states that the planets are in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for Planet_1 through Planet_5. We're asked about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. So I need to find T4 divided by T2, or T2/T4? Wait, the question says the ratio of Planet_4 to Planet_2. So T4 over T2.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L/(16πσ d²)) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and d is the distance from the star. Since all have the same albedo and same star, L and σ are the same for all. So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance (since T is proportional to (1/d^(1/2))).

Wait, but how does the orbital period relate to the distance? Oh, Kepler's third law! The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So P² ∝ a³.

But wait, the planets are in a system where their periods are in a ratio, so let me think. Let's assign variables. Let’s say Planet_1 has period P1, then P2 is 2P1, P3 is 2.5P1, P4 is 3.5P1, and P5 is 5P1.

So each planet's period is a multiple of P1. Now, since the periods are in a ratio, their distances can be found using Kepler's law. Let me write that.

Kepler's third law: (P/(P1))² = (a/a1)^3. So (a/a1) = (P/P1)^(2/3). So the distance a is proportional to (P)^(2/3).

So the distance ratio between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is (a4/a2) = (P4/P2)^(2/3). 

Wait, P4 is 3.5 P1, and P2 is 2 P1. So the ratio P4/P2 is (3.5)/(2) = 1.75. So (a4/a2) = (1.75)^(2/3). What is 1.75 to the power of 2/3? Let me calculate that.

Hmm, calculating 1.75^(2/3). Let me think, 1.75 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Alternatively, maybe I can compute it numerically. Let's compute the cube root first, then square it.

Cube root of 1.75: 1.75^(1/3) is approximately 1.2 (since 1.2³ is 1.728, which is close to 1.75). So 1.2 squared is 1.44. So a4 is about 1.44 times a2. So a4/a2 ≈ 1.44.

But wait, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T = T0 * (d0 / d)^(1/2), where T0 is the temperature at distance d0. So the ratio T4/T2 would be (d2/d4)^(1/2). Since d4 is larger than d2, the temperature of Planet_4 should be lower than Planet_2.

Wait,
