Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. Hmm, let me see. The problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one. 

Wait, so what's going on here? I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution and see what's left after they react. 

First, let's break it down. Each solution contributes some H+ or OH- ions. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely too.

Let me calculate the moles for each:

For CH3COOH:
Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't release all the H+, so the H+ from CH3COOH will be less than 0.05. But maybe I'll come back to that after considering the other components.

HCl:
Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles HCl = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is strong, so it dissociates completely, releasing 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2:
Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles OH-. So moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. That means moles OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when mixing, the H+ and OH- will react. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O. So I need to find the net moles of H+ or OH- after neutralization.

So total H+ initially: from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl gives 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH gives about 0.05 moles, but wait, I should think about how much H+ it actually contributes. Since it's a weak acid, the actual H+ is less. But maybe in this case, since we have a strong acid and a strong base, the weak acid might not contribute much compared to the strong ones. Or perhaps I should calculate the exact amount.

Alternatively, perhaps the strong acid and strong base will mostly neutralize each other, and the weak acid might have some leftover. Let's proceed step by step.

So total H+ from strong acid (HCl) is 0.08 moles. Total OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

When H+ and OH- are mixed, they'll react in a 1:1 ratio. So the OH- will neutralize H+.

So, moles H+ available: 0.08 (from HCl) plus any from CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully ionize. Hmm, but since we're mixing with a base, maybe it's better to first calculate the neutralization between HCl and Ba(OH)2.

Wait, another approach: when you mix acids and bases, the H+ from acids and OH- from bases will neutralize. So the total moles of H+ is sum of all H+ from acids, and total OH- is sum from bases.

So, H+ sources: HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.08 moles H+.

CH3COOH
