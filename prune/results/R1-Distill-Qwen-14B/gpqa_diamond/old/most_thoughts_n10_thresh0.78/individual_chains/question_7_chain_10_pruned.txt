Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB, which is the Cosmic Microwave Background, has a certain energy. The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. The question is about finding the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetimes are limited by this process. 

Wait, so the process is gamma gamma -> e+ e-. So high-energy gamma-rays are interacting with CMB photons. I think this has something to do with the photon-photon interaction and pair production. I've heard about this before in the context of gamma-ray attenuation in the universe.

I recall that the probability of such interactions depends on the energy of the gamma-ray and the photon density. Since the CMB is everywhere, the number density of photons is significant. So the lifetime of a gamma-ray would be determined by the time it takes for it to interact with a CMB photon.

The lifetime tau is related to the probability of interaction per unit volume. The probability per unit length is given by the cross-section multiplied by the photon density. So tau is inversely proportional to the interaction rate, which is sigma * n, where sigma is the cross-section and n is the number density of target photons.

Wait, the interaction rate Gamma (the rate) is sigma * n * v_rel, but since we're dealing with photons, which are moving at speed c, maybe it's just sigma * n * c. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the mean free path would be 1/(sigma * n * c), so the lifetime tau would be the mean free path divided by the expansion velocity or something? Hmm, maybe I should think about it in terms of the interaction rate.

The cross-section for the gamma-photon interaction to produce an electron-positron pair. I think the cross-section for this process is given by some formula. I remember that the cross-section for pair production by a photon-photon collision is sigma = (8π/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2) [1 + cos^2(theta)], but that's when both photons are of similar energy. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, for the process gamma + gamma → e+ e-, the cross-section can be approximated by sigma ≈ (8π/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2). Because when E1 and E2 are much larger than m_e c^2, this formula applies. So that's the cross-section for two photons of energies E1 and E2.

In this problem, E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E_gamma, and E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is given as 1e-3 eV. So E2 = 1e-3 eV.

The number density n of CMB photons can be calculated. I remember that the CMB has a temperature of about 2.7 K. The photon number density can be found from the formula for a blackbody: n = (g_{3/2}(z=1)) * (2.7 K)^{3/2} * (k_B)^{3/2} / (h^3). Wait, but the exact number might be more straightforward. I think the number density of CMB photons is about 411 photons per cubic cm, or about 411 cm^-3. Wait, let me confirm that. The photon density is about n ≈ 1e8 m^-3, since 1 cm^-3 is 1e6 m^-3 (because 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m^3, so 1e6 cm^-3 is 1e12 m^-3? Wait no, wait:

Wait, 1 m = 100 cm, so 1 m^3 = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm^3. So if n is 411 per cm^3, then per m^3
