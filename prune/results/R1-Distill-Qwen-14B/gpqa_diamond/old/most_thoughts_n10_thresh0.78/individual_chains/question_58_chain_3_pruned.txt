Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics question. The question is asking which of the given theories never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These divergences can cause problems, so physicists use regularization to make the math manageable and get finite, physical results.

Let me think about each option. 

Starting with option D, Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, that's the non-quantum version, right? So in classical theories like Maxwell's equations, you don't deal with quantum effects. So regularization, which is a quantum field theory concept, wouldn't apply here. So D might be the correct answer because classical theories don't require regularization at all.

But let me check the other options. Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is a quantum field theory, so it definitely has divergences, right? I remember that QED requires renormalization, which I think is a form of regularization. So they must use some regularization methods, like maybe using a cutoff or dimensional regularization. So C is out.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong force. It also has issues with divergences, especially because of things like Landau poles or the behavior at short distances. Wait, or maybe it's more about confinement. Well, regardless, QCD is a quantum theory and requires renormalization. So B also needs regularization, so it's not the right choice.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Wait, superstring theory is a type of string theory, which is a theory of quantum gravity. String theories aim to be finite, meaning they don't have the same divergences as in other quantum field theories. But do they ever require regularization? I'm a bit fuzzy here. I think that in string theory, the perturbative expansions might not have the same kinds of divergences as in QED or QCD because of how the theory is structured. But wait, when you calculate loop diagrams in string theory, do you still get divergences? I thought that string theory might have better behavior, but I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, but the question is which theory never requires regularization. So if string theory doesn't have the same divergences, perhaps it doesn't need regularization. But I've heard that even string theories can have issues with certain types of divergences, especially when dealing with higher-order corrections. Hmm, not too sure. Alternatively, maybe superstring theory is a candidate because it's a candidate for a theory that doesn't require it. But I'm not certain.

Wait, going back. The question is which theory never requires regularization. So which of these options don't have divergences that necessitate regularization techniques.

Classical Electrodynamics (D) isn't a quantum theory, so no regularization is needed. It can't be because regularization is a quantum field theory tool. So option D is
