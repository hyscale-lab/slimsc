Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question again.

The problem describes several reactions and asks about the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. Hmm, I remember that these are related to molecular point groups, which describe the symmetry of molecules. But I'm a bit rusty on the details, so I'll need to think carefully.

Let me break down the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, the reaction is A + 8B → C. The product is a bright red solid, which makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a metal sulfide. But more likely, given the equivalents, maybe it's a transition metal with a high oxidation state?

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents of B. That high number might indicate that B is a diatomic gas. For example, if B is O2, then 8 equivalents would give 8 O atoms. But wait, O2 is a diatomic molecule, so 8 O atoms would require 4 molecules of O2. Hmm, but 8 equivalents of gas B—so each molecule of B contributes one atom? Or each molecule contributes two? I think equivalents depend on the stoichiometry. For example, if B is O2, each molecule has two atoms. So 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of O2 molecules, which would be a lot. Maybe that's not it.

Wait, maybe B is Cl2? Because Cl2 is a diatomic gas, and 8 equivalents would mean 8 moles of Cl2 molecules. But let's see. Let me think about product C. It's a bright red product. Oh! I remember that when metals react with chlorine, they form chlorides. For example, copper reacts with Cl2 to form CuCl2, which is blue, not red. Wait, what about lead? Lead(IV) chloride is red. Or maybe it's a different compound.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is with oxygen. If A is lead (Pb) and B is O2, the reaction would be Pb + O2 → PbO2. Lead dioxide is bright yellow, not red. Hmm. Maybe sulfur? Sulfur is bright yellow, but the product here is red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal oxide that's red, but I'm not recalling any immediately.

Alternatively, maybe A is sodium and B is something else. Wait, but sodium reacting with something? Let's think about another approach. The next reaction says that C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio to produce E. Wait, no, the second reaction says C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to produce E. Wait, 2 equivalents of D. So, C + 2D → E. But D then reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. H being a solvent—maybe water, but D could be H2O? Or maybe something like ethanol or another organic solvent? Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Let me try to think about the third reaction: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid
