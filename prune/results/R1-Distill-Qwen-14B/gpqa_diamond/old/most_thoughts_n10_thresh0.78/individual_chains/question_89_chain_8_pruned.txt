Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Then, it goes through several steps, and we're supposed to determine the coupling pattern of a specific hydrogen in the final product's NMR spectrum.

Let me break down each step.

First, the initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating it with excess KOH at 240°C produces a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), and 1.94 ppm (2H). There's also an IR absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, what reaction happens when a dibromide is treated with KOH? Oh, that's probably a dehydrohalogenation, an E2 elimination. Wait, or maybe it's an SN2 substitution, but with two bromines adjacent, it's more likely elimination. Since it's a dibromide, heating with a strong base like KOH would lead to the formation of an alkene through an E2 mechanism. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, forming an alkene.

Wait, but where would the double bond form? The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. So if it's a bridged bicyclic structure, eliminating HBr from each Br would form a double bond. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so let me visualize that. Adamantane is a four-fused cyclohexane rings structure, each bridgehead being a carbon. If 1 and 3 positions are brominated, elimination would form a bridgehead double bond. But wait, bridgehead double bonds are generally not possible due to Bredt's rule. Wait, but in adamantane, the bridgehead is a quaternary carbon. So, can a double bond form between two bridgehead carbons? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, maybe elimination isn't the right path. Another possibility is that KOH could cause the formation of a epoxide. Wait, no, because the product's IR shows a strong peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester). So maybe it's not elimination forming an alkene but something else.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH. Another possibility is that each Br undergoes substitution. But wait, KOH in such conditions might not be a good nucleophile for SN2 because the adamantane structure is rigid and the leaving groups are in a bridgehead position, which is hindered. So maybe elimination is more favorable, leading to a ring-opening or forming a more substituted double bond.

Wait, but if elimination occurs, the product would have a double bond. However, the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone or an ester. So perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but substitution to form a diol? Wait, no, because substitution with KOH would give a diol, but the IR would show OH stretches, but in the NMR, the peak at 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 near an electronegative group, perhaps an oxygen. Wait, but a diol would have more than just two protons in that region, especially if it's vicinal (like a vicinal diol from two OH groups), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann elimination or
