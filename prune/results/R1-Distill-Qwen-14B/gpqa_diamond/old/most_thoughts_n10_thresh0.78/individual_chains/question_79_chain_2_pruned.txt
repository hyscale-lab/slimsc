Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. So, the compound X is C11H12O, and it's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then they give the NMR spectra of the product. The options are four different oxirane compounds. Hmm, I think 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, maybe something like DBU. Oh wait, DBU is 1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene, but maybe this structure is similar. So the reaction is probably an elimination reaction, like deprotonation leading to an epoxide opening or something else.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given, so I need to figure out what structure that corresponds to. Let me look at the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR has:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). So two singlets each integrating for 3H. That suggests two methyl groups. Maybe they're adjacent to something deshielded or in a symmetric environment. Or maybe they are in similar environments but split into two signals. Wait, sometimes if they're on adjacent carbons, like geminal or something else, but here they're singlets, so no splitting. So perhaps they're in environments where their neighboring protons don't cause splitting. Maybe two different methyl groups, one attached to oxygen or another group.

Next, the aromatic protons:
- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, that looks like a couple of doublets. Let me think about coupling patterns. Maybe a para-substituted benzene? But wait, in the 1H NMR, the downfield shifts suggest some substitution. Alternatively, maybe a styrene group or something with conjugation.

Looking at the 13C NMR:
- δ 21.3 (1C, s): that's a small shift, maybe a methyl attached to something electronegative like oxygen? Or a CH3 in a certain environment.
- 28.4 (1C, s): another carbon, maybe another methyl or something else.
- Then, a bunch of carbons in the 120s and 130s, which are typical for aromatic carbons.
- 197.7 (1C, s): that's a carbonyl carbon, maybe a ketone? Or maybe an ester, but wait, the starting material is an oxirane (epoxide), so perhaps this is an epoxide ring opening?

Wait, but the product's NMR is after the reaction. So the starting material X is an epoxide. When the epoxide reacts, perhaps it's undergoing ring-opening. If 1,4-diazabicyclo is a strong base, maybe it's deprotonating something to cause elimination or ring-opening.

Wait, so the product's NMR shows an epoxide would have certain features. Or maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring opening, but in this case, the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is high (403 K is around 130°C). The base used is probably causing an elimination.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclopropane or an epoxide that upon treatment with a strong base forms a more substituted double bond, leading to some kind of elimination product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide, and upon treatment with a base, it undergoes ring-opening to form a diol. But wait, the product's NMR doesn't show any OH signals, so maybe it's not that. Or maybe the diol is in an anhydrous environment, so it's not hydrogen bonded, but I'm not sure.

Looking again at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups. Maybe they're attached to carbons that don't have neighboring Hs, like perhaps a CH3 attached to an oxygen or a carbonyl group.

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is very downfield. That's characteristic of a carbonyl group, like a ketone. But wait, the starting compound X is
