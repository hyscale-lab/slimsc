Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it. The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. The options are A to D, with the possible answers being 5,3,2,4. 

First, I remember that optical activity arises from chirality, which means the molecule has a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry. Chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups. Alternatively, some compounds can be optically active even without chiral centers if they have a plane of asymmetry, like allenes or certain bicyclic structures.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Hmm, so the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, butene is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH2? Wait, maybe I should draw it. Structure is CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, maybe not. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, and C2 has a methyl group. So structure is Cl–C(CH3)=CH–CH3? Wait, but wait. Wait, butene is four carbons. 1-ene is between C1 and C2. So 2-methyl would be a methyl on C2. So I think the structure is Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), and then C3 and C4. So maybe the structure is Cl–C(CH3)=CH2–CH3? Or is it CH2Cl–C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But if it's 2-methyl, it would be CH2=CH(CH2CH3)–CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl–CH(CH3)–CH2–CH3 but with a double bond at position 1. Wait, no, but-1
