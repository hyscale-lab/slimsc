Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many of these compounds exhibit optical activity. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that optical activity arises from chirality, which means a compound has a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. Also, sometimes compounds can have other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain planar structures, but I think for this question we can focus on chiral centers and maybe some other cases.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The structure here is a double bond between carbons 1 and 2. Carbon 1 has a Cl, a double bond to C2 (which is CH2), and two more substituents. Wait, the formula is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. Let me draw it out.

Actually, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. But with substituents. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2 (which has a methyl). So C1 has Cl, double bond, and two CH2 groups? Wait no, maybe it's Cl-CR2=CR', but I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1: ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not with a double bond. Oh wait, it's but-1-ene, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not correct because the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to C1, which is part of the double bond. So structure is Cl-C(R)=CHCH2CH3, but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the structure is CHCl=CHCH2CH3? No, but wait, the correct structure for but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, so CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2: CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3 isn't right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Oh wait, no, the correct structure is CHCl2-CH2CH2CH3, no. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that's not correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-configured. But regardless, what's important is whether it has a chiral center. For that, the chlorinated carbon (C1) would have to have four different groups attached. Let's see: if C1 is connected to Cl, a double bond (which counts as a substituent), and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, because if it's CHCl=CHCH2CH3, then C1 would be Cl, double bond (to C2), and two CH2 groups? Or perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 with a double bond? Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. But that's but-1-ene with substituents. Wait, perhaps the structure is CHCl2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be 2-methylbut-1-ene: CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CHCl=CHCH2CH3, but with a methyl on C2. So 2-methyl would make the structure CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe it's CHCl2-CH(CH3)CH2CH3, but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it needs four different substituents. Let's say the chloro is on C1, which is double-bonded to C2. So C1 is connected to Cl, double bond (which is considered as a substituent since it's a double bond), and two other groups. Wait, but in a double bond, the substituents are the groups attached to each carbon. So if C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2 (which has a methyl group), and two other substituents. Wait, but in the structure (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl-CR1=C(R2)-R3, where R groups are other substituents. Wait, maybe the molecule is Cl on C1, then a double bond to C2, which has a methyl and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps actually, this compound is not chiral. Because, for a double bond, if the substituents on each carbon are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, maybe the molecule itself is not chiral because it lacks a chiral center. Let me think: the chloro is on C1, which is double-bonded. So the groups attached to C1 are Cl, the double bond (which is a substituent), and perhaps two same groups, like two CH2 groups. If C1 has Cl, double bond (which is like a substituent), and two identical substituents (like two CH2 groups), then it wouldn't have four different groups, so no chiral center. So this compound is not chiral. Therefore, it won't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, in the molecule (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but that's not a double bond. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, so structure is Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is structured as CHCl2-CH2CH2CH3? No, that can't be because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So maybe the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but where is the double bond? Oh wait, but-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 has Cl, double bond (to C2), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, because if C1 is double-bonded, then the groups on C1 would be Cl, the double bond (counting as one substituent), and two CH2 groups? No, wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two substituents on each side. So C1 is connected to Cl, double bond, and two other groups. Let me think: C1 is CH2Cl, but since it's a double bond, it's actually Cl-CR1=CR2. So for but-1-ene, C1 is CH2, but with a Cl, it becomes CHCl. So the structure is CHCl-CH2CH2CH3, but with a double bond. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe this compound doesn't have a chiral center because the Cl is on a double bond, which doesn't make it a chiral center. So, this compound is not chiral. So no optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**: This is a more complex structure. Let me try to visualize it. It's a fused ring system, perhaps with substituents. The substituent is a chloromethylene group (Cl-C=O), but wait, no, chloromethylene is Cl2C= (but wait, chloromethylene is CH2Cl with a double bond). Wait, chloromethylene is CH2Cl group with a double bond to another atom? Or perhaps it's a substituent on the ring. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent attached via a double bond.

Wait, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), so it's attached to the 8th position as a CH2Cl group, but with a double bond. I'm not entirely sure, but the key here is whether the molecule has a chiral center. The molecule has specific stereodescriptors: (3aR,7aS,E). The 'E' indicates the configuration of a double bond. But the presence of R and S suggests that the compound has stereogenic centers. So if the molecule has at least one chiral center, it can be optically active. But wait, the 'E' refers to the configuration around the double bond, not a chiral center. So maybe this molecule has multiple stereogenic centers or an allene (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe the substituent itself is a double bond, but I'm not sure. But given the R and S descriptors, it's likely that the molecule has chiral centers. So it's probably optically active. So count this as active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. If it's 2,3-dimethyl, then the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, looking at the carbons 2 and 3. Carbon 2 has groups: two CH3, a COOH group, and a CH(CH3)-COOH? Wait, maybe more accurately: the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So for carbon 2: groups are HOOC-, CH(CH3), CH(CH3)COOH, and a hydrogen? Wait, no. Carbon 2 would be connected to HOOC- (from C1), CH3 (from the methyl), CH(CH3)COOH (from C3?), and another substituent. Wait, wait, the structure for succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you add methyl groups on C2 and C3, each of those carbons (C2 and C3) have a methyl group. So for C2: the groups are HOOC-, CH2 (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3?), and a CH3. Wait, that's four substituents. Let me think: C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 (which is HOOC-CH2-), so the groups on C2 would be:

- A methyl group (CH3)
- The adjacent C1 (which is a CH2 group connected to HOOC)
- The adjacent C3 (which is a CH(CH3) connected to another CH2)
- And a hydrogen? Wait, no. Wait, C2 is CH(CH3), with four substituents: the two CH2 groups (from C1 and C3), a methyl, and a hydrogen? No, because that would be three substituents plus the methyl. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when we have 2,3-dimethyl, each of the middle CH2 groups becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-C(CH3)(H)-C(CH3)(H)-COOH. Wait, no, that's not possible because each CH2 can't have two CH3 groups. No, wait, 2,3-dimethyl means each of the CH2 groups (C2 and C3) has a methyl. So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has four substituents: two CH groups (from adjacent carbons), a methyl, and a hydrogen? Wait, no, because each of those carbons is CH2 in succinic acid, so adding a methyl would make them CH(CH3) groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, for C2: substituents are:

- HOOC-CH2- (from C1)
Wait, no. C2 is attached to C1 (which is a CH2 connected to HOOC), a methyl, and two CH groups (to C3 and maybe a hydrogen). Wait, maybe it's better to list the substituents.

Carbon 2: connected to:

1. The carbonyl group (from C1: the C=O is on C1, so C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 (which is CH2-COOH), C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think of it as a four-carbon chain: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Adding methyl groups on C2 and C3 would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- C1: which is CH2 (since it's HOOC-CH2-)
Wait, no. Wait, the parent chain is succinic acid: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So C1 is the first carbon (the one attached to the first COOH), C2 is the next, etc.

So the four carbons are C1 (COOH), C2 (CH2), C3 (CH2), C4 (COOH). Now, 2,3-dimethyl would add a methyl group to C2 and C3. So C2 becomes CH(CH3), and C3 becomes CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, looking at C2: the groups are:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- One COOH group (from C1: which is attached via a CH2)
Wait, no. Wait, C2 is attached to C1 (which is -CH2-COOH), C3 (which is -CH(CH3)-), and a hydrogen. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, the groups on C2 are: the methyl, a hydrogen, and the two neighboring carbons. Wait, no, each carbon is attached to four groups.

So, for C2: the four substituents are:

1. A methyl group (CH3)
2. A hydrogen (H)
3. The adjacent C1 (which is a CH2 group connected to COOH)
4. The adjacent C3 (which is a CH(CH3) connected to another CH2)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to see:

C2: attached to:

- C1: which is a CH2 group (so that's one substituent)
- C3: a CH(CH3) group (another substituent)
- A methyl group (CH3)
- And a hydrogen (H)

So C2 has four substituents: CH2 (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), CH3, and H. Therefore, all four substituents are different. So C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 is attached to:

- C2: CH(CH3)
- C4: a CH2 connected to COOH
- A methyl group (CH3)
- A hydrogen (H)

So C3 also has four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule has two chiral centers, so it's chiral and optically active. So this compound will exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**: Similar structure as the previous one, but with both R configurations. So the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, but with both C2 and C3 as R. Now, whether this is a meso compound or not. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral, despite having chiral centers. 

In this case, the molecule is (2R,3R). Let's consider if there's a plane of symmetry. If the two chiral centers are mirror images, then the overall molecule could be meso. For example, if the configuration of C2 is R and C3 is R, but the molecule has a plane of symmetry between them, making it achiral. Let's imagine the structure: the two chiral centers are on adjacent carbons, each with a methyl, and the two COOH groups on either end. So if you have a mirror plane through the middle of the molecule (between C2 and C3), then the configurations would be mirror images. So if both are R, would that make them mirror images? Let me draw it out.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so the two chiral centers are actually the same, leading to an internal plane of symmetry and making the molecule achiral (meso). So for example, if the configuration is (2R,3R), and the two substituents on each chiral center are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric, then it's meso. 

Wait, the substituents on each chiral center are the same: both have a methyl group and a hydrogen. So the groups on C2 are CH3, H, CH2-COOH, and CH(CH3)-COOH? Wait, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso because the two chiral centers are mirror images, making the overall molecule achiral. So despite having chiral centers, the molecule is not optically active. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. If the molecule is (2R,3R), is it a meso compound? Because if the two centers are mirror images, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, tartaric acid has two chiral centers and can be R,R (dextrorotatory), S,S (levorotatory), or meso (if it's R,S with a plane of symmetry, but in this case, it's R,R). Hmm, but in the case of tartaric acid, the meso form has one R and one S. Wait, but in our case, both are R. So does that make the molecule chiral or meso?

Wait, another approach: when you have two chiral centers adjacent to each other, and the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be meso. For example, if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry that makes the two chiral centers mirror images.

In this case, for the (2R,3R) configuration, are the substituents on each center arranged symmetrically? Let's think about the groups around each center.

C2 has: CH3, H, CH2-COOH (from C1), and CH(CH3)-COOH (from C3? No, from C3 it's CH(CH3)-, but maybe I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule symmetric. So if the substituents on C2 and C3 are mirror images, the molecule could be meso.

But without a clear plane of symmetry, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the two chiral centers don't form a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule isn't symmetric, then it would be chiral. 

Wait, let me take an example. Consider 2,3-dimethylbutane. If the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, and the molecule is (2R,3R), is it a meso compound? Wait, but in that case, butane is symmetric. So if the two chiral centers are mirror images, the molecule would be meso. But in our case, the substituents are different because they are connected to carboxylic acid groups. Let me think again.

In succinic acid, the two ends are the same: both are COOH. So the molecule is symmetric from the middle. So if both chiral centers are R configuration, then the molecule would be chiral because the groups aren't symmetric. Wait, no, because if the two chiral centers are arranged symmetrically with R and R configurations, the molecule might still be symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps it's not symmetric because the substituents are arranged in a way that the mirror image isn't the same.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the molecule. If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with both C2 and C3 being R, does that make it a meso compound?

Wait, no. Because a meso compound requires that the mirror image of each chiral center across the plane of symmetry would produce the same configuration. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the molecule is not meso because the groups on each chiral center aren't mirror images. Because each chiral center has a methyl, a hydrogen, and two different substituents connected to the COOH groups. So maybe the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but in the case of tartaric acid, the meso form has one R and one S. So if the two centers are R and R, perhaps the molecule is chiral because it doesn't have a plane of symmetry. So this compound would exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not confident here. Let me think again. If the configuration is (2R,3R), and the substituents are arranged so that the molecule is symmetric, then it's meso. But if the substituents are not symmetric, then it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each chiral center are the same, leading to a plane of symmetry. For example, if each chiral center has a methyl, a hydrogen, and two identical substituents (like two CH2 groups connected to COOH), then the molecule could be symmetric. But in reality, each chiral center is connected to a COOH group on either end. So the substituents on C2 are CH3, H, CH2-COOH, and CH(CH3)-COOH (or something like that). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the molecule is not meso because the two chiral centers don't mirror each other. Therefore, it's chiral and optically active.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should mark this as active for now.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**: This is a cyclohexene with a hydroxyl group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's cyclohex-3-en-1-ol). Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? The OH is on C1, which would have four substituents: the ring, the OH group, and two other substituents from the ring.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring has double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and a hydroxyl group on C1. The question is whether C1 is a chiral center. For that, it needs four different substituents.

So, C1 is connected to:

- The ring (specifically, the adjacent carbons: C6 and C2)
- The hydroxyl group (-OH)
- And two other substituents from the ring.

Wait, perhaps C1 is connected to:

1. C6 (which is CH2 group)
2. C2 (which is CH2 or CH group, depending on the ring)
3. The hydroxyl group (-OH)
4. And the double bond may influence the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is such that C1 is CH(OH), connected to C2 and C6, which are both CH2 groups, and to the ring. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two others in the ring. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and perhaps has two substituents: the OH group and another hydrogen.

Wait, maybe I should think of the structure as a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. So, the cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4. Now, is C1 a chiral center?

Looking at C1: substituents are:

- OH group
- Two ring carbons (C2 and C6)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons, so C1 is bonded to C2 and C6. That leaves two more bonds: one to the OH group and one to a hydrogen. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- C2 (which is part of the ring, perhaps a CH2 group)
- C6 (same as above)
- H

Wait, so C1 has substituents: OH, two ring CH2 groups (or similar), and a hydrogen. Are any of these substituents the same? For example, if C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, then they are the same. So C1 would have substituents: OH, two identical groups (like CH2), and H. So that's three substituent types: OH, CH2 (twice), H. Therefore, C1 does not have four different substituents. So it's not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is not chiral and won't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, perhaps C1 is connected to two different substituents in the ring. Because the ring is unsaturated (double bond between C3 and C4), the substituents on C1 might be different.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me visualize the cyclohexene ring. C1 has the OH group. The double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is more like:

C1: OH attached
C2: CH2
C3: CH connected to C4 (double bond)
C4: CH connected to C3
C5: CH2
C6: CH2 attached to C1.

Wait, but that's not correct because the double bond would fix the positions. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is arranged as:

C1: OH
C2: CH2
C3: CH2 (but double bond between C3 and C4)

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps the ring is such that C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6, which are each connected to other carbons. But regardless, C1 would have four substituents: OH, C2, C6, and a hydrogen. If C2 and C6 are both CH2 groups, then C1 would have substituents: OH, CH2, CH2, H. So two substituents are the same (the two CH2 groups), meaning C1 isn't a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is not chiral. So no optical activity.

Wait, but wait another thought: perhaps the ring's double bond causes the substituents on C1 to be different. For example, if the double bond is between C3 and C4, then the substituents on C3 and C4 are different. But does that affect the substituents on C1? Maybe not. Therefore, C1 is not a chiral center, so this compound isn't chiral. So it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**: This is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these positions is s configuration. Now, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If so, it could be achiral despite having stereogenic centers.

Cyclohexane with three hydroxyl groups at 1,3,5 positions. Let me imagine the structure. If the substituents are all on the same face (cis), it might have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is symmetric, it could be a meso compound.

In this case, the substituents are all hydroxyls on positions 1,3,5, which are every other carbon. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry through the center of the ring, making it meso. Therefore, despite having three chiral centers, the molecule is achiral because of the symmetry. So this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**: The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of a butanone. So the molecule is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH(CH3)2? Or more accurately, the structure is cyclopentyl attached to C1, which is a ketone (O=C-), then a chain of CH2-CH(CH3)-. So the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? Wait, but butanone is four carbons, so it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but in this case, the first carbon (the carbonyl carbon) is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group. Wait, perhaps it's O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH(CH3)-CH2-? No, but butanone has four carbons. Let me get the structure right.

Butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but that's 2-butanone. Wait, no, butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO, which isn't correct. Wait, butanone is (CH3)2CO, which is 2-butanone. So butan-1-one would be CH2CH2CH2CO, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(CO)CH2CH2CH3, but that would be pentan-2-one. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the nomenclature wrong.

Alternatively, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is at the end. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Now, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one would have a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), and a methyl group on C3. So structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but butan-1-one has four carbons, so the substituents would be on C1 and C3.

Wait, but butan-1-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the carbonyl is on C1. Then, 1-cyclopentyl would mean a cyclopentyl group attached to C1. So the structure becomes (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Additionally, there's a methyl group on C3. So the structure is (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps it's (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that can't be because butan-1-one has four carbons in the chain. So maybe it's (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, that's five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl carbon (C1), then a chain of CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? So the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But that's five carbons, which would make it pentanone, not butanone. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-, with the ketone at C1 and the substituents on C3. Hmm, maybe I should think about whether this molecule has a chiral center.

The substituents are on C3. Let's look at C3: what groups are attached? It has:

- A CH2 group from the carbonyl (C2)
- A methyl group (CH(CH3))
- Two CH2 groups leading to the end.

Wait, perhaps C3 is the carbon next to the carbonyl. So structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Then, C3 would be the third carbon (counting from the carbonyl as C1). So C3 is the third carbon, but that would be in a five-carbon chain, which contradicts butan-1-one being four carbons. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps it's better to focus on whether there's a chiral center.

Assuming the structure is O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, the carbonyl is on C1, then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2.

Looking at C3: substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 (from C4)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Each carbon has four bonds. So C3 is CH(CH3) attached to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and two hydrogens. So substituents are:

- CH2-C(O)-cyclopentyl
- CH(CH3)
- CH2-CH2-CH3
- And a H.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has the following substituents:

1. A methyl group (CH3)
2. Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)
3. A hydrogen.

So four substituents: CH3, CH2- (from C2, which is connected to the carbonyl), CH2- (from C4, connected to CH3?), and a hydrogen. So if all four substituents are different, then C3 is a chiral center. Are they different?

So substituents on C3 would be:

- CH3
- CH2 connected to the carbonyl group (so that's a -CH2-C(O)-cyclopentyl)
- CH2 connected to CH2-CH3 (so that's a -CH2-CH2-CH3 group)
- H

Are all these groups different? The CH2-C(O)-cyclopentyl is one substituent, the CH2-CH2-CH3 is another, the CH3 is another, and the H is the fourth. So yes, all four substituents are different. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and optically active.

But wait, is there another chiral center? For example, the cyclopentyl group: if it's attached in a way that creates another chiral center, but the question specifies 1-cyclopentyl, which is a substituent but not necessarily a chiral center unless the cyclopentyl group itself has a chiral center. But the cyclopentyl is a ring, so unless it's substituted in a way that creates a chiral center, it doesn't contribute to the molecule's chirality. So the only chiral center is at C3, making the molecule optically active.

So the seven compounds:

1. Not active (no chiral center)
2. Active (has chiral centers)
3. Active (two chiral centers)
4. Not active (meso compound)
5. Not active (no chiral center)
6. Not active (meso)
7. Active (chiral center at C3)

Wait, let me recount:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No (not chiral)
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes
3. (2R,3S)-...: Yes
4. (2R,3R)-...: No (meso)
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: No
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (meso)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes

So how many are active? 2, 3, and 7. That's three active. Wait, but earlier I thought 7 is active. So three would be the count.

Wait, but earlier I thought 3 is active, 2 is active, 7 is active. So that's three.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recheck each one.

1. No
2. Yes
3. Yes
4. No
5. No
6. No
7. Yes

So that's three compounds that are active.

Wait, but earlier I thought 3. (2R,3S) is active, and 4. (2R,3R) is not.

So total active: 2, 3, 7. That's three.

But looking back, the options are:

A)5

B)3

C)2

D)4

So the answer would be 3, which is option B.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits chirality through other means, such as a lack of internal symmetry in meso compounds.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound lacks a chiral center because the carbon bonded to the chlorine and the double bond does not have four different substituents. Therefore, it is not optically active.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound has specific stereodescriptors (R, S, and E), indicating the presence of chiral centers. Thus, it is optically active.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two chiral centers (C2 and C3), each with four different substituents. Since the molecule is not symmetric, it is optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two chiral centers (C2 and C3). However, the molecule is symmetric, making it a meso compound and thus not optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The carbon bonded to the hydroxyl group (C1) is not a chiral center because it does not have four different substituents. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 has four different substituents (a methyl group, a cyclopentyl group, and two different alkyl chains), making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**, and **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**. This gives a total of **3 optically active compounds**.
