Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². I remember that in such a system, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z for each direction, but since it's isotropic, I think it's better to look at the radial quantum number.

Wait, no, maybe I should think about the 3D harmonic oscillator in terms of its energy levels. I think the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n + 3/2), where n is a non-negative integer that combines the quantum numbers from each direction. Oh wait, actually, each direction (x, y, z) contributes a quantum number, so like each direction has n_x, n_y, n_z, and the total energy is E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2 *something? Or wait, no: each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2)ħω, so adding all three gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the energy levels are degenerate and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. So, the energy is E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n is the principal quantum number, which is the sum of n_x, n_y, and n_z. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers, and the total quantum number n is n_x + n_y + n_z. So each state is characterized by n and the angular momentum quantum number l, but wait no, in 3D harmonic oscillator, the energy depends only on n, which is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n can be 0,1,2,... So the ground state is n=0, first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. Wait, the question is about the third excited state. Hmm. Let's clarify: the ground state is n=0, first excited
