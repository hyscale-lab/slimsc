Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Wait, what makes a liquid decolorize bromine water? Oh right, alkenes and alkynes can do that because they have unsaturated bonds which react with bromine. So the mixture X must contain alkenes or alkynes. But wait, the question also says that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in the molecules of mixture X. So maybe each component has a single double bond or something else, but not conjugated ones.

Then, when mixture X is treated with platinum under heating, a mixture Y is formed through a disproportionation reaction. Disproportionation is when an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. Like in some redox reactions. So, for example, in the decomposition of H2O2, O is both oxidized and reduced.

Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. That suggests that the products don't have any double bonds anymore. Oh! Because if they did, they would still react with bromine. So maybe the alkenes or alkynes in X were hydrogenated, but wait, no, because mixture Y is formed via disproportionation. Hmm.

Wait, but then the problem says when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions, only one substance Z is obtained. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28
