Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound X was used in the reaction. Let me start by going through the information step by step.

The question says that compound X has the formula C11H12O. It reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given, both 1H and 13C. My task is to find out what X is based on this data.

First, I should probably think about what reaction is happening here. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used for the epoxidation of alkenes. Oh right! It's known as the Sharpless epoxidation reagent, but wait, no, Sharpless is for epoxidizing epoxides with stereochemistry. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Oh wait, no, the Sharpless epoxidation is a specific type, but generally, this compound is involved in epoxide formation from alkenes. So, the reaction here is likely epoxidation, turning an alkene into an epoxide.

So the product is an epoxide. That means the starting material, compound X, must have an alkene that got oxidized into an epoxide. So X is an alkene, and the product is the epoxide form.

Now looking at the NMR data of the product. Let's analyze the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR signals are:
- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

So, two singlets for 3H each. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something deshielded, but perhaps on an aromatic ring or near an electronegative atom. Wait, but the product is an epoxide, so maybe the methyl groups are part of an aromatic substituent, like a methyl attached to the ring (like toluene) or part of a substituent in the epoxide.

Looking at the 13C NMR data:
- δ 21.3 (1C, s) → probably a methyl group attached to something electronegative, maybe an epoxide carbon.
- δ 28.4 (1C, s) → another methyl, perhaps less deshielded, maybe attached to a CH2 group or part of a substituent.
Wait, but wait, the product is an epoxide. Epoxide carbons are typically in the range of around 60-70 ppm. Hmm, but looking at the 13C data, I see a peak at 197.7, which is way up. That's probably a carbonyl group, but wait, epoxides have two adjacent carbons. Wait, but epoxides are ethers, so the carbons are connected to oxygen. Oh wait, but 197 is more like a carbonyl, maybe a ketone. Hmm, that's confusing. Or perhaps it's a carbonyl from another functional group.

Wait, maybe the product isn't just an epoxide. Or maybe the epoxide is part of a structure with another carbonyl.

Wait, but the starting material, X, is C11H12O. The product would be the epoxide, so C11H10O2? Because epoxidation adds an oxygen. Wait, original formula is C
