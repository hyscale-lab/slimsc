Okay, so I have this question about a quasar's observations and determining its comoving distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question gives me that the quasar's spectrum shows a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical. And at shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops a lot. Wait, that makes me think about redshift. Because when objects are moving away, their light gets redshifted. So if the peak is in the infrared, which is longer wavelength than optical, maybe the quasar is at a high redshift.

Wait, visible light is around 400-700 nm. So 790 is near infrared. So the peak is shifted into IR from optical. So if the rest frame peak is in optical, say around 500 nm, then the observed wavelength is 790 nm. That would mean the redshift z is (observed - rest)/rest. So (790-500)/500 = 290/500 = 0.58, so z≈0.58. Or wait, maybe the rest wavelength is in optical, perhaps around 550 nm (green, which is a typical peak for some emission lines?), so z would be (790-550)/550 ≈ 240/550 ≈ 0.436. But I'm not exactly sure about the rest wavelength, but the main idea is that z is about 0.4 or 0.5.

But wait, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance depends on the redshift and the cosmological parameters given. The parameters are H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωλ=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ωm + Ωλ =1, which they do here: 0.3+0.7=1).

The comoving distance, Dc, is a function of the integral over the expansion history of the universe. The formula for comoving distance is (c/H0) times the integral from 0 to z of 1/sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ*(1+z')^ (something) ) dz'. Wait, for dark energy, which is a cosmological constant, the density scales as (1+z)^3 for matter, and (1+z)^0=1 for dark energy. So the integrand is 1/sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ).

So the integral is ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ωm (1+z')^3 + Ωλ)] dz'.

I remember that this integral can be evaluated numerically, and there are look-up tables or approximations for different cosmological parameters.

Alternatively, there's a standard approximation or maybe even a calculator that computes the comoving distance for given z, H0, Ωm, Ωλ.

Wait, but I think for a given redshift z, the comoving distance Dc is (c / H0) * integral from 0 to z of dz' / E(z'), where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). Wait, no, wait. Because E(z) is given by sqrt(Ωm (1+z)^3 + Ωrad (1+z)^4 + Ωλ), but since Ωrad is negligible at these redshifts (z ~0.5), we can ignore it.

So E(z) = sqrt(Ωm (1+z)^3 + Ωλ). Then, the integral is ∫0^z [1 / E(z')] dz'.

So the integrand is 1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7).

Let me think: for a given z, this integral is a number, and then multiplied by c/H0.

But wait, what's the value
