Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

The question describes a series of reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me try to break down each step.

First reaction: Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, typically E2, to form an alkene. The product here is a light yellow solid, product 1. The IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think corresponds to a carbonyl group (C=O). Wait, but elimination usually gives alkenes, which don't have carbonyls. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong. Oh wait, wait! Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but if both are bromines, perhaps it's a double elimination? Or maybe another reaction.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If it's a diamondoid structure, maybe adamantane has a structure where the two bromines are on adjacent carbons. When KOH is used, perhaps it's a double elimination. Wait, but elimination would form a double bond. But the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh, wait! Maybe the reaction is not elimination but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a substitution, but with two leaving groups, maybe a double substitution. Or wait, KOH is a strong base. Dehydration would produce an alkene, but that would have a C=C peak in IR, around 1600-1680 cm⁻¹. But the IR here is at 1720, which is more like a ketone or ester. Hmm.

Wait, wait a
