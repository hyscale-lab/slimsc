Okay, let me try to work through this physics problem. So the question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons into electron-positron pairs. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the process in question is gamma-gamma annihilation: γ + γ → e+ + e-. The problem states that this process limits the lifetime of certain gamma-rays in the universe. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. I need to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetimes are affected by this process.

I think this has to do with the interaction rate of gamma-rays with the CMB background. If the gamma-rays are too high energy, they'll annihilate quickly, so their lifetime is limited by such interactions. So the question is essentially asking for the energy threshold where the annihilation becomes significant enough to limit their lifetime.

Hmm, I recall that the cross-section for this process peaks when the center-of-mass (CM) energy is around twice the electron mass. Wait, the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so twice that is about 1.022 MeV. So the process is more likely when the combined energy of the two photons is around this value. But wait, how does that translate to the individual photon energies?

Well, the CMB photons are low energy, around 1e-3 eV each. So the gamma-ray must be much higher energy. Let me think about the energy in the CM frame. The total energy in the CM frame is the sum of the energies of the two photons, but considering their momenta. Since photons are massless, their energy equals their momentum. So for photons moving in opposite directions (which they are for an annihilation event), the total energy squared would be (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2. Wait, but since the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so the spatial part would subtract? Or wait, wait, in the center of mass frame, the momenta are equal and opposite, so in the lab frame where one photon is from the CMB and the other is the gamma, their directions might not be opposite. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.
