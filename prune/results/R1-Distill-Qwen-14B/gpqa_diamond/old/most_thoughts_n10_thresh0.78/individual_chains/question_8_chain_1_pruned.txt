Okay, so I have this genetics problem about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: they found three genes, G1, G2, G3. They knocked each out and made double mutants. They tested resistance to anthracnose. The control is 100% resistance, so higher numbers mean more resistance.

The results:
- g1: 75% (so 25% less than control)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Wait, so when any of the single mutants is G2, the resistance is 0. So G2 knockout is the most severe. G1 and G3 have partial resistance.

Now, the question is about the gene interactions. I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So if gene A is epistatic over gene B, the phenotype of B depends on A.

They also mention that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream. Transcription factors usually regulate other genes, so they're upstream in a pathway.

Looking at the data, G2's knockout leads to 0% resistance. So whatever G2 does is critical. Since it's a transcription factor, maybe it's regulating the other genes.

Let me think about the double mutants:

When g2 is combined with others, like g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is 0% in both cases. But g1 alone is 75%, g3 is 50%. So when G2 is knocked out, regardless of the other mutations, the resistance is gone. That suggests that G2 is epistatic to both G1 and G3. Because the presence or absence of G1 and G3 doesn't matter when G2 is knocked out—everything goes to 0.

Wait, but what about when you have g1g3? Their resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. Hmm.

So G2 seems to be a key gene. Since G2's knockout gives 0% resistance, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 or G3.

Looking at the single mutants:

g2: 0% → without G2, no resistance. So G2 is necessary for resistance.

g1: 75% → so when G1 is out, resistance is reduced. But not completely gone. So maybe G2 is still functional and provides some resistance through other genes, but not as much as when G1 is present.

g3: 50% → when G3 is out, resistance is halved, but still present.

Now, looking at the double mutants.

g1g2: 0% → So when both G1 and G2 are out, resistance is gone. But if G2 is already out (g2), why does G1's knockout matter? Maybe because in the presence of G2, G1 contributes to the resistance. But when G2 is absent, the pathway is broken regardless of G1.

g1g3: 10% → so even with both G1 and G3 knocked out, you still get some resistance (10%). So perhaps G2 is not the only upstream gene, but G1 and G3 may have some function even without G2. Or maybe G2 is the main TF, and G1 and G3 are downstream, but their combined loss makes the resistance even worse than either alone.

Wait, but without G2, the resistance is already 0, so why does the double mutant g1g2 have 0? Because G2 is already knocked out, so all downstream functions are gone. So in the double mutants, the presence of any missing gene beyond G2 doesn't matter because the pathway is already blocked.

But the other double mutants, like g1g3, which don
