Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, let me think. The question is about arranging six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo this reaction. The options are labeled 1 through 6, each with a different substituent attached to a benzene ring. I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the ring can activate or deactivate the ring and also direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para.

First, I need to figure out for each substituent whether it's an activating or deactivating group. Activating groups make the ring more reactive, while deactivating groups make it less reactive. Also, the substituent's directing effect determines where the incoming electrophile (in this case, bromine) will add.

Let me list each substituent:

1) С6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. It's a strong activating group, so it donates electrons through the inductive effect. Since it's activating, the ring is more reactive. Also, being an activating group, the substituent is ortho/para-directing. So, bromine will add mostly at the para position relative to the methyl group.

Wait, but wait, in the case of substituents, the activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions, but if the substituent is bulky, then para might be favored more because the ortho positions are hindered. Methyl isn't that bulky, so both ortho and para are possible. But I think for a substituent like methyl, the major product is para, but I'm not 100% sure. Or maybe it's a mix. But for this question, it's about the weight fraction of the para-isomer, so higher directing effect towards para would mean higher yield of para.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's a phenyl ester group. Wait, the substituent is COOEt (where Et is ethyl). The carbonyl group is an electron-withdrawing group. So the ester is a deactivating group. Deactivating groups make the ring less reactive, so the reaction might be slower. But wait, the ester is an electron-withdrawing group via the inductive effect. So, it's deactivating. But wait, the ester group is an ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing group that can donate electrons through resonance when in the para position. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. Wait, substituents with lone pairs can donate electrons via resonance, but carbonyl groups (like in esters) are meta directors. Or wait, no. Let me think. No, wait, I remember that the ester group is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

Actually, substituents with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro, carbonyl (like in ketones, esters, etc.) are deactivating and meta-directing. Because they withdraw electrons through inductive effect, making the ring less reactive. Wait, but I thought some groups, like nitro, are meta directors, while some others, like -COOH, are also meta. Wait, maybe I should get this straight.

So, activating groups are electron-donating and are ortho/para directors. Deactivating groups are electron-withdrawing and are meta directors, except when the group is an activating group.

Wait, no. Let me think. Activating groups are those that donate electrons into the ring, activating it, making it more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. Such as -OCH3, -NH2, -CH3.

Deactivating groups withdraw electrons from the ring, making it less reactive. Such as -NO2, -COOH, -COOR (ester), etc.

Now, for directing: activating groups are orth
