Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause the molecule to transition to the next lowest energy state. Let me try to think through this.

First, the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So for rotation-vibration models, the energy levels are quantized, both for rotation and vibration. But wait, the question says it's modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which I think includes both rotational and vibrational energy.

Wait, no. Wait a second. The question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably combines both rotational and vibrational energy. Oh, but the non-rigid rotor model is specifically for rotational states, considering bond vibrations. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The rigid rotor model assumes the bond doesn't stretch, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally accurate) rotor accounts for the bond length changes.

But the question is about the fundamental state. So the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state for both rotation and vibration. So in the quantum mechanical model, the energy levels for a diatomic molecule can be described by the sum of vibrational and rotational energies.

Wait, but in the pure rigid rotor model, the rotational energy is quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For the rigid rotor, the vibrational energy is ignored, but here we're using the rotation-vibration model, so I think it's considering both. Or maybe the question is about the transition between vibrational and rotational states.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think means the lowest possible energy state. So the molecule is in the ground state of both the rotational and vibrational energy levels. So the next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next higher state in either rotation or vibration. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels are often quantized and the transitions between them are governed by selection rules.

In the case of vibrational transitions, typically, the selection rule is Δv = ±1. For rotational transitions, ΔJ = ±1. But the question is about the photon being absorbed. So when a photon is absorbed, it's usually providing energy to cause a transition.

But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So which transition would that be? The lowest energy transition
