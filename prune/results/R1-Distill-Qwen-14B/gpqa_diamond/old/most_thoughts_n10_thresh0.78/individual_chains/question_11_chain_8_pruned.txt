Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology. The question is asking which of the statements A to D is incorrect. I'm a bit rusty on some of these details, but I'll try to think through each option carefully.

First, let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: It says that SARS-CoV-2's nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in mismatch repair. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds to nsp10, making an active exonuclease complex that prevents dsRNA breakdown. Wait, I remember that exoN is an exonuclease, and nsp10 is a cofactor. I think the nsp14 has two domains: the N-terminal is the ExoN, and the C-terminal is the methyltransferase. Oh, wait, no, maybe I'm mixing this up. Or perhaps nsp14 is the exonuclease and nsp10 is a part of the complex. Wait, I think the nsp14 has an endoNuclease domain, but wait no, maybe it's an exonuclease. Or wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. SARS-CoV-2 has a set of proteins, including nsp10 and nsp14. I remember that nsp10 is involved in the exoribonuclease activity, but as a cofactor. Oh right, nsp14 has a methyltransferase activity, and nsp10 is part of the complex for the exoN function. So nsp14-ExoN and nsp10 form a heterodimer. But wait, does this complex prevent the breakdown of dsRNA? Or does it actually help in the breakdown? Because exonucleases generally break down nucleic acids. Oh wait, in the context of the virus, maybe they're involved in processing the RNA or in replication. Wait, I think in some viruses,
