Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes if a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me think.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, I remember that solar neutrinos are produced in various processes, and the pp chain is a main one. Oh right, the proton-proton chain has different branches. The pp-I branch is the main one, pp-II is a minor, and pp-III is even less significant, I think.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch stops, what does that mean for neutrino production? Oh right, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos, specifically electron neutrinos. I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a certain energy range of neutrinos. So if it stops, that part of the neutrino flux would drop.

But the question is about the ratio of flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to figure out how the stopping of pp-III affects these bands.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me recall. The solar neutrinos are mostly from the pp chain. The pp-I branch dominates, producing a lot of lower-energy neutrinos. Then, the pp-II and pp-III branches contribute to higher energies. Oh right, each branch has different neutrino energies.

The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I branch. Let me think about the typical energies. The main pp-I branch produces neutrinos around 200 keV, I think. But the pp-III branch produces higher energy neutrinos, maybe in the 700-800 keV range or higher. Or was it a different part?

Wait, the neutrinos from the CNO cycle also are higher energy, but I don't think that's relevant here because the CNO contributes a smaller fraction. The question specifies that only the pp-III branch is stopped, others remain.

So if pp-III stops, the flux in the higher energy bands would decrease. But what are the energy ranges of the neutrinos from each branch?

I think the main pp-I branch neutrinos are around 200 keV. The pp-II and pp-III produce higher. For example, the pp-III branch's neutrinos might peak higher, perhaps in the 700-800 keV range. So if the pp-III stops, the neutrinos in that band would be affected.

Wait, but the question is the ratio of fluxes between band 1 (700-800) and band 2 (800-900). So band 1 is the 700-800, which would be affected if pp-III stopped, since that's where pp-III neutrinos are.

If pp-III stops, the band 1 flux (700-800) would decrease, but what about band 2, 800-900? Are they from the same source? Or do they come from different processes?

Wait, perhaps the pp-III branch produces the higher energy neutrinos, so band 2 (800-900) might be less affected. Or maybe the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in both bands.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are in higher energy, like above 800 keV. So stopping pp-III would reduce the flux in band 2 more than band 1, or not? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what the pp-III branch produces. The pp-III branch is the so-called "flashes" in the pp chain, which produce a small amount of neutrinos. So the main bulk of neutrinos are from the pp-I branch, and the pp-II and pp-III contribute to higher energies.

If pp-III stops, the neutrino flux in higher energies (like 700-800, maybe even
