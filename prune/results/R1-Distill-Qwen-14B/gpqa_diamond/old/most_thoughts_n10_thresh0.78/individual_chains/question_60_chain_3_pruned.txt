Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Okay, the question is about an astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth at a speed really close to the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old and we need to find out how long the trip would take from their perspective. 

Wait, the options are A to D. Option A suggests the astronaut dies before reaching Earth. The others are various years: 72, 77, 81. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut.

First, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time moves slower for the traveler relative to a stationary observer. But wait, in this case, we're looking at the astronaut's own experienced time, so that's proper time. So I should use the time dilation formula from special relativity.

The formula for time dilation is the proper time (tau) equals the coordinate time (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Oh wait, no, actually, the proper time is the time measured in the moving frame, so tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, maybe I should think about it as the spaceship's clock running slower. Hmm, but the question is from the astronaut's perspective, so the proper time is indeed the one they experience.

Wait, no, the astronaut is the one moving relative to Earth (assuming Earth is the rest frame). So from Earth's perspective, the spaceship is moving fast, so the time on Earth (t) is longer than the time on the spaceship (tau). So the astronaut's experienced time is the proper time.

But wait, the problem is about the time from the astronaut's point of view, so we need to calculate tau.

So I need to find tau, given the speed v, and the distance to Earth. Oh wait, but we don't have the distance given. Oh, wait, the problem mentions the Large Magellanic Cloud. I'm not sure about the exact distance, but maybe I can use the given that it's an engineer from there with a spacecraft traveling at a high speed. Wait, perhaps I should assume that the distance is the same as the distance from the LMC to Earth. Let me think. The LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Wait, but the problem says the spacecraft is going to Earth, so the distance would be approximately that.

So let me think: the distance from the LMC to Earth is roughly about 160,000 light-years. Let's say D is about 200,000 light-years for simplicity, but maybe the exact number
