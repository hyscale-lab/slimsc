Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, meaning it's symmetric around the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and we need to find two things: the fraction of A that's radiated at θ=30 degrees, and what form f takes, which is one of the options given.

Hmm. I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the charge distribution and the direction. Since the charge distribution is spheroidal and symmetric along the z-axis, I think the radiation pattern would have some symmetry related to this axis.

Wait, spheroidal symmetry—like an ellipsoid, but more like a prolate spheroid maybe? Well, whatever, the main point is symmetry along the z-axis. So, the radiation pattern is probably symmetric in θ. That is, the power radiated depends on θ in some specific way.

I remember that for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and falls off as you go towards the poles (θ=0 and 180). The radiation pattern for a dipole is sin²θ, I think. So the power per unit solid angle varies as sin²θ. But wait, this is an oscillating charge distribution, so maybe it's a dipole radiator?

But wait, the problem states that it's a spheroid, so perhaps the charge distribution is such that it's oscillating along the z-axis, making it a dipole-like radiator but with a specific shape.

Wait, another thought. The power radiated in the far zone (radiation zone) by an oscillating dipole is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to (sinθ)^2, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dependence.

Wait, the power per unit solid angle for a dipole is (2/3) (e^2 a^2 ω^4)/(4π c^3 r^2) ) * (1/2) sin²θ, or something like that. Wait, perhaps the exact expression is f(θ) = (something) sin²θ. So the maximum power occurs when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. So at θ=90, sinθ is 1, so the power per unit solid angle is maximum.

Wait, but the problem says "the maximum power thus radiated is A." So A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle, which occurs at θ=90 degrees.

But the question is asking what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees. So we need to calculate f(A, θ) at θ=30 and find what fraction that is of the maximum A.

Wait, but the function f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle. So f(θ) = (some function) times sin²θ. So let's think: if the maximum is at θ=90, then f(θ) must be proportional to sin²θ. So f(θ) = k * sin²θ. And since the maximum is at θ=90, where sinθ=1, then k would be A, because f_max = A = k * 1^2 ⇒ k=A.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the function f(θ) is the power per unit solid angle, which is a function of θ. So if the maximum is A, then f(θ) at θ=90 is A. So f(θ) = A * sin²θ.

Wait, but that would mean that when θ=30 degrees, sinθ=0.5. So sin²θ=0.2
