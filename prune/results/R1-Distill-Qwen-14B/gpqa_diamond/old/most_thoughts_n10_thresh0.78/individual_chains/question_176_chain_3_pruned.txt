Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait a minute—those are just the elements, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as vectors, right? So I think I need to normalize this vector because quantum states must have a norm of 1. 

Wait, but wait—do I really have to normalize it? The problem might not specify, but I think if the state is given, maybe it's already normalized. Let me check the norm. The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is 1/sqrt(6) times (-1, 2, 1). But wait, the question might not require normalization since the exact probabilities can be calculated without it, but I'm not sure. I'll keep that in mind.

The operators P and Q are given as 3x3 matrices. The operator P has elements:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And operator Q is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. Wait no, the other way around: measure Q just after measuring P. Wait, no, the question states: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is first P, then Q. Wait, no, the wording is: "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P". So wait, does that mean they measure P first, then Q? Because if you measure Q after P, the state would have collapsed based on P's outcome.

The
