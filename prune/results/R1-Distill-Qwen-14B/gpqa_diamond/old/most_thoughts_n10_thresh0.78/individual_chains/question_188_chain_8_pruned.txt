Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the crystal is rhombohedral with an interatomic distance of 10 Angstroms. The angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. They want the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, right? But in a crystal, especially a rhombohedral one, the structure has specific lattice parameters. Oh wait, but rhombohedral is a type of crystal system where all edges are equal and all angles are equal. So, it's like a cube that's been deformed a bit but all edges same length.

So in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all equal. Let's denote this as a. The angles between them are all equal too, which in this case are 30 degrees each.

The interatomic distance... wait, in a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance is just 'a', the lattice parameter. But for a rhombohedral system, maybe it's the same? Because if all atoms are at the corners of the cube (like in a simple cubic structure), the distance between nearest neighbors would be 'a' times sqrt(2)/2 if it's face-centered, but wait, no, rhombohedral is more like a cubic structure with all edges equal but angles not 90 degrees.

Wait, maybe the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice constant 'a' because in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is 'a'. So if the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, then a = 10 Angstroms. But wait, maybe in a different structure, like body-centered or something else, but the question says it's a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. So perhaps in this case, the lattice parameter a is 10 Angstrom. Because in a simple cubic structure, the nearest neighbor distance is a. So I'll proceed with a=10 Angstrom.

Now, the question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for interplan
