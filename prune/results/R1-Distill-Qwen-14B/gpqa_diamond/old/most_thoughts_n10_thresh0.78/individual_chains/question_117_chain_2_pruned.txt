Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about optical isomerism in different organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have to be chiral, meaning they lack a plane of symmetry and have a chiral center.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to figure out which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.** Oh, this looks a bit complex. So biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6. Wait, in biphenyl compounds, the substituents can lead to stereoisomerism if the rings can rotate. But for optical isomerism, the molecule needs to have chirality. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won't be chiral.

Wait, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetric, then it won't have optical isomers. Let me think: positions 2 and 2' on each ring. Also, the 6 and 6' positions have nitro groups. So does the structure have a plane of symmetry? If the two rings are arranged so that their substituents mirror each other across the central bond, then yes, maybe it's symmetric. But wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, in biphenyl, numbering goes so that the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So if substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, that's para positions relative to the connecting bond. But then the nitro groups are at 6 and 6'â€”which would be... Wait, number each ring: if the rings are connected at 1 and
