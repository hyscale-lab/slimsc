Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down.

Alright, so the problem says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and it's given by Ay = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as [0, -i] and the second row as [i, 0]. I remember that for angular momentum operators, the Pauli matrices are involved, especially for spin-1/2 particles like the muon, which is a lepton and has spin-1/2.

Wait, so the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, but here S is given as that 2x2 matrix. Let me write down what S looks like:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, wait a minute, that doesn't look like the standard Pauli matrices. Let me recall: the standard Pauli Y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Oh wait, exactly! So S here is actually the Pauli Y matrix. So S = σy.

So then, Ay = c * σy, where c = h/(4π). Wait, but what's the standard form of the angular momentum operators? Oh right, the spin operators are usually written as S = (ħ/2) σ, because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. But here, the operator Ay is given as c times S, which is the same as c * σy.

Wait, but in this problem, c is h/(4π). Let me just note that h is Planck's constant, and ħ is h/(2π). So h/(4π) is ħ/2. So c = ħ/2. So then Ay = (ħ/2) * σy. So that makes sense, because the spin operators for each component are (ħ/2) times the respective Pauli matrices. So S would be the spin operator, but in this case, the matrix given is that of σy, so the operator is (ħ/2) σy.

So the eigenvalues of the operator Ay are the eigenvalues of this matrix. Since Pauli matrices are Hermitian, σy is Hermitian, so Ay is Hermitian. The eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so when multiplied by (ħ/2), they become ±ħ/2.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. The eigenvalues of σy are ±1 because σy^2 = I, so its eigenvalues are 1 and -1. So multiplying by a scalar, the eigenvalues get scaled by that scalar. So if we have σy, then Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy. Since h/(4π) is ħ/2, then the eigenvalues of Ay are (ħ/2) * (±1) → ±ħ/2. Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues would be a = ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π) * 1/2? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, c is h/(4π), so Ay = c * σy. So the eigenvalues a are c multiplied by the eigenvalues of σy. The eigenvalues of σy are ±1, so a = c * (±1) → (h/(4π)) * (±1). So that's ± h/(4π). So that's the eigenvalue.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Let me compute the eigenvalues of Ay.

The matrix Ay is c * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The eigen
