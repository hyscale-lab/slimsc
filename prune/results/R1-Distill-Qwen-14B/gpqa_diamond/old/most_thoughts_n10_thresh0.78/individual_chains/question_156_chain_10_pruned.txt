Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. I need to determine how many peaks each would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation involves adding an oxygen to form an epoxide. So, both reactions are likely epoxidations.

Wait, but wait. When an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene will affect the configuration of the epoxide. Also, mCPBA is a peracid, so the reaction is an electrocyclic opening maybe? Or perhaps it's a concerted process, adding an oxygen across the double bond.

Wait, no, more accurately, mCPBA adds to the double bond in a stereospecific manner. The epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA leads to the formation of an epoxide where the oxygen is added with a specific stereochemistry based on the starting alkene's configuration.

Wait, but in this case, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. So each will form different epoxide products. Let me think.

For (E)-oct-4-ene: The double bond is between C4 and C5. The substituents on either end are opposite, so in (E) configuration, the higher priority groups are on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, it adds an oxygen across the double bond, creating an epoxide.

Wait, so when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. But wait, does the reaction form a trans-dihydroxylation or an epoxide? Oh wait, mCPBA leads to epoxidation, not dihydroxylation. So for each
