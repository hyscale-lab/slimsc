Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember sigmatropic rearrangements involve the movement of a pi bond from one position to another, usually in a cyclic transition state. The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different starting materials and conditions. I need to figure out each product and match them with the options.

Let me start with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Wait, I think this might be a Cope or Claisen rearrangement, but wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine doesn’t sound like the typical substrates I've heard about. Oh wait, maybe it's a Claisen-like rearrangement but with amines.

Claisen rearrangement is when an allyl vinyl ether rearranges to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the starting material is an amine with two methoxy groups. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Stork enamine rearrangement? Stork rearrangement involves enamine formation and then a [3,3] sigmatropic shift.

Wait, the structure of the starting material: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So the structure is NH2-C(OCH3)2. That’s a geminal dimethyl ether on an amine. But wait, maybe when but-3-en-2-ol is added, it forms an enamine?

But but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? No, wait, butane is four carbons. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3 but that's not possible. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, no, I
