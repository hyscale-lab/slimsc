Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that's like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have that carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1, so that's a key point. So the molecule must have an ester functional group, which is usually something like R-O-CO-R'.

Looking at the NMR data: There are six signals. Let's break down each part. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents' positions will affect the splitting. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be a pair each as AB quartets, but maybe in some other pattern depending on the substituents.

Wait, but the problem says two signals for aromatic-H. Oh, wait, di-substituted benzene can have different substitution patterns. Like ortho, meta, or para. Each would have different NMR signals. For example, para would have two sets of equivalent protons—maybe each as a doublet, but perhaps more complex if the substituents are different.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are from double bonds. Ester groups often have a carbonyl but might not have vinyl groups unless there's a double bond elsewhere, maybe in a substituent. Wait, but if the compound has an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, and the other is something else, maybe a vinyl group?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The ester is O-CO-O, but if the substituent is an ester, then the other substituent might be a vinyl group or something else. But the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals. Hmm.

Wait, the substituents on the benzene ring could be an ester and a vinyl group. But wait, vinyl groups are CH2=CH-. So if the substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH2CH2 group attached to the ring, but then the protons on the vinyl would split into certain patterns.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a phenyl group attached via a double bond, like a styrene group. Wait, but that's a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl-H signals: one doublet and one doublet of quartets. So perhaps a vinyl group with two sets of protons, maybe on adjacent carbons. Like in a propenyl group or something else.

Another thought: perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other substituent is a group with a double bond, like a vinyl group. For example, if one substituent is an ester like OAc (acetyloxy), and the other is a vinyl group (like CH2=CH2?), but maybe more complex.

Wait, maybe the substituents are such that each has a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a group like CH2CH2COO... No, maybe it's better to think about the structure.

Wait, the 1H NMR shows two signals for -CH3 groups. Each with their own signals. So maybe two different methyl groups. So perhaps one is part of the ester (like OAc has a CH3COO group), but another methyl from somewhere else. Or perhaps the substituents

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct molecular formula based on the given spectral data. Let me start by reading through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group, which makes sense because esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester functional group. The 1H NMR gives some specific signals: two aromatic protons, two vinyl protons (one doublet and one doublet of quartets), and two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 signals, which suggests that there are no methylene groups in the structure.

Hmm, let's break this down. The aromatic ring being di-substituted means that there are two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The ester group is one of them, right? So the substituents could be an ester group and something else.

Wait, but esters are typically R-O-CO-O-R', or more accurately, an ester is an acyloxy group, like O-CO-O-R. No, wait, correction: esters are R-O-CO-R'. So the structure would be where an oxygen is connected to a carbonyl and another oxygen connected to an alkyl group. So the benzene ring has two substituents, one of which is an ester group.

But wait, the NMR shows two types of aromatic protons. In a benzene ring, the number of protons can vary depending on the substitution. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are para, then there are two equivalent protons each in the ortho positions. If they are meta, then each substituent's adjacent protons would be different. Wait, but in a di-substituted ring, the substituents can be in para, meta, or ortho positions. Wait, but if the substituents are para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if substituents are para, then the aromatic protons would be in two sets: two each. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for aromatic protons. So maybe each aromatic proton is a pair but split into different signals. Hmm, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two distinct sets of aromatic protons.

Wait, let me think. If the substituents are para, then each of the two substituents is opposite each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For example, in para-dimethylbenzene (para-xylene), each ortho position has two equivalent Hs, so the NMR would show two singlets for the aromatic H. Wait, no, in para-xylene, the two substituents are opposite, so the ring has two sets of equivalent protons: the two Hs adjacent to each substituent are equivalent. So each set has two Hs, but they are split into two different signals because of the substituents' positions. Wait,
