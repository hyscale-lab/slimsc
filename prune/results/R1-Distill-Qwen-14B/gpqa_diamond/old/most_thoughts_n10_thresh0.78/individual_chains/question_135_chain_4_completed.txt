Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically dealing with the decay of a boson. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian for the interaction between a bosonic field X and fermions. The Lagrangian is written as:

L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y)

Wait, that looks a bit confusing. Let me parse it. Oh, right, the structure is probably something like a Yukawa coupling term. So, it's a term where the boson X couples to fermions with a coupling strength λ. The (υ + X) part probably is the field strength, where υ is a constant (maybe the vacuum expectation value) and X is the boson field.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermions X can decay into, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

First, I remember that for a boson to decay into a pair of fermions, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of each fermion in the pair. Because the rest mass of the fermions must be less than or equal to half the mass of X. Otherwise, energy and momentum conservation wouldn't allow the decay.

So, the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs. But the fermions have to be light enough. Let's list the known fermion masses (approximate, in GeV):

- Up quark (u): about 2.2 MeV → 0.0022 GeV
- Down quark (d): about 4.7 MeV → 0.0047 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95-105 MeV → ~0.095-0.105 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.2-1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top quark (t): ~173 GeV
- Electron (e-): ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.78 GeV
- Others like neutrinos are negligible, but they are very light, so they might be possible too, but the problem doesn't mention them, probably because they're not in the options.

Wait, but the Lagrangian term involves ψ_f, which is a fermion field. So, the interaction is with all the fermions that have this coupling. The problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian, so the coupling is for each fermion species f. That means X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair that the interaction allows.

But, wait, in reality, the actual couplings depend on the model. For instance, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field couples to fermions with Yukawa couplings, but each fermion has a specific coupling. However, in this problem, the Lagrangian seems to imply that X couples to all fermions since it's written as a general term. So, perhaps X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, as long as the mass condition is satisfied.

But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV. So, each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. Let's see: each fermion pair must have two particles each with mass m, so 2m ≤ 6 GeV → m ≤ 3 GeV.

Looking at the fermion masses:

- e-: 0.0005 GeV → 2m is 0.001 GeV. So, X can decay into e+ e-.
- μ-: ~0.105 GeV → 2m ~ 0.21 GeV. So, allowed.
- τ-: ~1.78 GeV → 2m ~3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 6 GeV? No, wait 1.78 is each, so 3.56 for both. Oh wait no, 1.78 GeV * 2 is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So τ pair is allowed.

Quarks:

- u and d are super light, so their pairs are allowed.
- s quarks: each about 0.1 GeV, so 0.2 GeV total. Allowed.
- c quarks: each around 1.5 GeV → 3 GeV for the pair. So 3 GeV is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.
- b quarks: each around 4.5 GeV → 9 GeV for the pair. Oh wait, that's more than 6 GeV. So 9 GeV >6 GeV → decay into b bbar is not allowed. Because 4.5 *2 =9 GeV >6 GeV. So X can't decay into b and anti-b because that would require at least 9 GeV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So, for X → b + bbar, each b has mass m. So 2m should be ≤6 GeV. So m ≤3 GeV. The mass of the b quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is larger than 3 GeV. So 4.5 *2=9>6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar.

So looking back at the options:

Option A: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-.

But according to our earlier reasoning, b bbar isn't allowed because 2m >6 GeV. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Wait, in option B, the decay includes c cbar. The c quark has a mass around 1.5 GeV, so 2m is 3 GeV, which is ≤6 GeV. So that's allowed. So option B includes c cbar, which is allowed. But what about tau+ tau-? Their mass is 1.78 GeV each, 3.56 GeV total. So yes, allowed. But what about mu+ mu-, which would have a combined mass of about 0.21 GeV, allowed. e+ e- even more so.

But looking at the option, option B includes c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e pairs. So that's possible if X can decay into all these.

Option C: X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, t tbar, tau, mu, e.

Wait, the top quark has a mass of ~173 GeV. 2m is way over 6 GeV. So decay into t tbar is impossible. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: X → b bbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau, mu, e.

As previously, b bbar is not allowed. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, but in option B, why is c cbar present? Because 2m_c ~3 GeV is allowed. So the allowed fermions are:

e, mu, tau (leptons), u, d, s, c (quarks), and maybe others like strange. But not b or t.

So looking at the options, the correct one should include all allowed fermions, but not include b or t.

Looking at the options, option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's correct. Option A includes b, which is not allowed.

Wait, but wait another thing: the coupling. The Lagrangian given is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this is a Yukawa-like term, which would imply that X couples to all fermions. So X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, the possible decays are:

- e+ e-
- μ+ μ-
- τ+ τ-
- u ubar
- d dbar
- s sbar
- c cbar

But not b bbar or t tbar, because their masses are too high.

So the allowed decay channels include all these except b and t.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A includes b, which is not allowed. So A is out.

Option B includes c, which is allowed, and excludes b. So B is a possible correct option.

Option C includes t, which is not allowed. So C is out.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed. So D is out.

So the correct answer should be B.

But wait, the options given are:

Option B) X → c cbar, s sbar, u ubar, d dbar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-

So that's exactly what we concluded. So the correct option is B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, based on the given interaction Lagrangian. The decays must satisfy the condition that the total mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of each fermion in the pair.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mass Constraints**: For \( X \) to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair \( f \bar{f} \), the mass of the fermion \( m_f \) must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This means \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

2. **Fermion Masses**:
   - **Leptons**:
     - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
   - **Quarks**:
     - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 0.0022 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.0044 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 0.0047 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.0094 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 3.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
     - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.0 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
     - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

3. **Allowed Decays**: Based on the above, \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
   - \( e^+ e^- \)
   - \( \mu^+ \mu^- \)
   - \( \tau^+ \tau^- \)
   - \( u \bar{u} \)
   - \( d \bar{d} \)
   - \( s \bar{s} \)
   - \( c \bar{c} \)

   Decays into \( b \bar{b} \) or \( t \bar{t} \) are not allowed because their combined masses exceed 6 GeV.

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
   - **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c} \), \( s \bar{s} \), \( u \bar{u} \), \( d \bar{d} \), \( \tau^+ \tau^- \), \( \mu^+ \mu^- \), and \( e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. **Correct**.
   - **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.
   - **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
