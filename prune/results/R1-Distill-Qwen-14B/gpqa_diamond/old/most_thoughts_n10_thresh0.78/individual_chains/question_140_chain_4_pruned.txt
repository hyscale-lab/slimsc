Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The molecule of gas W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Another part says that when a certain keto acid reacts with substance X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a very close analog. I need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, okay. Let's start by identifying what each part might mean.

First, gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So the molecule is likely a noble gas because they’re inert. Wait, but wait. The same number of neutrons and protons—each atom in the molecule would have that. So like, for example, if it's a molecule of a noble gas, each atom would have equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe it's a diatomic molecule, but the same for each atom. For example, Argon has 18 protons and 22 neutrons, but that wouldn't be the same. Wait, maybe it's He, which is 2 protons and 2 neutrons. So each He atom has 2 and 2. So He gas, maybe. But wait, He is monoatomic. Oh, but if W is a diatomic gas, like O2 or N2, but those wouldn't have protons equal to neutrons. Let me think. Wait, maybe W is CO2? No, because CO2 has different numbers. Wait, perhaps W is H2O? No, that doesn't fit either. Wait, maybe it's a molecule where each atom has the same number of protons and neutrons. So each atom in the molecule has p = n. Like, for example, carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if the molecule is C, but that's solid, not gas. Or maybe it's something like O2? No, oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in O-16, but O2 is O atoms with 8 each. Wait, but O has 8 protons, so each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (for O-16). So if W is O2 or O3, then each atom in W has p = n = 8. That would fit. Alternatively, maybe it's nitrogen gas, N2. Each N atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (N-14). So p = n =7. That could work too. Or maybe it's carbon monoxide (CO) but that's a molecule, but each atom in CO has p=6 and n=6 (C-12 and O-16, but O would have 8 protons, so that doesn't fit). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

Wait, the molecule's atoms each have equal protons and neutrons. So each atom in W has p = n. So each atom is an isotope where the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So for example, carbon-12: 6 protons, 6 neutrons. Oxygen-16: 8 protons, 8 neutrons. Chlorine-35: 17 protons, 18 neutrons? No, that's not equal. So the possible atoms are those where protons equal neutrons, so atomic mass is approximately 2p. So possible atoms are C (12), O (16), Ne (20, but p
