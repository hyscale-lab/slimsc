Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. So, let me read it again. The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think that's a vector with three components. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector is a column vector, so this must be a 3x1 vector.

The observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down what P looks like. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is to find the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and see which one is 0. Then, the probability of getting 0 is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude associated with that eigenvalue.

Wait, but perhaps I should find the eigenvalues first. Let me think. Alternatively, maybe P is a projection operator. Because when I look at the matrix, the elements on the diagonal are zero except in the middle of the second row and column. Hmm, but the eigenvalues of a projection operator are 0 and 1. Oh wait, no, not necessarily. Let me think again.

Wait, if P is a projection operator, then its eigenvalues are 0 and 1. Because a projection matrix satisfies P² = P. Let me check if that's the case here. Let's compute P squared and see.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a projection matrix, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed step by step.

First, let's find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, that's a symmetric matrix, so it's diagonalizable, and eigenvalues are real.

To find the eigenvalues, I can solve the characteristic equation det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let's compute the determinant of (P - λ I), where I is the 3x3 identity matrix.

The matrix (P - λ I) will have:

- λ on the diagonal elements (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)

So:

Row 1: -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ

Now, compute the determinant:

| -λ   1/√2   0   |
|1/√2  -λ    1/√2|
| 0    1/√2  -λ  |

The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

So determinant = -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * something.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The determinant is calculated as:

-λ * det( [ -λ, 1/√2; 1/√2, -λ ] )

minus (1/√2) * det( [1/√2, 1/√2; 0, -λ ] )

plus 0 * something, so that term is zero.

So, first term:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = -λ [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term:

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)*0 ) ] = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) ) = - (1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ)/2.

So putting it all together:

determinant = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2 )

Wait, no. Because the second term is subtracted, so:

determinant = (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ]

Wait, wait, let me correct. The expansion is:

det = (-λ) * [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 

- (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]

+ 0

So compute each part:

First term: (-λ) [ λ^2 - 1/2 ]

Second term: -(1/√2) [ ( -λ / sqrt(2) ) ]

Which is -(1/√2) * (- λ / sqrt(2) ) = (λ) / 2.

So the determinant is:

(-λ)(λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2)

= -λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2)

= -λ³ + λ.

Wait, that's because (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ³ + (λ/2). Then adding (λ/2) from
