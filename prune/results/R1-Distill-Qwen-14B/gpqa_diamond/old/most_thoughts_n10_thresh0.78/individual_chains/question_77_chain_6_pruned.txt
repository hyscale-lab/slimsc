Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. The reaction forms a new diene structure. Right, and it can be initiated by heat or light. The question gives two different reactions, and I need to find the major products A and B from each. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to D.

Let's start with the first part: the reaction producing compound A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So the structure... Wait, benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group connected to a methyl group and another butenyl group. Let me draw this out.

The substituent is OCH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, no wait, the but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- no, no, wait: but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between carbons 2 and 3. Wait, no, 1-yl means the substituent is at position 1. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, that's five carbons? No, butene is four carbons, so but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2- but the substituent is on the first carbon. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as the substituent attached to the benzene is OCH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no.

Wait, the substituent
