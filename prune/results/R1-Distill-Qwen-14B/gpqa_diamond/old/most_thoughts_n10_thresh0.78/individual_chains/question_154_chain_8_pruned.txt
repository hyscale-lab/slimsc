Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the structure of the unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let's see what I've got.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. So the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, that might be a fragment or maybe a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has an isotope at around m/z 35 and 37. If the molecular formula has one Cl atom, the molecular ion would have peaks at 156 (Cl-35) and 158 (Cl-37). Let me check the options to see which have chlorine.

The IR data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H bonds, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is probably a carbonyl group (C=O). So maybe a carboxylic acid, ester, or aldehyde. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually very broad, which fits the broad peak. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) is a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton because they typically appear around 10-12 ppm as a singlet due to the lack of neighboring hydrogens. The other signals: 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two doublets in aromatic region, which would be typical for a benzene ring where the two Hs are adjacent to substituents. For example, if the substituents are at the para positions, the Hs would be in two doublets, each integrating to 2H.

So putting this together. The IR suggests a carbonyl and an O-H. The NMR suggests a benzoic acid with substituents. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would have Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at position 1. Wait, benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group. But the NMR doesn't show a signal for an aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. But here we have a singlet at 11 ppm, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So maybe not A.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzene ring with Cl at position 4 and a COOH group at position 1 (since benzoic acid is at position 1). The NMR would have the COOH proton at ~11 ppm (singlet), and the aromatic protons. For 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The other positions (2,3,5,6) would have Hs. Wait, but in such a case, the aromatic protons would be in the ortho and para positions. Let me think. COOH is at 1, Cl at 4. So the Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and meta to Cl. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH.

Wait, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. The coupling would be such that the Hs at 2 and 6 are each adjacent to the COOH group (position 1) and the Cl at position 4. So, for the H at position 2: it's next to COOH (para to Cl?), or maybe I'm mixing up positions. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs at positions 2 and 6 are each adjacent to Cl and COOH. So their chemical shifts would be similar and might split into a doublet or more complex pattern.

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene, but with substituents in such a way that the remaining Hs are in two pairs of doublets. So for example, in para-substituted benzene, like p-methylbenzoic acid, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets. So back to option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure is:

COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4. So the ring would have Hs at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 are each ortho to COOH and meta to Cl; protons at 3 and 5 are ortho to Cl and meta to COOH.

But wait, in the NMR, the two doublets each have 2H. So positions 2 and 6 would be one set, and positions 3 and 5 another. But wait, in reality, for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Hs at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH (position 1), which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, so their shifts would be downfield. The Hs at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl (position 4), which is a slightly deactivating group, but not as strong as COOH. So the 2 and 6 Hs would be more downfield than 3 and 5. Alternatively, maybe they are all in the region around 8 ppm.

Wait, the NMR shows 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So perhaps the two doublets correspond to two sets of equivalent protons. Let's imagine that the substituents are in para positions. So if the substituents are at positions 1 and 3, maybe. Hmm, no, that would make the ring have adjacent substituents. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl), making the ring have substituents in the ortho positions. But that would lead to more complex coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions para, so the aromatic protons are in positions 2,3,5,6. Wait, let me think of 4-chlorobenzoic acid again. The Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, so their shifts would be more downfield. The Hs at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. So their shifts would be upfield compared to 2 and 6. Wait, but in the NMR, the higher ppm (8.02) would be more deshielded. So the two Hs at 2 and 6 would have higher ppm, appearing as a doublet. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be more shielded, appearing at 7.72, also as a doublet. That makes sense because in NMR, the splitting comes from coupling with adjacent protons, so each pair is split into a doublet. So that fits the data perfectly.

So 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have the signals: 2 Hs at ~8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 2 Hs at ~7.72 ppm (d, 2H), with the COOH proton at 11.0 ppm. That matches the NMR data.

What about the mass spec? The molecular ion is at 156. Let me calculate the formula. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. So 84 +5=89; 89 +35.5=124.5; 124.5 + 32= 156.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C7H6ClO2. Let me recalculate. C7: 84, H6:6, Cl:35.5, O2:32. Total is 84+6=90, +35.5=125.5, +32=157.5. Oh wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the molecular formula is C8H7ClO2? No, that would be higher. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in considering the molecular formula.

Wait, the molecular ion is 156. Let me think about the options. Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid: formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, let me calculate that again. Each C is 12, 7*12=84. H=5, 5*1=5. Cl=35.5. O=2*16=32. So total is 84 +5=89; 89 +35.5=124.5; 124.5 +32=156.5. Oh, so the molecular weight is approximately 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156 (m/z 156). So that's close. But why is there a peak at 158? Oh, because chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% at 35 (mass 35) and 25% at 37 (mass 37). So the molecular ion would appear as a doublet: the base peak at 156 (35 Cl), and the next at 158 (37 Cl), which is about 25% of the base peak. In the problem, the main peak is m/z 156 (100%) and m/z 158 (32%). That's a ratio of approximately 32% for 158, which is about 25% as expected. So that makes sense. So the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, molecular weight 156.5, which rounds to 156 as the molecular ion.

So that fits. So option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Let me check the other options.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. The Hs at 4 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, and Hs at 3 and 5 adjacent to COOH. The NMR for that would have more complicated splitting because the substituents are adjacent. The doublets might not be as clean as in the para case. Also, the chemical shifts would be different. I'm not sure, but the para-substituted compound (option B) seems to fit better.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's OCl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, or maybe ClCO-O-Ph. The structure would be something like Cl-CO-O-Ph. The molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Let's compute molecular weight: 8*1
