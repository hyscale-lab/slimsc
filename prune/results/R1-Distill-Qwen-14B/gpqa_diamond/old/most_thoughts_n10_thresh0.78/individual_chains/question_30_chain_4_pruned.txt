Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the color of light it absorbs. Hmm, I remember from chemistry class that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. Wait, I think this has to do with the concept of complementary colors. Like, if something absorbs blue light, it might appear orange because blue and orange are complementary.

The question states that the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to figure out which color it absorbs. Oh right, the energy of the absorbed photon relates to the energy gap in the molecule, like the band gap. The emission energy is related to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then when it drops back down, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the energy of the emitted photon. Because the absorbed energy raises the molecule's energy, and then part of that energy is released as light when it relaxes.

So the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. That's the energy of the photon it emits. But the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that. Because the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the excited and ground states. So the absorbed energy is higher, meaning the wavelength is shorter.

Wait, energy and wavelength are inversely related. Higher energy means shorter wavelength. The visible spectrum goes from violet (short wavelength, high energy) to red (long wavelength, low energy). So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, I need to find the absorbed energy, which is higher.

Let me think, what's the energy range for visible light? I remember that the visible spectrum is roughly from about 2 eV (violet) to 1.7 eV (red). Wait, no, wait. Electromagnetic energy: higher energy is lower wavelength. So 1 eV corresponds to about 1240 nm (infrared), 2 eV would be
