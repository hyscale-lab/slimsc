Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products: a major and a minor. Both have the molecular formula C13H16O3. Then, the NOESY NMR spectra show a cross-peak in the major product but not the minor. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak.

I remember that in NMR, especially NOESY, cross-peaks indicate spatial proximity of protons. So, if two protons are close in space, they'll show a cross-peak. This usually happens in cis or trans configurations, depending on the structure.

Let me try to outline the steps:

1. The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with cis-alkene. Dehydration of this would form an anhydride. Since the starting alkene is cis, the resulting anhydride would have a particular structure. Dehydration of a diacid typically forms an anhydride by losing water between the two carboxylic acid groups.

2. The anhydride has specific NMR signals. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, which is a region typical for aromatic protons or maybe some conjugated system. Wait, but the anhydride might have some kind of conjugated double bond or ring. Alternatively, maybe it's an annulated system. The 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, like an sp² carbon in a double bond. 165 is likely an ester or anhydride carbonyl. So perhaps the anhydride has a structure where two carbonyl groups are connected, maybe via an oxygen bridge.

3. When the anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, it probably undergoes some kind of Diels-Alder reaction. The cyclopentadiene is a diene, and the anhydride would act as a dienophile. Diels-Alder adds a six-membered ring, bicyclic perhaps. So the product would be a bicyclic compound with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

Wait, the reaction is between the anhydride (dienophile) and the tetramethylcyclopentadiene (dienophile? No, the diene is the conjugated diene, so the cyclopentadiene is the diene, and the anhydride is the dienophile).

The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered cyclohexene derivative. The substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) would end up on the same face (cis) because of the endo rule. But in this case, since it's a ring, maybe it's more about the structure of the product.

So, the major and minor products come from possible stereochemistry in the Diels-Alder adduct. The endo transition state is more favorable, so the major product would be the endo adduct. The minor product could be the exo, or perhaps another regioisomer if there's more than one possible way to combine.

The molecular formula of the products is C13H16O3. Let me check the starting materials. The anhydride comes from a diacid. Let's say the diacid is something like HOOC-(CH2)n-CH2-COOH. Wait, but the starting material is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. So maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, if it's a cis-alkene, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond somewhere. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups, making it cis. So, the structure would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with the middle CH2 replaced by a CH2-CH2 with a double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but that can't have a double bond. Oh, wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, when the diacid is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. So, the structure would have an oxygen bridge connecting the two carbonyl groups. For example, something like:

O
||
O-C-O
   ||
   C-O-C-O
   and so on.

Wait, perhaps it's a structure like this: the dicarboxylic acid is a substituted maleic acid (since the starting alkene is cis). So, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, and the double bond is between the two CH groups, and it's in the cis configuration.

Wait, yes. So, the starting dicarboxylic acid is cis-butenedioic acid, which is maleic acid. Dehydration of maleic acid would give maleic anhydride. So the anhydride is a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen bridge.

So, the anhydride structure is a five-membered ring: O=C-O-C-O, with the O's connected in a ring? Wait, no, maleic anhydride is a cyclic structure where two carbonyl groups are connected via two oxygen atoms in a five-membered ring. So the structure would be a cyclic anhydride, I think.

Now, when this reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene, the Diels-Alder reaction would proceed. The cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. The 1,3-cyclopentadiene would react with the anhydride as the dienophile.

Wait, the reactant is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So the diene is a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups attached. Let me draw this structure mentally. The cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with a conjugated diene, positions 1 and 3. But the molecule is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl. So, positions 1,2,3,4 on the cyclopentene have methyl groups. So, that would make the structure a cyclopentene ring where positions 1 and 3 are double bonds (making it 1,3-cyclopentadiene) and positions 1,2,3,4 each have methyl groups. So the structure would have two double bonds? Wait, no, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene has double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene.

Wait, no. 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, but that's not possible in a five-membered ring. Wait, no, wait, in cyclopentadiene, the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. But that's not possible. Oh wait, no. 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have a ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4 positions, which would make the ring have a conjugated diene. Hmm, but that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a bicyclic compound? Or perhaps it's a monocyclic with two double bonds. Wait, perhaps it's a diene in a five-membered ring. Let me think. I might be overcomplicating this part.

Regardless, the key point is that this cyclopentadiene is the diene in the Diels-Alder reaction, and the anhydride is the dienophile. The Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with substituents from both the diene and dienophile.

In the Diels-Alder reaction, the dienophile (anhydride) attacks the diene in a [4+2] cycloaddition. The endo rule suggests that the major product is the endo transition state, where the substituents on the dienophile are on the same face as the diene's substituents.

The products have the same molecular formula, so the major and minor products are stereoisomers, perhaps cis and trans or endo/exo.

Wait, but the question mentions that the NOESY NMR shows a cross-peak only in the major product. So, in the major product, two protons are close in space, leading to a cross-peak, whereas in the minor product, they are not, or perhaps the cross-peak is very weak.

So, in the major product, which likely is the endo adduct, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) are positioned in such a way that certain protons are close enough to cause a NOE effect.

Let me think about the structure of the Diels-Alder adduct. The dienophile would add across the diene, forming a cyclohexene derivative. The substituents (from the anhydride) would be on adjacent carbons in the new six-membered ring. Since the anhydride is a cyclic structure, the substituents would be two ester groups or something similar.

Wait, the anhydride is a cyclic structure (like maleic anhydride) which has two ketone groups connected by an oxygen. So, when it reacts, the maleic anhydride would add across the diene. The cycloadduct would have a six-membered ring with two ester groups (from the anhydride) attached to adjacent carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that in the adduct, there's a bridge formed, making a bicyclic compound.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, when it reacts, perhaps the Diels-Alder adds across the diene, creating a new six-membered ring. The substituents from the diene (the methyl groups) would be on the new ring.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. Maybe I should think about the NMR information.

The anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. That's a region where aromatic protons appear, but the anhydride is from maleic acid, which doesn't have aromatic protons. So perhaps it's a carbonyl group adjacent to an electronegative group. Wait, 7 ppm is more likely for an aromatic proton, but maybe it's a conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that's usually higher upfield. Hmm, maybe it's a vinyl proton. Wait, but in maleic anhydride, the structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure is:

O=C-(C-O)-C=O, but arranged in a ring. Wait, no, maleic anhydride is cyclic with an oxygen bridge. So the structure is O=C-(CH)-O-C=O, but arranged in a five-membered ring. So the four-membered ring would have two double bonds. Wait, no, maleic anhydride is a five-membered ring: the structure is O=C-O-C-(CH2)-O-C=O? No, I think I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, correct structure of maleic anhydride: it's a cyclic anhydride of maleic acid. The structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O
   \
    C=C
   /
O

Wait, no. Maybe it's better to draw it mentally: it's a cyclic structure where two carbonyl groups are connected via an oxygen bridge. The structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. So, the positions are: O=C-O-C-O with the double bonds in the ring. So, the structure is indeed a five-membered ring.

In any case, the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a singlet at 7 ppm. That suggests that there's a group with equivalent protons. Maybe two protons that are equivalent and in an environment that causes them to be around 7 ppm. For example, in an aromatic ring, but perhaps in a conjugated system.

Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen. Wait, no, carbonyl protons are usually at higher ppm. Or perhaps it's a diene proton? But in maleic anhydride, the protons are on the same side of the double bond, but they are in a conjugated system. Wait, no, maleic anhydride doesn't have any protons in the ring because the ring is fully conjugated and the carbons are all either double-bonded or part of the oxygen bridge. So the 1H NMR of the anhydride would have no peaks except maybe from any remaining protons. Wait, but the question says the anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. So perhaps the anhydride has some protons that resonate around 7 ppm. Oh wait, maybe the anhydride isn't maleic but another structure. Alternatively, perhaps the diacid has a substituent that includes a benzene ring, but that's probably not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the diacid was something else. Wait, the diacid is a cis-alkene. So, the structure is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond: that would be HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the two middle CH2 groups, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH(CH2)-CH(CH2)-COOH, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane derivative, but that's unlikely. I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should move on and try to think about the reaction products.

So, the Diels-Alder reaction forms a six-membered ring with substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) and the diene (tetramethylcyclopentadiene). The substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) would be ester groups or similar. The substituents from the diene would be the methyl groups from the tetramethylcyclopentadiene. So, in the product, there would be four methyl groups attached to the cyclohexene ring, plus the substituents from the anhydride.

Wait, the diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, when it undergoes Diels-Alder, the two ends of the diene (positions 1 and 3) would form the new sigma bonds with the dienophile. The substituents (methyl groups) at positions 1,2,3,4 would be part of the new six-membered ring.

So, the Diels-Alder product would have the four methyl groups from the diene attached to the cyclohexene ring. The dienophile (anhydride) would contribute two substituents, perhaps as ester groups or carbonyl groups.

Wait, but the anhydride is a cyclic structure. When it reacts, the two carbonyl groups would become substituents on adjacent carbons in the six-membered ring. So, the product would have two substituents (like ester groups) attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Now, considering the products. The major product is the endo transition state, so the substituents from the dienophile are on the same face as the diene, making them cis in the adduct.

The NMR data for the major product shows a cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum. So, two protons that are spatially close are causing this cross-peak. The question is, which two resonances are connected.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Option C: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm.

Wait, perhaps the cross-peak connects a methyl group (singlet) with another group of protons. For example, in the major product, a methyl group is near another set of protons, leading to the NOE effect.

If the product has multiple methyl groups, perhaps some are axial and equatorial in the ring. In the endo product, certain groups are cis, leading to spatial proximity.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo rule would position the substituents (like methyl groups) on the same face as the dienophile's substituents. So, perhaps in the major product, the methyl groups are on the same face, making some protons adjacent.

But I'm not entirely sure about the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak is between a methyl group and a hydrogen that's on an adjacent carbon, leading to a NOE effect.

Another thought: the cross-peak connects a methyl group (singlet) and another proton group. Let's think about what each option implies.

Option A: 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. The 6H singlet suggests a group of equivalent protons, like three methyl groups (each with two H) but that's 6H, or perhaps a single -CH2CH2CH3 group but that's 3H. Wait, no, 6H would be three methyl groups (each has 3H, but 3 × 2 = 6? No, each CH3 has 3H, but 3 CH3 groups would have 9H. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. A singlet with 6H could be two sets of three equivalent protons each. Alternatively, it's a group like two separate CH2 groups, each with 3H, but that would be 6H, but that's a doublet or something else. Hmm, perhaps the 6H is a methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with six equivalent protons, but that's probably not the case.

Option B: 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 6H singlet could be methyl groups, maybe attached to the ring. The 2H singlet suggests two equivalent protons, perhaps on a CH2 group in a symmetrical position.

Option C: Two singlets, 6H at ~1.7 and another 6H at ~1.7. That would mean two sets of equivalent protons, maybe two methyl groups each with three H (but that's 6H each, which would be two CH2 groups). Wait, no, three CH2 groups would have 6H each. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. That suggests a proton that's coupled to one other proton (doublet) and another group of two equivalent protons (singlet). Maybe a methyl group and an oxygen-bearing CH2.

But how does this relate to the NOESY cross-peak? The cross-peak is between a 6H singlet and another proton group.

Wait, perhaps in the major product, there's a methyl group (the 6H singlet) that's spatially close to a proton on an adjacent carbon. So, the cross-peak connects the 6H group to another proton group.

Wait, but the options don't all have the same groups. Let me look.

Option B says 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. So perhaps the 6H is a set of methyl groups, and the 2H is a CH2 group attached to something else, like an oxygen.

If the cross-peak connects these two, it suggests that the methyl groups are near the CH2 group.

In the Diels-Alder adduct, the endo transition state would position the substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) on the same face as the substituents from the diene. So, the methyl groups from the diene (tetramethylcyclopentadiene) would be on the same face as the substituents from the anhydride.

In the product, the substituents from the dienophile (anhydride) would be adjacent to each other on the cyclohexene ring. So, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons, and the methyl groups are attached in a way that some are axial, others equatorial.

Wait, but in the Diels-Alder product, the substituents from the dienophile (like the anhydride's groups) would be on the same face as the diene's substituents (the methyl groups). So, the methyl groups from the diene would be on the same face as the substituents from the anhydride.

So, in the major product (endo), the substituents are all on the same face. This would bring together certain protons, leading to the NOE effect.

In the product, if there are two substituents from the anhydride (like ester groups) on adjacent carbons, and the methyl groups from the diene are attached to the ring in such a way that some are close to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents from the anhydride are on opposite ends of the ring, creating a bridge.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclic compound. So, the Diels-Alder adds to form a bridge, making a bicyclo structure. In that case, there might be bridgehead protons that are close to each other.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to think of the possible structures.

The diene is a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. So, when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (five-membered ring) would add the dienophile across two of its double bonds, forming a six-membered ring. The product would have substituents from the diene (methyl groups) and from the dienophile (anhydride groups).

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Wait, that might be the case.

Wait, the Diels-Alder adds a six-membered ring, but if the diene is part of a ring, the product could be a bicyclic structure. For example, if the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, adding the dienophile could form a bicyclo structure like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene.

So, in the product, substituents from the dienophile (like the anhydride) would be at bridgeheads. The methyl groups from the diene would be distributed around the rings.

In such a structure, certain protons would be close. For example, in a bicyclo structure, bridgehead protons are often cis, leading to possible NOE interactions.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to think of the NMR data.

The major product's NOESY shows a cross-peak between two groups. The question is, which two?

Looking at the options, perhaps the cross-peak connects a methyl group (singlet) with a CH2 group (singlet) or a CH group with another.

Option B: 6H singlet (probably methyl groups) and 2H singlet (possibly a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen). So, perhaps the 6H methyl is near the CH2 group.

In the structure, the methyl groups from the diene would be close to the substituents from the anhydride. Maybe the CH2 group is part of the bridge, and the methyl groups are on adjacent carbons.

If the CH2 group is near a methyl group, they would show a cross-peak in NOESY.

Alternatively, perhaps the 2H singlet is part of an ester group (like OCH2O), but that's unlikely since the singlet suggests no splitting.

Wait, if the product has an ester group, the oxygen would be attached to a CH2 group. For example, if the anhydride becomes part of an ester substituent, perhaps as an ester group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

So, maybe the substituent from the anhydride is an ester group, such as O-CO-O, but that's part of the ring.

Wait, the anhydride's structure is such that when it reacts, it becomes an ester substituent on the Diels-Alder adduct.

In the major product, the endo transition state would have the ester groups positioned in a way that certain protons are close.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents from the anhydride are on opposite ends of the ring, and the methyl groups are arranged such that in the endo product, some methyls are near the ester groups.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the NMR data for the major product.

The 1H NMR of the major product would have certain signals. The cross-peak implies that two groups are close. So, looking at the options, the 6H singlet is at ~1.7 ppm, which is typical for methyl groups attached to a carbonyl group. The 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm could be a CH2 group near an oxygen, like an ester or ether.

So, if the 6H singlet is from methyl groups adjacent to the ester group, and the 2H is from the ester's CH2, then perhaps in the major product, these two groups are close, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H is a cyclopropyl group or something else, but that's less likely.

Now, considering the options, option B connects the 6H singlet and the 2H singlet, implying that the methyl groups are near the CH2 group.

In the major product, the endo adduct would have the substituents from the dienophile (like the ester groups) near the substituents from the diene (methyl groups), leading to their proximity and thus the NOE effect.

So, if the 6H singlet is from three methyl groups (each contributing 2H?), but that doesn't add up. Wait, no. 6H would be two methyl groups each with 3H, but that's 6H total.

Wait, no, each methyl group (CH3) has three H. So, two methyl groups would give 6H. So, the 6H singlet could be two methyl groups (each CH3) attached in a symmetrical fashion. The 2H singlet could be a CH2 group, perhaps attached to an oxygen.

So, in the major product, these two groups are near each other, leading to a cross-peak.

Looking at the options, option B is 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm.

So, the cross-peak is between a methyl group (or two methyl groups) and a CH2 group. This would happen if the CH2 is adjacent to the methyl group(s), perhaps in a bridge structure.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option B.


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that is dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major (endo) and a minor (exo) product. Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The key difference between the products is the spatial arrangement of substituents, which is reflected in the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product shows a cross-peak, indicating spatial proximity between two groups, while the minor product does not.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Anhydride Structure**: The anhydride is likely maleic anhydride, a five-membered cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen bridge. Its 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, consistent with a conjugated system, and its 13C NMR shows peaks at 137 ppm (sp² carbon) and 165 ppm (carbonyl carbon).

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**: The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (diene) forms a bicyclic compound. The major product follows the endo rule, where substituents from the dienophile and diene are on the same face of the newly formed six-membered ring. The minor product is the exo isomer.

3. **NOESY NMR Data**: In the major product, a cross-peak is observed, indicating spatial proximity between two groups. This is absent or weak in the minor product. The cross-peak connects a 6H singlet (likely methyl groups) and a 2H singlet (likely a CH2 group near an oxygen atom).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This does not align with the expected spatial proximity in the major product.
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm (likely methyl groups) and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm (likely a CH2 group near an oxygen atom). This matches the expected spatial proximity in the major product.
   - **Option C**: Two 6H singlets at ~1.7 ppm. This does not explain the cross-peak involving a 2H singlet.
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This does not involve the 6H singlet observed in the major product.

### Conclusion:
The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product connects the 6H singlet (likely methyl groups) and the 2H singlet (likely a CH2 group near an oxygen atom). This spatial proximity is consistent with the endo product, where substituents are positioned on the same face of the bicyclic structure.

**Answer: B**
