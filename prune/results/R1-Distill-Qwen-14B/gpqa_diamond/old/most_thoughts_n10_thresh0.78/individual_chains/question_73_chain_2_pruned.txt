Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I'm supposed to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think this through.

Alright, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. So, astronaut A is 2m at 0.6c, astronaut B is 3m at 0.5c. 

First, I need to find their relative speed. I remember that in relativity, speeds don't just add up normally. The formula for adding velocities is different. Oh right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). Wait, but which one is moving faster? A is at 0.6c, B is at 0.5c, so from A's perspective, B is moving at 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? No, wait, that can't be right because in relativity, it's not that simple. I have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, so the formula for the relative speed u' is (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)). So which is the frame of reference here? If we're looking for the speed of one astronaut relative to the other, say, the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So u is B's speed in the lab frame, v is A's speed in the lab frame.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. When you're in A's frame, you're moving at velocity v (A's speed). So to find the velocity of B in A's frame, we use u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

So here, u is B's speed in the lab frame, which is 0.5c, and v is A's speed
