Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the Lorentz factor required for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup is that particles are being collided in the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, and they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor around 20. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Right now, on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. But the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that two-thirds reach the walls instead.

Wait, so why does the Lorentz factor affect how many particles reach the walls? Oh, right, because particles moving at relativistic speeds experience time dilation. From the lab frame (the detector's frame), the particles are moving fast, so their lifetime is shorter. If the particles decay quickly, they might not reach the detector walls. But wait, particles with higher Lorentz factors have longer lifetimes from the lab frame, right? Because gamma is the Lorentz factor, and the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by gamma gives the lifetime observed in the lab frame. So longer gamma means longer lifetime in the lab frame, so the particles can travel a longer distance before decaying.

Wait, so the number of particles reaching the walls depends on their lifetime. If the lifetime is longer, more of them can reach the walls. So the original setup has a gamma of about 20, and only one third reach the walls. We need to find a higher gamma such that two-thirds can reach. Because with a higher gamma, the particles live longer, so more can make it to the walls.

But wait, how does the probability of reaching the detector relate to gamma? I think it's based on the particles' lifetime compared to the time it takes for them to reach the detector walls.

So let's model this. The particles are produced at the center of the detector. The distance to the walls is 30 meters. The time it takes for a particle moving at speed v to reach the wall is t = 30 / v. But since v is very close to c, perhaps we can approximate v â‰ˆ c.

Wait, but since they're ultra-relativistic, the speed is very close
