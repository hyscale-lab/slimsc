Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Hmm, the problem is about space travel and time dilation, right? So there's this civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're sending a spacecraft at a speed super close to the speed of light—0.99999987c. That's really fast! The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. Wait, but the options are in years, so it's about calculating the time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait, the question says, "how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth." Oh, right, so we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut because they're traveling at such a high speed. That's the key here, because of time dilation effects in special relativity.

First, I should figure out the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh wait, I remember that the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

Wait, but wait, the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. So from Earth's frame of reference, how long would the trip take? Time is distance divided by speed. So time t = distance/speed.

Calculating that: 163,000 light-years divided by 0.99999987c. Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, the time in Earth's frame would be 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1/(1 - 0.00000013)). Wait, maybe I can approximate that. Because 0.99999987 is very close to c, so 1/0.99999987 is approximately 1.00000013. So 163,000 * 1.00000013 is roughly 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013) = 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.0212 years. But wait, that's from Earth's frame. But the astronaut's time would be different due to time dilation.

Wait, no, the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) would be shorter due to time dilation. Because in their frame, the distance is contracted. So in their frame, the distance is length-contracted. So the proper time τ is equal to the Earth time multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Or wait, the other way around. Let me think.

No, actually, the proper time τ is the time experienced by the traveler. So from Earth's frame, the time is t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years approximately (since v is so close to c, the time is almost the same as the distance in light-years). Wait, no, 163,000 divided by almost 1 is about 163,000 years, but the astronaut's experienced time would be less because of time dilation.

Wait, let me get the formula straight. The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which is the Earth time multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma's inverse. Because the Earth frame's time is dilated relative to the astronaut's frame.

Wait, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the proper time τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So from Earth's perspective, the time is t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000.021 years. But for the astronaut, the time is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So v is 0.99999987c. Let's compute v²/c²: (0.99999987)^2 = approx? Let me calculate that. 0.99999987^2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ which is approximately 0.99999974, but maybe we can just compute it as (0.99999987)^2 = 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 0.00051. Because sqrt(2.6e-7) is about sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Well, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so 1.612e-3.5 is 1.612 * 1e-3.5 ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ wait, no, wait. Wait 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001, 1e-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 1.612 *3.16e-4 is approximately 5.08e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7)= ~0.00051.

So τ = t * 0.00051.

But t is about 163,000 years. So τ ≈ 163,000 * 0.00051 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.00001 is 1.63. So 0.00051 is 0.0005 + 0.00001, so 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13 years.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the astronaut is 22 years old. So 83 years later, he would be 105. But the average lifetime of these aliens is 150 years. So 105 is less than 150, so he would live long enough to reach Earth. So the time experienced is about 83 years.

Looking at the options: Option D is 77 years, C is 81, D is 77. Hmm, wait, I got 83, but perhaps my approximation was off.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise in calculating t. Let me recalculate t.

t = distance / speed. Distance is 163,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So t = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 * (1/0.99999987) = 163000 * approx 1.00000013.

So 163000 * 1.00000013 = 163000 + 163000 * 0.00000013. 163000 * 0.00000013 is 0.02119 years. 0.02119 years is about 0.02119 *365 days ≈ 7.72 days. So t ≈ 163000 years + 7.72 days. But for the purpose of time dilation, maybe the exact t isn't that critical because the sqrt part will have a big impact.

Wait, let's recalculate the gamma factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.784. So tau = t / gamma.

Wait, wait a second. So tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

Because gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So t is about 163000 years as per Earth's frame. So tau = t * 0.00051 ≈ 163000 * 0.00051 = 163000 * 0.0005 is 81.5, 163000 *0.00001 is 1.63, so 81.5 + 1.63 = 83.13.

So about 83 years. But the options are 72, 77, 81, etc. So none of the options are exactly 83. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the actual distance is different. I thought the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away. Let me check that. Oh, wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is actually about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years from Earth. So perhaps 163,000 is a good approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact gamma factor.

v = 0.99999987c.

So v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = let's compute more accurately.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute that:

(1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-13 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me calculate that accurately.

The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6)*sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is (1e-3.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-7)=1e-3.5≈3.1623e-4.

So sqrt(2.6e-7)=sqrt(2.6)*3.1623e-4 ≈ 1.612 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.09e-4.

So sqrt(0.00000026)= approx 0.000509.

So tau = t * 0.000509.

But t is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 +0.00000013) [using 1/(1-x) ≈ 1+x for small x]. So t ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 0.00000013 = 163,000 + 0.02119 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

So tau ≈ 163000 * 0.000509 ≈ Let me compute that:

163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.000009 = 1.467.

So 0.000509 is 0.0005 + 0.000009.

So 81.5 + 1.467 = 82.967 years.

So about 83 years. Hmm. But the options don't have 83. The closest is option C)81, D)77. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v² or elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation of 0.99999987 squared.

Alternatively, perhaps I should get v in terms of fractions.

Wait, 0.99999987 is equal to 1 - 1.3e-7.

So (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 0.99999974.

So same as before.

Wait, perhaps I should compute tau another way. The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which can be calculated via the Lorentz transformation. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for time dilation considering the distance and speed.

Wait, another approach: The distance from Earth to LMC is L = 163,000 ly. So from Earth's frame, the time is t = L/(v) = 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163000 years (plus a negligible fraction, since 0.99999987 is almost 1).

In the astronaut's frame, the distance is length-contracted. So the contracted length is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163000 * 0.000509 ≈ 82.967 ly.

So the time experienced is t' = L' / v = 82.967 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 82.967 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.967 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83 years.

So same result as before.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the actual distance. Wait, I think the average distance to the LMC is about 160,000 to 200,000 ly. So maybe I should use a more precise value. Let's say 160,000 ly.

Wait, then t = 160000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160000 * 1.00000013 = 160000 + 0.208 ≈ 160000.208 years.

Tau = t * 0.000509 ≈ 160000 * 0.000509 = 81.44 years.

Hmm, that's about 81.44, which is about 81 years. Oh, so if the distance is 160,000 ly, then the answer would be approximately 81 years, which is option C.

But in the question, the distance is given as the LMC, which is about 163,000 ly. So why the discrepancy?

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is not exactly 0.99999987c, but I think that's a given. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approximation. Let's compute sqrt(1 - v²/c²) more accurately.

Let me compute v²/c² again: v = 0.99999987c. So v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = (0.99999974)c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute that precisely.

Using a calculator, sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(26e-8) = sqrt(26)*1e-4 = 5.0990195135927845e-4 ≈ 0.0005099.

So, more accurately, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 0.0005099.

So, tau = t * 0.0005099.

If t is 163000, then 163000 * 0.0005099 = ?

Compute 163000 * 0.0005 = 81.5.

163000 * 0.0000099 = 163000 * 9.9e-6.

Compute 163000 * 9.9e-6 = (163,000 * 9.9) * 1e-6.

163,000 * 9.9 = 1,613,700.

Multiply by 1e-6: 1.6137.

So 81.5 + 1.6137 = 83.1137 years.

Hmm, but if the distance is 160,000 ly, tau is 81.44 years. So the exact answer depends on the actual distance.

But the problem states that the destination is Earth, which is about 160,000 ly away. Wait, wait, no, Earth is in our Solar System. Wait, wait a minute! I think I made a mistake here.

Wait a second, the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from the Milky Way. But Earth is in the Milky Way, which is much closer. So, the distance from the LMC to Earth would actually be about 160,000 ly. Because the Milky Way is about 100,000 light-years in diameter, and the LMC is outside, so the distance from Earth to LMC is roughly 160,000 ly.

So using 160,000 ly as the distance, the proper time tau is about 81.44 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years, which would be the closest.

But wait, the problem says "the average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years." So the astronaut is 22 years old. If the journey takes 81 years, he would be 103 when he arrives, which is still within the 150-year lifespan, so he would live to reach Earth.

But the options also include option D)77 years. So perhaps our initial approximation is a bit off.

Wait, let me try another approach. Perhaps using the formula for time dilation: tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But another approach is to calculate the gamma factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

v = 0.99999987c.

So v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = approx 0.99999974c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

Gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.8.

So, the time experienced by the astronaut, tau = t / gamma.

t is the time from Earth's frame: t = 160,000 ly / (0.99999987c) = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 160,000 years plus a tiny fraction, but for approximation, 160,000 years.

So tau = 160,000 / 1960.8 ≈ approx 81.44 years.

So the astronaut would be about 22 + 81.44 = 103.44 years old when he arrives.

But the options don't have 81.44; the closest is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate this more precisely.

Let me compute t more accurately.

t = distance / v.

Distance is 160,000 ly.

v = 0.99999987c.

So t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 = 160,000 * (1 / 0.99999987).

Calculating 1 / 0.99999987:

We can write it as (1 + 0.00000013) approximately, using the approximation 1/(1-x) ≈ 1+x for small x. So 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1.00000013.

So t ≈ 160,000 * 1.00000013 = 160,000 + (160,000 * 0.00000013) = 160,000 + (0.0208) ≈ 160,000.0208 years.

So, t = 160,000.0208 years.

Tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 160,000.0208 * 0.0005099 ≈ let's compute that.

Breaking it down:

160,000 * 0.0005099 = 81.584.

0.0208 * 0.0005099 ≈ 0.0000106.

So tau ≈ 81.584 + 0.0000106 ≈ 81.584 years.

So approximately 81.58 years. So about 82 years. But the options don't have 82. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c. Maybe I can use the approximation for time dilation when v is very close to c. There's another formula for time experienced due to high speeds.

Wait, another approach: The time experienced is tau = (distance in Earth frame) / (gamma * v).

Wait, no, I think that's more complicated. Maybe another way is to calculate using the Lorentz factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would make this more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the approximation that at v ≈ c, the time experienced is roughly distance (in light-years) divided by gamma.

So gamma for v=0.99999987c is about 1960.

So with distance 160,000 ly, the time in Earth's frame is t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years.

Then tau = t / gamma = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.63 years.

So that's about 82 years. But the options given don't have 82. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) Astronaut dies before reaching Earth.

B)72

C)81

D)77.

So option C is 81 years. So the closest is C.

But in our calculation, it's around 81.5, so about 82 years. So since 81 is an option, perhaps the answer is C.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the spaceship is going from the LMC to Earth, so the distance is about 160,000 ly, and the speed is 0.99999987c.

Wait, but the problem says the spacecraft is traveling at a constant speed. So the time experienced is the proper time, which is t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So with t=160,000 / 0.99999987≈160,000 years, tau=160,000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Which is 160,000 * sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 160,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 81.584.

So 81.58 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 81.5 years, which is approximately 82, but the options have 81 as option C. So perhaps the correct answer is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would give 81.5, but the options round it to 81.

But then, why is option D 77? Maybe I made a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the actual value of v as 0.99999987c, which is 1 - 1.3e-7. So the exact gamma would be 1/sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = 1/(sqrt(2.6e-7)).

Which as calculated earlier is about 1960.8.

So, tau = t / gamma = (160,000 / 0.99999987) / 1960.8 ≈ (160,000 * 1.00000013) / 1960.8 ≈ (160,000 + 0.0208) / 1960.8 ≈ 160,000 /1960.8 ≈ 81.63.

So 81.63 years.

But the options have 81, which is close.

So the answer would be approximately 81 years, which is option C.

Alternatively, maybe the distance is 190,000 ly, which would make tau = 190000 *0.0005099≈96.88. But that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options again.

If the correct answer is 81, which is option C, but option D is 77, perhaps the question considers the distance as 163,000 ly and a more precise calculation brings the time down a bit.

Wait, let me compute with 163,000 ly.

So t = 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000 *1.00000013 ≈163,000 + (163,000 *0.00000013)=163,000 + 0.02119=163,000.0212.

So tau = t * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = 163000.0212 * 0.0005099 ≈ 163000 *0.0005099= 82.967, plus 0.0212 *0.0005099≈0.0000108, so total 82.967 + 0.0000108≈82.967 years.

So 83 years. Not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the average lifetime is 150 years, so the astronaut is 22, and the trip would take 83 years, making him 105, which is within 150. So option A is not correct.

So the possible options are C and D. But the calculation leads to about 83, which is not in the options. So perhaps the intended answer is 81, assuming the distance is about 160,000 ly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question wants us to use a different approach, like considering that the speed is so close to c that the time is roughly distance (in ly) multiplied by (1 - 0.5(v/c)^2) or something? Wait, no, that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximation formula for time dilation when v is close to c. The approximation is tau ≈ t (1 - v²/(2c²)).

Wait, the exact expression is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For v close to c, we can approximate sqrt(1 -v²/c²) as 1/sqrt(2*(c^2 -v^2)/c^2)} or maybe using a binomial expansion.

Wait, sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (1 - v²/(2c²)) / (1 + ... ), but perhaps for very high speeds, we can approximate it as 1/(v²/(2c²))^{-1/2} or something else. Alternatively, perhaps using a Taylor expansion.

Wait, let me consider 1 - v^2/c^2 = 2.6e-7.

So, sqrt(2.6e-7) = 0.0005099, as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be approximated as tau = (distance in light years) * (1 - v²/(2c²)) / v.

Wait, that might complicate. Or perhaps, using the formula tau = (distance in ly) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Because in that case, for v=0.99999987c, sqrt(1 - v²/c²)=0.0005099.

So, tau = (160,000 ly) * (0.0005099) / (0.99999987c) * (c in ly/year).

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time, which can be found using the formula:

tau = (distance) / (gamma * v).

But distance is 160,000 ly, v=0.99999987c.

gamma is 1960.8.

So tau = 160000 ly / (0.99999987c * gamma).

Wait, but (gamma * v) = (1960.8) * 0.99999987 ≈ 1960.8 *1 = 1960.8.

So, tau = 160000 / (1960.8 * (ly/yr)) * (1 ly per year).

Wait, no, units are getting messy. Let me think in terms of years.

Since v=0.99999987c, and light travels 1 ly in 1 year.

So, the time in Earth's frame is t=160000 /0.99999987 ≈160,000 years.

Proper time tau = t * sqrt(1 -v²/c²) = 160000 * 0.0005099 ≈81.58 years.

So, the astronaut would be about 22 + 81.58 = 103.58 years old, which is within the 150-year lifespan. So, he would survive.

Thus, the correct answer should be approximately 81.58 years, which is closest to option C)81 years.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from the perspective of the astronaut, we need to account for time dilation due to the spacecraft's velocity, which is $v = 0.99999987c$. The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is approximately 160,000 light-years. The proper time $\tau$ experienced by the astronaut is calculated using the relativistic time dilation formula:

\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where $t$ is the time in Earth's frame, given by:

\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}.
\]

### Step 1: Calculate $t$ in Earth's frame
Since $v$ is extremely close to $c$, we approximate:

\[
t \approx 160,000 \cdot \frac{1}{0.99999987} \approx 160,000 \cdot 1.00000013 \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate $\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}$
\[
v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad \text{so } 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.00000026.
\]

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate $\tau$
\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx 160,000 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 81.58 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the result
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. After traveling, the astronaut's age would be approximately $22 + 81.58 = 103.58$ years, which is within the average lifespan of 150 years for these aliens. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the trip.

### Step 5: Compare with the options
The calculated proper time is approximately $81.58$ years, which is closest to option **C) 81 years**. Other options are either too low (e.g., 77 years) or inconsistent with the calculations.

### Final Answer
The time experienced by the astronaut is approximately **81 years**.
