Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the target molecule. Let me visualize it. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. Wait, wait. Wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me think: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3? Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering depends on the substituents.

Wait, the compound is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: at position 1 (ethoxy), position 2 (tert-butyl), and position 3 (nitro). So, the substituents are in a meta arrangement relative to each other? Or maybe ortho and meta. Wait, let's think about how that would look. For example, if ethoxy is at position 1, nitro at 3, and tert-butyl at 2. So, the positions are adjacent, perhaps?

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3, then it's like positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, and 2 and 3 are adjacent. But that would make the substituents in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's possible with the reaction conditions given.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me re-express the target structure. The IUPAC name is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenz
