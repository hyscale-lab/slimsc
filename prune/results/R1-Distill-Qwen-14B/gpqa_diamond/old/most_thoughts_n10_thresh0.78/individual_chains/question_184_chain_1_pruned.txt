Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which reaction sequence will give me the desired product. Let me take it step by step.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, let me draw that out in my mind. Benzene ring with substituents: at position 1 is ethoxy (OEt), position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro (NO2). Wait, numbering might be tricky. Oh, wait, in benzene rings, the numbering starts such that substituents get the lowest possible numbers. But for this problem, perhaps the exact order isn't critical as long as the substituents are in the correct relative positions.

Wait, the substituents are 1-ethoxy, 2-tert-butyl, and 3-nitro. So, the positions are ortho, meta, para to each other? Let me think. Wait, position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, relative to each other: nitro is at position 3, which is meta to ethoxy and para to tert-butyl? Wait, maybe I should think about their positions around the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering is as follows: the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at position 3 (meta to ethoxy, ortho to tert-butyl). So, the substituents are all in adjacent positions? Or maybe I should think about directing effects.

The starting material is benzene. The question is asking which sequence of reactions will give the desired product with a high yield. So, the options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions.

I need to plan the synthesis steps. Let's think about what each reaction does.

The target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro.

Ethoxy (OEt) is an activating group, ortho/para-directing. Nitro is a deactivating, meta-directing group. tert-Butyl is a bulky activating group (since it's an alkyl group) and is ortho/para-directing.

The challenge is to get all three substituents in the correct positions with the right directing effects.

Let me think about the order of nitration and alkylation. Nitro groups are meta directors, so if we nitrate early on, it will affect the positions of subsequent groups.

Alternatively, if we introduce the ethoxy and tert-butyl first, which are activating, they will direct incoming groups.

But wait, the target has ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, nitro at position 3. Hmm, perhaps that arrangement is possible through a series of directed substitutions.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ethoxy and tert-butyl groups. Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, and it might not be easy to add it
