Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a conducting sphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are A to D, each with different formulas.

Wait, I remember that when dealing with potential energy in such setups, it's often about the work done to bring charges together. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that might change things.

So, the conducting sphere being grounded means it's connected to the earth, which is at zero potential. When a charge q is placed near it, charges will redistribute. But since the sphere is a conductor, the charges will reside on its surface. Oh wait, but if it's grounded, any induced charges might flow to the ground. Hmm, that's a key point.

Wait, no. When a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges will redistribute due to induction. But if the sphere is grounded, the excess charge will leave the sphere, right? Or wait, no. If I have a positive charge q near a neutral conducting sphere, the sphere's electrons will be attracted to the near side, and the positive charge will be on the far side. But since the sphere is grounded, the electrons can leave through the ground, leaving the sphere with a positive charge, or no? Or maybe the sphere remains neutral, but the charges are redistributed. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let me think. A conducting sphere in electrostatic equilibrium has charges on its surface. When another charge is placed near it, the charges on the sphere rearrange themselves. But if the sphere is grounded, any induced charge can flow to the ground. So, the sphere might end up with no net charge because the induced positive and negative charges can leave via the ground. Wait, no, because if the external charge is positive, the sphere's electrons (negative) are attracted to the near side, making that side negative. The positive charges on the far side would make that side positive. But since the sphere is grounded, those positive charges can leave, so the sphere ends up with an induced negative charge?

Wait, no. Or maybe the sphere remains neutral. Because the induced charges are positive and negative. But since it's grounded
