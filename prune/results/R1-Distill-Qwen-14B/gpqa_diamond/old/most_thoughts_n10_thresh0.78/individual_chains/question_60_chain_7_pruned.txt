Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, it's about space travel and time dilation, right? So, the question involves an astronaut traveling at a very high speed, close to the speed of light, and we need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut. Wait, the options are about whether they live long enough or the time they experience.

So, the setup: the aliens are from the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they're heading to Earth. The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we're to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective.

Wait, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to light speed, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. There are two frames of reference here: the Earth's frame and the astronaut's frame.

In the Earth's frame, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud is a certain amount. Oh wait, wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy near the Milky Way. How far is it? I think it's about 160,000 light-years away. So, if the spaceship is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time taken from Earth's perspective would be distance divided by speed. Let me calculate that.

Distance: 160,000 light-years. Speed: 0.99999987c. So time on Earth would be 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years. Wait, that's a long time. But from the astronaut's perspective, due to time dilation, their experienced time is less.

Time dilation formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh wait, no, wait.
