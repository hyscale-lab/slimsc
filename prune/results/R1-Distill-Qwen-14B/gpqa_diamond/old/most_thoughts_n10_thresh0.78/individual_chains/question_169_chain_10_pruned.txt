Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about nuclear decay. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So the question is about comparing two different decay processes and how the energy spectrum of one of the emitted particles changes.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two particles of flavor A decay into two B's, and emit two E and two V particles. It's given that the E's have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of emitting two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M. I need to figure out how this change affects the energy spectrum of the E particles.

Wait, okay, I remember that in radioactive decay, the energy distribution of emitted particles often depends on whether the decay products are massive and what their possible energies are. The initial decay has two V particles. I wonder what they are—maybe like electrons or positrons? Or perhaps they're something else, but whatever they are, they have mass because the E's are lighter but also maybe have mass.

In the first case, the E particles have a continuous spectrum up to a maximum energy Q. That makes me think that the decay is not a pure beta decay, but maybe something else because in beta decay, the emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum with a maximum, but that's because the neutrino carries away some energy. Oh wait, but in this problem, E could be like electrons and V could be neutrinos? But wait, neutrinos are super light, but in the problem, V is light but maybe not massless. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says E and V are much lighter than the nucleons. So maybe E and V are like electrons and neutrinos or something similar. But in any case, they have mass, but are lighter than the nucleons.

So in the original decay, 2E and 2V are emitted. The E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So each E can take some energy up to Q, and the rest goes to the V's.

Wait, but why is the E spectrum continuous? Because when particles are emitted with varying energies, depending on how the energy is shared between them. In the two-body decay, like if you
