Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and E is defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²). Hmm, I remember that formula from my notes—each particle's energy levels in a 1D box are quantized and given by E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base unit.

Wait, but wait—since the particles are identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers. But wait, in a 1D box, the particles can only have different n values if they have different spins? Or does spin come into play here? Because for identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But in a 1D box, each particle's state is determined by n and spin.

Wait, let me think. In a 1D infinite potential well, each particle's state is characterized by its principal quantum number n and its spin. For spin-1/2 particles, each can have two possible spin states: spin-up or spin-down. So for each n, there are two possible states. So when we're placing multiple fermions into the well, each fermion must occupy a unique combination of n and spin. So the first two particles can be in n=1, one spin-up and one spin-down. The next two must go into higher n if n=1 is filled.

Wait, but the order in which we fill the states depends on the energy. The energy for each state is E_n = n² E. So the ground state would have the lowest possible energies, then first excited, etc.

So for four particles, let's think about how they fill the states. Each level n can hold two particles (spin-up and spin-down), so:

n=1: can hold 2 particles
n=2: can hold 2 particles
n=3: can hold 2 particles
and so on.

So for four particles, they would fill the lowest n levels. Let's see: 2 particles in n=1, and 2 in n=2.

Wait, but wait. No, wait
