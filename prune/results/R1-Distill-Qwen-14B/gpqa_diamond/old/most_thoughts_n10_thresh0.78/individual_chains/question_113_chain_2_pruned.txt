Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says. I need to identify the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its characterization data from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. 

First, I'll go through each technique one by one and see what information they give.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak here suggests the compound might have an alcohol group (like -OH) or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, often around 3000 cm-1. Alternatively, if it's an alcohol, the peak is usually a bit broader and can appear in that region too, but maybe not as strong as a carboxylic acid. Then there are peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which makes me think of a carbonyl group. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring (like conjugated carbonyl or maybe an amide, but I don't think that's the case here). Alternatively, maybe it's an unsaturated carbonyl, like a conjugated ketone or an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. 

Wait, another thought: 1700 cm-1 is typical for carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or carboxylic acids. The 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe a ketone
