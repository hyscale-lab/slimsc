Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, so I remember that when a metal ion forms a complex with a ligand, the concentration of the free metal ion can be found using the formation constant. The formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the reaction where the metal and ligand combine to form the complex.

The general reaction for the formation of a metal-ligand complex is something like: M + nL ↔ ML^n−, and the formation constant Kf is [ML]/([M][L]^n). But wait, in this case, the complex is Ca-EDTA. So, the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4− ↔ CaEDTA^2−.

Since EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, I think the reaction is 1:1. So the formation constant equation would be Kf = [CaEDTA^2−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]).

But wait, the problem says the solution has 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, all the calcium is in the complex form. But some of it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4− ions.

Wait, no. Wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentrations are: [CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA^4−] are zero, but that can't be right because the complex can't form with zero concentrations. So, some of the complex must dissociate.

Wait, but the problem says it
