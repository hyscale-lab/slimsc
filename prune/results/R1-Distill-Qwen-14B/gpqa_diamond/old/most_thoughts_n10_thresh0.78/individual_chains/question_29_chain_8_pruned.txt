Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar. Let's see, the gene has five exons and four introns. The problem says that the compound is made by this gene, so we need a mutation that disrupts its synthesis. That probably means we need to find a mutation that alters the gene's function, maybe by causing a premature stop codon or changing the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, all the mutations are in the first exon. The intact gene and the mutants are shown. Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene to see what's changed.

First, let's write down the intact gene's first part for clarity:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Now, let's look at each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, the first part is ATGTTTCT in the intact, and Mutant 1 has ATGTTCTA. So the fourth nucleotide in the sequence changes. Let's see. Intact is TTTCT, mutant is TTCTA. Wait, that's a substitution of the fourth T to C? Wait, let me count the letters.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me look for where the changes are.

In the intact gene, the first exon starts with ATGTTTCT... In Mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTA. So perhaps the third T becomes a C. Hmm. Let's see: the intact is positions 1-10: ATGTTTCTCG.

Mutant 1: positions 1-10: ATGTTCTACG.

Wait, so the fourth nucleotide is a T in intact, but in Mutant 1, it's a C. So the change is at the fourth position. So the nucleotide is changed from T to C. Let's see what amino acids that would affect.

The coding sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. The next codons would be TTT, which is phenylalanine. Then CTC, which is leucine. So in the intact gene, the sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

In Mutant 1, the change occurs at the fourth position. Let me see: the third codon is CTC in the intact. Wait, no, let's line them up.

Wait, let me write the intact and mutants in terms of codons.

Intact gene: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA C...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TT...

Wait, no,
