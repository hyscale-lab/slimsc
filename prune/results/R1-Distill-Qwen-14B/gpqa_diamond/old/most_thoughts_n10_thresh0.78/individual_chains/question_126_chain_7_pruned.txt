Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Each reaction uses a different starting material and a different reagent. After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

First, let me look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reagent is LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride), followed by an acidic workup. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent. It is typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone group at the third carbon. When reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. But wait, wait, the molecule is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy part. Hmm, wait, noâ€”the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is like:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, let me draw that properly. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but here, the 5th carbon (counting from the ketone) has a methoxy group. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the position. Hexan-3-one is CH3CH2CO... Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe numbering from the other end? Let me think. The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3 attached? No, wait. Wait, hexan
