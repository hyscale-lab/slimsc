Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and think it through step by step. 

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the given options.

First, let's break down the information given. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, so it's a six-membered aromatic ring with two substituents. The molecular formula isn't given directly, but the total number of carbons is 8. Wait, the benzene ring itself has 6 carbons, so the two substituents add 2 carbons in total. Hmm, that might help in figuring out the structure.

The substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and an aromatic-halogen bond, which means one of the substituents is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). But wait, the substituents are each on the ring, right? So the ring has two substituents: one is a halogen (since aromatic-halogen bond is present), and the other must be a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, but wait—halogens can be part of substituents. So the substituents could be, for example, a halide (like Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as an ester, ketone, or maybe even an aldehyde. Alternatively, the substituent could be something else with a carbonyl group, like an acetyl group.

But considering the total carbons: 6 in the ring, so substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a single carbon, perhaps, or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? Wait, no. Because if the substituents are on the ring, each substituent is attached to the ring. So for example, if one substituent is a chlorine (which is one atom, zero carbons), then the other substituent must have two carbons. So the substituent with two carbons must be something like a carbonyl group attached with two carbons. 

Wait, but a substituent could be a ketone group (like a methyl ketone). For example, if the substituent is -COCH3, that's two carbons attached to the ring (the carbonyl carbon and the methyl group). But wait, that's three carbons: the ring has six, substituent is -COCH3 (2 carbons), and the other substituent is a chlorine. Wait, but the total carbons would be 6 + 2 + 1 (Cl isn't a carbon). Wait, no, the substituents are two groups on the ring. Each substituent contributes their own carbons. So substituent 1 is Cl (no carbons), substituent 2 is something with two carbons. So substituent 2 must have two carbons attached to the ring. For example, maybe an acetyl group (COCH3), which has two carbons (the CO- and the CH3). So the substituent would be -O-CO-CH3? No, wait, that's an ester group, but that would have more carbons. Hmm, maybe a ketone group like -COCH3.

So, let me think about the structure. The ring is di-substituted with Cl and COCH3 groups. So the structure would be something like 1-chloro-3-acetylbenzene, for example. But wait, how many carbons in total? The ring is 6, Cl is one substituent, COCH3 is another. COCH3 is two carbons (the C in CO and the CH3), so total carbons would be 6 + 1 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) → but wait, Cl isn't a carbon. Oh wait, the substituents contribute their own carbons. So the substituents are Cl (no carbons) and (COCH3) which has two carbons. So total carbons: 6 (ring) + 2 = 8. Yes, that matches the given 8 carbons in the compound. So that works.

Now, let's think about the IR. The IR has peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic halogen bond. So the substituent must have a carbonyl, which aligns with the substituent being an acetyl or another carbonyl group.

Now, the NMR. Let me think about the structure of the molecule. The substituents are Cl and COCH3 on the benzene ring. Let's assume they are in the para positions for maximum symmetry, which affects the NMR. Alternatively, they could be in the ortho or meta positions.

Wait, wait—if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring will have certain symmetry, which affects the NMR signals. So the aromatic protons would be in specific patterns.

But maybe the substituents are in a different arrangement. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a Cl and the other is a carbonyl group attached in such a way that the ring has certain symmetry.

Wait, but the substituents are in a di-substituted ring. Let's consider the possible structures:

If the substituents are para, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. For example, substituents at positions 1 and 3 would be meta, and substituents at positions 1 and 2 would be ortho.

But for a di-substituted benzene, the substituents can be either ortho, meta, or para. Each arrangement leads to different NMR signals.

But the substituents in this case are Cl and COCH3. So the ring has two groups: a strong deactivating group (Cl, being an EWG) and a strong deactivating, meta-directing group (COCH3, which is a ketone group, also EWG).

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are already attached, so their directing effects are done. Now, the positions of the substituents would affect the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester group, but I think the carbonyl is in a ketone group.

Wait, to get the NMR data, perhaps each substituent's neighboring protons will show up as doublets or singlets.

Alternatively, let's think about the substituents. If the substituents are in the para positions, then the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. The aromatic protons would be in two sets, perhaps. Alternatively, if they are in the meta, the pattern could be different.

But perhaps the substituents are in the para positions, leading to two sets of aromatic protons, each as doublets.

Wait, but let me think about the actual structure. Let's say the ring has a Cl at position 1 and a COCH3 at position 3 (which would be meta to each other). Then, the adjacent protons would be in certain positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to a para arrangement. Let's say Cl is at position 1 and COCH3 is at position 4 (para). Then, the ring would have symmetry, leading to equivalent protons in certain positions.

Wait, but in para substitution, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. The substituents are Cl and COCH3, which are different, so the ring would not be symmetric. Therefore, the aromatic protons would split into more signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons are split into two doublets. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 2 (ortho), then perhaps each substituent affects the neighboring protons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the NMR signals for each substituent.

The COCH3 group is an acetyl group attached to the ring. The methyl group (CH3) attached to the carbonyl would be deshielded and appear as a singlet in the NMR, around 2.1-2.3 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but looking at the options, option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is 3H. So that could correspond to a methyl group attached to a carbonyl.

So, the CH3 from COCH3 would be a singlet. Let me check the options.

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). Hmm, 3.7 is likely an OCH2 group, but not a CH3CO group.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s). Those look like maybe a vinyl group or something with adjacent CH2 groups, but not a COCH3.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). So the 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H likely is CH3 attached to a carbonyl. The aromatic region has two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That suggests perhaps a para-substituted ring, but with two substituents. So for a para-substituted ring (but with two different substituents), the aromatic protons would be split into two sets, each a doublet. So for example, if the substituents are in para positions, but are different, the adjacent protons (ortho and meta) would each have different chemical shifts, leading to two doublets.

Wait, but in para substitution, each substituent is opposite, but if the substituents are different, the ring's symmetry is broken. So the two substituents (Cl and COCH3) would cause their own adjacent protons to have different shifts. Let me think about the structure. Suppose the ring has Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4 (para). Then, the aromatic protons at positions 2 and 6 would be adjacent to Cl, and positions 3 and 5 adjacent to COCH3.

But wait, the substituents are at 1 and 3 positions (meta), perhaps? Or another arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in such positions that the ring has symmetry. Wait, but Cl and COCH3 are different, so symmetry is unlikely. So, the aromatic protons would show up in multiple signals.

But the NMR in option C has two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests four aromatic protons, which is possible only if the substituents are in such a way that two sets of two equivalent protons each are present.

Wait, if the substituents are in the para positions, the ring would have two substituents opposite each other. Then, the ring would have four equivalent protons if the substituents are the same. But since substituents are different (Cl and COCH3), the ring would have two pairs of equivalent protons, each pair giving a doublet.

Wait, no. For example, if the substituents are at positions 1 (Cl) and 3 (COCH3) (meta), then the ring would have substituents at 1 and 3, which are meta. Then, the ring would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. Let me visualize:

Positions 1: Cl
Position 3: COCH3

Then, positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to Cl. Positions 4 and 5 are adjacent to COCH3.

So, the protons at 2 and 6 would be in one environment, and protons at 4 and 5 in another. So each of these would be a pair of equivalent protons, leading to two doublets in the NMR, each integrating for 2H.

That would match option C's aromatic region: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). Additionally, the 2.3 ppm singlet (3H) is the CH3 from COCH3.

So, that makes sense. Let me think about the other options.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 singlet suggests an aromatic proton with no adjacent protons. But in a di-substituted benzene, unless the substituents are in a way that one position is substituted, but others have only one adjacent substituent. Or perhaps the structure is something else, like a substituted phenyl group attached to another group. I'm not sure, but the presence of two doublets in D is 4.8 and 4.6, which might suggest something like a di-substituted CH2 group, maybe an ethylene glycol type structure. But I'm not sure how that would fit into the current scenario.

Option B has a 3H singlet at 1.3, which is perhaps a methyl group attached to something else, but looking at the shifts, the 4.8 and 4.6 ppm doublets might correspond to -OCH2CH2O- or something else, but not directly linked to a carbonyl group.

Option A: The singlet at 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. But the presence of a carbonyl group could be a ketone, not an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be a strong deshielded proton, like an aromatic proton with strong de-shielding. Wait, but 9.9 is high for an aromatic ring. It's more typical for aldehydic protons. So perhaps that's an aldehyde group.

But wait, the compound has a carbonyl group. If it were an aldehyde, the structure would be PhCHO, but that's only one substituent. But the compound is di-substituted. So perhaps the other substituent is a halogen. But then, the aldehyde would be another substituent. But wait, the total carbons are 8. Let me check: benzene ring (6 C) + aldehyde (CHO is one C) + halogen (Cl is no C) ==> 6 +1 +0 =7. No, the molecule has 8 C, so that can't be. So option A probably isn't correct.

So, going back to option C: aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H, and a singlet at 2.3 ppm for 3H. That fits the structure where the substituents are Cl and COCH3 in such positions that the aromatic protons split into two doublets.

But wait, another point to consider: the integration in option C is 7.8 (2H, d)—so two protons as doublet, and 7.6 (2H, d)—another two protons as doublet.

In a di-substituted benzene ring, if the substituents are para to each other, but different (Cl and COCH3), the ring would have two sets of two equivalent protons each, leading to two doublets in the NMR. So that's consistent with option C.

So, putting it all together:

IR shows C=O (carbonyl) and aromatic Cl.

Structure is a benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 groups, likely in the para positions but different substituents leading to two sets of doublets in the aromatic region.

The NMR in option C has 7.8 and 7.6 ppm doublets, each integrating to 2H, and a 2.3 ppm singlet for 3H (the methyl group attached to the carbonyl).

Thus, option C is the correct NMR data.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents on the benzene ring are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH3). The total carbons in the molecule are 8, which matches the benzene ring (6 carbons) plus the substituents (2 carbons from COCH3).

The NMR data must reflect the structure of the molecule. The aromatic region of the spectrum will show signals corresponding to the protons on the benzene ring, which are influenced by the substituents. The substituents (Cl and COCH3) are likely in the para positions, breaking the symmetry of the ring and splitting the aromatic protons into two sets of equivalent protons. This results in two doublets in the aromatic region, each integrating to 2H. Additionally, the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (CH3 in COCH3) will appear as a singlet in the aliphatic region, typically around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the structure. The total carbons would not match if the substituents include an aldehyde.
- **Option B**: The signals at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a structure with adjacent CH2 groups, which does not align with the expected substituents (Cl and COCH3).
- **Option C**: The aromatic region shows two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm, each integrating to 2H), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring with two different substituents. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group in COCH3, making this option consistent with the structure.
- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which is unlikely in a di-substituted benzene ring. The other signals do not align with the expected substituents.

The correct NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected signals for a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 as substituents.

Answer: C
