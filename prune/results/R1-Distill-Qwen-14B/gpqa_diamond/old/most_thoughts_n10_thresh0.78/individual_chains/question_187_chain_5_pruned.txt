Okay, so I have this question about whether certain stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The key here is determining the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel after a 1-hour exposure. The requirement is S/N of at least 10.

First, I think I need to understand what factors affect the S/N ratio. I remember that S/N is influenced by the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency. Also, the distance of the star matters because farther stars are fainter.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, so it's probably optimized for bright stars. Wait, but I'm not exactly sure about its specs. From what I recall, ESPRESSO can achieve a high S/N for bright stars, but for fainter ones, maybe not so much.

The formula for S/N ratio in astronomical imaging is roughly S/N = (star flux) / (noise), where noise is usually the photon noise plus background noise, but maybe for this question, we can simplify it. But perhaps a better approach is to use the relation involving the star's apparent magnitude.

The S/N for a star observed with a telescope is given by the formula:

S/N = ( (F * t) / sqrt(F + B) )

But wait, sometimes it's simplified when F >> B (F is flux from star, B is background), so S/N ≈ sqrt(F * t). Hmm, not sure about that. Alternatively, another approach is using the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N.

I think the formula I remember is S/N ≈ 5 * sqrt(10^(0.4*(m - m0))), where m0 is some reference magnitude. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers here. Alternatively, I've heard that a 10th magnitude star gives about 10 S/N per pixel in an hour with certain instruments.

Wait, let me think. For a typical telescope and spectrograph, the S/N depends on the star's apparent brightness. Let me try to find out the apparent magnitudes of the given stars and see if they can reach S/N >=10.

The options are:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with V=15 mag, 10 pc
