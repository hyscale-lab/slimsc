Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay reaction. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino, nu. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and the mu(+) has a rest mass of 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino. The options given are A, B, C, D with pairs of MeV values.

Hmm. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So the initial momentum is zero because Pi is stationary. Therefore, the total momentum of the decay products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass (practically zero compared to other particles). So, the muon's momentum would be equal in magnitude to the neutrino's. But the neutrino's energy would be mostly from its kinetic energy, since its rest mass is negligible.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy of the system before decay is just the rest mass of the Pi, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

So, energy conservation equation:
M_Pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu.

And since the initial momentum is zero, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Let me write down the equations. For each particle, the total energy is their rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. But for the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, E_nu = p_nu * c (approx). Similarly, E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ).

Wait, but neutrinos are (almost) massless, so E_nu = p_nu c. So, the momentum of the muon is p, and the neutrino has the same p in magnitude. So, the energies would be:

E_mu = sqrt( p² c^4 + m_mu² c^4 ) / c²? Wait, perhaps better to work in units where c=1 to simplify. Oh, right, in particle physics, units are often set so that c=1. So I can ignore factors of c, which makes the equations easier.

So, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ) and E_nu = p_nu.

Since p_mu = p_nu (because they're equal and opposite), let's set p = p_mu = p_nu.

So the total energy equation becomes:
M_Pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

Because E_mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) and E_nu is p.

So the equation is M_Pi = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) + p.

I need to solve for p. Let's denote M as M_Pi, m as m_mu.

So, M = sqrt(p² + m²) + p.

Let me rearrange this equation. Subtract p from both sides:

M - p = sqrt(p² + m²).

Now square both sides to eliminate the square root.

(M - p)^2 = p² + m².

Expanding the left side: M² - 2 M p + p² = p² + m².

Simplify by subtracting p² from both sides:

M² - 2 M p = m².

Now, rearrange terms:

M² - m² = 2 M p.

So,

p = (M² - m²) / (2 M).

Wait, that's interesting. So the momentum p is (M² - m²)/(2M).

Let me plug in the numbers. M is 139.6 MeV, m is 105.7 MeV.

M² = 139.6² = let's calculate that. 140² is 19600, but 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² -
