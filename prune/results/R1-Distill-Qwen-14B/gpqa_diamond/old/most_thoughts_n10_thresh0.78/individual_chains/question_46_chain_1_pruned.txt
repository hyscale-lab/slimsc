Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis typically involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. So, when Grubbs is involved, it usually breaks and reforms double bonds, perhaps leading to ring formation or different chain lengths.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂CH3? No wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3, right? Because pentane has five carbons, so pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Wait, wait, no, wait, that's actually six carbons. Oh wait, no, wait: pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, wait, that's actually 1-pentene, which is five carbons total. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, no, that's six carbons. Oh wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Pentene has five carbons. 1-pentene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? Wait, no, that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let's see: 1-pentene would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. Wait, no, that's six carbons. Because CH₂ is two, CH is one, and then three more CH₂ groups? Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The formula for pent-1-ene is C5H10. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, I'm getting this wrong. Let me count. Pent-1-ene: the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3? No, that's five carbons. Wait, CH₂ is first, then CH, then CH₂, CH₂,
