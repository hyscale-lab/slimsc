Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So, I need to find the normalized eigenvector components.

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

Px is (ħ/2) times a matrix with first row (0, 1) and second row (1, 0). So that's (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]. That's the Pauli X matrix, right? Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

But wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So, the operator P along direction n is the sum of its components multiplied by the direction's components. Oh right, for an arbitrary axis, the operator would be the dot product of the vector of Pauli matrices with the direction vector.

So, the operator P is given by P = n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz. Because n is in the x-z plane, n_y must be zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z), and they probably define n in terms of polar coordinates or something. Hmm, but the exact components aren't given. Maybe I can express it in terms of an angle θ?

Right, for a direction in the x-z plane, we can parametrize it using an angle θ with the z-axis. So, n_x = sinθ cosφ, but wait, since it's in x-z, phi is 0 or some other angle. Wait, no. Wait, in spherical coordinates, x is r sinθ cosφ, y is r sinθ sinφ, z is r cosθ. But if it's in the x-z plane, then y-component is zero. So φ would be either 0 or 180, but I think in x-z, the angle can be φ=0 or π. Hmm, but maybe it's better to think in terms of θ being the angle from the z-axis, and n_x = sinθ, n_z=cosθ because when θ=0, we're along z, and when θ=π/2, we're along x. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). But wait, wait, that's if we're considering n as a unit vector. So, yeah, n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

So, the operator P becomes:

P = (n_x) * Px + (n_y) * Py + (n_z) * Pz. But n_y is zero, so:

P = n_x * (ħ/2) σx + n_z * (ħ/2) σz.

Wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So substituting n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ, P becomes:

(ħ/2) [ sinθ σx + cosθ σz ]

So, let's compute that matrix.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], σz is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So:

sinθ σx = [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
cosθ σz = [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding them together:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ
