Alright, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used on large telescopes. ESPRESSO is on the VLT at Paranal, and HIRES is part of the Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The question gives me some key details about their brightness limits.

The question states that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17. So, wait, wait. Wait, no. Actually, the description says "brighter than 17 mag." But in astronomy, lower magnitudes mean brighter objects. So, if a star's apparent magnitude is brighter (lower number) than 17, ESPRESSO can see it. So the apparent V magnitude of the star must be <=17? Because anything brighter (lower magnitude) than 17 would be within ESPRESSO's range.

Similarly, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So for HIRES, the star's apparent V magnitude must be <=16. Because 16 is the limitâ€”so stars brighter than (i.e., magnitude less than) 16 can be observed by HIRES.

So any star that has an apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 16 can be seen by both? Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO can go up to 17, and HIRES up to 16. So the overlapping range is up to 16. So a star with apparent V magnitude <=16 would be visible by both.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, ESPRESSO can see it. That means any star with V mag less than or equal to 17. HIRES can see stars with V mag less than or equal to 16. So the overlapping region is up to 16. So any star with V mag <=16 can be seen by both. But wait, wait. No, no. Because if a star is brighter than 17, that's V mag less than 17.
