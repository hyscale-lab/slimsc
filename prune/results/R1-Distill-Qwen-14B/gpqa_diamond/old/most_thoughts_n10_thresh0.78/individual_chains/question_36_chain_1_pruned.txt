Okay, so I've got this question here about the interstellar medium and absorption lines. Hmm, I remember that the interstellar medium is the stuff between stars, right? It's made up of gas and dust. And absorption lines are those dark lines in a star's spectrum where light is absorbed by the gas, so each line corresponds to a specific element or ion.

The question says the absorption line energy is about 3.9 micro electron volts. Wait, micro is 10^-6, so 3.9e-6 eV. That seems really low. I think the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c the speed of light. So lower energy photons have longer wavelengths. Oh, right, visible light is higher energy than infrared, which is higher than radio. Wait, or is it the other way around? No, no, higher frequencies (like X-rays) have higher energy than visible, which is higher than radio, which is longer wavelength.

Wait, but what determines the energy of the absorption lines? I remember that the ionization state of the gas affects the energy. Like, if the gas is hot, it might ionize more, but if it's cold, it's neutral or molecular. Oh, but wait, molecular clouds are cold, right? So the energy of the absorption line could tell us about the temperature or the density of the gas.

Wait, the energy of the line itself—I think that's the ionization potential? Or maybe the transition energy between energy levels. For example, hydrogen has Lyman alpha at about 10.2 eV, but that's a higher energy. But wait, 3.9 micro eV is way lower than that. Maybe that's a transition in a different element or molecule.

Wait, but in the interstellar medium, the most abundant elements are hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen line transitions—like the 21 cm line—is a hyperfine transition in neutral hydrogen. What's the energy of that? Let me think. The 21 cm line is in the radio part of the spectrum. Radio waves have low energy. Let me calculate the energy.
