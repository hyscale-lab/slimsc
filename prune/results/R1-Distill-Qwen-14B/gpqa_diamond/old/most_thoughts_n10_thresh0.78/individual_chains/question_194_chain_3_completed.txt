Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to think through it step by step. 

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state. The Boltzmann factor is e^(-βE), where β is 1/(kT), and E is the energy of the state.

The spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. I think I should list all these states and calculate their energies.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, so each term is the product of two spins. Let's see, for each state, I'll compute each product and then sum them up.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way than listing all eight possibilities. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so the product of two spins will be +1 if they're the same and -1 if different. So each term S_i S_j is ±1.

Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's denote H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J H. So the energy is proportional to -H. So each state's energy depends on H.

I need to find how many states have each possible value of H. Then, for each H value, the number of states with that H multiplied by e^(-β E) would contribute to Z.

Let me compute H for all possible states. Let's list all 8 possibilities.

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 3.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1:
   H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1:
   H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 3.

Wait, wait a second. Let me recount. For state 1, all spins up, H is 3. For state 8, all spins down, H is also 3. For the other states, H is -1. How many states have H=3? Only two: all up and all down. The other six states have H=-1.

So the possible values of H are 3 and -1, with counts 2 and 6 respectively.

Now, the energy E is given by E = -J H. So for each state, E = -J H.

So, for H=3, E = -J * 3 = -3J.

For H=-1, E = -J * (-1) = J.

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E). But since states with the same E can be grouped, we can multiply by the number of states.

So for H=3, the energy is -3J. The Boltzmann factor is e^(β * 3J) because E is negative. Because β is 1/(kT), so -β E = (1/(kT)) * 3J, which is 3Jβ.

Wait wait, no: E is -3J. So -β E is beta * 3J, which is 3Jβ. So e^{3Jβ}.

Similarly, for H=-1, E= J. So -beta E is -beta J = -Jβ. So the Boltzmann factor is e^{-Jβ}.

So the partition function Z is:

Z = (number of states with H=3) * e^{3Jβ} + (number with H=-1) * e^{-Jβ}.

From earlier, H=3 occurs in 2 states, and H=-1 in 6. So:

Z = 2 e^{3Jβ} + 6 e^{-Jβ}.

Wait, but wait the options are presented differently. Let me look at the options:

Option A) 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ}.

Option B) 2e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}.

Option C) 2e^{2Jβ} +6e^{-2Jβ}.

Option D) 6e^{2Jβ}+2e^{-2Jβ}.

So according to our calculation, Z = 2e^{3Jβ} +6e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.

But wait, wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in calculating the energy?

Wait, original E is -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So E = -J H, where H is the sum of the products.

So for H=3, E = -3J. So exp(-β E) is exp(3J β).

For H=-1, E= J. So exp(-β E) is e^{-J β}.

Yes, correct. So the calculation seems right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each term.

Wait, for each state, the energy is E = -J (S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3). So when H=3, E is -3J. So each of these two states contributes e^{3Jβ} each, so 2 e^{3Jβ}.

The other six states have E= J, so each contributes e^{-Jβ}, so 6 e^{-Jβ}.

So adding them gives Z = 2e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ}, which is option B.

Looking at the options, option B is exactly this.


To calculate the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), we start by noting that each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), giving a total of \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible states. The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right),
\]

where \( J \) is a coupling constant. Let \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). The energy can then be expressed as \( E = -JH \). The partition function \( Z \) is the sum of the Boltzmann factors for all states:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E} = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{\beta JH}.
\]

### Step 1: Determine the possible values of \( H \)
For all 8 possible states, we compute \( H = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \). The results are:
- \( H = 3 \): This occurs for two states where all spins are aligned, either all \( +1 \) or all \( -1 \).
- \( H = -1 \): This occurs for the remaining six states where the spins are not all aligned.

### Step 2: Compute the energy and Boltzmann factors
For each value of \( H \), the energy is \( E = -JH \), and the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-\beta E} = e^{\beta JH} \):
- For \( H = 3 \): \( E = -3J \), and the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{3J\beta} \). Since there are 2 such states, their contribution to \( Z \) is \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).
- For \( H = -1 \): \( E = J \), and the Boltzmann factor is \( e^{-J\beta} \). Since there are 6 such states, their contribution to \( Z \) is \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

### Step 3: Combine contributions to find \( Z \)
The partition function is the sum of the contributions from all states:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
Comparing this result with the given options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect signs in the exponents).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect exponents and coefficients).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
