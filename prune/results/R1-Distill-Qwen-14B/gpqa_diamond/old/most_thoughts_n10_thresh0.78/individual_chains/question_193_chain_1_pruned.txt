Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So the formula is N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options given are A to D, each with different exponents of r.

Hmm, right. So I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is in arcseconds, and the distance in parsecs is the reciprocal of parallax. So distance r = 1/plx. Wait, that's right. Because if plx is 1 parsec, distance is 1 parsec. Plx is 0.5, distance is 2 parsecs, etc.

So if N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5, I can substitute r into this. Since r = 1/plx, that means plx = 1/r. Plugging that into the equation, N ∝ 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let's compute that.

(1/r)^5 is 1/r^5. So 1 divided by that would be r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So when r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. 

Wait, but wait. The question says, how does the number change with distance per unit range of distance. Oh, maybe I'm thinking about the differential, like how much N changes as r changes by a small amount. But perhaps the question is looking for the functional form, not the differential. Or maybe it's about the number per unit distance, so the rate of N per unit r.

Wait, the problem states "number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance. Or maybe the total number in a thin shell between r and r+dr would be proportional to the surface area times the number of stars per unit volume. Hmm, maybe I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, since N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, and plx is 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So as r increases, the number of
