Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT for short. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my SMEFT, but I remember that it's a framework where you write down all possible interactions up to a certain energy scale, respecting certain symmetries.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare symmetry (2), CP symmetry (3), and CPT symmetry (4). The choices are A to D, each combining these.

Wait, let me think about each symmetry. Lorentz symmetry is a big one. SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, right? Because all the operators in the Standard Model are Lorentz-invariant, and SMEFT extends that. So any operator in SMEFT must preserve Lorentz symmetry. So point 1 must be correct.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations in space and time. Wait, but in a field theory, all terms must be Poincare invariant. Because Poincare includes momentum conservation, right? So operators in the Lagrangian must respect Poincare symmetry as well. So point 2 is correct too. So the first two are in.

Now, what about CP and CPT symmetries? I think that in the Standard Model, the symmetry is CPT, not CP. Because CPT is a combination of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. But I'm not sure if SMEFT enforces CP. Wait, wait, I remember that SMEFT doesn't necessarily require CP symmetry. Because some beyond the SM theories (like certain beyond-SM terms) can violate CP. For example, the Wilson coefficients can have phases that would lead to CP violation. So SMEFT itself doesn't enforce CP symmetry.

What about CPT? I think in any Lorentz-invariant theory, CPT symmetry must hold. Because the theory must be consistent with special relativity, and that includes the CPT theorem. Wait, the CPT theorem says that in a Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory, the product
