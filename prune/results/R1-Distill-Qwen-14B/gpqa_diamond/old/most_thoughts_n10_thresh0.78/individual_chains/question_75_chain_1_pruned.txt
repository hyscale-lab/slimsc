Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology. Let me try to figure it out. The scenario is about a researcher creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They modified the gene to include an influenza hemagglutinin sequence at the N-terminus for affinity purification. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells but couldn't overexpress the protein. The question is why, based on the construct's sequence provided.

Hmm, let's break this down. So the construct's plus strand sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, methionine. Then, after that, it's the coding sequence for the hemagglutinin determinant, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, I assume.

Wait, but the problem says they were unable to overexpress the protein. So why would that happen? Let's think about possible issues.

Option A says the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That could cause a problem if the HA sequence is messed up. Like, maybe the antibody won't bind because the epitope is altered. But how does that affect expression levels? If the HA is mutated, the purification might not work, but the protein might still be expressed. Unless the mutation caused a premature stop codon or messed up the reading frame. But the question is about overexpression, not purification.

Option B suggests the ribosome stops early. That would mean a premature stop codon. Let me look at the sequence. After the start codon, the next codons... Hmm. The sequence starts ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, TAC is tyrosine, CCA is proline, TAC is tyrosine, GAT is aspartic acid. So the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT... So the first few amino acids would be Met, Tyr, Pro, Tyr, Asp... Not seeing a stop codon early on. The sequence goes on for a while, and I don't see a UAA, UAG, or UGA anywhere in the first part. Unless I'm missing it. Wait, the sequence is written as 5' to 3', so looking for in-frame stop codons. Let me scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA in triplets.

Looking through the sequence, the first 100 bases or so don't have any obvious stop codons. So maybe option B isn't the issue.

Option C says the lack of a linker is causing proteolysis. If the HA tag is at the N-terminus, and there's no linker, perhaps the protein is being degraded. Proteases might recognize the HA sequence or something else. Or maybe the HA is causing the protein to misfold, leading to ER retention and degradation. But the question is about expression level, so if the protein isn't expressed, perhaps the mRNA isn't translated, or the construct is faulty.

Option D suggests the mouse lacks tRNA for the UAA codon. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. But in the sequence, are there any UAA codons? Let me check. Looking at the DNA sequence, which is the coding strand, so for mRNA, it's the same as the plus strand except T becomes U. So looking for sequences that would code for stop codons.

Wait, the coding strand is the one that's same as mRNA, except T becomes U. So the plus strand is the mRNA, essentially. So looking for UAA, UAG, UGA.

In the given sequence, let's look for any occurrence of TAA (since DNA is plus), which would be UAA in mRNA. Let me scan the sequence:

Looking for TAA in the DNA sequence. Let's see:

Looking through the sequence: 

Looking for triplets of TAA. Let me scan:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, I'll look for TAA in the DNA sequence. Let's see:

Looking for 'TAA' in the DNA sequence, so the triplet in the plus strand:

Hmm, let me split the sequence into triplets, starting from ATG:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CTC TGG AAG AAG TCC GCG GCC AGG ACA CAG TTC CGG AAA GCA CAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TGC GGC GCA GCG TCA GGG CTC GCC TCA CTC GCT GCC GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Wait, looking through each triplet:

ATG, TAC, CCA, TAC, GAT, GTT, CCA, GAT, TAC, GCC, AAA, TGA, CTC, TGG, AAG, AAG, TCC, GCG, GCC, AGG, ACA, CAG, TTC, CGG, AAA, GCA, CAG, CCA, GGA, TGC, AGG, GTG, CCG, GGA, AAG, CGC, TGC, ATG, AGT, TGC, TGC, TGC, TGC, GGC, GCA, GCG, TCA, GGG, CTC, GCC, TCA, CTC, GCT, GCC, GCG, TCT, ACG, AGT, CAG, CCA, AAG, TCT, TGA, ACG, TGG, ACC, CCC, GAC, AAT, GTG, ACC, TTT, TGT, GTG, CTC, GGC, TCG, GCG, GAC, ATC, GCG, CTT, TCG, CAG, ATC, CCA, TTT, TAC, GCC, TGA, TCC, AGG, CTC, TCT, GCT, GCG, AGA, TCG, TGG, GGC, GCC, CGG, CGC, AGG, AGG, CGG, TGG, CGC, CCG, GGA, GCA, CTG, CAT, CCT, CAT, TCC, ATT, TCC, GAG, TGA.

Wait, so let me look for TGA, which in DNA is TGA. DNA has TGA, which in mRNA is UGA, a stop codon. Looking through the triplets, I see one at position around the middle:

Looking at the triplet list, I see: ... TGA ... in the triplets.

Yes, in the middle I see 'TGA' as a triplet. So in the DNA, that would be the stop codon. Wait, so in the DNA sequence, the coding strand has a TGA, which would be a stop codon.

But when is this TGA appearing? Let me count the triplets. Let's see:

Triplet 1: ATG (1)
2: TAC (2)
3: CCA (3)
4: TAC (4)
5: GAT (5)
6: GTT (6)
7: CCA (7)
8: GAT (8)
9: TAC (9)
10: GCC (10)
11: AAA (11)
12: TGA (12)

Oh! The 12th triplet is TGA. So in the coding sequence, the 12th codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the mRNA would be ... UAC UAC UAC ... until the 12th codon, which is UGA, a stop.

That would mean that the construct introduces a premature stop codon at position 12, which is way early. So the protein would only be 12 amino acids long (since each codon is one amino acid, starting from ATG as 1). That's way too short. So the construct is truncated, leading to a very small protein, not the overexpressed one they wanted.

Wait, but why would that happen? Because they introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. Let me think about how the construct should be. The HA tag is at the N-termin
