Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order of substituents matters a lot because of directing effects. So I need to think about the directing groups and how they influence each other.

First, let me draw the target molecule. It's a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the numbering. Let me visualize it. Oh, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,3 would be adjacent in a row. So 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro. So in a straight line, ethoxy is at position 1, then tert-butyl at 2, then nitro at 3. So they're all meta to each other? No, waitâ€”ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, which is ortho to the ethoxy, and nitro at 3, which is meta to ethoxy and para to tert-butyl.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so maybe the positions are arranged such that substituents are in certain directing positions. Let me think about the substituents and their directing effects.

The substituents we have are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Ethoxy is an activating group (since it's an O-alkyl group), and it's an ortho/para director. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, activating group (alkyl), also ortho/para directing. The nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group.

So, when we add substituents, we have to consider which ones are added first because the existing substituents will direct the next incoming group.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let me think about the order in which they can be introduced.

Optionally, the nitrating step (adding nitro) could be done early or late. But since nitro is deactivating, if added first, it would direct the next substituents to certain positions. But ethoxy and tert-butyl are activating, which might be better when added later if possible.

Alternatively, perhaps nitrating after adding some activating groups would be better because the nitro group is deactivating, so it might not interfere too much with the next steps.

Wait, the target has the nitro group at position 3, ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2. Let me think about how to get that arrangement.

Let me consider the directing effects. Suppose I first add a nitro group. Then, the next substituent would be directed to the meta position with respect to nitro, but since nitro is meta-directing, the next group would be added meta to it. But that might complicate things because ethoxy and tert-butyl are both activating ortho/para directors.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added last, because adding nitro after activating groups would be more challenging since nitration is a strong deactivating step. Let me think again.

Wait, benzene is the starting material. Let's think of possible sequences.

I think the correct approach is to first add the ethoxy group, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro group. Or maybe the nitro group is added earlier.

Wait, but nitration is a powerful electrophilic substitution. So perhaps adding nitro after some activating groups would be better. Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is added first, but then the other groups have to be added in positions directed by nitro.

But the target molecule has all three substituents. So let's think about the steps:

Option 1: Add ethoxy first. Then, add tert-butyl, which might go ortho or para to ethoxy. Then, add nitro, which would be directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps adding nitro first, then ethoxy, then tert-butyl. But nitro is deactivating, so the next substitution would be directed but the ring would be harder to substitute.

Wait, but the target molecule has the nitro group at position 3. Let me think about the positions relative to ethoxy and tert-butyl.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced last because it's a deactivating group, and the activating groups can be added first.

Let's outline what each substitution does.

First, adding eth
