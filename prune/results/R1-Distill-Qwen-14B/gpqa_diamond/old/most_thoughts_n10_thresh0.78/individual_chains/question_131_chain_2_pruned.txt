Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. This anhydride has specific NMR spectra: the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two productsâ€”a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3.

The key part is about the NOESY NMR spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, which the minor doesn't. The question is asking which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product's spectrum.

Let me break this down. First, I need to figure out what the starting materials are.

The starting dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. Dehydration of a diacid usually forms an anhydride by losing water between the two acid groups. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the dehydration might form a cyclic anhydride, like a cyclic diester.

Looking at the NMR data of the anhydride: 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high field shift, but wait, 7 ppm is actually a medium shift in 1H NMR. Typically, aromatic protons are around 6.5-8.5 ppm. Wait, but the anhydride might not have aromatic rings. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol ether or something else, but I'm not sure. Wait, another possibility is that the 7 ppm peak is from an -OH group, but that's usually broader, not a singlet. Or perhaps it's from an alkene proton, but that's usually lower.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows a peak at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. 137 ppm is probably a carbon adjacent to an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl or an olefinic carbon. 165 ppm is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. Since it's an anhydride, the carbonyls are likely the ester carbonyls.

Wait, in an anhydride, the carbonyl carbons are typically around 170-220 ppm. Wait, 165 is a bit low for an anhydride. Hmm, maybe it's a cyclic anhydride? Or perhaps the 165 is a conjugated carbonyl?

Wait, another thought: 13C NMR of the anhydride has two peaks. So, perhaps the structure is symmetric. If the anhydride has a symmetrical structure, the carbons would be equivalent, giving fewer peaks.

Wait, the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. Let's think about possible structures. For example, if the anhydride is cyclic and has an ethereal oxygen, maybe with substituents that have equivalent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a simple cyclic anhydride without protons, but that doesn't fit because the 1H shows a peak.

Wait, perhaps the anhydride is a cyclic structure with a bridge, so that all the protons are equivalent. For example, if the anhydride is a five-membered ring, like maleic anhydride. But in that case, the
