Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when a ketone reacts with something like NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions, I think it's an example of the formation of a cyanohydrin. Oh yeah, cyanohydrin formation! That's when a nitrile group adds to a ketone, and you get a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on the same carbon.

So the mechanism for cyanohydrin formation typically involves the base deprotonating something. Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN-, which is a nucleophile. But in the presence of an acid, maybe? Or maybe it's done under basic conditions. I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, I think the reaction is usually done with an acid catalyst. Like H3O+ as a catalyst. The ketone, in the presence of an acid, probably gets protonated, making the carbonyl more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and then water does a backside attack, leading to the formation of the diol, but in this case, it's a nitrile and a hydroxyl group.

So for the first step, reagent A is probably an acid. Looking at the options, A could be H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which I think is used in the reduction of ketones to form bisulfite adducts, but maybe in other reactions. Or wait, in the case of the formation of a cyanohydrin, it's usually done with a catalytic acid. So A is H3O+.

Then the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the starting material is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile. Wait, that's a bit complex. Let me think. The structure has a nitrile group (CN) attached to a carbon that also has a hydroxyl (OH) group. And after reaction with B and water, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how do nitriles form carboxylic acids? Oh, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. Typically, this involves strong acid or base conditions, perhaps with heat. So when a nitrile group (R-Câ‰¡N) is hydrolyzed, it can form R-COOH. But wait, the starting material is 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, so when it's hydrolyzed, would it become a
