Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question presents four matrices: W, X, Y, Z. Each is a 3x3 matrix. The task is to choose the correct statement from the options A to D based on these matrices.

First, I need to recall some concepts from quantum mechanics and linear algebra. Quantum mechanics often deals with operators, states, and matrices. Observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the evolution operator (which is unitary) is used to describe the time evolution of a quantum state.

Let me go through each matrix and analyze their properties.

Starting with matrix W:
W is given as [[0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 0]]. Let's think about whether this is Hermitian or unitary. A Hermitian matrix equals its conjugate transpose. The conjugate transpose of W would be the same as W because all elements are real. So W is Hermitian. That makes sense because observables are Hermitian. But wait, the evolution operator is a unitary matrix. So for a matrix to be unitary, its inverse should equal its conjugate transpose. Let me check W's transpose. W is symmetric, so transpose is same as original. But is W unitary? Let's compute W*W^dagger (which is same as W*W since W is real and symmetric). So W squared is [[1, 0, 1], [0,1,0], [1,0,1]]. Hmm, not the identity matrix, so W is not unitary. Wait, but in three dimensions, maybe it's a permutation matrix. Yeah, W looks like a permutation matrix swapping elements. For example, applying W to a vector [a,b,c] would give [c, b, a]. The determinant of W is 2, I think. Because for a 3x3 permutation matrix, the determinant is either 1 or -1. Wait no, permutation matrices have determinant ±1. Let me compute the determinant of W. The matrix is:

Row 1: 0 0 1

Row 2: 0 1 0

Row 3: 1 0 0

The determinant can be calculated as 0*(1*0 - 0*0) - 0*(0*0 -1*1) +1*(0*0 - 1*1) → 1*(-1) = -1. So determinant is -1. So W is a unitary matrix because permutation matrices are orthogonal, hence unitary. Unitary matrices have the property that UU† = I.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. A matrix is unitary if U†U = I. Since W is real and symmetric, its conjugate transpose is itself. So W^2 = ?

W squared would be:

W is 3x3.

First element W11: (0*0 + 0*0 +1*1) =1.

Similarly, W squared:

Row 1: [ (0*0 + 0*0 +1*1), (0*0 + 0*1 +1*0), (0*1 + 0*0 +1*0) ] → [1,0,0]

Row 2: [ (0*0 +1*0 +0*1), (0*0 +1*1 +0*0), (0*1 +1*0 +0*0) ] → [0,1,0]

Row3: [ (1*0 +0*0 +0*1), (1*0 +0*1 +0*0), (1*1 +0*0 +0*0) ] → [0,0,1]

Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, when I multiply W by W, the first row of W is [0,0,1], and each column of W is [0,1,1], [0,1,0], [1,0,0]. Wait no, perhaps I should compute each element.

Wait, element (1,1) is row 1 of W times column 1 of W:

(0)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(1) =1.

Element (1,2): row 1 * column 2: 0*0 +0*1 +1*0 =0.

Element (1,3): row1 * column3: 0*1 +0*0 +1*0 =0.

So first row of W^2 is [1,0,0].

Similarly, row 2 of W is [0,1,0].

Multiply by column 1: 0*0 +1*0 +0*1 =0.

Column2: 0*0 +1*1 +0*0=1.

Column3: 0*1 +1*0 +0*0=0.

So row2 of W^2 is [0,1,0].

Row3 of W is [1,0,0].

Multiply by column1: 1*0 +0*0 +0*1=0.

Column2: 1*0 +0*1 +0*0=0.

Column3:1*1 +0*0 +0*0=1.

So row3 is [0,0,
