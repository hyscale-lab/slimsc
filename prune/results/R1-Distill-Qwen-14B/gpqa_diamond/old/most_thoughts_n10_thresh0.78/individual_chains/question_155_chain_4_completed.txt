Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Hmm, I remember that uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So the uncertainty ΔP_z would be the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. Mathematically, that's sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). 

Wait, but wait. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x, right? So, the state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). I think I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in this state to find the uncertainty.

First, let me write down the matrix for P_z. From the question, P_z is a 3x3 matrix with the first row [ħ, 0, 0], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,-ħ]. So, it looks like this:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ]]

And the state vector ψ is given as a column vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as ψ = [a, b, c]^T where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2. 

Wait, but to compute <P_z>, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward. Each diagonal element is multiplied by the square of the corresponding component's magnitude. Because for a diagonal matrix, P_z |ψ> is just scaling each component by the diagonal elements. So, <P_z> is a² * ħ + b² * 0 + c² * (-ħ). 

Wait, let's compute that. a is -1/2, so a squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Similarly, c squared is also (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So, <P_z> = (1/4) * ħ + (1/4)*(-ħ) = (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0. Oh, right, because the middle term (b² *0) is zero. So <P_z> is zero.

Now, <P_z²> is the expectation value of P_z squared. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is also diagonal, with each element squared. So the diagonal elements of P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0, and (-ħ)^2, which is ħ², 0, ħ². 

So, <P_z²> is a² * (ħ)^2 + b² *0 + c² * (ħ)^2. Plugging in the values:

a² is (1/2)^2 = 1/4, same for c². So 1/4 * ħ² + 1/4 * ħ² = (1/4 +1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². 

So, putting it into the uncertainty formula: ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - (0)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = (ħ) * sqrt(1/2) = ħ / sqrt(2). 

Wait, looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2). So the uncertainty should be that. But wait, I should double-check my calculations because sometimes I might mix up the components.

Wait, let me recheck the components of the state vector. The state is (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So when squared, each component is (1/4), (1/2), and (1/4) respectively. So a² is 1/4, c² is also 1/4. So when I multiply a² by ħ² and c² by ħ², I get 1/4 ħ² each. Together, 1/2 ħ², which is correct. 

So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). So the answer should be option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal:
\[
P_z = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -\hbar
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state of the system is given as the column vector:
\[
\psi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
-1/2 \\
1/\sqrt{2} \\
-1/2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is calculated as:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = a^2 \cdot \hbar + b^2 \cdot 0 + c^2 \cdot (-\hbar),
\]
where $a = -1/2$, $b = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and $c = -1/2$. Squaring the components:
\[
a^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad b^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad c^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]
Substituting:
\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot (-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:
\[
P_z^2 = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \hbar^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = a^2 \cdot \hbar^2 + b^2 \cdot 0 + c^2 \cdot \hbar^2.
\]
Substituting:
\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the uncertainty formula:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]
Substituting $\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2$ and $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$:
\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
