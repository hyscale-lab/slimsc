Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the planet and the closer it is, the bigger the shift, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. So both planets are about the same mass. They detected each using the RV method.

Planet #1 caused a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 caused a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but wait, I thought the RV method measures the velocity of the star, not the Doppler shift directly. Oh wait, maybe the shift given here is proportional to the star's velocity. Because the Doppler shift in wavelength is related to the star's velocity towards or away from us.

So the formula I remember for the Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But in this case, I think the shifts are given as the full amplitude, so it's twice the maximum velocity or something? Or maybe it's directly the semi-amplitude of the velocity. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh wait, no, I think the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. So the maximum speed the star moves towards or away from us is what's measured.

But wait, the question gives the periodic wavelength shifts. So maybe the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity is proportional to the Doppler shift. So the bigger the velocity, the larger the shift.

So for planet 1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet 2, it's 7. So that suggests that planet 2's star has a higher velocity semi-amplitude. So that would imply a higher mass or a closer planet.

Wait, but both planets
