Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They orbit in a system and were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure if that method affects this problem directly. Maybe it's just context.

The question gives me ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, Planet1's temperature (T1) is 1.4 times Planet2's (T2). Then the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3, so T2 is 2.3 times Planet3's temperature (T3). So T1 is 1.4 * T2, which would make T1 = 1.4 * (2.3 * T3) which is 3.22 * T3. So T1 is 3.22 times T3.

Wait, but maybe I should write that down more clearly. Let me think about the ratios:

T1 / T2 ≈ 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 T2

T2 / T3 ≈ 2.3 → T2 = 2.3 T3

So substituting, T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = 3.22 T3. So T1 is 3.22 times T3.

But maybe I don't need that right now. The question is about the orbital periods. The question also gives mass ratios. Planet1/Planet2 mass is approximately 1.15, so M1 = 1.15 M2. And Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35, so M2 = 1.35 M3. So M1 = 1.15 * 1.35 M3. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35 is 1.5525. So M1 is about 1.55 times M3. So M1 = 1.55 M3.

But how does that relate to the orbital period? Well, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a) divided by the mass of the star (M), assuming the planet's mass is negligible. But wait, the mass in Kepler's law is the mass of the star, not the planet. But the problem says the masses are given for the planets. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Each planet is orbiting the same star, right? So their periods would depend on their distance from the star and the star's mass. But the problem is giving me the planet masses, not the star's mass. Hmm. So maybe I don't need the planet masses because the star's mass is the same for all. But then why are the planet masses given?

Wait, perhaps the question is talking about the Hill sphere or something else, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the planets' masses in some way affecting their orbital periods, but I don't think so. Because Kepler's law is about the star's mass and the planet's distance, not the planet's mass. So maybe the planet masses are a red herring, or perhaps it's about another aspect.

Wait, but the question is about the equilibrium temperatures and the orbital period. The equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and its albedo. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [(L (1 - a))/(16πσ D²)]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, and D is the distance from the star. Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), that factor is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the luminosity (since L is proportional to D^4), or inversely on the square root of the distance squared? Wait, let me think.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature equation can be written as:

T = [ (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Simplifying, T ∝ sqrt( (L)^(1/4) ) / D^(1/2) )

Wait, maybe it's better to square both sides:

T^4 ∝ L (1 - a) / D²

Since (1 - a) is the same for all, T^4 ∝ L / D².

But L, the star's luminosity, is the same for all planets, so T^4 ∝ 1/D² → T^2 ∝ 1/D → T ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

So the temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. So, if T1 is higher than T3, that means Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet3. Because higher temperature implies closer distance.

Wait, but I have the temperature ratios. Let me see.

So, T1 / T3 = 3.22 → from earlier.

But since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then T1 / T3 = sqrt(D3/D1) )

Wait, let me think. Because T = k / sqrt(D), where k is a constant. So T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T3 = k / sqrt(D3). So T1 / T3 = sqrt(D3/D1). So (T1/T3)^2 = D3/D1 → D3 = D1 * (T1/T3)^2.

Wait, but T1 is 3.22 times T3 → (3.22)^2 = approximately 10.36. So D3 = D1 * (3.22)^2 → D3 = D1 * 10.36.

So Planet3 is about 10.36 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Now, Kepler's third law says that P² ∝ D³ / (M_star), assuming M_star >> planet mass. But if the star's mass is much larger than the planet's, and all planets orbit the same star, M_star is the same for all, so P² ∝ D³. Thus, P ∝ D^(3/2).

So the period of Planet3 compared to Planet1 would be:

P3/P1 = (D3 / D1)^(3/2) = (10.36)^(3/2)

Let me compute that. So 10.36 squared is about 107.3 (since 10^2 is 100, 10.36^2 is (10 + 0.36)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.36 + 0.36² = 100 +7.2 +0.1296=107.3296). Then the cube root of that would be (107.3296)^(3/2) = sqrt(107.3296)^3. Wait, no, wait. Because 10.36 is D3/D1, so (D3/D1) is about 10.36, so (D3/D1)^(3/2) is (10.36)^(1.5).

Wait, 10^1.5 is about 31.62 (since sqrt(10)=3.162, 10^1.5 = 10 *3.16
