Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. We need to find the energy difference that allows us to clearly distinguish the two levels. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a quantum state is related to the uncertainty principle. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! The principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is at least ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. So, ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. 

Wait, but in this case, the lifetimes given are the lifetimes of each state. So each state has its own lifetime. I think the time uncertainty Δt for each state is the lifetime itself. So for E1, Δt would be 1e-9 seconds, and for E2, it's 1e-8 seconds. 

But wait, the question is about the energy difference between E1 and E2. So the energy difference ΔE must be such that the uncertainty in energy (from each state's lifetime) is smaller than the actual energy difference. Otherwise, the two states might not be distinguishable. 

So, the uncertainty in energy for each state would be ħ divided by the lifetime. Let me calculate that. The reduced Planck's constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. 

For E1: ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1 = 1.0545718e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.0545718e-25 J. To convert that into eV because the options are in eV. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602176634e-19 joules. So, 1.05e-25 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = approximately 6.56e-7 eV. So about 6.56e-7 eV uncertainty for E1. 

Similarly, for E2: τ2 is 1e-8 s. So ΔE2 = ħ / τ2 = 1.05e-34 / 1e-8 = 1.05e-26 J. Convert to eV: 1.05e-26 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 6.56e-8 eV. So about 6.56e-8 eV uncertainty for E2. 

Wait, but the energy difference between E1 and E2 is ΔE = E2 - E1. To clearly distinguish the two states, the energy difference ΔE must be greater than the sum of their uncertainties. Because if the energy difference is smaller than the uncertainties, you can't tell them apart. So, ΔE > ΔE1 + ΔE2.

Let me calculate the sum of the uncertainties. ΔE1 is about 6.56e-7 eV, and ΔE2 is 6.56e-8 eV. So sum is 7.216e-7 eV. So ΔE must be greater than approximately 7.2e-7 eV.

Looking at the options, the choices are A) 1e-9, B)1e-11, C)1e-4, D)1e-8. Let's see: 1e-4 is 0.0001 eV, which is way bigger than 7e-7. So option C is much larger. Option D is 1e-8, which is 0.00000001 eV, which is smaller than 7.2e-7. So option D is too small. Similarly, options A and B are way too small.

So the energy difference needs to be larger than about 7e-7 eV. The only option that fits is C, which is 1e-4 eV. Because that's much larger than 7e-7. So option C is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I
