Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and break it down. 

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. 

Then, the astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a star's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, that's Wien's Law. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is the same, then T is the same. 

Wait, but wait! I thought that more massive stars are hotter. Oh, but maybe not in this case. Because they have the same peak wavelength, so same temperature. That's a crucial point. So T1 = T2. 

Now, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But I'm not sure if that affects the luminosity calculation. Oh, right, because luminosity is an intrinsic property, not depending on velocity. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, it might shift the spectrum (Doppler effect), but the intrinsic brightness (luminosity) is based on its actual properties. So maybe radial velocity doesn't factor into the calculation here. 

The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, given that they are black bodies. The options are A to D, with factors around 2.2 to 2.35. 

So, the formula for luminosity of a star as a black body is the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where R is radius, T is temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. 

But since both stars have the same temperature (as their peak wavelengths are same), the ratio of their luminosities depends on the ratio of their radii squared. 

So L1 / L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4 

But since T1 = T2, the T term is 1, so it's just (R1/R2)^2. 

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, so (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2, which would suggest the answer is A) ~2.25. 

But wait, the options have B) ~2.32, which is a little higher. Hmm. Did I miss something? 

Wait, the problem says they calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So maybe I should double-check the formula. 

Alternative thought: Could the radial velocity affect the observed flux, and thus the observed luminosity? No, wait, luminosity is an intrinsic property. The observed flux would change if the star is moving, but luminosity is the actual energy output. Or wait, perhaps because the stars are moving, their measured flux might be affected. But the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity, which is the intrinsic value, not the flux. So the radial velocity shouldn't affect the luminosity calculation. 

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the role of the radial velocity. Since Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, could that affect our measurement of its temperature or radius? Because when a star moves towards or away, the Doppler effect shifts the wavelengths. But in the problem, the peak wavelengths were found to be the same. So even if Star_2 is moving, the measured peak wavelength is the same as Star_1. So their temperatures are the same. 

Wait, but Doppler shift would affect the observed wavelength, but the peak is same. So if Star_2 is moving with some velocity, does that affect our inferred temperature? Let me think. When a star is moving towards us, the wavelengths are blueshifted, and moving away would redshift. But the peak wavelength observed would be λ = λ0 (1 + v/c), where v is the velocity. Or something like that. 

Wait, but in this problem, the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. So if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, and Star_1 is not moving, then perhaps the observed λ_max for Star_2 is λ2 = λ1 (1 + v/c), assuming it's moving away. But wait, the problem says the wavelengths are the same, so λ1_obs = λ2_obs. 

Wait, then λ1_obs = λ1_rest * (1 + v1
