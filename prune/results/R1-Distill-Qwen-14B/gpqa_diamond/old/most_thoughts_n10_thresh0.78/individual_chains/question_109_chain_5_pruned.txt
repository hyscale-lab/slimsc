Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nucleons and particle emission. Hmm, let's read through it carefully.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X that has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. We need to find which partial wave is not permitted, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

Okay, so the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 means 2S+1=1, which implies S=0. L is S, so that's the orbital angular momentum. J is 0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital L=0 (since it's S), and total angular momentum J=0.

They emit a particle X. The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the emitted particle is negative.

The final NN state has T=0. The Pauli equation condition is T = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So T is 0, so 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies S + L = 1 mod 2. So their sum is odd. So S and L must be one even and one odd.

Wait, because if S is even, L must be odd, and vice versa. Because even + odd = odd.

Now, the process is emission of X, so the initial NN is in state 1S0, and after emitting X, the final state is something else. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the system is two nucleons in 1S0, and they emit a particle X, so the final state includes the NN plus X, but the question is about the NN's state after emission. Or is it about the reaction where the two nucleons are in some state after emitting X?

Wait, the initial system is two nucleons (they were bound), and they emit a particle X. So the initial state is NN in 1S0. The final state is NN in some state, plus X (the emitted particle).

But the question is about the partial waves possible for X. The options give the possible transitions, like 1S0 → something + p, etc. So each option is an initial state (1S0) and a final state (like 7D1, 3S1, etc.), plus the particle X emitted.

Wait, but the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So in each option, the NN after emission is in a state with T=0.

Wait, but the initial state's isospin T isn't given. Oh wait, the initial state is 1S0, which for NN is a singlet state in isospin. Because for two nucleons, the isospin can be 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). But in the 1S0 state, I think it's the singlet state, so T=0. Hmm, but wait, the question says that the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is 1S0 with T=0? Or is it different?

Wait, the problem says, "the final NN state has T(NN) = 0". So the initial state could have a different T, but in the options, each transition leads to a certain state. Hmm, maybe the initial T is irrelevant because we're given the final state's T.

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0, which would have T=0 (since S=0 is the spin, and for two nucleons, the isospin T can be determined by their combination). Wait, no, the isospin isn't directly the same as spin. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

The problem says that the initial state is 1S0. So, the initial state's T might be 0 because it's a singlet. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's isospin is not the focus; what's more important is the final state's T=0.

So, for each option, the final state of the NN is given as, e.g., 7D1, 3S1, etc. Each of these states has certain quantum numbers (T, S, L) which must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T=0, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L
