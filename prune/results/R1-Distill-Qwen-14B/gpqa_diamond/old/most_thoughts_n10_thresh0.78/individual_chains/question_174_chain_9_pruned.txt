Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I need to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy and the classical approximation. Let's see.

The problem says the initial nucleus is at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments. One is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, the initial mass is M, and the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, where m2 is twice m1. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Let me write that down.

So m1 + 2m1 = 3 m1 = 0.99 M → m1 = 0.99 M /3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, m1 is the smaller mass, so the other is m2 = 2 m1. So m1 + m2 = 3 m1 = 0.99 M. So m1 = 0.99 M /3, and m2 is 0.99 M *2/3.

Wait, but the initial mass is M, which is 300 GeV/c². But since the rest mass energy is 300 GeV, M c² = 300 GeV. Oh, right, because E=mc², so M is 300 GeV/c².

So the fragments have rest mass energies of m1 c² and m2 c². Let me compute m1 and m2. 

m1 = (0.99 M) /3. And M is 300 GeV/c², so m1 = (0.99 *300 GeV/c²)/3 = (297 GeV/c²)/3 = 99 GeV/c². So m1 c² is 99 GeV, and m2 c² is 198 GeV.

Wait, but the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M, which is 300 *0.99 = 297 GeV. So yes, that checks out: 99 + 198 = 297 GeV. 

Now, the nucleus is initially at rest. After fission, the two fragments move in opposite directions because of conservation of momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after must be zero. So if the velocities are opposite, their momenta cancel each other.

I need to find the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m2. Let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2 for m1 and m2. Since they move in opposite directions, their momenta are p1 = gamma m1 v1 and p2 = gamma m2 v2, but I think in opposite directions. So p1 = -p2 → gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2. Hmm, but this might get complicated.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to think in terms of
