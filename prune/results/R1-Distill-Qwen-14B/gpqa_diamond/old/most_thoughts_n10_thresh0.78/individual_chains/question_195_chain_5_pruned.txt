Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the maximum orbital period of a second planet in the same system that will show both transit and occultation events. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's parse the question. There's a primary planet, let's call it Planet A, with Earth's radius orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of Planet A is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet, Planet B, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size. We need to find the maximum period Planet B can have so that it transits and occults.

Wait, transit and occultation... Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet's light (if it emits any) is blocked. But I guess in this context, occultation refers to the planet being hidden behind the star, so we can't see it — but from our observation, that would just mean it's not visible. Wait, but for the purpose of the problem, maybe it's more about the alignment of the orbits so that both events can occur.

So both planets are in the same orbital plane, which is good because that means their transits would be aligned. But the question is about the maximum period where both events happen. I think this relates to their orbital periods and how they relate — like a conjunction, I suppose.

Wait,
