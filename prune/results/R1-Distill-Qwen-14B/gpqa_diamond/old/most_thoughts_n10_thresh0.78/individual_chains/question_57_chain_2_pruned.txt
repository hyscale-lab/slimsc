Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, the question gives me phase shifts at different angles and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, phase shifts in scattering... right, in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is expressed using partial waves and phase shifts. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) ), but wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe it's f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} (1 - e^{-2iδ_l}) / (1 - e^{-iδ_l}) ] or something like that. Hmm, I'm not sure. Oh wait, I think the standard expression for the scattering amplitude when considering partial waves is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} (e^{-2iδ_l} - 1) ) * something else. Or perhaps it's better to think about the relation between the scattering amplitude and the phase shifts in terms of the partial wave expansion.

Wait, another approach: The total scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all angular momentum states. For each l, the contribution is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (k (1 - e^{-2iδ_l})) )? Or maybe I'm getting this from the optical theorem or something else.

Wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, along the beam direction is θ=0, so that's the forward direction. So I should think about f(0). 

But wait, in the partial wave expansion, the amplitude at θ=0 is f(0) = sum over l of (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (k
