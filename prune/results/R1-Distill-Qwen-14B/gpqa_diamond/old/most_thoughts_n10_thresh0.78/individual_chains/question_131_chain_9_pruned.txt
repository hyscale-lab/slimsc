Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and think through each part step by step.

The problem says that a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacted with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3. The major product's NOESY NMR shows a cross-peak, but the minor doesn't have it or has a weak one.

First, I need to figure out the structure of the anhydride. The 1H NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm. That's a high ppm value, so maybe it's an aromatic proton? But wait, the 13C NMR has peaks at 137 and 165 ppm. Oh, 137 could be a carbonyl adjacent to something, like an oxygen, maybe a carbonyl group. 165 is likely a carbonyl as well, like a ketone or ester. Wait, but anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. So the 13C spectrum has two peaks for the carbonyls. Hmm, but the 1H NMR has only one peak at 7 ppm. Maybe it's a symmetrical structure, so all the protons are equivalent.

The starting material is a dicarboxylic acid. When it's dehydrated, it forms a cyclic anhydride. Since the starting acid has a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride where the two carboxylic acid groups are connected via a ring, probably a five-membered ring because that's more common for anhydrides. The cis-alkene suggests that the two carbonyl groups are on the same face, making the anhydride have a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Maybe that's a methylene group next to the carbonyl, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated system. Oh, wait, maybe it's a maleic anhydride structure. Maleic anhydride is a good example. Its 1H NMR has two sets of protons, but in this problem, there's only one peak. Oh, wait, maybe the structure is such that all the protons are equivalent. Like in a symmetrical situation. For example, if the anhydride is formed from a diacid where the two acid groups are symmetrical across the double bond.

Wait, if the diacid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond. No, wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene. So perhaps it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond between the CH2 groups, so like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes HOOC-CH=CH-COOH when dehydrated? No, wait, dehydration would form an anhydride, which is cyclic. So maybe the structure is such that when the diacid loses water from adjacent OH groups, it forms a cyclic anhydride with the double bond.

Wait, wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene. So the structure before dehydration is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond instead of single bonds between the two middle carbons, and the substituents on either side are cis. So when it dehydrates, the anhydride forms a five-membered ring, with the double bond contributing to the ring. So maybe the structure is cyclic, like a cyclopentene-fused an
