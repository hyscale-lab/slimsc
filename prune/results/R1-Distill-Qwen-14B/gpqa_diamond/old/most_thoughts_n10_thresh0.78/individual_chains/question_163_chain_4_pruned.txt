Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it properly.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we need to determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. Since it's a hydroxide, it should react with an acid. Monobasic strong acid—like HCl, HNO3, etc.—so the reaction should produce water and the corresponding salt, probably Fe^3+ ions.

Let me write down the reaction equation. Fe(OH)3 reacting with a strong acid, say HCl:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

Wait, but wait, how much Fe(OH)3 do we have? 0.1 grams. I need to find the moles of Fe(OH)3 first.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: let's calculate that. Iron (Fe) is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, Hydrogen (H) is 1.008. So:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 * 16 = 48
H: 3 * 1.008 = 3.024
Total = 55.85 + 48 + 3.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. That's about 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

From the reaction equation, 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl. So moles of HCl needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

But wait, the acid solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So to find the volume needed, use M = n/V → V = n/M.

So n is 0.002808 mol. M is 0.1 mol/L = 0.1 mol/1000 cm³. So V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters → 28.08 cm³. Oh, but wait, the options have a 28.05 cm³ (option C) and a 30.09 cm³ (option B), etc. Hmm, slight differences. I'll have to be precise with the calculations.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles of Fe(OH)3 more accurately. 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol.

0.1 / 106.874 is approximately 0.00093596 moles. So that's about 9.3596e-4 mol.

So moles of HCl needed: 3 * 9.3596e-4 = 0.00280788 mol.

Volume of HCl solution = moles / concentration. 0.00280788 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280788 L = 28.0788 cm³. So approximately 28.08 cm³. That's very close to option C's 28.05 cm³. Hmm, but why the slight difference? Maybe I should check the exact molar mass.

Wait, let me compute the molar mass again.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol (I think I used 55.85 before)
O: 16.00 each
H: 1.008 each.

So Fe(OH)3:

Fe: 55.845
O: 3 * 16.00 = 48.00
H: 3 * 1.008 = 3.024

Total: 55.845 + 48.00 + 3.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.00093598 mol.

HCl needed: 3 * 0.00093598 = 0.00280794 mol.

Volume of HCl: 0.00280794 mol / 0.1 M = 0.0280794 L = 28.0794 cm³. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 28.08 cm³. Option C is 28.05, which is very close. So perhaps the slight difference comes from rounding during the calculation.

So the first part of the question is the minimum volume of acid, which is approximately 28.08 cm³. So looking at the options, option C and option B have volumes near 28 and 30.

Wait, but what's the second part about? The pH of the resulting solution. So after the reaction, what's the pH?

After adding the HCl, the solution will have FeCl3 dissolved. FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So the solution should be acidic because the Fe^3+ ion will hydrolyze in water, making H+ ions.

So the pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions.

Let me think about this. Fe^3+ hydrolyzes in the following way:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

But wait, wait, the solution after adding HCl would have excess acid, but in this case, since we used just enough HCl to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, what's the situation?

Wait, no. Because Fe(OH)3 is being dissolved by HCl. So all of the Fe(OH)3 is converted into Fe^3+ ions in solution.

But wait, when Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in a strong acid, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions and the excess H+ ions from the acid. So the solution should be acidic. But how do we calculate the pH?

Wait, but in the solution, the H+ comes from two sources: the excess HCl and the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But wait, when you add exactly enough HCl to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, the moles of HCl would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So in this case, the Fe(OH)3 is 0.00093598 mol, so HCl would be 0.00280794 mol.

Now, the solution volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So the concentration of HCl is 0.00280794 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0280794 M. But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.

But wait, when you have excess H+ from HCl, but also Fe^3+ which can hydrolyze to produce more H+.

Wait, but in this case, since all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved by HCl, the solution is a solution of FeCl3. So the solution will have Fe^3+ ions. So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but in reality, the presence of excess H+ from the acid will suppress the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ because Le Chatelier's principle says that the system will adjust to counteract the change. So the hydrolysis will be suppressed, and the pH will be low because of the excess H+.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the solution is made by adding 28.08 cm³ of HCl to 100 cm³ of solution. So the total volume is about 128.08 cm³? Or is the total volume 100 cm³? Wait the question says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the resulting solution has a volume of 100 cm³.

Wait, wait, no. The question says, "dissolve ... in 100 cm3 total volume." So that implies that the final solution is 100 cm³. So the 100 cm³ is the total solution after adding the acid.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Because the volume of the solution after adding the acid would depend on the volume of the acid added. But the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps when you add the acid, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So you can't just add 28 cm³ of HCl because that would make the total volume 100 cm³ only if the initial solution was 72 cm³, but probably, the problem is assuming that the solution's final volume is 100 cm³, regardless of how much acid is added.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is simplified, assuming that the volume of the acid added is negligible compared to the total solution volume, which is 100 cm³. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the total solution volume is 100 cm³, so the HCl is diluted into 100 cm³.

Wait, but the problem says: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume after dissolution is 100 cm³. So when you add the HCl, the total volume becomes 100 cm³
