Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and partial waves. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it.

The question says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh wait, I remember that the parity of the system is related to the orbital angular momentum. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays in here.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, we need to find which partial wave isn't permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 implies 2S+1 =1 â†’ S=0. L is S in spectroscopic notation, so L=0. J is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X. The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the process will affect the allowed transitions. Also, since the initial state is 1S0, the emitted particle's parity will influence the parity of the final state.

Wait, the parity of the initial system (two nucleons) is important. For a two-body system, the parity is (-1)^L, since L is the orbital angular momentum. So initial parity is (-1)^0 = 1.

When they emit a particle, the final state's parity must be considered. The parity of the final state (NN and X) has to be conserved. Wait, no, because parity isn't a conserved quantity in weak interactions, but here, since we're dealing with strong or electromagnetic processes (emitting a pion, perhaps?), parity should be conserved. So the product of the intrinsic parity of X and the parity of the NN system should equal the parity of the initial system. Wait, no. Let me think.

The parity of the system after emission would involve the orbital angular momentum of X with the NN system. So the parity of the final state (NN) would be the product of the parity of the initial state, the parity of X, and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of X.

Wait, perhaps the parity conservation is about the initial and final states. The initial parity is the parity of the NN system, which is 1 (since L=0). The final state is the NN system and the emitted particle X. But since we're considering the NN system's state after emission, perhaps the parity of X is involved.

Alternatively, considering that the process is emission of X, the parity of the NN system after emission must be equal to the initial parity multiplied by the parity of X times the parity change due
