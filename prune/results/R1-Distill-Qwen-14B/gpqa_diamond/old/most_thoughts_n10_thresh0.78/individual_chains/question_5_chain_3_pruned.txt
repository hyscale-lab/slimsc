Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

Wait, the operator is called P_vec, and it's for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, muons are just like electrons but heavier, right? But for this problem, probably doesn't matter. The direction is in x-z, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, I guess.

The eigenvalue we're looking for is +ħ/2. So we're dealing with spin-up along the direction n. Since spin-1/2 particles have eigenvalues ±ħ/2 for any direction.

The question gives me the components P_x, P_y, P_z of the operator P. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix.

Let me write down each component:

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]]. So that matrix is σ_x, the Pauli X matrix.

P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is σ_y, the Pauli Y matrix.

P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0], [0,-1]], which is σ_z.

So the operator P in the x-z plane. Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary in x-z. So the operator we need is the component of P along n, which is a direction in x-z.

Wait, no, wait. The operator P is given as a vector operator, i.e., it's a vector with components P_x, P_y, P_z.

Wait, but the operator along an arbitrary direction n would be P · n̂, right? So the operator is P_n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be described by an angle θ from the z-axis. So the components of n are (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

So n_x = sinθ, n_y = 0, n_z = cosθ.

So the operator P along n is P_n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Let me write this out. Since P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x, and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z.

So P_n = (ħ/2) (σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ).

Wait, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So adding them in combinations:

σ_x sinθ + σ_z cosθ would be:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So P_n would be (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So the matrix for P_n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, we're to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ
