Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem is about a series of reactions starting from compound A, going through B, C, and then D. The task is to identify compound D from the given options.

First, let me break down the information given.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, that's interesting. NMR signals can tell us a lot about the structure.

So, a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. That's probably a set of equivalent protons, maybe in a methyl group. Triplets usually come from coupling with two neighboring sets of protons. Wait, so if it's a triplet, maybe each of those protons is next to two others. Like in an ethyl group. Wait, but 6H suggests two methyl groups. Oh wait, perhaps two equivalent methyl groups adjacent to a CH2. Let me think.

The second signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each of those protons is coupling with three others. So, maybe a -CH2-CH2- group. The 4H could be two sets of two protons each, maybe as part of an ethyl group.

Putting that together: The triplet (6H) could be two methyl groups attached to a CH2. So, maybe a structure like (CH2CH2CH(CH3)2) or something like that. Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl group. No, wait, diethyl would have more protons. Or maybe it's an ethyl group adjacent to two methyl groups. Wait, let's think: If we have a central CH2 connected to two CH(CH3)2 groups? No, that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: The triplet (each H in the triplet has two neighbors) and quartet (each H has three neighbors). Let me think about a possible structure where there's a CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2) but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, no, wait. If you have a structure like (CH2CH(CH2CH3)2), but that's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe the structure is a cyclohexane derivative. Wait, no, because the NMR doesn't suggest any ring protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is neopentyl? No, neopentyl is 2,2-dimethylpropyl, which would have a singlet for the central CH, so maybe not.

Wait, another thought: The triplet could be from two equivalent methyl groups (like two CH3 groups
