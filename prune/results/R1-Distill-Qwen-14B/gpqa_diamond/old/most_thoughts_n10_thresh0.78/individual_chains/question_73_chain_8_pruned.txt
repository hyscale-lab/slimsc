Okay, so I've got this physics problem about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

First, the problem states: Two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, but wait. When it comes to relative speed in relativity, you can't just subtract the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, because of the velocity addition formula. I remember that in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. So to find the relative speed of one astronaut from the other's frame, I should use the velocity addition formula.

The velocity addition formula is (u - v) / (1 - (uv)/c²). Oh wait, but wait, let me get the order right. If astronaut A is moving at u relative to the lab frame, and astronaut B is moving at v, then from B's frame, A's speed would be (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²). Or is it the other way around? Maybe I should think in terms of which astronaut is moving faster. In the lab frame, the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, the second (mass 3m) at 0.5c. So from the second astronaut's frame, what's the speed of the first?

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let's clarify. The problem asks for the relative speed. Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, from the perspective of the astronaut moving at 0.5c (let's call him B), the other astronaut A (0.6c) would have a relative speed. So using the formula, u is 0.6c (A's speed in lab), v is 0.5c (B's speed). So the relative speed is (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² ). Let me compute that.

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately. Numerator: 0.1c. Denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/c² )= 1-0.3=0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. That looks like one of the options.

Now for the total energy. Hmm, each astronaut has rest mass energy plus kinetic energy. Wait no, in relativity, the total energy is the sum of their relativistic energies. So for each, energy E is gamma multiplied by m c². But wait, each has their own mass. So for astronaut 1 (mass 2m, speed 0.6c): gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8=1.25. So E1 =2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 m c².

Astronaut 2: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 -0.25)=1/sqrt(0.75)= around 1.1547. So E2 =3m * 1.1547 c² ≈ 3.464m c².

Adding them: 2.5 +3.464 =5.964 m c², which is approximately 5.96 mc². So that would match option C, which says E=5.96 mc² and v_rel=0.14c.

Wait, but let me double-check the velocity. I used (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²) which gives (0.6c -0.5c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) = 0.1c/(1-0.3) = 0.1c/0.7 ≈0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So that part looks right.

So the options, let's check. Option C is v_rel=0.14c
