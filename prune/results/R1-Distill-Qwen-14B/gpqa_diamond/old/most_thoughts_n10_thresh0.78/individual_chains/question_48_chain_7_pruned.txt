Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I need to find out how many distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The structure is a six-membered ring with one oxygen as a ketone group.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine. Wait, bromine in what conditions? I think when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's probably an addition reaction. Oh, right! The ketone undergoes a halogenation, maybe a bromohydrin formation? Or wait, no, cyclohexanone is treated with aqueous bromineâ€”oh, that's the haloform reaction? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation? Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening. No, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, which is less reactive than, say, alkenes. Oh wait, no, when cyclohexanone reacts with bromine (like Br2), it's a bromination, but where? Wait, another thought: perhaps it's an enolate formation. Or maybe the reaction is a diaddition.

Wait, wait, think again. Cyclohexanone contains a carbonyl group. When it's treated with bromine (like in a solution such as aqueous or maybe in a different solvent), perhaps it's a 1,2-addition. So bromine adds to the carbonyl, making a diastereomeric dibromide? Hmm, but wait, I think I'm confusing it with something else. Maybe the actual reaction is different. Oh! Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. When treated with Br2 under certain conditions, such as in a solvent like aqueous NaOH, it might undergo a ring-opening. But wait, that's more like the haloform reaction when there are methyl ketones. Alternatively, perhaps the first step is an epoxidation. Wait, no, that's for alkenes.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. So, reacting a ketone with bromine. Another thought: maybe it's a bromination via some other mechanism. Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a nucleophilic addition. For example, in a ketone, bromide could add to the carbonyl. But wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination of the cyclohexane ring. But wait, cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a carbonyl group, which is deactivating, so the ring is less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So maybe bromine isn't adding to the ring but the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe the first reaction is a bromohydrin formation. So, cyclohexanone plus Br2 in a basic or acidic condition. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. Oh, wait, no, dihydroxylation is for alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction conditions. The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine. I think that when a ketone like
