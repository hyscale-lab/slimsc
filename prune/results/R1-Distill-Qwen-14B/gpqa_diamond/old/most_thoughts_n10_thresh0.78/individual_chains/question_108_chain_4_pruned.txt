Okay, so I have this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that we have a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's 1 Tesla. Also, m is small, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. We need to compare the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I assume is the paramagnetic term) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, given a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers.

First, I remember that in atoms, the energy levels are quantized. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula. The transition energy ΔE is related to the photon's energy when an electron moves between energy levels. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 μm, which I think corresponds to the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line. Let me recall the Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m^-1. 

So, the energy of the photon emitted or absorbed during a transition is E = hc/λ. Let me compute that. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters.

Calculating E_photon: E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9). Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 is about 1.9878e-25. Divided by 486.1e-9 meters gives 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.088e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, hydrogen's energy levels are usually on the order of eV. Let me convert that to eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J, so E_photon is about 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE is around 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism arises due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for this interaction is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (about 2 for electrons), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. So m is the orbital magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. For small m, like m=1 or m=0, the term would vary. But I think the expectation value of H would be proportional to m. Hmm, but for the energy levels, the expectation value would be the average energy shift due to this term.

Wait, the question is about the expectation value ⟨H⟩ of the paramagnetic term compared to ΔE. So I need to calculate ⟨H⟩, which is the energy shift due to the magnetic field.

The paramagnetic term in the Hamiltonian is H = μ_B * B * m * g. Wait, the formula might be ⟨H⟩ = μ_B * B * m, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think: the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = g μ_B m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So the energy is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, the dot product would be μ_z * B. So H = -μ_z B = -g μ_B m B.

Wait, no, because μ is a vector, and B is along Oz, so it's just μ_z B. So H = μ_z B, but I might have to include the sign correctly. So the expectation value is the energy shift which is <H> = μ_B * B * m * g, but perhaps I should think of it as μ_B * B * m multiplied by some factor.

Wait, more accurately, the Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B. The magnetic moment μ for an electron is μ = -g μ_B S / ħ, where S is the spin angular momentum. Wait, no, I'm getting confused between orbital and spin. Oh wait, the orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e)) * L, where L is the angular momentum. The Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), approximately 9.27e-24 J/T.

But wait, the problem says it's the paramagnetic coupling term. Paramagnetism is due to the electron's orbital and spin angular momentum. But in this case, since B is applied, the coupling is H = -μ · B, where μ is the magnetic moment, which could be orbital, spin, or both. But for hydrogen, the ground state has l=0, so the orbital contribution is zero. So maybe the paramagnetic term here is due to spin. Wait no, for higher orbitals, l>0, m can be non-zero. But the problem states m is small, perhaps implying that m is zero? Or that it's a state with small m, like m=1, but perhaps for higher n or l, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, the question says "small values of m", so m is small, perhaps in absolute terms like m=0 or m=1. So the paramagnetic term would be on the order of μ_B * B * m. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic term is the perturbation, and we're looking at the energy shift due to this perturbation. So the expectation value ⟨H⟩ would be μ_B * B * m, but perhaps scaled by the Lande g-factor.

Wait, for the hydrogen atom, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula, and the fine structure comes into play when considering relativistic effects and spin-orbit coupling. But the paramagnetic term here is a separate effect due to the external magnetic field. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the Zeeman effect.

Ah, right! The Zeeman effect is the splitting of spectral lines due to the presence of a magnetic field. The energy shift is given by ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. But wait, the actual formula is ΔE = g_j μ_B B m, where g_j is the Landé g-factor for the state. For hydrogen, the ground state (n=1) has l=0, so m=0, and the g-factor is 1. So for states with higher l, m can be non-zero.

Wait, but the problem states m is small, so perhaps m=0 or m=1. Let's think for m=1, then ΔE_Zeeman is μ_B * B * m. Let's compute this.

μ_B is approximately 9.27e-24 J/T. B is 1 T, m=1. So ΔE = 9.27e-24 J/T * 1 T * 1 = 9.27e-24 J. 

To convert J to eV, since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 9.27e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = roughly 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but earlier I found that the transition energy ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is much smaller than ΔE (which is 2.55 eV). So the paramagnetic term is much less than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure if I'm considering the right m. The question says m is small, so perhaps m=0, which would give zero. But if m is 1, it's 5.8e-5 eV. So in either case, the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy ΔE.

So the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. So the correct option would be C) ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

μB = 9.27e-24 J/T. So for m=1, B=1 T, the energy shift is
