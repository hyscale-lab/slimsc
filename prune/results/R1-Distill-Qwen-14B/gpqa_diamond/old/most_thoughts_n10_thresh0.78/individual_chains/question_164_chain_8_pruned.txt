Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The question says that there are two binary systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. So the orbital period of system_1 is twice as long as system_2's. 

The next part talks about radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. Wait, radial velocity amplitude refers to how much each star moves towards and away from us, right? 

I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star would cause the less massive one to orbit it. So the more massive star would have a smaller velocity because it's heavier. Like, if two objects orbit each other, the less massive one moves more. So in system_1, the 10 km/s star is probably the less massive one, and 5 km/s is the more massive. But wait, the problem says to consider the mass of the system as the sum of both, so maybe I don't need to worry about individual masses right now.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So I need to find (mass of system_1) / (mass of system_2).

I think the key here is Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the masses of the stars. Oh, right, the formula for the binary system's period is given by:

P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³

Wait, but another approach might be using the radial velocity method. I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula for K is something like:

K = [ (2π G) / (P c) ]^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

But wait, in this case, each star's velocity is measured. So for a binary system, each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the center of mass must be stationary. So the ratio of velocities is M2/M1.

Wait, yes
