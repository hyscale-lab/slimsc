Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about reacting a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate. The compound given is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. I need to find out what product forms when it's reacted with Me2CuLi.

First, what do I remember about epoxide reactions with organocuprates? I think organocuprates are strong nucleophiles, often used in conjugate additions or as reagents in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Wait, yes, when epoxides react with cuprates, they typically undergo a ring-opening via a nucleophilic attack.

The question mentions that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile (Nu) adds. Also, the alkyl group from the cuprate is added to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. So the first thing I need to do is figure out which carbon is less hindered.

The given molecule is a bicyclic epoxide. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane suggests a norbornane structure. The substituents are at carbons 1, 3, 4, and 6. Wait, wait, the structure is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, so the oxygen is part of the ring as an epoxide. So the epoxide is in the bridge structure.

Wait, the structure: the bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has two rings. The bridgehead is at positions 1 and 6? Or maybe 1 and 5? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it out mentally. Let me think: bicyclo[m.n.p] has the bridgeheads at positions 1, m+p+1, etc. Maybe I should look for the exact structure.

Alternatively, maybe I can imagine the epoxide as part of a norbornene-like structure but with an oxygen bridge. So the epoxide is the bridge between two carbons, making a three-membered ring. The positions are 1,3,4,6 substituted with methyl groups.

Wait, the compound is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the numbering is such that the oxygen is at position 7, which is part of the bridge. Let me think of the structure: the bicyclo system has bridge lengths of 4, 1, and 0. So the main bridge is four carbons, another bridge is one carbon, and the third bridge is a single bridge (maybe
