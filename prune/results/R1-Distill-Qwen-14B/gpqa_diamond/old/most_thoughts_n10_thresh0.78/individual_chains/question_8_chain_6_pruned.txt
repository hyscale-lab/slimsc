Okay, so I'm trying to answer this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: We're looking at three genes, G1, G2, and G3, which are involved in resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They created knock-out mutants for each gene, and also double mutants. The resistance levels are given for each mutant and the double mutants.

The goal is to figure out the functional relationships between these genes, especially considering that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

So, the results I have are:

- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild-type)
- g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

Hmm, so the wild-type is 100%, so higher numbers mean more resistance. Lower numbers mean more susceptibility.

I remember that in genetics, when looking at epistasis, the idea is that the effect of one gene is dependent on another. So if the double mutant's phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, that suggests that gene is epistatic.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then the phenotype of the double mutant (A and B knocked out) would resemble the phenotype of the A single mutant. Because A is upstream, perhaps. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, I think if gene A is epistatic to gene B, meaning that the pathway is like A → B → phenotype. So if A is knocked out, the pathway is blocked regardless of B. So in that case, the double mutant (A and B both knocked out) would have the same phenotype as the A single mutant. Because without A, B isn't doing anything anyway.

So looking at the data, let's see which double mutants' phenotypes match which single mutants.

Double mutant g1g2's resistance is 0%, same as G2 single mutant (g2: 0%). So that suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when both are knocked out, the resistance is as bad as when G2 is knocked out. So G2 is acting upstream of G1, perhaps.

Similarly, the g2g3 double mutant is 0%, same as g2. So again, G2 is epistatic to G3.

What about g1g3? The resistance is 10%, which is worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%). So that's worse than either of the single mutants. How does that fit into the model?

Let me think about the possible models.

The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So one of these genes is a TF, which is a regulatory gene. So the other genes are perhaps downstream targets.

Looking at the data, G2 single mutant is completely susceptible. So without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all. That suggests G2 is essential for resistance. Because when G2 is knocked out, resistance drops to 0%.

In the double mutants involving G2, the resistance is also 0%, which makes sense if G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. So G2 might be a transcription factor activating G1 and G3. Without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can be expressed, so the resistance is gone.

Wait, but let's look at the other data points. The g1 single mutant has 75% resistance. So it's less than wild-type but not completely gone. So G1 contributes to resistance but isn't the only factor. Maybe G2 is the main one, and G1 contributes some additional resistance.

G3 single mutant is 50% resistance. So it's contributing some but not as much as G1.

Now, the double mutant g1g3 has 10
