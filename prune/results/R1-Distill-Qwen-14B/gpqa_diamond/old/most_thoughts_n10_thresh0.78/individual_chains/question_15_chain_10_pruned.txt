Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet the researchers should prioritize observing for transits. Both planets are Earth-like, so they have similar sizes, but their host stars and orbital periods are different. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the relative sizes of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit. But since both planets are Earth-like and their host stars have the same radius, maybe the planet-to-star size ratio is the same. Wait, but their host stars have the same radii even though the masses are different. Oh, right, the stars are same radius but different masses. So maybe the planet's size compared to the star is the same for both, but wait, Earth's radius is about the same. Hmm, but wait, the actual formula for transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2, where R_p is planet radius and R_s is star radius. But if R_s is the same for both stars, and R_p is same (since both are Earth-like), then the (R_p/R_s) term is same for both. So the probability depends on another factor.

Wait, but wait, the other factor is the orbital inclination. The probability is also related to the size of the star and the planet's orbital distance. Oh, right, the transit probability is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on. But since the planets are detected via the RV method, their orbits are already known to be in the plane of the sky, but I'm not sure. Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is most effective when the planet's orbit is edge-on because the Doppler shift is maximum. But wait, no, actually, the RV method can detect planets even if the orbit isn't perfectly edge-on, but the minimum mass is determined. Maybe the inclination affects the RV measurements. Hmm, but for the transit probability, it's the geometric probability, which is the chance that the planet's orbit passes in front of the star from our point of view. 

Wait, the transit probability
