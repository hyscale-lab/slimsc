Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with chirality, right? Chiral molecules are those that are not superimposable on their mirror images, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds show this kind of isomerism.

The options given are four different organic compounds, and I need to figure out which ones are chiral. Let's go through each one step by step.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: Okay, the name is a bit complicated, but let's break it down. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, with dimethyl ester groups and nitro groups at 6 and 6'. So, each ring has two substituents: a nitro and a methyl ester group. Wait, but wait—the arrangement might create a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, there might not be a chiral center. Let me visualize this. The biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', so the rings are directly attached. The substituents at 2 and 2' are both ester groups, and 6 and 6' are nitro. So the arrangement might be symmetric. Wait, but if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical, then perhaps there's a chiral center. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the central bond is a single bond, which could allow for rotation, but in biphenyls, sometimes the substituents can create a chiral environment. Wait, is there a chiral center here? Let me think: each ester group is at 2 and 2', but each is on a different ring. The nitro groups are at 6 and 6', same positions on each ring. So each ring is substituted at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, but each ring has two substituents—each ring has a nitro and an ester. So for each ring, the substituents are in positions 2 and 6, which are across from each other. The structure of each benzene ring is symmetrical regarding these substituents. But the biphenyl group as a whole—does that create any chiral centers? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry, making it not chiral. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe the molecule isn't chiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. If that's the case
