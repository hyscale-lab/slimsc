Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a reaction where a compound ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene is reacted with hydrogen bromide (HBr). After some time, the researcher checked with TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to figure out which of the given options is correct for the products.

Hmm, first I should figure out what the starting material looks like. The structure is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me break that down. The benzene ring has an ether group (oxy) attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. Butenyl is a four-carbon chain with a double bond. The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, let me draw that. So the substituent is CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2- but where's the double bond? Oh wait, but-3-en-1-yl. So the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but wait, butenyl has four carbons. So numbering starts from the end attached to the oxygen. So structure is: OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, but in but-3-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2CH2CH=CH2 but that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. Let me think again.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that's five carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's count: butenyl is four carbons. So for but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, that would be the third and fourth? Hmm, but four carbons only go up to 4. Wait, but the but
