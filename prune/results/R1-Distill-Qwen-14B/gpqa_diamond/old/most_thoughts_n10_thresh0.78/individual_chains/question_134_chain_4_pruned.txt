Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and strong bases, but I'm not sure if that applies here since the problem gives specific concentrations and volumes. Oh wait, right, the problem isn't giving me the standard value; I have to calculate it based on the given amounts.

The reactants are HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Wait, mixing all three together? I'm a bit confused. Oh, maybe some of them will react with each other. Let me see.

So, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but wait, H2SO4 is diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when these are mixed, the HCl and H2SO4 will react with the Ba(OH)2. But wait, what's the reaction here?

Wait, but HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, so I think the base Ba(OH)2 will neutralize both. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Hmm, so I need to figure out how much each acid contributes to the H+ and how much the base can neutralize.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Its formula is Ba(OH)2, which dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides two moles of OH^-.

So, the neutralization reaction is between H+ ions (from acids) and OH^- ions from the base.

So, let me first calculate the moles of each H+ and OH^-.

First, find moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = Molarity * Volume = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. So HCl gives 0.1 moles of H+.

Next, H2SO4. Volume is 300 mL, which is 0.3 L. Molarity is 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+. So 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2. Volume is 200 mL, 0.2 L. Molarity is 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^- (since formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2 OH^-). So moles of OH^- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

Total OH^- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.2 moles.

Now, in neutralization, H+ + OH^- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here is OH^- because we have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH^-.

Wait,
