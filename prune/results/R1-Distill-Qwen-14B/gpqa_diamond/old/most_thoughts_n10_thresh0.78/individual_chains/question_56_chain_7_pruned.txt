Okay, so I have this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options give different transition routes and probabilities. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions involve the emission or absorption of a photon, and the selection rules for the quantum numbers n, l, m are important here.

The selection rules for a dipole transition are typically:
- Δl = ±1 (the orbital angular momentum changes by one unit)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1)
- Δn can be any integer, but in multi-photon transitions, it's the cumulative change that matters.

Wait, but here it's a two-step process because the transition happens in two steps. So from 3,0,0, it goes to an intermediate state, then to 1,0,0.

Let me think about the possible transitions. Starting from n=3, l=0, m=0.

First transition: |3,0,0> → something. Since it's a dipole transition, Δl must be ±1. So l=0 can go to l=1 or l=-1, but since l can't be negative, it must go to l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1.

So the first transition must go to a state with l=1. Possible m values for l=1 are -1, 0, +1.

So the possible first steps are to |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>, but wait, n has to decrease by one each time? Not necessarily. Because in two steps, n can decrease by two. So from n=3, in two steps, each step can decrease n by 1 or more? Wait, but dipole transitions typically have Δn = ±1. So each step should change n by ±1. But in this case, the starting state is n=3 and the end is n=1, so two steps each decreasing n by 1.

So first step: n=3 → n=2, then n=2 → n=1. So the first transition is 3→2, second is 2→1.

So in the first transition, moving from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1. So the first state must be |2,1, m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the intermediate state could be |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>, or |2,1,-1>.

Then, the second transition from that state to |1,0,0>.

So, for the second transition, from l=1 to l=0. That's allowed because Δl can be ±1. Also, for m, the change must be such that m_final - m_initial is 0, ±1.

So let me consider each option's transition:

Option A: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0. Then probability is 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0.

Option D: The first part is not clear here. The option says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> and probability 2/3.

Wait, but my notes say that the transition probability in such cases depends on the square of the matrix elements, and the possible m transitions.

I think the selection rules for m are that m can change by 0, +1, or -1 in each transition.

So let's evaluate each option.

Looking at the first transition from |3,0,0> to the intermediate state |n1, l1, m1>.

Only possible l1 is 1, and n1 is 2.

So for the first transition, the intermediate state is |2,1, m>, m can be -1, 0, +1.

The second transition must go from |2,1, m1> to |1,0,0>.

So, for the second transition, l changes from 1 to 0, which is allowed (Δl = -1). m must change from m1 to 0. So the change in m, Δm = -m1.

Since Δm can be 0, ±1, m1 must be 0, 1, or -1.

Wait, because the change in
