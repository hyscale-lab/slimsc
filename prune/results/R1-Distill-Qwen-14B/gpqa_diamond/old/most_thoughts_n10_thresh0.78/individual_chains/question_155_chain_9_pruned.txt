Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to figure this out step by step.

Alright, the problem states that we have an operator P which has components Px, Py, and Pz. The matrices for each are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). We need to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

Wait, the uncertainty in Pz would be the square root of the variance of Pz in this state, right? Oh right, the formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

So first, I need to find the expectation values ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩.

But wait, how do I compute the expectation value of Pz? Well, the expectation value is the bra-ket product ⟨ψ| Pz |ψ⟩. Since the given state is a column vector, I can represent it as |ψ⟩ and do the matrix multiplication.

Let me write down the given state vector. It's a 3x1 column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

The matrix for Pz is given as:
Pz = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ] ].

Wait, so when I compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's ψ† Pz ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose.
