Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best. So, the question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm.

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, and when it's dissolved in a strong acid, it should react completely. The reaction should produce iron(III) ions and water. Wait, what's the formula for Fe(OH)3? Oh right, it's Fe(OH)3. So when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, it should form Fe^3+ and water. Let me write that equation.

The reaction would be Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O. Yeah, that looks right. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl to completely dissolve it.

Now, the problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to find out how many moles that is. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would be... let's see, Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So each OH group is 17 g/mol, and there are three of them. So 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 moles. Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately. 0.1 / 106.85 is about 0.0009358. Yeah, rounded to maybe 0.000936 moles.

Since the reaction uses 3 moles of HCl per mole of Fe(OH)3, the HCl needed is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 moles. Okay.

The HCl solution is 0.1 M (monobasic strong acid, so concentration is 0.1 mol/L). We need to find the volume of this solution that contains 0.002808 moles. The formula is moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So Volume = moles / Molarity.

So Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options
