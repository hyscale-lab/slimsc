Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that both of these are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, maybe exoplanets or stellar spectroscopy.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties: RA (Right Ascension), DEC (Declination), magnitudes, distances, and some have color excess which affects their apparent brightness. The task is to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

Wait, the key here is their apparent V magnitude. Because both spectrographs have limits on how bright the stars need to be for observation. The problem states that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17, and HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So a star must have an apparent V mag ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES) because they can observe brighter than those magnitudes.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the problem says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", meaning that if a star's apparent V is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, for HIRES, stars brighter than 16 mag (so apparent V ≤16) can be observed.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, magnitude is a bit counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, if a spectrograph can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that's all stars with V ≤17. So for ESPRESSO, stars up to V=17 are detectable. Similarly, HIRES can go up to V=16.

So a star must have V ≤16 to be detected by HIRES, which is a stricter condition than ESPRESSO (since 16 is brighter than 17). So the same star has to be bright enough for both, which means it must have V ≤16. Because if a star is V=17, it's too faint for HIRES. So only stars with V ≤16 can be detected by both.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the other way around. Let me think. For a star to be detectable by both, it needs to be within the brightness range of both. So, the maximum apparent V mag is the lower of the two. Because, for HIRES, the limit is V ≤16, and for ESPRESSO, V ≤17. So any star with V ≤16 would be detectable by both. But a star with V=17 could be seen by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Let me rephrase. To be detected by both instruments, the star's V magnitude must be ≤17 (since ESPRESSO can go up to 17) and also ≤16 (since HIRES can only go
