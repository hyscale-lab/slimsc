Okay, so I have this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, two stars, star_1 and star_2. The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2's. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. 

I remember that in LTE, the distribution of particles in different energy levels follows the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy states. The formula is something like n2/n1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, wait. Wait, no, the question says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So I think that refers to the population of a higher energy level compared to the lower one. Let me clarify: suppose E1 and E2 are two energy levels, with E2 higher than E1. The excitation is the population in E2 relative to E1.

So for star_1, n2/n1 = 2. For star_2, n2/n1 = let's say x. But wait, does the question mean that star_1 has twice the excitation of star_2? That would mean the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So, n2_1 / n1_1 = 2 * (n2_2 / n1_2).

Wait no, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the excitation refers to the ratio of the excited state to the ground state. Let me think: so if star_1 has twice the excitation, then its (n2/n1) is twice that of star_2's (n2/n1). So for star_1, the ratio is 2 times star_2's. Or wait, no—maybe star_1's ratio is twice as much as star_2's ratio. Let me write that down.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 = n2/n1 for star_1, and R2 = n2/n1 for star_2. According to the question, R1 = 2 * R2.

But wait, if the question is that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited, perhaps it's that the number in the excited state is twice as much as in star_2's. Or maybe the ratio is higher. Wait, actually, the problem states "twice as excited in a specific energy level." So perhaps the excitation refers to the ratio of excited to ground state. So for star_1, R1 is twice that of star_2's R2. So R1 = 2 * R2.

But then, according to the Boltzmann equation, R = exp(-ΔE/(k T)). So R for each star would be R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

So if R1 = 2 * R2, then exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). 

Hmm, let me write that out.

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

Take the natural logarithm of both sides.

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2)).

Rearrange terms.

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) ) = ln(2).

So, [1/T2 - 1/T1 ] = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, let me think about the signs. Because the equation is:

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

Because when I factor, I have (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) multiplied by ΔE/k.

Wait, perhaps I should re-arrange the earlier equation.

Let me take the equation again:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2).

Factor ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2).

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = [ ln(2) * k ] / ΔE.

Wait, but the question gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. Let me compute that.

Wait, but I don't know if I need to compute the actual temperatures; the question is about the equation between T1 and T2.

So let's think about the options. The equation should involve ln(2) equals something involving T1 and T2.

Looking at the options, which one can fit the equation we derived.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (ln(2) * k ) / (ΔE).

But the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, wait, 1.38 is approximately k (Boltzmann's constant is about 1.38e-23 J/K). Oh! So ΔE is approximately equal to k, because 1.38e-23 is about k's value. So ΔE ≈ k.

If ΔE is approximately k, then (ln(2) * k ) / ΔE ≈ (ln 2 * k ) / k = ln(2).

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Wait, but wait, no, let me compute that again. If ΔE is approximately equal to k, then (ln 2 * k ) / (ΔE) is (ln 2 * k ) / k ) = ln(2). So yes.

So,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2).

Wait, but that's the same as (1/T2) = (1/T1) + ln(2).

But the question is about the equation that relates T1 and T2. Let me think about rearranging the equation.

From the equation,

1/T2 - 1/T1 = ln(2).

Let me factor the left side.

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

So,

(T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Wait, because 1/T2 -1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2).

Which can be written as ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Looking at the options, option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ). That's exactly what we have.

Wait, but wait, let me look again at the options.

Option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2).

Yes, that's correct.

So the correct equation is option D.


To determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures of the two stars, we start by applying the Boltzmann distribution in the context of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels as:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the higher and lower energy levels, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature of the system.

The problem states that the excitation ratio \(n_2/n_1\) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Denoting the excitation ratios for star_1 and star_2 as \(R_1\) and \(R_2\), respectively, we have:

\[
R_1 = 2 R_2.
\]

Substituting the Boltzmann equation for each star:

\[
R_1 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right), \quad R_2 = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Equating \(R_1 = 2 R_2\), we get:

\[
\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right) = 2 \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1} = \ln(2) - \frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right) = \ln(2).
\]

Factoring out \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\), we can write:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{\ln(2)}{\Delta E / k}.
\]

Given that \(\Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), which is approximately equal to \(k\) (Boltzmann's constant), the equation simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \ln(2).
\]

Rewriting this in terms of \(T_1\) and \(T_2\), we get:

\[
\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} = \ln(2).
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
