Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting from acetic acid and ending up with a product whose NMR spectrum we need to analyze. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the first step: acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I remember that when acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of acetic anhydride and pyridine, it's typically a bromination reaction. Wait, acetic anhydride is a good acetylating agent. Oh right! This is the formation of acetyl bromide. Acetic acid has an -OH group which is a good leaving group, but it's not very reactive. When treated with acetic anhydride, the OH is converted to an acetyloxy group, making it a better leaving group. Then, Br2 in pyridine (which acts as a base) would substitute the leaving group. So the product, product 1, should be acetyl bromide. Structure-wise, that's CH3COBr.

Next step: product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. Oh, that's a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Acetyl bromide reacting with ethanol. CH3COBr plus ethanol in H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is probably acting as a catalyst. Ethanol has a good nucleophile, the ethoxide ion. The bromide leaves, and the ethoxide attacks the carbonyl carbon. Wait, but waitâ€”it's more like an SN2 reaction because the acetyl group is a good leaving group (the bromide is a good leaving group). So the product would be ethyl acetate, CH3COOEt (where Et is CH2CH3). Because when acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacts with ethanol (HOCH2CH2OH), the bromide leaves, and the ethoxide attacks, leading to the formation of ethyl acetate. So product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Third step: product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide (NaCN), forming product 3. Sodium cyanide is a nucleophile. Reacting ethyl acetate with NaCN. Wait, but ethyl acetate is an ester. How does that react with CN-? Hmm. Maybe it's a substitution. The ester oxygen is not very reactive towards nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but under certain conditions, like maybe under basic conditions, could the ester undergo some kind of substitution? Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis. Wait, no. Wait, sodium cyanide is a source of CN-. Maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Oh, right! In the presence of a strong base, like maybe the conditions are basic. Wait, ethyl acetate is an ester, so perhaps the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon. So the
