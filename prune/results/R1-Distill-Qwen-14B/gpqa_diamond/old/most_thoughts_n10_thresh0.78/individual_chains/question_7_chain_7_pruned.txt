Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, right? It's like a background of photons filling the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is γγ → e+e−.

The question is asking at what energy the gamma rays' lifetimes would be limited by this process. The options are all on the order of 1e5 GeV or so, which is really high energy. So I think this has to do with the interaction rate of these gamma rays with the CMB photons.

I remember that the interaction rate is related to the cross-section and the density of the photons they're interacting with. The cross-section σ is a measure of the probability of the interaction happening. The photon density would depend on the CMB's properties.

Wait, the average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. I think the CMB photons have an energy around ~0.001 eV, which is in the microwave range.

So, how do I model this? I think the lifetime τ of the gamma ray is inversely proportional to the interaction rate Γ, which is the product of the cross-section σ, the photon density n, and the relative velocity v between the gamma and the CMB photon. But wait, in the CMB rest frame, the CMB photons are isotropic, so the relative velocity might be considered. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the concept of the optical depth or the mean free path.

The mean lifetime τ is approximately the inverse of the interaction rate: τ ≈ 1/Γ. And the interaction rate Γ is σ * n * v. But wait, in particle physics, the cross-section often is given in terms of c (speed of light) because velocities are a fraction of c. Hmm, maybe v is just beta times c, but when considering units, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the product σ * n * v being in appropriate units.

Alternatively, I might need to use the photon density. Let's see, the CMB photon density n is approximately the critical density times the energy density divided by the average energy per photon. The critical density is about 1e-29 g/cm^3, but wait, maybe I should calculate it properly.

Wait, the energy density of the CMB is known. The CMB has a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The energy density u is given by u = 8π^5 k^4 / (15 h^3 c^3) * (1/T^4), where k is Boltzmann's constant, h is Planck's constant, and c is speed of light.

Alternatively, I think the energy density u is approximately 0.23 eV/cm^3, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Or maybe it's better to compute it from the temperature.

Alternatively, the number density of CMB photons is about n = 411 photons/cm^3. Wait, I remember that the number density of CMB photons is roughly n ≈ 411 cm^-3, but I'm not certain. Let me think again. The average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, and the energy density u = n * ⟨E⟩. So if I can find u, I can get n.

The energy density of the CMB is also written as u = (8π^5 k^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) * (1/(T^4)) * (1/( (11/2) )) approximately. Wait, no, the exact factor depends on the photon energy distribution. But perhaps for this problem, I can use the known energy density of the CMB.

Wait, I think the CMB's energy density is about 0.23 nanoerg per cubic cm, which is 0.23e-9 erg/cm^3. Since 1 eV is about 1.6e-12 erg, 0.23e-9 erg/cm^3 is about 0.23e-9 / 1.6e-12 ≈ 143 eV/cm^3. Wait, that can't be right because the average photon energy is 1e-3 eV, so if u = n * ⟨E⟩, then n = u / ⟨E⟩ = (143 eV/cm^3) / (0.001 eV) = 1.43e5 photons/cm^3. But I thought n was about 411 photons/cm^3. Hmm, maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: I think the number density n of CMB photons is given by the formula n = (8π^5 k^4)/(15 h^3 c^3) (1/(T^4)) ) * (1/⟨E⟩). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to calculate n as the photon number density.

The photon number density is given by n = (2) * (8π k T)^{3/2} / (h^3 c^3) ) * (1/(h c k T / (2π k T)) )) Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the standard formula for photon number density in a blackbody.

The photon number density is n = (8π)/(h^3 c^3) * ∫ (x^2)/(e^x - 1) dx from 0 to infinity. The integral evaluates to (π^4/15), so n = (8π) * (π^4/15) / (h^3 c^3) ) * (k T)^3.

Wait, more accurately, the number density is n = (8π/(h^3 c^3)) * ∫ (E^2)/(e^{E/(kT)} - 1) dE from 0 to ∞.

Let me plug in the constants. Let me use E = h f = h c / λ. But perhaps it's easier to make a substitution x = E/(k T), so x = (h c)/(λ k T), and dE = k T dx.

Then, the integral becomes ∫ ( (x k T)^2 ) / (e^x -1) ) k T dx from 0 to ∞.

So ∫ x^2 (k^2 T^2) / (e^x
