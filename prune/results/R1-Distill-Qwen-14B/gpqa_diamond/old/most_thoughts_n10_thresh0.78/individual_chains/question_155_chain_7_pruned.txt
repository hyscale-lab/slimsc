Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see... The question is about finding the uncertainty in P_z for a given state. 

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable, like P_z, is given by the square root of the expectation value of (P_z squared) minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So the formula is ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). But wait, the basis vectors here are the eigenvectors of P_z, right? So, the state is expressed in the P_z basis.

I think I need to compute the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for this state. 

But wait, the state is already given as a vector in the P_z basis, which is the computational basis here. So, maybe I don't have to change the basis. 

Let me write down the matrix for P_z. It's diagonal, according to the problem statement. The matrix is:

[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So, it's a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ in the diagonal. The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2 ]^T.

To find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute the expectation value of P_z in this state. That's ψ† P_z ψ.

So, let's calculate that. The expectation value is the sum over i of ψ_i* * (P_z)_ii * ψ_i. Since the matrix is diagonal, the off-diagonal terms contribute nothing. 

So, the diagonal elements are (ħ, 0, -ħ). The components of ψ are (a, b, c) = (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2).

So, ⟨P_z⟩ = a* * ħ * a + b* * 0 * b + c* * (-ħ) * c.

Since all the components are real here (I think), this simplifies to:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ + (0) + ( ( -1/2 )^2 ) * (-ħ )

So, each term:

First term: (1/4) ħ
Third term: (1/4)(-ħ) = - (1/4) ħ

Adding them: (1/4 - 1/4) ħ = 0.

So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero. That's interesting. So the average of P_z is zero.

Now, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z squared is just the square of the diagonal elements, so (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2.

So, (P_z²)_ii = ħ², 0, ħ².

So, ⟨P_z²⟩ = a² * ħ² + b² * 0 + c² * ħ².

Again, with a = -1/2, c = -1/2, so a² = c² = 1/4. 

So:

⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4) * ħ² + (1/4) * ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = ħ² / 2.

So putting it all together, the variance is ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩)^2 = (ħ²/2) - 0 = ħ²/2.

Therefore, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ħ²/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

The state vector is [-1/2, 1/sqrt
