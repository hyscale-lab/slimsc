Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I need to figure out which compound it is among the four options given. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives the 1H NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate.

Hmm. So first, I should probably draw the structures of each of these compounds to understand where the protons are.

Wait, let me start by recalling the structures. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, wait. The ester is R-O-CO-O-R', but for an acetate, the R' is an acetyl group, so it's OAc-O-R, where R is the alkenyl group in this case.

Wait, actually, the acetate ester is usually written as R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait no, wait. No, acetate is OAc, which is O(CO)OCH3. So in this case, the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure more accurately. Oh wait, no, acetate is the ester of acetic acid. So the structure is R-OAc, so R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no. Wait, acetic acid is CH3COOH, so the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. No, the acetate ester is R-O-CO-O-R', where R' is the acetylium part. Wait, actually, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me get this straight.

The acetate group is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. So when you have an ester, like R-O-CO-O-R', but in this case, because it's an acetate, R' is CH3. So the est
