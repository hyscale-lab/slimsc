Okay, so I need to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. The setup is that the person created a transgenic mouse model where they're trying to overexpress the GADD45G gene under an inducible promoter. They modified the gene by adding a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. Then they transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies to test expression.

But when they started, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. They looked at the plus strand sequence of their construct and noticed something. Hmm, I need to figure out what's wrong with the sequence.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. So, if the HA sequence is messed up, maybe it's not expressed properly. But wait, the issue here is overexpression, not the HA function. But if the HA isn't there, maybe the purification (affinity) wouldn't work. But the problem is overexpression, not the function of HA.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would mean a premature stop codon. If there's a stop codon in the mRNA before the actual protein, the ribosome would stop early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all. So I should look for any in-frame stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA) in the coding sequence.

Option C: No linker causing proteolysis. Without a linker, maybe the protein is getting degraded. But the issue is overexpression; if the protein isn't expressed, it's not about degradation. Unless the construct isn't making the protein at all. Alternatively, maybe the lack of a linker affects the proper folding or recognition, but I'm not sure that's the main issue here.

Option D: tRNA for UAA doesn't exist in mouse. Wait, UAA is a stop codon. If the construct introduces a UAA somewhere, but the mouse doesn't have a tRNA for it, that might lead to termination. Wait, no, all standard stop codons are recognized by release factors, regardless of tRNA. Because stop codons don't have tRNAs; they're recognized by release factors that cause the ribosome to terminate. So D might not be the issue.

So, looking back at the sequence provided. Let me check the DNA sequence for any premature stop codons.

The given sequence is the coding strand, so it's the same as the mRNA (except T instead of U). Let me scan for TAA, TAG, or TGA, which are stop codons in DNA (since mRNA has UAA, UAG, UGA).

Let me go through the sequence:

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Looking at the sequence:

5' ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTC GGA AGA GTC GCC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GGA AAG CGC TGC ATG AGT TGC TGC TGC TGC CGC AGC GTC AGG GCT GCG CTA CTC GGC GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTC GTG TGC TGC TGG CTC GCG GTC GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC CGC CTT GCA GAT CCA TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG CAG GAA CGC CAT CGA CAT AGT GCG CGT GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA 3'

I'll look for TAA, TAG, TGA in triplets.

Starting from the beginning:

ATG → methionine (start)
TAC → tyrosine
CCC → proline
ATA → isoleucine
CGA → arginine
TGT → cysteine
TCC → serine
AGA → arginine
TTA → leucine (but wait, TTA is a stop codon in DNA? No, in DNA, TTA would be a codon for leucine in mRNA as UUA. Wait, but in DNA, the plus strand is the coding strand, which when transcribed to mRNA, would have U's. So TTA in DNA is UUA in mRNA, which codes for leucine. So TTA is not a stop codon.

Wait, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Let me go through each triplet.

... CTG ATG AGT ... (CTG is leucine, ATG is methionine, AGT is serine)

Then TGC TGC TGC → all Cys.

Then, looking further down, I see:

... CCG CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA ...

Wait, I'm looking for TAA, TAG, TGA.

Wait, I see a TGA in the sequence? Let's check:

Looking at the end:

... ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA 3'

So the last part is ... GAG TGA 3'.

So the triplet before that is CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA.

Wait, the last part is ... GAG TGA. So the triplet is GAG TGA.

Wait, wait: in the DNA, the strand is 5' ... GAG TGA ... So the mRNA would be CUU UAA.

Wait, wait, the coding strand is the same as mRNA, except T becomes U.

So the DNA sequence is ... GAG TGA ...

So the mRNA would be ...GAG becomes GAG (but mRNA uses U, so GAG is GAG. Wait, no: DNA has T, mRNA has U.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The coding strand is the same as mRNA. So the DNA is 5' ATG ... GAG TGA ... 3' (the plus strand). So mRNA would be 5' ATG ... GAG UAA ... 3'. So the mRNA will have UAA, which is a stop codon.

So the sequence has a UAA in the mRNA. That is, the DNA has TGA at the end.

Looking at the sequence, the last few codons are:

... GAG TGA 3'

So the mRNA would be GAG UAA. So UAA is a stop codon, which would terminate translation early.

So the construct introduces a stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, before the actual end. That would cause the ribosome to stop, leading to a truncated or no protein being produced.

So why is there a TGA there? The construct is supposed to have the coding sequence for GADD45G with an HA tag at the N-terminus. But in the given sequence, the TGA occurs before the end, which would cause the premature stop.

So the issue is that the construct has a premature stop codon (UAA in mRNA) in the middle of the coding region, leading to early termination. So the protein isn't overexpressed because it's not being made properly.

So looking back at the options, option B says "The ribosome terminated the translation early." That would be the case if there's a premature stop codon in the sequence.

Wait, but the given DNA has TGA at the end. Wait, no, the last part is GAG TGA. Wait, the DNA sequence is 5'...GAG TGA 3'. That would correspond to mRNA as GAG UAA. So UAA is a stop codon.

So the problem is that the construct has a stop codon in the middle. So why is that happening?

Wait, the person modified the gene by adding the HA sequence. Perhaps the HA sequence introduced an in-frame stop codon. Or maybe during the cloning, the sequence was messed up.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag was inserted in a way that introduced a stop codon. But looking at the sequence, the HA tag is at the N-terminus. The HA sequence is probably right after the ATG start codon.

Wait, the first part of the sequence is ATG TAC, which is the start codon (ATG) followed by TAC (tyrosine), which would be the HA tag. So the HA sequence comes right after the start.

So the HA tag is correctly added, but the problem is the premature stop codon at the end, which is GAG TGA in the DNA.

Wait, but the given sequence ends with ...GAG TGA 3'. So that's the last part. So the mRNA would have ...GAG UAA, which is a stop. So the construct includes a stop codon in the middle, making the protein shorter than expected. Or, wait, maybe the construct is correct and the stop is at the end.

Wait, perhaps the construct includes the full coding sequence, but in the given sequence, the TGA is the actual stop codon at
