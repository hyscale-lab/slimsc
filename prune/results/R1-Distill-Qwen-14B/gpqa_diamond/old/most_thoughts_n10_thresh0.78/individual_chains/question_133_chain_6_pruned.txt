Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is H3PO4, but in solution, it dissociates. The problem gives us the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Hmm, so these are the dissociation constants.

I remember that in buffer solutions, when you have a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. But wait, what's happening here? KH2PO4 is K+ H2PO4^-; Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- plus water. So, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution.

I think this is a buffer solution because we have two species from the same acid (H3PO4) at consecutive dissociation steps. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, so their concentrations would determine the pH of the solution.

So, first, I should calculate the concentrations of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O in the solution. Then, use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH, and from that, determine the concentration of the orthophosphate ion, which is PO4^3-.

Wait, but orthophosphate is the deprotonated form beyond HPO4^2-. So, the PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation of H3PO4: HPO4^2- → PO4^3- +
