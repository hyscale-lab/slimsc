Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out. Hmm. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². I remember that in an isotropic 3D harmonic oscillator, the potential depends on the radial distance r, and the energy levels are quantized.

Wait, the question asks about the third excited state's energy and how many eigenfunctions correspond to the same energy. Right, so I need to find the energy value and the degeneracy (the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy).

First, let's recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. Each degree of freedom (x, y, z) contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, where n_i is the quantum number for that direction. But in 3D, the total energy is the sum of the three. So, the energy E is (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in terms of the principal quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but wait. The ground state is when n_x, n_y, n_z are all zero. So N=0, E=(0 + 3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be when one of them is 1, others zero. So N=1: E=(1 + 3/2) ħω. The next could be N=2 (two quanta), and so on.

But the question is about the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest, so the first excited is first above that, second excited is the next, third excited is the third. So I need to figure out what level that is.

Wait, in 3D, the order isn't just based on N. Because for a given N, there are different ways to distribute the quanta among the three directions. So the states are degenerate based on N.

Let me think: the ground state (N=0) has E= (3/2) ħω. The first excited state (N=1) would have E= (5/2) ħω, and
