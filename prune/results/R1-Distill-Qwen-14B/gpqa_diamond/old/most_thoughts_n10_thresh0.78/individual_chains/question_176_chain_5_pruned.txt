Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a vector in three dimensions. Oh, but wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, right? Let me check the norm of this vector. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So, the norm is sqrt(6). Hmm. So the state should be normalized by dividing each component by sqrt(6), I think. Otherwise, it's not a valid quantum state because the norm should be 1.

Wait, but maybe the problem is written in a way that the state is already normalized? Because if it's a state vector, the sum of the squares should be 1. Let me calculate: (-1)^2 is 1, 2 squared is 4, and 1 squared is 1. Sum is 6. So yeah, it's not normalized. So I guess I should normalize it first. Otherwise, the probabilities won't add up correctly.

So the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T. Let me write that down.

The problem involves two observables, P and Q. The operator for P is given as a matrix. Let's write it down.

P's matrix:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, okay. And Q's matrix is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Oh, wait, so Q is a very simple observable. Its possible measurement outcomes are 1, 0, -1, right?

The question is: if we measure P first, and then Q, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no. The question says, someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the order is P first, then Q. So the probabilities are dependent on the state after P's measurement, which affects the state for Q's measurement.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the observable. So the idea is that when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. Then, when you measure Q, the state is already in that eigenstate of P, and the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue for Q is calculated based on that state.

But wait, the problem is asking for the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1. So I think the process is:
