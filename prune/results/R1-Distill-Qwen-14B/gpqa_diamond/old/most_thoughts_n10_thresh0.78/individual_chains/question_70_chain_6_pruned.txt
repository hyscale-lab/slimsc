Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. So, the question is about some chemical reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of a product E. Hmm, symmetry groups can be tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, let's break down the reactions given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. 8 equivalents make me think that maybe B is being used in a stoichiometric ratio that's a power of 2, so perhaps 2^3=8. Like, maybe B is something like O2? Or another diatomic gas.

2. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. So, D is another gas reacting with C. What could that be? Maybe D is something reactive like Cl2 or F2? Because those are often dangerous.

3. C also reacts with water to reform A plus two acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak one. Strong acids like HCl or H2SO4, weak ones like HClO or something else. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. This suggests perhaps C is a salt that can hydrolyze into two different acid components.

4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent. So D and B combine in 1:1. Let's think: if B is O2, and D is Cl2, then H would be ClO or something else? Wait, but 1:1... Maybe B is O2 and D is H2 (but that would form H2O). Alternatively, B could be another diatomic gas. Wait, maybe B is Cl2 and D is O2? Wait, no, because in the first reaction, A reacts with B. Let me think again.

Wait, when D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Common solvents include H2O, ethanol, etc., but H2O is a product from B reacting with D. Let's see, if B is Cl2 and D is O2, then Cl2 and O2 in 1:1 would not form much. Hmm, maybe H is something else. Wait, perhaps H is HClO? No, that would require Cl and O in a reaction. Alternatively, if B is O2 and D is H2, then they could form H2O. But 1:1 ratio of H2 and O2 would make H2O, which is a solvent. So B is O2, D is H2? But wait, the reaction of H2 and O2 in 1:1 would be 2H2 + O2 â†’ 2H2O, but that's a 2:1 ratio. Oh, but the problem says 1:1, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the possible products and their structures.

C is bright red. I remember that some transition metal compounds are bright red. For example, MnO2 is dark brown, but maybe another compound. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitride or something else. Wait, another thought: when solid A reacts with multiple equivalents of a gas B, perhaps A is
