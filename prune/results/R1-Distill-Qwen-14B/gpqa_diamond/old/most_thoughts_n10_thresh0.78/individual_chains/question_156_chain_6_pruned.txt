Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about reactions involving alkenes and mCPBA, then some HPLC analysis. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

So the question says that a chemist does two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, then aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. Peracids are typically used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes converts the double bond into an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the double bond affects the epoxide formation.

Wait, but wait. Epoxidation with mCPBA is a syn addition. So, when the alkene reacts, the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that the two new bonds form on the same face. So for a trans (E) alkene, the epoxide would form with a certain stereochemistry, and for a cis (Z) alkene, another.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is a four-carbon double bond in an eight-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2CH2, but with substituents on either end of the double bond. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite each other, while for (Z), they're on the same side.

When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. I think the configuration of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. But since mCPBA is an electrophilic peracid, the epoxidation should lead to the same epoxide regardless of E or Z? Or does it form different epoxides based on the starting geometry?

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, the starting geometry (E or Z) will influence the endo transition state. For a trans (E) double bond, the two substituents are opposite. So when the peracid attacks, the oxygen adds from the same face. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this.

Wait, maybe I should think about the diastereomers formed. Let me recall: when mCPBA epoxidizes an alkene, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the configuration of the starting alkene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide will form in a way that the substituents on each carbon are trans relative to each other. Or is it that the substituents on the epoxide end up cis or trans?

Wait, I think for epoxidation, the endo transition state leads to cis addition of the oxygen atoms. So the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face. For a trans starting alkene, that would lead to a trans epoxide? Or wait, maybe the substituents on the original double bond are
