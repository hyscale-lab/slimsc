Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that I prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an OR group. The O in the carbonyl and the OR would come from the ester, so the formula will have O2, which matches the options given.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break down the signals. The aromatic-H part: two signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring (6-membered aromatic ring), the substituents probably are in a certain position. For example, para-substituted would give two equivalent aromatic protons, but wait, that's for a single substituent. Wait, no, di-substituted. Let me think about that. Di-substituted benzene rings can be ortho, meta, or para. But wait, the substituents could be identical or different. The NMR shows two aromatic signals, each with a certain integration.

Wait, the aromatic region has two signals. So maybe the ring has two sets of equivalent protons. For example, in para substitution, if there's an ester group in the para position, but wait, it's di-substituted so maybe the substituents are such that the ring has two types of aromatic Hs. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents are ortho to each other, but that might cause more complex splitting. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are a vinyl group and another group. Wait, the NMR says there are two vinyl-H signals. Oh wait no, the NMR says two signals corresponding to vinyl-H, and one is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Hmm, maybe the substituents include a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR breakdown: two aromatic-H signals, two vinyl-H signals (doublet and doublet of quartets), and two –CH3 groups. No –CH2 groups. So the molecule doesn't have any methylene (CH2) groups.

Let me think about the structure. The aromatic ring is six-membered, so maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents. The ester is one of those substituents. The other substituent could be a vinyl group or maybe a group with methyl groups.

Wait, the NMR shows two –CH3 signals. So two different methyl groups. So perhaps a substituent that includes two methyl groups, like an ester with a methyl ester group and another substituent with a methyl group.

Wait, but the ester group is O-CO-O-R, but wait, esters are usually O-CO-O-R, but in an aromatic substitution, the ester would be attached as a substituent. So perhaps one substituent is an ester group (e.g., O-CO-O-R or R-O-CO-O-R?), no, wait, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So if the substituent is an ester, then maybe it's O-CO-O-R, but that's not standard. Wait, more accurately, the ester

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1700-1750 cm^-1. So, there's an ester functional group present.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Two aromatic-H signals. Wait, benzene rings typically have symmetry, so maybe the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. For a di-substituted benzene, if the substituents are para, then there are two equivalent sets of H. Or if they are ortho, maybe more splitting, but maybe the substituents are such that there are two sets. Or perhaps the substituents are different, leading to different environments. But wait, in the NMR, there are two aromatic-H signals. So maybe each set has two or more Hs.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are like those attached to a double bond, maybe in an ester group or another substituent. Oh wait, the ester group structure is O-C-O, but the carbonyl is between the two oxygens. The vinyl Hs might be part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring.

Also, two signals for –CH3 groups. So maybe two different methyl groups. No signals for –CH2 groups, so no methylene groups in the molecule. So, the structure doesn't have any CH2 groups.

Putting this together, the molecule has an ester group and other substituents. Let me think about what substituents would fit.

Esters can be part of a substituent. For example, an ester group could be attached as a substituent on the benzene ring. So, the structure might be something like an aryl ester or perhaps a vinyl ester.

Wait, another possibility: the ester could be part of a substituent like an acetyl group, but that's a ketone, not an ester. No, wait, an ester is O-C-O connected to two different R groups.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. The aromatic ring is di-substituted. One substituent is an ester group, maybe. Let me think about the structure. Perhaps the substituents are an ester and another group.

Let's think about the NMR. Two aromatic H signals. So maybe the ring has two substituents that are para to each other, leading to two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, then each substituent is attached to the ring in such a way that the remaining Hs are in two equivalent sets.

Wait, but wait, if the substituents are para, the benzene would have two sets
