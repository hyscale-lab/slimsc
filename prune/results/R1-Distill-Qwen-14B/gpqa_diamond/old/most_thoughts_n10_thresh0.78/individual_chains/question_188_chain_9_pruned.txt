Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography. I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state chemistry, but let me try to think this through.

The question is about finding the interplanar distance for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees.

Wait, wait. I remember that in crystals, the structure can be described using unit cells, and the interplanar distance (d) is related to the crystal structure and the Miller indices. The Miller indices here are (111), so we're looking at the (hkl) = (1,1,1) plane.

I think the formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - (2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ) ), but wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe it's a different formula. I recall that for a cubic system, the formula simplifies because all angles are 90 degrees, but here it's a rhombohedral, so angles are 30 degrees each.

Another approach: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_hkl = (a^2 (h² + k² + l²) - 2 a^2 (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)) )^(-1/2) * (something). Hmm, maybe I should look up the formula again. Oh wait, I'm trying to think from memory. The formula is d = (a² * [h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2hl cos β - 2kl cos γ]) )^(-1/2) / (sqrt( h² + k² + l² + ... )) Wait, no, perhaps I should get it right.

The formula for the interplanar distance in a general crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2 h k \cos \gamma - 2 h l \cos \beta - 2 k l \cos \alpha}}}

Wait, no, that might not be correct. Alternatively, I think it's derived from the structure factor, using the metric tensor. But
