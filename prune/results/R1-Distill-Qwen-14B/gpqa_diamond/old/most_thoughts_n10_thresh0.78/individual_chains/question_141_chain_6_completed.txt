Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. I'm supposed to find out how many possible organic products there are.

Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Let me make sure I get the structure right. Benzene has six carbons in a ring. The numbering would be such that the bromine is on carbon 1 and a deuterium (d) is on carbon 2. Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, "1-bromobenzene-2-d" probably means that the bromine is on position 1, and there's a deuterium (which is a hydrogen isotope) attached to position 2. So the molecule is bromobenzene with a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. Or maybe it's a benzene ring where position 1 has bromine and position 2 has a deuterium, and the rest are regular hydrogens.

Wait, but wait, benzene is symmetric. So if bromine is on position 1, and the deuterium is on position 2, then the molecule's structure is such that the two substituents are adjacent. So it's bromine at C1 and deuterium at C2.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. In aromatic chemistry, it's used for things like elimination, especially in the formation of benzynes. Oh right, the benzidine rearrangement or something similar? Or maybe it's used to form benzyne intermediates.

Wait, another thought: when a bromobenzene ring has a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, treating it with a strong base like NaNH2 can lead to the elimination of HBr, forming a triple bond in the ring, leading to a benzyne intermediate. Benzyne is a diradical or a highly strained triple bond, which can undergo various reactions like cycloadditions.

But wait, in this case, the substituent isn't just a hydrogen; it's a deuterium on the adjacent carbon. So, perhaps the base (NaNH2) can abstract a proton, but wait, the adjacent position has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen. So maybe the reaction is different.

Wait, but I should think about this more carefully. The structure is 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the positions are 1 (bromine) and 2 (deuterium). So each of the adjacent carbons has Br and D respectively.

In the reaction with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it would typically abstract a proton β to the leaving group. In the case of bromobenzene, the β position is the adjacent carbon. But wait, in this molecule, the adjacent carbon (C2) has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen. So, can NaNH2 abstract a deuterium? I think in such cases, deuterium is less acidic than hydrogen. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. The acidity of deuterium in aromatic rings is similar but maybe slightly different from hydrogen.

Wait, in aromatic rings, the acidity of hydrogens is influenced by the substituents. For instance, in toluene, the para position is more acidic because the conjugate base is stabilized. But in this case, the substituents are bromine and deuterium.

Wait, but the reaction is about deprotonation. If the base is strong enough, it can abstract a proton. But if the hydrogen is deuterium, which is a heavier isotope, would it be harder to abstract? I think deuterium is less acidic than regular hydrogen because the bond strength is higher, so deprotonation is less likely. Hmm, but wait, NaNH2 is a very strong base, stronger than, say, KOH. So maybe it can abstract deuterium as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

In the case of bromobenzene, when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, the base abstracts a proton from the carbon adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge (a carbanion intermediate), which can lose HBr and form a triple bond, creating a benzyne intermediate. But wait, if the adjacent carbon has a deuterium instead of a hydrogen, can the base abstract that?

Alternatively, maybe the deuterium is in a position that's not adjacent. Wait, no, the numbering is 1 and 2, so they're adjacent. So the C1 has Br, and C2 has D.

So, in the reaction, the base (NH2^-) would try to deprotonate C2, but it's a D. So can NH2^- abstract D in this scenario? I'm not sure, but I think in practice, deuteriums are less acidic than hydrogens. So maybe the base can't abstract the D. If that's the case, then perhaps there's no elimination because the necessary H (or D) isn't available.

Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Another possibility: in the presence of a strong base, perhaps the Br leaves, but that's not likely without a good base to abstract a proton. Wait, but without abstraction, elimination can't happen because the leaving group (Br-) would require a proton adjacent to it to form the triple bond.

Wait, but if the base can't abstract the deuterium, then perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed as expected. So no elimination, and the product would be something else. Or maybe the base abstracts a different hydrogen.

Wait, but in the molecule, are there any other hydrogens available for deprotonation? Let me think about the structure. The benzene ring has six carbons. So C1 has Br, C2 has D, and the other positions (3,4,5,6) have H. So, the base could abstract a hydrogen from any of these positions?

Wait, but wait, if the base is NaNH2, which is a strong base, but if the adjacent (to Br) position has D, which the base can't abstract, perhaps the base would abstract a hydrogen from another position. But wait, where would that be?

Wait, but for elimination to form benzyne, the H has to be on the adjacent carbon to Br. Because elimination (like E2) requires the H and leaving group to be anti-periplanar, and in a benzene ring, the adjacent positions are the only ones that can allow that geometry.

Wait, but if the H on C2 is a D, then the base can't abstract it. So perhaps the reaction can't proceed via elimination. Hmm, but then what reaction occurs?

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's meta to Br. But I'm not sure. Let me think. If the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is next to C2, then would that lead to any elimination?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products. If the reaction doesn't proceed via elimination, maybe nothing happens. But that can't be, because the question suggests that products are formed.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the deuterium is on the same carbon as the bromine? No, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d, so bromine is on 1, deuterium on 2.

Wait, but maybe the reaction doesn't involve elimination but something else. Like, perhaps a substitution reaction. But under what conditions would that happen? SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution) requires a good leaving group and a strongly activated ring. But Br is a leaving group, but in this case, the ring isn't activated; it's deactivating due to the electron-withdrawing Br.

Wait, but without a good activating group, SNAr is unlikely. So perhaps substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Hmm, getting a bit stuck. Let's try to think of what NaNH2 usually does. It's used for dehydrohalogenation, forming benzyne. So in the case of 1-bromo-2-d benzene, if the base abstracts a hydrogen adjacent to Br, but the adjacent position is D, which is not abstractable, then perhaps there's no elimination. So maybe no reaction occurs, or perhaps an alternative pathway is taken.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that's not adjacent to the bromine. Let me imagine the benzene ring. C1 is Br, C2 is D. The other positions are C3, C4, C5, C6. The base can abstract a hydrogen from any of these. But for elimination to form benzyne, the H and Br must be on adjacent carbons. If the H is on, say, C3, and the Br is on C1, then C3 is two carbons away from C1, which isn't adjacent. Wait, in a benzene ring, C1 is adjacent to C2 and C6. So C3 is opposite to C1, perhaps.

Wait, but if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), then perhaps elimination could occur. But wait, in this molecule, C2 has D, and C6 is another position. So in 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the C6 position would be a hydrogen. So the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to Br on C1.

Wait, yes! Because in 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the adjacent positions to Br (C1) are C2 (which has D) and C6. So the base can abstract a hydrogen from C6. So that would allow elimination of HBr, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. Wait, no, elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C2 or C1 and C6? Wait, no, when the H is on C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), elimination occurs between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but in the benzene ring, the positions are C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. So if Br is on C1, and H is on C6, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, but that's the same as C1 and C2 because it's a ring. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to the next, so triple bond between C1 and C2 is the same as between C1 and C6? No, wait, in benzene, it's a six-membered ring, so C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So if H is abstracted from C6 (adjacent to C1), then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, which is the same as forming a triple bond between C1 and C2 because it's a ring. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. C1 has Br. C2 has D. C6 is adjacent to C1. So if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, which are adjacent. That would create a triple bond, forming a benzyne intermediate. So the product would be a triple bond between C1 and C6 (or equivalently, C1 and C2 in a ring structure). But wait, that doesn't change the ring structure; it's just a different position.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, the positions are relative. So if the triple bond is between C1 and C2, or between C1 and C6, it's the same because the ring can rotate. So in this case, the benzyne would have the triple bond in either position, but considering the starting material, the elimination would occur between C1 and C6 because C6 has a hydrogen available (since C2 has D, which can't be abstracted).

Wait, but how many possible benzyne structures can form from this starting material?

Wait, wait. When the H is abstracted from C6, elimination forms a triple bond between C1 and C6, which would be a single position. But when the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, it would form a single product. Alternatively, could the base abstract a hydrogen from another position?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, but that's not adjacent to Br. But without a hydrogen adjacent to Br, elimination can't happen. So in this case, the only available hydrogen adjacent to Br is on C6. So elimination would occur between C1 and C6, forming a triple bond, making a benzyne.

Wait, but wait, in 1-bromobenzene-2-d, the substituents are on C1 and C2. So if the base abstracts H from C6, then elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, but in the benzene ring, that's equivalent to a triple bond between C1 and C2. So the resulting benzyne would be 1,2-didehydrobenzene, or o-benzyne.

But wait, in this reaction, the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. So the deuterium is on C2, and bromine on C1. When the base abstracts a hydrogen from C6, which is adjacent to C1 (Br), then the elimination would form a triple bond between C1 and C6, which is the same as between C1 and C2 due to the ring's symmetry.

Wait, but wait, does the position of deuterium affect the elimination? Since the base can't abstract a deuterium, the only possible H for elimination is on C6. So the benzyne would have the triple bond between C1 and C2. So the product would be o-benzyne.

But wait, the question is about the number of possible organic products. So, when NaNH2 is used, the elimination forms benzyne, which is a diradical and can react in different ways. But in this case, perhaps the benzyne doesn't form because the reaction isn't possible. Or does it?

Wait, but I'm probably overcomplicating. Let me think again: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-d benzene. The base NaNH2 is present.

If the H on C6 is abstracted, elimination occurs, leading to benzyne. But how many possible products are formed from this reaction?

Wait, in a normal bromobenzene without deuterium, elimination would form o-benzyne as the major product. But in this case, the presence of a deuterium on C2 would affect the reaction.

Wait, but in this case, the reaction can only form o-benzyne because the H abstracted is from C6, leading to a triple bond between C1 and C6 (which is the same as C1 and C2 in the ring). So only one benzyne is possible.

But wait, wait again. Benzyne is a symmetrical molecule. When you have the triple bond between C1 and C2, it's the same as between C1 and C6 because of the ring's symmetry. So the product is a single benzyne, which is o-benzyne.

But then, the question is about the number of organic products. If only one product is formed, the answer would be option B, which is 1.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another product. Wait, what else could happen?

Wait, another possibility: when the base abstracts a hydrogen from a non-adjacent position, but that's less likely because elimination requires the H and leaving group to be adjacent. But in this case, the only possible H adjacent to Br is on C6.

Wait, but wait, could the base abstract a hydrogen from C3 or C5, which are para to Br? No, because elimination can't happen from those positions. So the only elimination possible is through C6.

So the reaction would form o-benzyne as the product. But wait, benzyne can undergo various reactions, but in this case, the solvent is condensed ammonia. Wait, I think in condensed ammonia, benzyne can dimerize, but that's another reaction.

Wait, but the question is about the possible organic products formed in this reaction. So if the reaction forms benzyne, which is a diradical, but perhaps it doesn't actually form a product in this case because it's not captured. Alternatively, the reaction may not proceed because the necessary H isn't abstractable.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the H on C6 is abstractable. Because it's a hydrogen, not a deuterium. So the base can abstract that, leading to elimination of HBr and formation of benzyne.

But the question is about the number of possible products, so if only benzyne is formed, that's one product. So the answer would be B) 1.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from a position that leads to different products. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the adjacent H is deuterium, so elimination isn't possible. So the reaction doesn't occur, and the only product is the starting material. But that's not one of the options, because the question implies a reaction occurs.

Wait, but the options include B)1 and D)3, etc. So if only one product is formed, the answer is B.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Another thought: perhaps the deuterium affects the reaction in a way that leads to different products.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from another position, leading to a different product. Let's see.

In the benzene ring, if the base abstracts a hydrogen from C3, which is meta to Br. Would that lead to elimination? No, because elimination requires the H and Br to be on adjacent carbons. So, abstracting from C3 wouldn't allow elimination, so no product would form from that.

Alternatively, what about para position? No, because the para position to Br is C4. So the H on C4 is not adjacent to Br, so elimination isn't possible.

Hmm, so the only possible elimination is from C6, leading to one product.

Wait, but wait, another possibility. Suppose the base abstracts a hydrogen from C2, which is a deuterium. But earlier I thought deuterium is less acidic, so it's not abstracted. So in that case, no elimination from C2.

So the reaction would proceed only via elimination from C6, leading to a single product: o-benzyne.

Therefore, the number of possible products is 1, so the answer is B.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. The structure of 1-bromobenzene-2-d has bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2 on the benzene ring. The reaction mechanism typically involves deprotonation of a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, followed by elimination of HBr to form a benzyne intermediate. However, the presence of deuterium at position 2 complicates the reaction because deuterium is less acidic than hydrogen and is less likely to be abstracted by the base.

In this case, the base (NaNH₂) can abstract a hydrogen from position 6, which is adjacent to the bromine at position 1. This leads to elimination of HBr and the formation of a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. Due to the symmetry of the benzene ring, the triple bond between positions 1 and 6 is equivalent to a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Thus, the reaction produces a single product, o-benzyne.

No other elimination pathways are possible because the hydrogens at positions 3, 4, and 5 are not adjacent to the bromine and cannot participate in elimination. Therefore, the reaction yields only one organic product.

Answer: B
