Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically involving a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that in crystals, the interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes of atoms. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees each. Wait, so this is a rhombohedral crystal, which means the lattice is rhombohedral, a special case of a hexagonal or cubic system, but all edges are equal and all angles are equal too.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Right, interplanar distance is calculated using the formula from X-ray crystallography. I think the formula is d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), but wait, no, that's not right. Maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, another approach: the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the Miller indices squared plus some terms involving the cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, I think the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ), but wait, no, because in a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but for other systems, the angles come into play. Oh right, for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are equal and a is the lattice parameter, the formula is a bit more complex.

Wait, the Miller indices here are (1,1,1), so h=1, k=1, l=1. So the formula for d_{111} would be a divided by the square root of (1^2 +1^2 +1^2 + 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1*1)*cos α ), but wait, no, I think I have the signs wrong. Because in the denominator, the term is (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α, right? Or is it plus? Hmm, maybe I should look this up.

Wait, I think the correct formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos θ ), where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors. But in a rhombohedral system, all three angles are same, so α=β=γ=30 degrees in this case.

Wait, but wait, wait. Another approach: the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system can be written as d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cos α ). So substituting h=k=l=1, and cos(30°) which is sqrt(3)/2, approximately 0.866.

So let's compute the denominator:

Denominator = 1 + 1 + 1 - 2*(1*1 +1*1 +1
