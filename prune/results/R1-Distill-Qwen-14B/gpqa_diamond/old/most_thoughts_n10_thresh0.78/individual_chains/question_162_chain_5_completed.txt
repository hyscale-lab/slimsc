Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry. But wait, what's the exact definition again? I think it's like a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I'm trying to recall how to calculate the area from a metric. Oh right, in general relativity, the area element is found by the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Or wait, for a 2D metric like this, the determinant might be straightforward.

Let me break down the metric. It looks like it's written in terms of x and y coordinates. The ds² is expressed as a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²), which resembles a 2D Euclidean metric scaled by some factor. The function here is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). 

So, in matrix form, the metric tensor g would be diag(32/(4 - x² - y²), 32/(4 - x² - y²)), right? Because each of dx² and dy² is multiplied by the same factor. So the determinant of this metric tensor would be the product of the diagonal terms, since it's diagonal. So determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². 

Wait, but when you have a metric in the form ds² = g_{xx} dx² + 2g_{xy} dx dy + g_{yy} dy², the determinant is g_{xx}g_{yy} - (g_{xy})². In this case, since g_{xy} is zero, the determinant is just g_{xx} * g_{yy} = [32/(4 - x² - y²)]².

So the area element dA would be sqrt(det g) dx dy. Wait, no, no, I think in 2D, the area element is the square root of the determinant times dx dy. Wait, no, wait. For a metric ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx² dy², but since we're in 2D with coordinates x and y, it's sqrt(det g) dx dy.

So sqrt(det g) is [32/(4 - x² - y²)].

Wait, but what's the region over which we integrate? The metric has a denominator 4 - x² - y², which suggests that this is non-zero only when x² + y² <4, because otherwise it blows up. So the domain is the disk where x² + y² <4. Because if x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up, so that's the boundary.

So the area would be the integral of sqrt(det g) over this region. So sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Then the area A is the integral over x² + y² <4 of 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Hmm, that integral can be done in polar coordinates. Let's convert to polar coordinates where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, and dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The denominator becomes 4 - r².

So the integral becomes:

A = ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, factor out the constants. 32 is a constant, so can move it out. The integral over θ is just 2π. So:

A = 32 * 2π ∫ (from 0 to 2) [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Wait, the integral is ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2. Let's make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then du/dr = -2r => (-1/2) du = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) (1/u) * (-1/2) du.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (4 to 0) (1/u) du. But flipping the limits makes it positive:

(1/2) ∫ (0 to4) (1/u) du = (1/2) [ln u] from 0 to 4.

Wait, but ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh wait, that's a problem. Let me check the substitution again.

Wait, the substitution u = 4 - r². So when r approaches 2 from below, u approaches 0. So the integral becomes:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = ∫ [r/(u)] dr.

But substituting u=4 - r², dr = (-1/(2r)) du, right? So:

r/(u) * (-1/(2r)) du = (-1/(2u)) du.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute.

Let me rewrite the integral:

∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → (du)/(-2) = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r/(u)] dr = ∫ [1/u] * (du/(-2)).

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du.

But the limits: when r=0 → u=4; when r=2 → u=0.

So the integral from r=0 to 2 becomes the integral from u=4 to u=0 of (-1/2) (1/u) du.

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ (from 0 to4) (1/u) du.

Because reversing the limits (from 4 to 0) and multiplying by (-1/2) gives (1/2) ∫ from 0 to4.

But ∫(1/u) du is ln|u|, so this becomes (1/2)(ln4 - ln0).

But ln0 is negative infinity. So (1/2)(ln4 - (-∞)) is (1/2)(∞) which is infinite. So the integral diverges to infinity.

Wait, that can't be right. So the area is infinite? But the options don't have an option that says infinite except option D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are given. Let me look:

Options:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C) 4π(x² - y²)

D) +infty

So the area would be infinite, which is option D.

But wait, why is the area infinite? Because the metric is defined in a region where x² + y² <4, but the area element becomes singular at r=2. So the integral over the disk up to r=2 would diverge.

Wait, but a pseudosphere, like the tractricoid, is a finite area surface. Or is this a different kind of pseudosphere?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about what a pseudosphere is. The tractricoid is a pseudosphere, which has finite area. But I'm not sure about the metric given here.

Wait, the metric given is ds² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). So as (x² + y²) approaches 4, the metric becomes infinite. That suggests that this is a model with a singularity at r=2.

In the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually something like (4/(1 - r²)^2)(dr² + r² dθ²), which for r approaching 1, the metric blows up, but the model represents hyperbolic space with finite area when integrated from 0 to 1. Wait, no, integrating the Poincaré disk metric from 0 to 1 would give a finite area. But in that model, the area is π, if I remember correctly.

Wait, but in our metric, the denominator is 4 - r², so the curvature is different. Let me calculate the Gaussian curvature to see.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature K for a metric ds² = E(dx² + dy²), where E is a function, is given by:

K = - (1/(2E)) * Δ(ln E),

where Δ is the Laplacian in 2D.

So E here is 32/(4 - x² - y²) = 32/(4 - r²). So ln E = ln(32) - ln(4 - r²).

The Laplacian in polar coordinates (r,θ) is (1/r) d/dr (r dr) + (1/r²) d²/dθ². But since E is radial, the angular part is zero.

So Δ(ln E) = d²(ln E)/dr² + (1/r) d(ln E)/dr.

So, d(ln E)/dr = (0) - [ (-2r)/(4 - r²) ) ] = 2r/(4 - r²).

d²(ln E)/dr² = [2*(4 - r²) - 2r*(-2r)] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, let's compute it:

d/dr [2r/(4 - r^2)] = [2*(4 - r²) + 2r * 2r ] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, more carefully:

d/dr [2r/(4 - r^2)] = [2*(4 - r²) - 2r*(-2r)] / (4 - r²)^2.

= [8 - 2r² +4 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

= [8 + 2r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

So Δ(ln E) = [8 + 2 r² ]/(4 - r²)^2 + (1/r)(2 r)/(4 - r^2).

Simplify the second term: (1/r) *2r/(4 - r^2) = 2/(4 - r^2).

So Δ(ln E) = [ (8 + 2r^2) + 2(4 - r²) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, no, because the second term was 2/(4 - r^2), and the first term is [8 + 2 r²]/(4 - r²)^2.

So combine the terms:

= [8 + 2 r² + 2 (4 - r²)] / (4 - r²)^2.

Wait, because the second term is [2/(4 - r^2)] = [2(4 - r^2)]/(4 - r^2)^2.

So adding all terms:

[8 + 2r² + 8 - 2 r² ] / (4 - r²)^2.

= [16 ]/(4 - r²)^2.

So K = - (1/(2E)) * (16)/(4 - r²)^2.

But E is 32/(4 - r^2), so 1/(2E) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ] * [16/(4 - r²)^2 ].

Simplify:

= - [ (16 (4 - r²)) ] / [64 (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Wait, wait,

Wait,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ) ] * [16/(4 - r²)^2 ]

= - [ 16 (4 - r²) ] / [64 (4 - r²)^2 ]

= - [16 / (64 (4 - r²)) ) ]

= - [1/(4 (4 - r²)) ) ]

= -1/(16 - 4 r² )

Hmm, this seems a bit complex. I'm not sure if I did that correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the Gaussian curvature is negative, as expected for a pseudosphere.

But regardless, the important point is that the metric given has a singularity at r=2, and the area integral diverges, leading to an infinite area. So the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2 would be infinite, which would correspond to option D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the standard tractricoid has finite area. Oh wait, maybe I'm not considering the correct parametrization here. Or perhaps the given metric is not for a tractricoid but a different pseudosphere model, leading to an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral's evaluation. Let me double-check.

The area integral is:

A = ∫∫ sqrt(det g) dx dy.

det g = [32/(4 - r²)]².

sqrt(det g) = 32/(4 - r²).

So A = ∫∫ [32/(4 - r²)] dx dy.

In polar coordinates, dx dy = r dr dθ.

So A = ∫_{θ=0}^{2π} ∫_{r=0}^{2} [32/(4 - r²)] r dr dθ.

= 32 * 2π ∫_{0}^2 [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0.

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr from 0 to 2 → ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [1/u] * (-1/2) du.

= (1/2) ∫ (from u=0 to u=4) (1/u) du.

But ∫ 1/u du = ln |u|.

So (1/2) [ ln u ] from 0 to4 → (1/2)(ln4 - ln0).

But ln0 is -infinity, so this becomes (1/2)(ln4 - (-infty)) = (1/2)(infinite) → infinite.

So the area integral diverges. Therefore, the area is infinite, which is option D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right).
\]

To calculate the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we first determine the area element \( dA \) from the metric. The metric tensor in matrix form is diagonal, with both diagonal entries equal to \( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The determinant of the metric tensor is:

\[
\det g = \left(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\right)^2.
\]

The area element is then:

\[
dA = \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is defined by \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), as the metric becomes singular when \( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \). Converting to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area \( A \) is:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 \cdot r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

Factoring out constants, the integral over \( \theta \) gives \( 2\pi \), so:

\[
A = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = \int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2}}{u} \, du = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \( \int \frac{1}{u} \, du \) is \( \ln|u| \), so:

\[
\int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln 4 - \ln 0.
\]

Since \( \ln 0 \) is \( -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the area \( A \) is infinite.

Given the options:

- **A) 0**: Incorrect, as the area is not zero.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect, as this does not represent the area of the pseudosphere.
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct, as the area integral diverges due to the singularity at \( r = 2 \).

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
