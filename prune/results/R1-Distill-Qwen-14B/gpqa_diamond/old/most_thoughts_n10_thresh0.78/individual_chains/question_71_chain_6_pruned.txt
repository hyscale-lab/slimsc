Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember equilibrium temperature has to do with the balance between the star's radiation and the planet's heat emission. But wait, let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered via the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, right? But I don't think that's directly relevant here. The important part is the orbital periods and their ratios, and that they're in orbital resonance. Oh, and they have the same albedo. So albedo affects how much light is reflected, but since they all have the same, maybe that cancels out in the ratio.

The orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 is the fastest, with period P, Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. Wait, actually, no, I think the ratio is between the planets themselves. So the periods are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, for example, Planet_2's period is twice that of Planet_1, and so on.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of Planet_4 and Planet_2. The ratio T4/T2 is what we're looking for. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature involves the square root of the ratio of the star's luminosity to the planet's distance squared, but wait, the formula is proportional to (L/(16πσd²))^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, d is the distance, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since all planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ will be same for all. So the temperature depends on the inverse square root of the distance squared, which simplifies to 1/distance.

Wait, wait. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, the formula is T
