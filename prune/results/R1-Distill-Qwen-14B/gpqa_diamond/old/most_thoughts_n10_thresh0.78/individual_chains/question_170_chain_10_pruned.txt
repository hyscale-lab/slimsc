Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured the observable many times on identically prepared systems.

The spin state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation represents a two-component spinor. So the state vector is written as a column matrix with components [3i, 4]^T. Right, because spin-1/2 particles have two possible states, so it's a two-component vector.

The operator for S_y is given, which is sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait, the note says sigma_y is the Pauli matrix:

sigma_y = [[0, -i],
           [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So to find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute the expectation of the operator. The expectation value formula is <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Let me write down the steps. First, let me write the state vector ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]

But wait, complex numbers can be tricky. So ψ has components which are complex. The first component is 3i, and the second is 4, a real number.

To compute the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, where † denotes
