Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that the pion (Pi+) is stationary. So, initially, the total momentum should be zero because the pion isn't moving. When it decays into the muon (mu+) and the neutrino (nu), the total momentum of the products must still be zero since momentum is conserved. That means the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But wait, neutrinos are super light, right? Or maybe even massless? I remember that in some models, neutrinos are considered massless, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. The problem gives the rest mass of the pion and muon but doesn't mention the neutrino's mass. I guess for this problem, we can treat the neutrino as massless. So, that simplifies things.

The rest mass of Pi+ is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. So, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which would be 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

Since the pion is at rest, the decay products will have some kinetic energy. Let's think about energy conservation. The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy would be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy would just be its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible, maybe zero).

Wait, but wait. If the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum times the speed of light. Oh, right, because for a massless particle, E = pc. But in units where c=1, like MeV and MeV/c, E = |p|. So the neutrino's momentum is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the muon's momentum.

Let me set up some variables. Let me denote the energy of the muon as E_mu and the neutrino as E_nu. So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

The muon's energy is its rest mass plus kinetic energy: E_mu = m_mu * c² + K_mu. But wait, m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², so m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV. So E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just K_nu, since its rest mass is zero.

So total energy equation: 105.7 + K_mu + K_nu = 139.6.

Which simplifies to K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

Now, considering momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. So, the muon's momentum (p_mu) plus the neutrino's momentum (p_nu) must equal zero. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But since momentum is a vector, their magnitudes are equal, and directions opposite. So, |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But for the neutrino, since E_nu = p_nu c (because m=0), E_nu = p_nu. And for the muon, its energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2 ? Wait, no, the relation for a particle is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So, E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. Since we're using units where c=1 for energies and masses, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + m_mu^2.

So, E_mu^2 = p_mu^2 + (105.7)^2.

But from earlier, E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu. Hmm. Not sure if that helps yet.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Let me denote p as the magnitude of the muon's momentum. Then, the neutrino's momentum is also p, but in the opposite direction. So
