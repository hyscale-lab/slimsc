Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking.

The problem says we have an atom that has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. They're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, wait—wait, the next 150 minutes, but 50 have already passed. Wait, so the remaining time is 150 minutes after the current time? That would make the total time 200 minutes. Or do they mean the next 150 minutes from the start? Oh wait, the question says, "50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed." So right now, it's at 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150. So the total time we're considering is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

Wait, but the initial decay probability is given for 100 minutes. I think we're dealing with an exponential decay model here. So the decay probability is based on the decay constant.

In radioactive decay, the probability that an atom decays in a certain time follows an exponential law. The formula I remember is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t, and λ is the decay constant. But here, we're dealing with probabilities, so perhaps it's better to think in terms of the probability of decay.

The probability that the atom has decayed by time t is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). Alternatively, the probability it hasn't decayed is e^(-λt).

Wait, the problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. So P(100) = 0.32. Which means 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. So we can solve for λ.

Let me write that down: 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 => e^(-λ*100) = 0
