Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are common in many physical systems.

The problem states that the state is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> )/ N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant. And N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha squared)). Right, because when you calculate the norm of that state, you have cos²(phi) times |alpha> and sin²(phi) times |-alpha>, but the cross terms involve sin(2phi) times the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha>.

The question is to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state and rho is the state in question.

Wait, I think relative entropy is a measure of how different two probability distributions are. But in quantum terms, it's calculated using the density matrices. The relative entropy of rho with respect to tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in this case, the formula given is different; it's [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh, so it's the entropy of rho minus the entropy of tau, which is the von Neumann entropy of rho minus that of tau. But wait, isn't non-Gaussianity usually measured as the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state? Because Gaussian states have certain properties, and the minimal relative entropy might be computed by finding the Gaussian state tau that's closest to rho.

Wait, but the problem says the relative entropy measure is defined as delta_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's S(rho) - S(tau), where S is von Neumann entropy. But non-Gaussianity could be thought of as the difference between the entropy of the non-Gaussian state and the entropy of the best Gaussian approximation.

But wait, another thought: for Gaussian states, the entropy is maximal for certain parameters. Or maybe for the same first and second moments, the Gaussian state has the maximum entropy. So perhaps the minimal relative entropy between rho and any Gaussian state tau is S(rho) -
