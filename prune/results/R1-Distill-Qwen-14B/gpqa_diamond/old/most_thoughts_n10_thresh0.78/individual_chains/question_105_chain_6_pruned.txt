Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's all about. The question is about a star with some spots and how that affects the brightness variations we observe, comparing it to an exoplanet transiting in front of the star.

Alright, so the setup: the star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. They mention that because only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates, we see brightness variations as the spots come into view and then disappear. And the kicker is that this situation can look similar to an exoplanet causing the same brightness dip when it transits.

The question is asking, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve (if there were no spots), what would be the radius of the exoplanet relative to the star? So, we need to find Rpl/Rstar.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that the brightness variation when a planet transits a star is due to the planet blocking some of the star's light. The amplitude of the dip is determined by the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Because the star is a sphere, the area blocked is related to the radius squared.

So for a planet of radius Rpl orbiting a star of radius Rstar, the area blocked is πRpl². The star's total area is πRstar². So the fractional dip in brightness (the transit depth) is (Rpl/Rstar)². So if the dip is ΔF = (Rpl/Rstar)², then Rpl/Rstar = sqrt(ΔF).

But wait, in this problem, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. It has spots. So the spots affect the observed brightness as they rotate into and out of view. The problem says that the spots are cooler, so when they are facing us, they contribute less to the star's total brightness. So the brightness variation due to the spots will have a certain amplitude, and we want to find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same amplitude.

So first, let's figure out the amplitude caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the amplitude that the planet would cause. Since the problem says that the same amplitude would be produced by the planet, we can set them equal and solve for Rpl/Rstar.

Let me start by calculating the brightness variation due to the spots.

The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so their temperature is 5000 K. The filling factor is 20% or 0.2. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Since it's one hemisphere, does that mean the spots cover 0.2 of half the star's surface? Or is it 0.2 of the entire star? Wait, the question says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So perhaps it's 20% of that hemisphere that is covered by spots.

Wait, I think the filling factor usually refers to the fraction of the surface (like the entire star's surface) that is covered. So if it's one hemisphere, and the filling factor is 20%, that might mean 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. Or does the filling factor apply to the entire star? The wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think the filling factor is for the hemisphere. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the entire star's surface has a filling factor of 20% spots on one hemisphere. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (0.5 * 4πRstar²) = 0.2 * 2πRstar² = 0.4πRstar². Alternatively
