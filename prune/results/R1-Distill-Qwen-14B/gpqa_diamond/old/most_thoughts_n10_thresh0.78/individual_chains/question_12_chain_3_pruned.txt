Okay, so I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles in this decay reaction. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. Oh wait, but wait, neutrinos are a bit tricky because they have such tiny masses, right? So maybe their mass can be neglected here. The problem states that the Pi(+) is stationary, so the total initial momentum is zero. That probably means the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

So, let me think about the conservation laws here. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. But the neutrino's mass is negligible, so its momentum would be approximately equal in magnitude to the muon's, but opposite in direction.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact approach. I remember that in such decay processes, the total energy is conserved, and because the pion is at rest, the system's initial momentum is zero. So the final momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out.

Let me think about the energies. The pion's rest mass is given as 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. But the neutrino's rest mass is so small, maybe we can consider it as zero. So the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion: 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy will be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But since the neutrino is nearly massless, its energy would be equal to its momentum multiplied by c, but I'm probably working in units where c=1, so E = p for neutrino.

Wait, but in particle physics, energies are often given in MeV, and masses are also in MeV/c². Hmm, maybe I should be careful with units. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I can ignore the neutrino's mass and proceed.

Let me set up some equations. Let’s denote:

- m_π = 139.6 MeV/c² (rest mass of pion)
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c² (rest mass of muon)
- m_nu ≈ 0 (neutrino mass negligible)
- E_π = m_π c² = 139.6 MeV (since pion is at rest)

After decay, the muon has energy E_mu and the neutrino E_nu. The total energy must be conserved, so E_mu + E_nu = E_π = 139.6 MeV.

Momentum is also conserved. The pion has zero initial momentum, so the vectors of the muon and neutrino momenta must cancel each other. Let me denote the magnitude of the muon's momentum as p. Then the neutrino's momentum would be p_nu = p, but in the opposite direction. But since neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy E_nu = p_nu c^2, but perhaps in natural units, E_nu = p_nu.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct relation. For a particle, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. Since for the neutrino m≈0, E = pc.

So, the neutrino's energy E_nu = p_nu c, but using c=1 (in MeV units where c=1), E_nu = p_nu.

So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2
