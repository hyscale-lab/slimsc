Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the question is about planets transiting and occulting their star. So, transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet is behind the star, right? So both events happening means that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it can both pass in front and behind the star as seen from Earth.

So the setup is: there's a star with radius 1.5 times the Sun. The first planet has Earth's radius and a transit impact parameter of 0.2. Its orbital period is 3 days. Now, we need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii, such that it also transits and occults. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, circular orbits.

Hmm, I think the key here is the alignment of their orbits. For both transits and occultations to occur, the two planets must be in a configuration where their orbital planes are aligned, and they must pass each other in a way that allows transits and occultations. Wait, but wait, no, actually, the problem says they share the same orbital plane, so alignment is given.

Wait, but for a planet to both transit and occult, it must have its orbital plane edge-on enough so that it passes in front and behind the star. But in this case, the first planet is already transiting, so the inclination is right. The second planet, being in the same orbital plane, must also have the correct alignment. So, the question is about the maximum period so that the second planet can also transit and occult.

Wait, perhaps the key is the Hill sphere or the Roche limit? Or maybe it's about the planets being in a certain orbital distance relative to each other. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the size of the star and the planet's size affecting when they can transit, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: the transit and occultation events happen when the planet's orbital period is such that it's in a position to both pass in front and behind the star. But for a planet to occult, the star must block the planet from our view, which means the planet must be behind the star. So, the planet must be in a position where it's on the same line of sight as the star, both when it's in front (transit) and behind (occultation).

But more importantly, perhaps the maximum period is determined by the condition that the second planet must be able to transit as well, which depends on the size of the star and the planet. Oh, wait, but the first planet is already transiting, so maybe the second planet's period is constrained by the same star's size and its own size.

Wait, but no, the problem states that the second planet must also exhibit both transit and occultation. So, the second planet must be in an orbit that is aligned (same plane) and has a period where it can also transit and occult.

Wait, so for a planet to transit, the orbital inclination must be such that the planet's path across the star's disk is possible. But since both planets are in the same orbital plane, and the first one transits, the second must also
