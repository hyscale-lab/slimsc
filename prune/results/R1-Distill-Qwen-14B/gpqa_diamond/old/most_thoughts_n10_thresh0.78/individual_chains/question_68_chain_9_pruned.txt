Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

Alright, the setup: There's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's moment is aligned with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with this field because the magnetic moment mu is gamma S_z. When the field is along Z, the energy levels are quantized in the z-direction. So the spin-up state would have a higher energy than spin-down, or vice versa, depending on the sign.

Wait, but when the field is turned off, the magnetic field in the Z direction is gone. Then, the new field is along Y. So the Hamiltonian changes from something proportional to S_z to something proportional to S_y. Oh, because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so the energy would be -mu·B. So the Hamiltonian would be proportional to the dot product of the magnetic moment and the magnetic field.

Wait, wait, the problem states that mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because normally, magnetic moment is given by mu = gamma S, where S is the spin operator vector. So maybe here, mu is perhaps given as the z-component, but that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps the problem simplifies mu as just gamma multiplied by the z-component of spin S_z. So mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. Or perhaps it's a typo and should be mu = gamma S, meaning the vector. But I'll proceed with what's given.

So the initial state is when the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with B, so the spin is up in the Z-direction. So before the field is turned off, the system is in the eigenstate of S_z. Let's say it's in the spin-up state along Z, which I'll denote as |↑⟩_z.

When the magnetic field is turned off, the Hamiltonian changes. The field was along Z, and now it's along Y. So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z, but wait, that can't be right because S_y is involved now. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read it again.

The problem says: mu = gamma * S_z. So the magnetic moment is proportional to S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Z, the energy is proportional to S_z. But when the field is turned to Y, the energy depends on S_y. So the Hamiltonian after the field change is H = -mu · B. Since B is along Y now, H = -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but wait, mu is the magnetic moment vector. So when the field is along Y, mu · B would be gamma S_z multiplied by B in the Y direction. Oh, wait, no, that's not right because S_z is the operator, and the magnetic field direction affects how the dot product works.

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. The magnetic moment mu is given as gamma times the spin operator in the z-direction. So mu = gamma S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Y, the interaction energy is mu · B. Since B is along Y, this becomes mu_y * B, but mu is given along z. Oh, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe the magnetic moment is in the same direction as the spin, but the problem says mu = gamma S_z. So perhaps the magnetic moment is only in the z-direction. That would mean the magnetic moment is along z, but the field is along y. So the interaction would be mu · B = (gamma S_z) · (B_y ĵ). So the dot product would be gamma S_z * B * (ĵ · ẑ) which is zero because ĵ and ẑ are perpendicular. So then the energy would be zero? That can't be right because that would mean no interaction, which contradicts the problem statement that the average starts oscillating.

Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the initial setup. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S, meaning the vector. So mu = gamma S. So when B is along Z, the energy is proportional to S_z. When B is along Y, the energy is proportional to S_y.

Wait, but the problem says mu = gamma
