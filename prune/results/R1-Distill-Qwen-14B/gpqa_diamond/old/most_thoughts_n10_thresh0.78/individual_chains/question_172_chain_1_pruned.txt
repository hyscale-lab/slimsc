Okay, so here's this question about stars and their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but let's try to think this through. So, the question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, right, the energy levels relate to temperature because of the excitation states. 

Oh, right, the Boltzmann equation comes into play here. The Boltzmann factor describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two states being equal to the exponential of the energy difference divided by thermal energy. So the ratio N_upper/N_lower = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

Wait, wait, but in this case, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is close to the value of Boltzmann's constant k, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Wait, because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so the energy difference ΔE is k*T, perhaps? Hmm, no, wait. Let's think. The energy difference is fixed, so if the excitation is higher in star_1, that means more atoms are in the higher energy state, which implies higher temperature because higher temperature means more thermal energy to excite the atoms.

The ratio given is 2:1 for the excitation. So N1/N2 = 2, where N1 is star_1 and N2 is star_2. Or wait, actually, the problem states that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps N1/N2 = 2. Or wait, maybe the excitation is the number in the higher state. So, using the Boltzmann equation, N1/N2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ). Because the ratio would be (N1/N2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ). But assuming the energy levels have the same statistical weight, g, so it cancels out.

So N1/N2 = exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T1) ) / exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T2) )

Wait, wait, actually, it's the other way around; the population of a higher energy level is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), so if star_1 has higher excitation, that means higher population in the excited state, so higher temperature.

So for the ratio N_upper/N_lower in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (N1_upper/N1_lower) = 2 * (N2_upper/N2_lower). Or wait, no, the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, perhaps it's
