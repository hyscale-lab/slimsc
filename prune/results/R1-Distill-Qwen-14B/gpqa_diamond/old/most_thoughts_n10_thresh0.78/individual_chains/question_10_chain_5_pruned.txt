Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let's see, the options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A, B, C, D corresponding to them.

Wait, the question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So I'll have to find the density for each option and compare.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that. So if it's Earth's mass and radius, the density would be the same as Earth's. So a's density is 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's given. So density here is 5.5. So that's same as a. Hmm, but wait, if the planet's density is 5.5, which is same as Earth, but it's more massive. Does that affect anything? No, because density is independent of mass when volume scales accordingly. So b's density is 5.5.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Oh, same composition means same density, right? Because composition affects both mass and volume. So if it's similar composition, same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So c's density is 5.5.

Option d: Same composition as Earth but half the mass. So again, same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So d's density is 5.5.

Wait a second. All of them have the same density? That can't be right because the options don't have all the same answer. Wait, no, let me read again.

Wait, no. Option b says the planet has a density of approximately 5.5. So that's given. But options a, c, d refer to same composition as Earth. So for them, same composition would mean same density as Earth, which is 5.5. So all four options have the same density of 5.5. But that can't be, because the question asks which one has the highest.

Wait, am I missing something? Let me think again. Oh wait, option a is Earth
