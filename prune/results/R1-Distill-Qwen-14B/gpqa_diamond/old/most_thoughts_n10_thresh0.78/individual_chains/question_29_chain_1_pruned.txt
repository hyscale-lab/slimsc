Okay, so I have this question about genetics and plant breeding, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for this compound is made up of five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate this anti-nutritional compound by using EMS mutagenesis. So, they're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene function.

The intact gene sequence is given, and there are four mutants. I need to figure out which mutation would likely eliminate the compound. The options are A to D, each corresponding to one of the mutants.

First, I should think about what EMS does. EMS (Ethyl Methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, usually substitutions. It tends to methylate DNA, leading to base changes, especially in regions where replication is more active, like during S phase when the DNA is unwound.

Looking at the gene structure: the gene has exons and introns. The important part is that only exons are transcribed into mRNA, so any mutation in the exons could affect the protein product. But wait, the question says the mutation is in the first exon area. All the mutants have changes in the first exon.

So, the first exon is where the mutation is. The wild-type gene starts with 5’-ATG... and so on. The ATG is the start codon, so any mutation there could be critical.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
The sequence starts with ATGTTCTACGCT... The wild type has TCG, and mutant 1 has TCA. Wait, let me look again. The wild type first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACT... So in the first exon, the wild type is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... 

Mutant 1's sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT... So comparing each position. Let me line them up:

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 

Mutant 1:   ATG TTT CTA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to look for any nonsense mutations (premature stop codons) or missense that might disrupt the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

In each case, the sequences are given. Let me try to compare each mutant to the wild type.

Wild type: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, comparing the two:

Wild
