Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars can be detected based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets through the radial velocity method, right? So its main goal is to measure the Doppler shift in stars very precisely. But in this question, the focus is on whether a star is detectable based on S/N.

The key here is figuring out the S/N per binned pixel after a 1-hour exposure. The condition is S/N >=10. So I need to find out which of these stars meet that threshold.

The stars given are options a to f. Let's list them:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with V=15, 10 pc
d) Star with V=15, 200 pc
e) Star with V=15, 5 pc
f) Star with V=15, 50 pc

Wait, no, wait. Looking again, for c to f, all have absolute V magnitude of 15, but different distances. Oh wait, no, wait. Absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude it would have at 10 pc. So if a star is at another distance, its apparent magnitude will be brighter or fainter. Because the formula for apparent magnitude is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So for each star from c to f, I can calculate their apparent magnitude at Earth (V mag), then figure out the S/N.

But wait, how does the apparent magnitude relate to the S/N? I think the S/N depends on the flux from the star, which is higher for brighter stars (lower apparent magnitude).

ESPRESSO's sensitivityâ€”I need to figure out what's the S/N it can achieve for a star of a given V magnitude in one hour.

I think the ESPRESSO spectrograph's S/N depends on the star's brightness. The formula I vaguely remember is S/N = (flux * exposure time) / noise. But maybe I can find a
