Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants regarding resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The setup is that three genes, G1, G2, and G3, were identified as candidates for contributing to resistance. They made knockout mutants: single mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The idea is that these genes might be involved in a pathway that confers resistance, and knocking them out would reduce the plants' ability to resist the disease.

The data given is the resistance levels as percentages of the control (wild-type). So, higher percentages mean more resistance, lower means more susceptibility.

The results:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less resistant than wild-type, which is 100%. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% resistance. That's a big hitâ€”completely susceptible. So G2's function is crucial for resistance.
- g3: 50% resistance. So, knocking out G3 reduces resistance, but not as much as G1 knockout.
- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's worse than either single mutant. So, combining G1 and G3 knockouts is bad.
- g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. Hmm, so adding g3 to the g2 mutant doesn't change the resistance.
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. So, adding g1 knockout to g2 doesn't make it any worse.

I remember that in genetics, when the double mutant doesn't show a more severe phenotype than one of the single mutants, it's called epistasis. Epistasis occurs when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, for example, if g2g3 has the same resistance as g2, then G3's effect is somehow redundant or dependent on G2.

Wait, but let's think about what each gene might be doing. The question states that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe one gene is regulating the others. Transcription factors typically are upstream, so perhaps G2 is the transcription factor.

Looking at the data, when g2 is knocked out, resistance is 0%. So the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is essential for the resistance mechanism. If G2 is a transcription factor, knocking it out would mean that the downstream genes (like G1 and G3) aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but what about the other mutants? Let's see:

In g1, resistance is 75%. So, when G1 is knocked out, the plant is less resistant but not completely susceptible. So perhaps G1 is part of the resistance pathway but not the main one. Or maybe G1 is part of a parallel pathway.

In g3, resistance is 50%, so when G3 is knocked out, the plant is more susceptible but not as much as g1. Wait, but g3 is 50% which is lower than g1's 75%. So knocking out G3 has a bigger impact than G1. Hmm.

Now looking at the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as g2 alone. So, in the absence of G2, G1's function doesn't matter. That suggests that G1 acts downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, then without it, G1 can't be expressed or can't function, so knocking it out doesn't add anything. So, G2 is epistatic to G1.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0% resistance, same as g2. So knocking out G3 in the absence of G2 doesn't change the resistance level. So G3's function is downstream of G2 as well.

What about g1g3? Resistance is 10%. So, when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single mutant. G1 knockout alone is 75%, G3 is 50%, so together they're 10%. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because knocking out both leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone, which is additive or synergistic.

Wait, but if G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, then each contributes to resistance. So, when you knock out both, the resistance is additive. So 75% (from g1) and 50% (from g3) might not add to 25% because it's not linear,
