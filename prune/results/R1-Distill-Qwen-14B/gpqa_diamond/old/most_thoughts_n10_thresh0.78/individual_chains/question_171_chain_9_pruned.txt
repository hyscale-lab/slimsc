Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me think. The question is about which substituent directs the incoming electrophile to which position on the benzene ring, and how that affects the weight fraction of the para-isomer when bromine is added in excess.

So the compounds are all benzene derivatives with different substituents. The substituents are:

1) С6H5-CH3 (that's toluene, methyl group)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxy ethyl? Wait, no, COOC2H5 is ethyl ester of a carboxylic acid, so the substituent is COOEt, which is an ester group)
Wait, no, the structure is C6H5-COOC2H5. Oh, wait, no, maybe it's an aromatic ester. Wait, no, benzoyl is C6H5-CO-. So if it's C6H5-COOC2H5, that's a benzoyloxy ethyl group? No, wait, no, the structure is a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group which is connected to an O and then ethyl. So the substituent is O-CO-C2H5? No, wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Oh wait, maybe it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached to an ethyl ester. So the substituent is COOEt. So it's a phenyl ester? Hmm, wait, perhaps it's para-substituted, but the substituent itself is a COOEt group.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethyl benzene, ethyl group attached to benzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

So, each of these substituents is on the benzene ring, and when bromine is added in excess, each undergoes electrophilic substitution to form a monobrominated derivative. The question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced, arranged from least to greatest.

Wait, but wait. Electrophilic substitution on a benzene ring with substituents: the substituents are either activating or deactivating, and meta or para directors.

So, I need to figure out for each substituent, whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta directing.

Let me list each substituent:

1. CH3 (toluene): methyl group is an activating, ortho/para director. So the incoming electrophile (Br+) will substitute preferably at ortho, para positions.

2. COOC2H5: this is an ester group. Ester groups are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. Wait, but wait, the ester group is an ortho/para director? Or meta? No, wait, activating groups are ortho/para directors, deactivating groups can be meta or para. Let me think: the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group (due to the carbonyl), so it's deactivating. But ester is an ortho/para director. Wait, no, wait. Wait, nitro groups are meta directors. Ester groups: I think esters are meta directors. Or wait, maybe I mixed up. Let me think: substituents with lone pairs like -OCH3 are activating and para/ortho directors. Groups like -NO2 are deactivating and meta directors. The ester group is -COOR. So in the ester group, the oxygen is part of the carbonyl, which is electron-withdrawing. So the substituent is deactivating. But in terms of directing, I think the ester group is an ortho/para director. Wait, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing by induction, which would deactivate the ring. But the lone pairs on the oxygen may have some resonance. Wait, in the case of esters, the oxygen is adjacent to the carbonyl. So in resonance, the electrons can't easily delocalize into the ring. So the ester group is deactivating and ortho/para directing. Wait, no, wait. I recall that groups like -COOH are deactivating and meta directors. Let me think again: the -COOH group (like in benzoic acid, compound 6) is deactivating and meta-directing. Because the carbonyl is strong electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive, and the substituent directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position.

Wait, but for esters, like -COOEt (compound 2), is it an ortho/para director or meta? Let's think. The ester group has a carbonyl which is EWG, which makes the ring less reactive. But the lone pairs on the oxygen might not be as easily available as in an -OCH3 group. So perhaps the ester group is deactivating but ortho/para directing. Or is it meta? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of some examples. For example, nitration of an ester group. I think esters are meta directors. Or wait, maybe they are ortho/para. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the meta director is when the substituent is strongly deactivating, like nitro groups. Activating groups are OR, NH2, etc., making the ring more reactive and directing ortho and para.

Wait, let me think: the substituent's directing effect depends on whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's ortho/para or meta.

So the substituents:

1. CH3: activating (donates electrons via sigma bonds), ortho/para.

2. COOEt: deactivating (EWG), but is it ortho/para or meta?

3. Cl: deactivating (since Cl is more electronegative, but it's an exception—Cl is ortho/para director but deactivating. Because although the inductive effect is deactivating, the resonance (with lone pairs) can donate electrons, making the ring more reactive in ortho and para positions, but less reactive overall.)

4. NO2: deactivating, meta director.

5. C2H5: ethyl group, similar to methyl, activating, ortho/para.

6. COOH: deactivating, meta director.

Wait, so for substituent 2: COOEt is deactivating. Since the substituent is an ester, which has a carbonyl group. The substituent is meta or ortho/para? Hmm. I think esters are meta directors. Wait, but I'm not so sure. Wait, let me think of another approach. Let's list each substituent and its directing effect.

Substituent | Activating/Deactivating | Ortho/Para/Meta
--- | --- | ---
CH3 | Activating | Ortho/Para
COOEt | Deactivating | ?
Cl | Deactivating (but ortho/para)
NO2 | Deactivating | Meta
C2H5 | Activating | Ortho/Para
COOH | Deactivating | Meta

So for substituent 2 (COOEt), I'm trying to remember. Let's think of the substituents on benzene. The ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating. For directing, the substituent could be either ortho/para or meta. I think ester groups are meta directors. Because the carbonyl is strong EWG. So perhaps substituent 2 is meta-directing.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The nitro group is a strong meta director because it's strongly deactivating. The ester's EWG effect is similar but perhaps not as strong. Wait, another approach: the substituent's electron-donating or withdrawing nature. For example, -OCH3 is activating (donating) and ortho/para; -NO2 is deactivating and meta; -COOH is deactivating and meta; -COOR is deactivating and meta? Or is it ortho/para?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me check from what I remember. For substituents like -COOH and -COOR (ester), they are meta-directing. Because the EWG effect is strong, so the ring is less reactive, and the substituent directs to meta positions.

So substituent 2 (COOEt) is meta-directing.

So substituent 2 is deactivating, meta-directing.

So now, each substituent's effect:

1. CH3: activating, ortho/para. So when bromine is added, the bromine will add in ortho and para positions, but since it's activating, the ring is more reactive. But in the case of substitution, the major product will be a mix of ortho and para, with para being more favored than ortho. Wait, no, the major product is usually para, but sometimes ortho is more substituted if possible.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, we need to know how much the para product is formed.

So if a substituent is ortho/para director, then bromine can add in ortho, meta, and para positions? No, wait, no. For an ortho/para director, the substitution occurs mainly at ortho and para positions, with some preference between them.

Wait, but when the substituent is para to itself, like in toluene, the para position is more substituted than ortho, but the substituent is meta to itself would be ortho. Wait, this might get confusing. Let me think in terms of substituents:

For each substituent, the direction of substitution determines where the Br comes in. Let's think of each substituent's effect on the ring.

- Substituents that are ortho/para directors mean the Br substitutes ortho and para to the substituent. The major product is usually para, but ortho is possible. So for each such substituent, the para isomer is a major part, but the ortho may be a minor.

- Substituents that are meta directors mean Br substitutes meta to the substituent. So in that case, the meta is the major product, and para
