Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). Oh wait, the parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. Right.

First, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are easier to handle. The problem is using relative entropy as the measure for non-Gaussianity, which is given by Δ_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is that of a Gaussian reference state.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (or sometimes called quantum non-Gaussianity) measures how non-Gaussian a state is by comparing it to a Gaussian state of the same parameters. So, the idea is that if a state is Gaussian, its non-Gaussianity would be zero because tau would match rho.

But what is the reference Gaussian state here? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the reference state is a thermal state or a coherent state. Oh, wait! I think for the Schrödinger cat state, the reference Gaussian state is a squeezed state, perhaps? Or maybe the reference is a coherent state with the same first and second moments as the cat state?

Wait, let me think again. The density matrix of the given state is |psi><psi|. So rho is a pure state. The reference state tau is a Gaussian state, probably the best Gaussian approximation to rho.

Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as the cat state. Because, for Gaussian states, the first and second moments (like mean and variance) determine the state uniquely.

Wait, no. I think the reference is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the given state. Because when you compare the non-Gaussian state to the best Gaussian approximation (in terms of moments), the relative entropy would indicate how non-Gaussian the state is.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Compute the density matrix rho of the given state |psi>.
