Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it. Hmm, so the question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic velocities and their detection in a spherical detector. 

Alright, the setup: particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. They produce new particles that move at a certain Lorentz factor. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reaches the inner walls of the detector. Now, the radius of the detector is 30 meters. The question is asking, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls?

Wait, so right now, at a Lorentz gamma of ~20, only one third reach the detector walls. We need to find the gamma that would make it two-thirds reach the walls.

Hmm, I remember that the lifetime of a particle moving at relativistic speeds is longer due to time dilation. But wait, in this case, the particles are fast-decaying, so their decay is probably influenced by their speed. So maybe the proper lifetime is short, but from the lab frame, it appears longer. 

The particles are created at the center of the sphere, so the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is the radius. Oh wait, the radius is 30 meters. So the maximum distance any particle can travel before decaying is 30 meters. But wait, the problem says on average, one third reach the walls. So that depends on their lifetime and the speed. 

So the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is t = distance / speed. Since they're moving at relativistic speeds, their speed is close to c. Let's say speed is v â‰ˆ c, but more precisely, v = beta * c, where beta is v/c.

But the lifetime of the particle, as measured in the lab frame, is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau). So tau is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So the particle will travel a distance of v * gamma tau, because in the lab frame, their lifetime is longer.

Wait, but the distance to the wall is 30 meters. So the distance the particle travels before decaying is v * t, where t is the time they live in the lab frame. So t = gamma * tau. So the distance is beta c gamma tau.

Wait, but
