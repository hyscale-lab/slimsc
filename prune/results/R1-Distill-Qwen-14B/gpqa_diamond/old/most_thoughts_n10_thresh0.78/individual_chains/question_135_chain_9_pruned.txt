Okay, so I've got this physics question about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe that's a typo in the question. Oh wait, probably it's more like L(y) = -λ ψ_f (y) X(y) ψ_f(y) (maybe, since X is a boson and ψ_f are fermions). Or maybe the term is more like a Yukawa coupling. Oh, right, Yukawa interactions are something like g ψ ψ φ, where φ is a scalar. So in this case, the interaction must be between the boson X and a pair of fermions.

So the interaction term is probably something like L = λ X(y) ψ_f(y) ψ_f(y), where ψ_f is a fermion field. So when the boson X decays, it would decay into a pair of fermions. So the possible decay products are fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, but the problem is about the kinematically allowed decays. So the key here is the mass of X (6 GeV) and the masses of the possible fermion pairs.

Because for a decay to be possible, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion (since energy and momentum must be conserved; each fermion must have at least rest mass energy). So the allowed fermions are those with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV (since 6 GeV /2 =3 GeV).

Wait, but wait, what are the masses of the known fermions? Let me think. Let's list the known fermions and their masses
