Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: there are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So, the quantum numbers are l1=1, l2=1, l=2, and m=-1. Hmm.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for both electrons. We need to find the joint probability that both measurements yield eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. So each electron is in a p orbital, which means l=1 for each. Since they are electrons, their spins are involved, but the problem says to ignore spin, so we're only considering their orbital angular momentum here.

The coupled state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the magnetic quantum number m is -1.

Now, when we measure L1z and L2z, each can have possible eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, or +ħ because l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So each Lz can be one of those.

The problem asks for the probability that both are measured as -ħ. So, what's the probability that L1z is -ħ and L2z is also -ħ?

Hmm. I remember that in coupled angular momentum states, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is a linear combination of the product states |l1, m1>|l2, m2>, right? So to find the probability, I need to expand this coupled state into its components in the product basis.

Wait, the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So, I need to find the expansion in terms of |m1, m2>, where m1 is the m for the first electron and m2 for the second.

But wait, when talking about angular momentum coupling, I think the total m is m1 + m2. So in the coupled state, the m is given as -1. So each product state must satisfy m1 + m2 = -1.

But wait the question is about measuring L1z and L2z. So the eigenvalues would be m1 * ħ and m2 * ħ, right? Because Lz |m> = mħ |m>.

So when we measure each L1z, we get m1 * ħ, and L2z would be m2 * ħ. So the product state is |m1, m2>, and when the coupled state is expanded in terms of these, each term gives the possible m1 and m2 values.

So, to find the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1, we need to find the coefficient of the term |m1=-1, m2=-1> in the expansion of the state |l=2, m=-1>.

Wait, but wait. The coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a state with total angular momentum L=2
