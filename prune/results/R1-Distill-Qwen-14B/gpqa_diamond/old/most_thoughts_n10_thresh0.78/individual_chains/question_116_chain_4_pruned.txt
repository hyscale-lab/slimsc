Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with compound A. Let's break down what each part tells me.

First, compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet suggests two neighboring groups with two protons each, maybe like a CH2CH2 group. Wait, but a quartet would be three neighboring protons, but wait, no, quartet would come from a neighboring group with three protons, like a CH2CH(CH3)2 situation? Or maybe something else.

Wait, let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. Protons at 0.9 ppm are usually from CH3 groups attached to something, maybe a branched structure or attached to an oxygen or something. So 6H as a triplet. What structure gives 6H as a triplet? Maybe two equivalent CH3 groups each attached to a CH2 group. Because each CH3 would be next to a CH2 with two protons. So if you have two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2, their protons would split into a triplet. Because each CH3 is next to a -CH2- which has two protons. So the triplet would come from each CH3 group, and since there are two, it's 6H total.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. That suggests each of these protons is split into a quartet, meaning each is adjacent to a group with three protons. Wait, quartet is n+1 where n is number of neighboring protons. So quartet implies three neighbors. So perhaps each of these protons is next to a CH2CH3 group? Or another possibility: maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Wait, but if a CH2 is next to another CH2, each would split into a triplet, not a quartet. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The quartet for 4H. 4H suggests two CH2 groups. Each of these CH2 groups is next to a group with three protons. So maybe the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's cyclopropane? No, that's probably not. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-substituted structure, like maybe a cyclohexane with substituents.

Wait, another thought: the triplet and quartet could be from an ethyl group. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH3 would be a triplet because it's next to a CH2. The CH2 would be a quartet if it's next to another CH2. So wait, but in an ethyl group, the CH2 is next to another CH2 (the CH3), which would make it a triplet, not a quartet. So maybe that's not it.

Wait, perhaps compound A is neopentane? No, neopentane is 2,2-dimethylpropane, which would have a singlet for all the methyl groups. So not that.

Wait, maybe it's 2,2-dimethylbutane or something. Let me think. Let's imagine the structure. If there are two CH3 groups attached to a CH2 group, and that CH2 is connected to another CH2 group, which is connected to another CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3? But wait, the NMR would show different signals. Alternatively, perhaps it's 3-pentane with two methyl groups on the third carbon.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the integration and splitting. 6H as triplet: two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. The quartet is 4H, which could be two CH2 groups. So perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2X or something. Wait, but what would the splitting look like?

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is diethyl ether. Diethyl ether has two CH2CH3 groups. Let me think about their NMR. The CH3 groups in diethyl ether are at around 1.2 ppm as a triplet, but in this case, they have a triplet at 0.9 ppm. Hmm, lower ppm than typical for CH3 in ether. Alternatively, maybe it's a branched ether or something else.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclohexane derivative with substituents.

Wait, another thought: the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Let's count the carbons: 6H from two CH3 groups, 4H from two CH2 groups. So perhaps the structure is (CH3)2CHCH2CH2. Wait, but that would be a five-carbon chain, with substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclopropane ring with substituents.

Wait, perhaps the compound is 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane or something like that. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane with two methyl groups and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's a diether, like 1,4-dioxane. But in that case, the protons would be around 3.5 ppm, I think.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a di-substituted cyclopropane. For example, cyclopropane with two ethyl groups attached. But then the NMR would show different shifts.

Wait, maybe the structure is 3-methylpentane or something. Let me try drawing it.

Wait, another approach: when A undergoes monobromination to form B. So A has a structure that can undergo monobromination, which suggests it has a hydrogen that is relatively reactive for bromination. Maybe allylic bromination, or perhaps substitution. Wait, but if it's monobromination, maybe it's adding a Br to a double bond, but I don't think so because the starting compound A doesn't show any indication of a double bond in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps compound A is cyclopentane or cyclohexane with substituents. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe compound A is a di-substituted ethane. For example, (CH3)2CHCH2CH3 would be pentane with a branch. The NMR would show triplets and maybe a quartet.

Wait, let's think about the splitting. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H): perhaps two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. So the structure would have two CH3 groups attached to a CH2, which is then attached to another CH2 group. So maybe (CH3)2CHCH2CH2X or something. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3)2CHCH2CH2CH3, but that's 2-methylbutane, I think.

Wait
