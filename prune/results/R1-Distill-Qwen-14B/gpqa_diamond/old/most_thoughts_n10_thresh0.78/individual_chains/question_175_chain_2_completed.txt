Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me think. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of wavelength and angle theta. The setup is an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with the symmetry along the z-axis.

Wait, the problem says it's oscillating, so it must emit electromagnetic radiation. I remember that oscillating charges can be sources of radiation, and the radiation's properties depend on the charge distribution and its motion.

The key here is the form of the radiated power function f, and the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at theta = 30 degrees. The options give possible fractions and power dependencies on lambda.

I recall that for a dipole radiator, which might be the case here since it's spheroidal and oscillating, the radiation pattern has a specific angular dependence. Oh right, the radiation from a dipole is maximum at the equator (theta = 90 degrees) and falls off as theta decreases. The formula for the radiation pattern is something like sin^2(theta) for the intensity. Wait, no, I think the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta) for a dipole, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Because for a dipole, the far-field radiation pattern is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) in some cases? Or wait, I think the radiation pattern for a dipole varies as sin^2(theta), meaning it's highest at 90 degrees and zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180). Or wait, no, that's the electric dipole's radiation pattern.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The intensity pattern for a dipole is actually proportional to (sin^2(theta)). So the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, and it's zero at theta=0 and 180. That makes sense because the dipole's field is strongest perpendicular to the axis.

So given that, the power per unit solid angle at a given theta is proportional to sin^2(theta). So the maximum would be at theta=90 degrees, with sin(theta)=1. So the maximum power A would correspond to f_max = f(90) = something.

But the question isn't directly about the maximum; it's asking what's the fraction of A at theta=30 degrees. So, the function f as a function of theta is sin^2(theta), and the maximum is at 90 degrees, where f is 1. At 30 degrees, sin(theta) is 0.5, so sin^2(theta) is (0.25). Therefore, the fraction at 30 degrees would be 0.25 times the maximum. So the fraction is 1/4.

Wait, but wait, that's the angular part. What about the dependence on lambda? The problem says f is a function of lambda and theta. So the power also depends on the wavelength.

I remember that the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (acceleration)^2, and the radiation's power depends on the frequency. But in terms of lambda, since lambda is 2πc divided by frequency, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact dependence.

Wait, for a dipole antenna, the radiation resistance and power depend on the frequency. The radiated power is proportional to (omega^4), where omega is the angular frequency. Since omega is 2π times the frequency, and frequency is c / lambda, omega is 2πc / lambda. So omega^4 would be (2π)^4 * c^4 / lambda^4. So the power is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

So the function f would have a dependency of 1/lambda^4, multiplied by the angular term, which is sin^2(theta). So f(theta) = k * sin^2(theta) / lambda^4.

Thus, the maximum power A would be at theta=90 degrees, so sin(theta)=1, so A = k / lambda^4.

The question asks, what fraction of A is the power at theta=30 degrees? So the fraction is (k sin^2(30) / lambda^4) divided by (k / lambda^4) ), which simplifies to sin^2(30). Sin(30) is 0.5, so 0.5^2 = 0.25. So the fraction is 1/4.

Now looking at the options, the fraction is 1/4, and the function f has a lambda^-4 dependence.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4.

So the correct option should be C.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength \(\lambda\). The radiated power per unit solid angle, \(f(\lambda, \theta)\), depends on \(\lambda\) and the angle \(\theta\) relative to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \(A\) radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) and the functional form of \(f\).

For a dipole radiator, the angular dependence of the radiated power is proportional to \(\sin^2(\theta)\). The maximum power occurs at \(\theta = 90^\circ\), where \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\). At \(\theta = 30^\circ\), \(\sin(30^\circ) = 0.5\), so \(\sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25\). This means that the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\).

The radiated power also depends on \(\lambda\). For an oscillating dipole, the power radiated is proportional to \(\omega^4\), where \(\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda\) is the angular frequency. Substituting \(\omega\), the power is proportional to \(1/\lambda^4\). Thus, the function \(f(\lambda, \theta)\) has the form \(f \propto \sin^2(\theta) / \lambda^4\).

From the given options, the fraction of the maximum power at \(\theta = 30^\circ\) is \(1/4\), and the functional form of \(f\) is \(\lambda^{-4}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
