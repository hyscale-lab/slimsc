Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through this.

The problem says that Ay is a 2x2 matrix and is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. Oh wait, c is h/(4π), right? And S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I guess S is a Pauli matrix or something similar. Oh yeah, the Pauli matrices are used in spin-1/2 systems, which makes sense because a muon is a spin-1/2 particle.

The task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So I'm thinking, eigenvalues of a matrix satisfy the equation Ay |φ> = a |φ>, where a is the eigenvalue. Since Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by the eigenvalues of S.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of S? Let me think. S is a 2x2 matrix with rows [0 -i; i 0]. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(S - λ I) = 0.

Calculating the determinant: (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (i*(-i)) = λ² - (1) because i*(-i) is -i² = -(-1) =1. So λ² -1 =0 → λ²=1 → λ= ±1. So S has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Then, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c multiplied by these. Since c is h/(4π), so a = c * λ → a = (h/(4π)) * (±1). So the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the real parts are ±h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero because they're real numbers. Wait, that's important.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and real part ±h/(4π). But wait, no, because our eigenvalues are real. So the imaginary part is zero. So option A can't be correct because it suggests non
