Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR part. The problem states that there's a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in the IR spectrum, especially around that region, usually indicate the presence of O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Also, the strong absorption at 1700 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have both O-H and C=O, so that fits. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. The problem mentions that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, like in alkenes. So the molecule doesn't have any double bonds, which makes sense because the FTIR doesn't show any peaks around 1650-1600 cm⁻¹, which are typical for C=C. So no alkenes here.

The NMR has some specific splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. Splitting patterns in NMR arise from neighboring protons. The more neighbors a proton has, the more splitting occurs. Let me think about what each of these means.

A doublet of triplets would mean that the proton is next to two different sets of protons. Wait, not exactly. Let me remember: each split corresponds to neighboring protons. So for each neighbor, the signal splits into (n+1) peaks, where n is the number of equivalent protons.

A quartet is a triplet of doublets? Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about each splitting step. The first term is the most intense splitting.

So, a doublet of triplets of quartets: That implies first splitting into a doublet, then each of those splits into triplets, and then each of those splits into quartets. Alternatively, maybe it's a first-order splitting where the order is considered from each coupling. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet of doublets, but the wording here is a bit confusing. Wait, the first part is a doublet, then a triplet, then a quartet. Let me think of it as each split happening in sequence.

So, the first split is a doublet (coupled to one set of H with 1 neighboring proton?), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the proton is coupled to three different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants.

Wait, perhaps the splitting is due to multiple neighboring groups. For example, a proton adjacent to two different groups, each with their own number of protons. Let me think of an example. Suppose a CH group next to two different CH2 groups. But maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe it's a geminal coupling? Wait, geminal protons are on the same carbon. But geminal coupling is usually considered in geminal diastereotopic protons, but in most cases, they're not considered in routine NMR unless under specific conditions.

Wait, perhaps the structure has branching, leading to multiple neighboring groups. Let me look at the options.

The options are:

A) CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH

B) CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH

C) CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH

D) CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3
