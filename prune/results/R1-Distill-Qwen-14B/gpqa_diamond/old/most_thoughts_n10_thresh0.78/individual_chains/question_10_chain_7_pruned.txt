Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a to d.

Let me read the question again. The options describe different planets:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius. So same as Earth, right? Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that from somewhere. So this planet has the same density as Earth.

b) 2 Earth masses and density of 5.5. Wait, that's same as Earth's density? But the mass is higher. Hmm, but density is mass over volume. So if the mass is double, but the density is same, then the volume must be twice that of Earth. Wait, but Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg and radius 6.37e6 meters. If this planet has twice the mass but same density, does its radius change?

Let me think. Density (d) = mass (m) / volume (v). Volume is (4/3)πr³. So if density is same, then (mass)/(volume) is same. If mass doubles, then volume must also double. So volume is proportional to r³. So if volume doubles, radius is cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. So planet b would have a radius larger than Earth's but same density. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth.

c) Same composition as Earth but 5 times Earth's mass. Oh, same composition. So same density as Earth. Because composition affects density. Like, if it's made of similar materials, their densities would be the same. So if Earth is 5.5, this planet also has 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, is that correct? Because more massive same composition would imply same density. Because density is determined by the material. So for example, if you have two objects made of same material, one bigger than the other, their densities are the same.

But wait, the mass is 5 times Earth's. So if mass is 5x and same density, the volume is 5x as well.
