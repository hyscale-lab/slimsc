Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh wait, Li usually has 3 protons, right? So Li with 3 neutrons would be Li-6, I think, since 3 protons plus 3 neutrons makes 6 nucleons in total.

So first, I need to figure out the mass of this Li-6 nucleus. The mass number A is 6. Now, the mass of a nucleus can be approximated by the sum of the masses of its constituent protons and neutrons, minus the mass defect due to binding energy. But wait, maybe there's a simpler way. I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the formula m = m_p * Z + m_n * N - binding energy terms, but perhaps for this problem, it's better to use the concept of relativistic energy.

Wait, the problem is about relativistic energy, so I need to use the relativistic energy equation. The total energy E of a particle is given by E = gamma * m_0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I'll compute gamma for v = 0.96c.

Let me calculate gamma. So v is 0.96c. Plugging into gamma's formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2). Let me compute 0.96 squared. 0.96 * 0.96 = 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that. 0.28 times what is 1? Oh, 1/0.28 is about 3.5714. Correct.

Now, the mass of the nucleus X is Li-6. The mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the total mass is (3 * 938) + (3 * 939.565) MeV/c². Let me compute that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV. 3 * 939.565 is 3 * 939.565 = let's see: 939.565 * 3. 900*3 is 2700, 39.565 *3 is 118.695. So 2700 + 118.695 = 2818.695 MeV. So total is 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV. So about 5632.7 MeV, which is 5.6327 GeV. Wait, because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV, right.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the atomic mass of Li-6. Because sometimes the mass of a nucleus is given in terms of atomic mass units. Another approach is to look up the exact mass of Li-6. Let me think: the exact mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6.013 atomic mass units (u). Hmm, because each nucleon (proton or neutron) contributes roughly 1 u, but with some adjustments.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The exact mass of Li-6 in atomic mass units. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.013 u. So converting that to GeV/c² using the conversion factor 1 u ≈ 931.5 MeV/c². So 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u = let's compute that.

6.013 * 931.5 = let's see. 6 * 931.5 is 5589 MeV. 0.013 * 931.5 is about 12.1095 MeV. So total is 5589 +12.1095 = 5601.1095 MeV, which is 5.6011 GeV. Hmm, earlier I had 5.6327 GeV when adding protons and neutrons. So why the discrepancy? Oh, because the actual mass is slightly less than the sum due to the binding energy. So using the exact mass is better here, which is about 6.013 u.

So m_0 c² of the nucleus is 6.013 u * 931.5 MeV/u = 5601.1 MeV, which is 5.6011 GeV.

So now, the total energy E is gamma * m_0 c². Gamma is approximately 3.5714, so E is 3.5714 * 5.6011 GeV.

Let me compute that. 3 *5.6011 is 16.8033. 0.5714 *5.6011 is approximately 0.5714 *5 = 2.857, 0.5714 *0.6011≈0.3435. So 2.857 + 0.3435 ≈3.2005. So total is 16.8033 +3.2005≈20.0038 GeV. Wait, but I think I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, maybe just calculate 3.5714 *5.6011.

3.5714 *5.6011:

Let me compute 3.5 *5.6011 = 19.60385.

0.0714 *5.6011 ≈ 0.4019.

So total is approximately 19.60385 +0.4019 =20.00575 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, and option B is 23.06
