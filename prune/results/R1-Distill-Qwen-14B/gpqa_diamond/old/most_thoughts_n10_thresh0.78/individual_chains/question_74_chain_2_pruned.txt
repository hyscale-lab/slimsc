Okay, so I have this physics problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over a given time. Let me think about the question again.

The question says that we have an atom which has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So that means, if we have a lot of these atoms, 32% of them will decay in 100 minutes. But here, we're talking about a single atom, and 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Now, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait. So the total time from now would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the given probability is for 100 minutes. Hmm.

Wait, I think the key here is that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay law. The probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So each moment is independent. So if the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability for the next 150 minutes should be calculated based on the remaining time, not the total.

Wait, let me get this straight. The decay probability within a certain time is given by the equation N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. Or wait, the probability of decay is
