Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the structure of the starting molecule. The name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let's dissect that. Non means nine carbons in a chain. The '2,6-diene' part tells me there are double bonds at positions 2 and 6. So the structure would have double bonds between C2-C3 and C6-C7. 

Wait, but wait. The substituents matter too. The '5-but' refers to a butyl group attached at carbon 5. Butyl is four carbons. So the structure is a nine-carbon chain with double bonds at 2 and 6, and a butyl group attached to the fifth carbon.

Wait, let me draw the structure. So the main chain is nine carbons long. Let's number them 1 to 9. So 2,6-diene means double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. The substituent is a butyl group on carbon 5. Butyl is -CH2CH2CH2CH2-, but wait, butyl can be in different positions. Wait, but it's 5-butylnona... so the substituent is on carbon 5. So carbon 5 has a butyl group attached.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, when substituents are named, the longest chain is chosen, and the substituents are numbered to give the lowest possible numbers. So butyl is a four-carbon substituent. So the structure would have a butyl group on C5 of the nine-carbon chain. So the molecule is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, not quite. Let me think.

Wait, nona is nine carbons. The main chain is nine, with double bonds at
