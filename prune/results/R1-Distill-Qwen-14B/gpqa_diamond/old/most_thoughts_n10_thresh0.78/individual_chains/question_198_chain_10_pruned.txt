Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and see what I can figure out.

The problem is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (β) are used in the formation of complexes. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β1 is for the first complex, maybe [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)₂]^2+, and so on. Wait, actually, the numbering can sometimes be a bit tricky. Usually, βn refers to the complex with n ligands. So β1 is the first ionization, β2 the second, etc. So each β corresponds to adding another SCN⁻.

The question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex. So that's the second complex, right? So β2 is 40, the one we're interested in.

But wait, the problem asks for the blue dithiocyanato. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)₂]^2+ complex. So the percentage is the fraction of all Co species that are in this dithiocyanato form.

I remember that when multiple complexes can form, the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. So we need to calculate the fraction of each possible complex.

The approach might involve using the formation constants (β) and the concentrations to find the mole fractions of each complex.

The general approach for such problems is to consider all possible complexes, calculate their concentrations using the given β values and the concentrations of Co²+ and SCN⁻, then sum them up to find the mole fractions.

Wait, but how are these βs used exactly? Stability constant β is defined as [CoL_n]/([CoL_{n-1}}][L]),
