Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the given phase shifts are δ0 =90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, and δ4=13°. And we're told to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider these five phase shifts. The electrons are at 50 MeV, but I don't know if their energy is directly relevant here since the question is about the scattering amplitude's imaginary part based on phase shifts.

Wait, I remember something about partial waves and scattering amplitudes. Oh right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is related to the partial wave expansion. The general formula I think is f(θ) = sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) * exp(iδ_l - i l π/2) * (something with Legendre polynomials). Wait, no, maybe more precise: f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) exp(2iδ_l) P_l(cosθ) / (something), or wait, I might be mixing up some terms.

Wait, the partial wave expansion formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [exp(2iδ_l) - 1] P_l(cosθ), where k is the wave number, right? Or maybe it's (1/(2ik)) times (2l+1) times [exp(2iδ_l) - 1] multiplied by the Legendre polynomial. Wait, I think I might be getting the exact form wrong.

Alternatively, another approach: the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is given by the optical theorem. Oh wait, but the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Wait, along the incident beam direction would mean θ=0 degrees, I suppose. Because the incident direction is when the angle is zero; the scattering is forward.

Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0. I remember that the imaginary part is related to the total cross-section. The optical theorem states that the total cross-section σ_total is equal to 4π/k² times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude (Im f(0)). So, σ_total = (4π/k²) Im f(0).

But wait, the question is asking to compute Im f(0). So perhaps I can find f(0), take its imaginary part.

So f(θ) is given by the partial wave expansion: f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [exp(2iδ_l) - 1] P_l(cosθ) / (2ik), where k is the wave number.

At θ=0, cosθ = 1, so P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for any l. So when θ=0, each term in the sum becomes (2l+1)[exp(2iδ_l) - 1] * (1) / (2ik). So summing over all l, f(0) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l) -1) / (2ik).

But wait, that's for f(0). We're interested in the imaginary part of f(0). So let me compute Im f(0).

So Im f(0) = Im [ sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l) -1) / (2ik) ].

Let me factor out the 1/(2ik) from the sum, so it's (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l) -1) ].

But I'm interested in the imaginary part of this. So let's compute the imaginary part of each term in the sum.

Each term is (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l) -1). Let's expand exp(2iδ_l) as cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). So exp(2iδ_l) -1 is [cos(2δ_l) -1] + i sin(2δ_l).

So the term becomes (2l+1)[ (cos(2δ_l)-1) + i sin(2δ_l) ].

Multiply that by 1/(2ik). So the entire expression becomes [sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l)-1 + i sin(2δ_l)) ] * 1/(2ik).

To find the imaginary part, let's consider that 1/(2ik) = (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = -i/(2k). So when we multiply each term by -i/(2k), the imaginary part will come from the real part of the sum, because the multiplication by -i introduces an imaginary component.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to just compute the imaginary part by considering that for each term:

The term (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l) -1) = (2l+1)( [cos(2δ_l)-1] + i sin(2δ_l) )

So the imaginary part of this is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

But when we have a complex number A + iB, and we multiply it by a complex number C + iD, the imaginary part is something, but in this case, we have each term being (real part) + i (another part). So when multiplied by 1/(2ik) which is -i/(2k), each term's contribution to the imaginary part of f(0) would be:

Let me think about it step by step.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

Multiply this by 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k):

So (2l+1)[ (cos(2δ_l)-1) + i sin(2δ_l) ] * (-i/(2k)).

Let me compute this:

Multiply term by term:

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l)-1) * (-i/(2k)) + i sin(2δ_l) * (-i/(2k)) ]

= (2l+1) [ (-i (cos(2δ_l)-1) )/(2k) + (-i^2 sin(2δ_l))/(2k) ]

But since i^2 = -1, the second term becomes (- (-1) sin(2δ_l))/(2k) ) = sin(2δ_l)/(2k).

So the sum of terms becomes:

(2l+1) [ (-i (cos(2δ_l)-1) )/(2k) + sin(2δ_l)/(2k) ]

Now, when we sum all terms, f(0) is the sum of these. But we are looking for the imaginary part of f(0).

Looking at each term, the first part is imaginary (because of the -i), and the second part is real (sin(2δ_l)/(2k)).

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) * [ (- (cos(2δ_l) -1 )) / (2k) ].

So the total imaginary part of f(0) is the sum over all l of (2l+1) [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) / (2k) ] multiplied by (-1) from the -i.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

Each term's imaginary component is (2l+1) * [ (-i (cos(2δ_l)-1)) / (2k) ].

So the imaginary part is (2l+1) * [ (1 - cos(2δ_l)) / (2k) ] * (-i) multiplied by i from the initial term? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute Im f(0) as the sum over l of (2l+1) [ sin(2δ_l) ] / (2k) ].

Wait, because when I look at the term (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l) -1) / (2ik), the imaginary part of that is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k). Because when you have (a + ib)/(c + id), you can compute the imaginary part, but perhaps in this case, since 2ik is in the denominator, maybe it's simpler.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again.

Each term is (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l) - 1)/(2ik).

Let me compute the imaginary part of this term. Let me consider a general complex number z = A + iB, then Im(z) = B.

So for each term, (2l+1)( [exp(2iδ) - 1] ) / (2ik) = (2l+1)( [cos(2δ) -1 + i sin(2δ) ] ) / (2ik).

We can write the denominator as 2ik = 2i k.

So the term becomes (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ) -1)/(2ik) + i sin(2δ)/(2ik) ].

Let me compute this:

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ) -1) / (2ik) ) + (i sin(2δ)) / (2ik) ) ]

Simplify each part:

The second term: i sin(2δ) / (2ik) = [ i/(2ik) ) ] sin(2δ) = [ 1/(2k) ] sin(2δ ).

The first term: (cos(2δ) -1) / (2ik) = [ (cos(2δ)-1) / (2i k) ) ]

Which is [ (cos(2δ)-1) / (2k) ] * (1/i) = [ (cos(2δ)-1) / (2k) ] * (-i ), since 1/i = -i.

So putting it together:

Term = (2l+1) [ (-i (cos(2δ)-1) )/(2k) + (sin(2δ))/(2k) ]

So the imaginary part of the term is the coefficient of 'i' in this expression. Wait, but the term is a complex number, so the imaginary part is the coefficient of 'i'.

Wait, let's see: the term is [ real part ] + i [ something ].

Wait, the first part is (-i (cos(2δ)-1))/(2k), which is a purely imaginary term. The second part is real: sin(2δ)/(2k).

So the entire term is:

(2l+1) [ real part + i * ( (1 - cos(2δ)) / (2k) ) ]

Because the first part is (-i)(cos(2δ)-1)/(2k) = i (1 - cos(2δ)) / (2k ), since - (cos(2δ)-1) = (1 - cos(2δ)).

So the term's imaginary part is (2l+1) * (1 - cos(2δ)) / (2k ).

So adding all l terms, the imaginary part of f(0) is sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l)) / (2k ), since we only have l=0 to l=4.

Wait, but in the problem statement, we are told to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, so we can stop at l=4.

So the formula becomes:

Im f(0) = [ sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l)) ] / (2k )

Now, we need to compute this sum.

But wait, what is k? Because k is the wave number, which is given by k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but I think in terms of energy, perhaps it's better to compute k in terms of the given energy.

Wait, the electrons have energy E =50 MeV. But wait, the electrons are 50 MeV electrons. But wait, are they 50 MeV per electron, or 50 MeV in some other form? Wait, energy in scattering is usually given as the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm, but for non-relativistic speeds, perhaps we can approximate. Wait, 50 MeV is a lot; electrons have rest mass about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is 97 times their rest mass. So relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but perhaps the problem just expects me to use the non-relativistic expression for k.

Wait, but wait, what's the formula for k? The wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but this is non-relativistic. However, since E is given in MeV, and m is the electron mass, which is about 0.511 MeV/c². So maybe we can compute k in units where ħ = c =1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but perhaps there's another approach. The wave number k is related to the scattering angle in the Born approximation, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is given by k = (sqrt(2mE)) / ħ. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, using E = ħ²k²/(2m), which is the non-relativistic formula. So k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But I'm not sure about the exact expression, perhaps I need to compute k in some unit system.

But wait, the problem is giving the options in fm, which is femtometers, 10^-15 meters. So k would be in units of 1/fm, or inverse femtometers.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute k in units where ħ=1 and c=1, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I can compute k using E = 50 MeV.

E is the kinetic energy of the electron. But for electrons, when E is much larger than their rest mass (511 keV), the non-relativistic formula may not hold. So perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the energy.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). But if E is the kinetic energy, then E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) - m c^2.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that E is the total energy, so E = pc for electrons when E >> m c². Because for high energies, the term m c² is negligible compared to pc. So in that case, E ≈ pc, and p ≈ E/c.

But then, the wave number k is given by k = p/ħ. So if p ≈ E/(c), then k = E/(ħ c).

But units can be tricky here. Let me think: if E is in MeV, and ħ c is about 197.33 MeV fm (since ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s, and c is about 3×10^8 m/s, so ħ c ≈ 197.3 MeV fm).

So E=50 MeV, so k = E/(ħ c) = 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm. So 50 MeV divided by 197.33 MeV fm is 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the wave number k is given by sqrt(2mE)/ħ, using the non-relativistic formula, but since E is 50 MeV, which is way larger than the rest mass, maybe this isn't the right approach. But perhaps the problem expects this non-relativistic approach.

Let me compute k using both methods to see if it makes a difference.

First, non-relativistic approach: E = (ħ²k²)/(2m). So k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

E is 50 MeV. Let me convert E to Joules.

1 eV = 1.602×10^-19 J. So 50 MeV = 50e6 eV = 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J = 8.01e-13 J.

m is the electron mass, about 9.109e-31 kg.

So k = sqrt( 2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J ) / ħ

Compute numerator: 2 * 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-13 = 2 * 9.109e-31 * 8.01e-13 ≈ 2 * 7.296e-43 ≈ 1.459e-42.

sqrt(1.459e-42) ≈ 3.822e-21 m^-1. But wait, let's compute the exact value.

Wait, sqrt( (2mE) ) = sqrt(2 * 9.109e-31 kg * 8.01e-13 J )

= sqrt( 2*9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 )

= sqrt( 145.9e-44 )

Wait, 2 *9.109e-31 is 1.8218e-30, multiplied by 8.01e-13 is 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13 = 1.459e-42.

sqrt(1.459e-42) = approx 3.822e-21 m⁻¹.

But ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = (3.822e-21 m⁻¹) / (1.05457e-34 J·s) ) = 3.822e-21 / 1.05457e-34 ≈ 3.625e13 m⁻¹.

Wait, that's 3.625e13 inverse meters, which is 3.625e13 m⁻¹. That's a huge number. Wait, but that can't be right because when E is much larger than the rest mass, the non-relativistic approach isn't valid, so I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps the non-relativistic approach isn't applicable here, and the relativistic approach is better.

In the relativistic case, for E >> m c², E ≈ pc, so p = E/(c).

Then, ħ k = p → k = p/ħ = E/(c ħ).

Compute this: E=50 MeV = 50e6 eV.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, E in Joules: 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = 8.01e-12 J.

Then, k = E/(c ħ) = (8.01e-12 J) / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s )

Compute denominator: 3e8 * 1.0545718e-34 = 3.1637e-26 m·J·s / s = 3.1637e-26 m·J.

Wait, units: J is kg m²/s², so denominator is (m/s) * (J·s) ) = (m/s) * (kg m²/s² * s) ) = kg m²/s.

Wait, maybe better to compute numerically:

k = (8.01e-12) / (3e8 * 1.05457e-34 ) 

= 8.01e-12 / (3.1637e-26 )

≈ 8.01e-12 / 3.1637e-26 ≈ 2.53e14 m⁻¹.

But that's still a very large k, which would make Im f(0) very small. Hmm, but none of the options are that small.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem uses natural units where ħ = c =1, which is common in high-energy physics. In that case, E in MeV would correspond to units where k is in MeV⁻¹, but you need to convert to fm⁻¹.

Wait, 1 fm⁻¹ is approximately 0.197 GeV (since ħ c ≈ 197 MeV fm → 1 fm⁻¹ ≈ 197 MeV). So 50 MeV would correspond to k ≈50 / 197 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that matches my earlier estimate. So I think using k ≈50 / (197.33) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹ is correct.

So k ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Now, back to the sum.

We need to compute sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l )).

Let me compute each term for l=0 to l=4.

Given phase shifts:

δ0 =90°, which is π/2 radians.

δ1=67°, which is about 1.169 radians.

δ2=55°, 0.9599 radians.

δ3=30°, 0.5236 radians.

δ4=13°, 0.2269 radians.

Compute each (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l)).

l=0:

(2*0 +1) =1.

2δ0 = 180°, which is pi. cos(180°)= -1.

So 1 - (-1) = 2.

So term = 1 * 2 =2.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3.

2δ1=134°, cos(134°) is cos(180-46)= -cos(46)≈-0.6947.

So 1 - (-0.6947) =1.6947.

Term =3 *1.6947 ≈5.084.

l=2:

(2*2+1)=5.

2δ2=110°, cos(110°)=cos(90+20)= -sin(20)≈-0.3420.

So 1 - (-0.3420)=1.3420.

Term=5 *1.3420≈6.71.

l=3:

(2*3+1)=7.

2δ3=60°, cos(60)=0.5.

1 - 0.5 =0.5.

Term=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:

(2*4+1)=9.

2δ4=26°, cos(26)= approx 0.8988.

1 - 0.8988≈0.1012.

Term=9 *0.1012≈0.9108.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 2

l=1: 5.084 → total 7.084

l=2:6.71 → total 13.794

l=3:3.5 → 17.294

l=4:0.9108 →18.2048.

So sum is approximately 18.2048.

Now, Im f(0)= sum/(2k) = 18.2048 / (2 *0.253 ) 

Compute denominator: 2 *0.253 =0.506.

18.2048 / 0.506 ≈35.99.

Wait, but wait, the units? Because the options are in femtometers (fm). So the Im f(0) is in units of 1/(fm), because k is in fm⁻¹. Or wait, no: because f(θ) has units of inverse length. Because cross-section is in barns (cm²), so f has units of (4π/k²) * Im f(0), but perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, the problem asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, which is f(θ). Since f(θ) is dimensionless in certain unit systems, but in natural units (where ħ = c =1), f has units of inverse length. But in our calculation, k is in fm⁻¹, so Im f(0) would be in fm⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, our calculation for Im f(0) is in units of 1/(fm), because k is 1/fm, and Im f(0) is sum/(2k), which is (dimensionless) * 1/(fm).

But the options are in fm. So perhaps I have a mistake in the units.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is sum/(2k), which in units where k is in 1/fm, so Im f(0) would be in 1/fm. But the options are in fm. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = sum/(2k) multiplied by something. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula I have is Im f(0) = [sum (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l)) ]/(2k).

Wait, but perhaps I missed a factor of ħ in the units. Because in the formula, k is in 1/fm, and the scattering amplitude f has units of fm⁻¹, so the result would be in fm⁻¹. But the options are in fm, which is the inverse unit. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = [sum ... ]/(2k), but if k is in 1/fm, then Im f(0) would be in fm. Because 1/k is in fm, and the sum is dimensionless.

Wait, in our calculation, k was approximately 0.253 fm⁻¹. So 1/k is approximately 3.95 fm.

So Im f(0) is sum/(2k) = 18.2048/(2*0.253 ) ≈18.2048/(0.506) ≈35.99.

But wait, the sum is 18.2048, and 2k is 0.506, so 18.2048 / 0.506 ≈35.99.

So Im f(0) ≈35.99 (in units of 1/(fm)), but the options are in fm. Hmm, that doesn't match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = [sum (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l)) ]/(2k) * ħ/(2m_e c^2) or something, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have included factors of 2m or something else in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the formula for the scattering amplitude. Let me recall. The partial wave expansion is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ exp(2iδ_l) - 1 ] P_l(cosθ).

So at θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1. So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l)-1).

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im [ (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)(exp(2iδ_l)-1) ]

Which is Im [ (1/(2ik)) * sum ... ]

Which is Im [ (1/(2ik)) * sum ... ]

Expressed as (sum ... )/(2ik).

The imaginary part of this is (sum ... )/(2k) * (1/(i)) ), but wait, 1/i is -i.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to write 1/(2ik) as (1/(2i)) * (1/k) = (-i/2) * (1/k). So when you multiply by the sum, the imaginary part comes from the real part of the sum multiplied by (-i/2k), so the imaginary part is [ sum (2l+1)(1 - cos(2δ_l)) ]/(2k) ), because when you have a term like (a + ib) * (-i/2k), the imaginary part is (a) * (-1)/(2k), and the real part is (b) * (1)/(2k), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the imaginary part as Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)/(2k).

Wait, because exp(2iδ) -1 = [cos(2δ) -1] + i sin(2δ). So the imaginary part of (exp(2iδ) -1) is sin(2δ).

So when you have (2l+1)(exp(2iδ) -1)/(2ik), the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2δ) / (2k).

So Im f(0) = sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)/(2k).

Ah! Maybe that's the correct approach. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier by considering (1 - cos(2δ)) instead of sin(2δ).

So perhaps the correct sum is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) / (2k).

Wait, let me re-express the term. exp(2iδ) -1 = e^{i 2δ} -1 = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) -1 = [cos(2δ) -1] + i sin(2δ).

So the imaginary part of (exp(2iδ) -1) is sin(2δ).

Thus, each term in the sum contributes (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) to the imaginary part, scaled by (1/(2ik)).

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k).

So the total Im f(0) is sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)/(2k).

Ah, that makes more sense. So earlier, I think I used the wrong expression. I should have used sin(2δ) instead of (1 - cos(2δ)).

So let's recalculate using this new approach.

Each term is:

(2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) / (2k).

Compute each l:

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°, sin(180°)=0. So term=1 * 0/(2k)=0.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134)≈sin(46)≈0.7193.

So term=3 * 0.7193 / (2k) ≈ (2.1579)/(2k) = 2.1579/(2*0.253) ≈2.1579/0.506≈4.265.

Wait, but wait, no. Because the sum is (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l), then divided by (2k).

Wait, no, for each term, it's (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l)/(2k), so the overall sum is sum of these terms.

Wait, let me compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin(180) = 0 → 0/(2k) =0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°)= 3 * sin(134) ≈3 * 0.6691=2.0073 → 2.0073/(2k) ≈2.0073/(0.506) ≈3.966.

l=2:5 * sin(110°)=5 * sin(110)≈5 *0.9397≈4.6985 → 4.6985/(2k)= 4.6985/0.506≈9.285.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7*(√3/2)=7*0.8660≈6.062 →6.062/(2k)=6.062/0.506≈12.0.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9*0.4384≈3.9456 →3.9456/(2k)=3.9456/0.506≈7.801.

Now sum all terms:

l=0:0

l=1:≈3.966

l=2:≈9.285 → total 13.251

l=3:≈12.0 → 25.251

l=4:≈7.801 →33.052.

So Im f(0) ≈33.052.

But wait, the options are in the hundreds or thousands. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, but wait, let's double-check the sin values.

sin(134)=sin(180-46)=sin(46)=0.7193? Wait, no, sin(134 degrees) is sin(46 degrees), which is about 0.7193? Wait no, wait, 46 degrees is about 0.7193, but 134 degrees is in the second quadrant, so sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193.

Wait, no, 134 is 180-46=134, so yes, sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193.

So for l=1: 3 * 0.7193 =2.1579 → 2.1579/(2k)=2.1579/(0.506)≈4.265.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 3.966, but I must have made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 2.1579 / 0.506.

2.1579 / 0.506 → 4.265.

Similarly:

l=2:5 * sin(110) =5 * sin(70)=5 *0.9397≈4.6985 → 4.6985 / 0.506 ≈9.285.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660≈6.062 →6.062/0.506≈12.0.

l=4:9 * sin(26°)=9 *0.4384≈3.9456 →3.9456/0.506≈7.801.

So sum is:

4.265 +9.285=13.55 → +12.0=25.55 → +7.801=33.351.

So Im f(0)=33.351.

But wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, none of these match 33.35 fm. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula should include 1/(2k) as 1/(2k) in the denominator, but when considering the correct units.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by the factor of 2m or some other term.

Wait, another thought: The scattering amplitude f has units of (4π/k) * (Im f(0)), so the cross-section sigma is 4π/k² * Im f(0). But perhaps I'm confusing the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the formula Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) * (1/(2k)).

But that gives me 33.35 when k is 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, but 33.35 is in units of 1/fm, which would be inverse femtometers. But the options are in femtometers. Hmm, this suggests I may have made a mistake in the k calculation.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k was miscalculated. Let me re-calculate k.

Earlier, using the relativistic approach, I get k= E/(ħ c) ≈50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) )=50/197.33≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But perhaps the correct approach is to include the rest mass. So let's compute k correctly.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

But for electrons, m c²=0.511 MeV. Since 50 MeV is much larger, E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/c = (50 MeV c) / c =50 MeV.

Then, k = p / ħ = (50 MeV c) / ( ħ c ) ) =50 MeV / ħ c.

As before, ħ c ≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k ≈50 /197.33≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that's correct.

Hmm, but then why is the answer not matching any option? Because 33.35 is nowhere near the options given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back to the formula.

The formula for scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1)/(2ik) [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ] P_l(cosθ)

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= sum (2l+1)/(2ik) [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ]

The imaginary part is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1)/(2k) [ Im (exp(2iδ_l) -1 ) ]

Im (exp(2iδ) -1 )= Im exp(2iδ) = sin(2δ).

So Im f(0)= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k )

Which is what I calculated to be ~33.35.

Hmm, but the options are much larger, like 177.675 fm (option C), which is about 5.3 times 33.35.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units when calculating k. Maybe I should have used E=50 MeV as the kinetic energy, and found the total energy E_total= K + m c² =50 +0.511=50.511 MeV. But that would make a negligible difference, as 50.511 ≈50.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k should be k= sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but in that case, using E=50 MeV:

Wait, E=50 MeV =50e6 eV.

m=electron mass=9.109e-31 kg.

So k= sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But E in Joules:50e6 eV *1.602e-19 J/eV=8.01e-12 J.

So 2mE=2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-12 J=1.459e-42 kg J.

sqrt(1.459e-42)= approx 3.822e-21 m⁻¹.

But ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

k=3.822e-21 / 1.05457e-34 ≈3.625e13 m⁻¹ → 3.625e13 m⁻¹ =3.625e13 /1e15 fm⁻¹ →0.03625 fm⁻¹. Wait, that's 0.03625 fm⁻¹.

Wait, that's a much smaller k, which would make Im f(0) larger.

So let me recalculate Im f(0) with this k.

k=0.03625 fm⁻¹.

sum from earlier (using sin terms) is 33.351 in units of 1/fm.

So Im f(0)= sum/(2k) =33.351/(2 *0.03625 )=33.351/(0.0725)≈459.9 fm.

Hmm, but the options are about 177.675 fm, which is option C. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in using E as kinetic energy. Maybe E is the total energy, including rest mass.

Wait, let me compute k again, using E=50 MeV as the total energy.

E=50 MeV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m c²=0.511 MeV →0.511e6 eV →0.511e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.18e-14 J.

So p^2 c² = E² - m² c^4.

p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

So p = sqrt( (50e6 eV)^2 - (0.511e6 eV)^2 ) / c.

Approximately, since 50e6 >>0.511e6, p≈50e6 eV/c.

k = p/(ħ) = (50e6 eV/c )/( ħ c ) → since ħ c≈197.33 MeV fm.

So 50e6 eV =50 MeV.

k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So that brings us back to the previous k=0.253 fm⁻¹, leading to Im f(0)=33.35.

Hmm, but the option closest to this isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum correctly.

Using the correct formula: Im f(0)=sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k ).

Let me compute each term correctly.

l=0: δ=90°, 2δ=180°, sin(180)=0 → term=0.

l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134)=sin(46)=0.7193. So (2*1+1)=3 →3 *0.7193=2.1579 → 2.1579/(2k)=2.1579/(0.506)≈4.265.

l=2: δ=55°, 2δ=110°, sin(110)=sin(70)=0.9397. (2*2+1)=5 →5 *0.9397=4.6985 →4.6985/0.506≈9.285.

l=3: δ=30°,2δ=60°, sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. (2*3+1)=7 →7 *0.866=6.062 →6.062/0.506≈12.0.

l=4: δ=13°,2δ=26°, sin(26)=0.4384. (2*4+1)=9 →9 *0.4384=3.9456 →3.9456/0.506≈7.801.

Sum:

4.265 +9.285=13.55 → +12=25.55 → +7.801=33.351.

So Im f(0)=33.351.

But the options don't have this. Wait, perhaps a factor of 2 is missing? Because the formula might have 2l+1 multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used (2l+1) * [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ] and not just the imaginary part.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the sum with the correct formula, which includes the [ exp(2iδ) -1 ].

Wait, let me compute [exp(2iδ) -1 ] for each l to get the correct sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is sum (2l+1) [ (1 - cos(2δ_l )) / (2k) ].

Wait, in that case, the sum would be:

l=0:1*(1 - cos(180))=1*(2)=2 → 2/(2k)=1/k=3.952.

l=1:3*(1 - cos(134)).

cos(134)=cos(180-46)= -cos(46)= -0.6947 → 1 - (-0.6947)=1.6947 →3 *1.6947=5.084 →5.084/(2k)=5.084/(0.506)=10.048.

l=2:5*(1 - cos(110)).

cos(110)=cos(180-70)= -cos(70)= -0.3420 →1 - (-0.3420)=1.342 →5 *1.342=6.71 →6.71/(0.506)=13.257.

l=3:7*(1 - cos(60))=7*(1-0.5)=7*0.5=3.5 →3.5/0.506≈6.913.

l=4:9*(1 - cos(26))=9*(1-0.8988)=9*0.1012=0.9108 →0.9108/0.506≈1.8.

Sum:3.952 +10.048=14 → +13.257=27.257 →+6.913=34.17 →+1.8=35.97.

Hmm, this gives Im f(0)=35.97, which is about 36. Still doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k)) * (2ik) ?

No, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the factor of (2ik) in the denominator.

Wait, let me think again.

The formula for f(θ) is f(θ) = sum (2l+1)/(2ik) [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

At θ=0, this becomes f(0) = sum (2l+1)/(2ik) [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ].

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1)/(2k) Im [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ].

Im [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ] = Im exp(2iδ_l) = sin(2δ_l).

So Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k).

Which brings us back to the sum of 33.35.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.3 times larger than 33.35.

Wait, 33.35 *5.3≈177. So what factor could I have missed?

Ah, perhaps I forgot that the formula includes a factor of 2 in front of the sum.

Wait, the formula for f(θ) is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1)[...], so the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ) / (2k).

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used (2l +1) * 2 sin(δ_l) cos(δ_l) ?

Wait, 2 sin(δ) cos(δ) is sin(2δ), so that wouldn't change anything.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees, and I should have converted them to radians before computing the sine. Let me re-calculate the sum using radians.

For l=1: 67°=1.16937 radians. 2δ=2.33874 radians. sin(2.33874)=sin(134°)=0.6691.

Wait, no, 67 degrees in radians is approx 1.16937 rad. 2δ=134 degrees=2.33874 rad.

sin(2.33874) = sin(134°)=0.6691.

Similarly, l=2: 55°=0.95993 rad. 2δ=110°=1.91986 rad. sin(110)=0.9397.

l=3:30°=0.523598 rad. 2δ=60°=1.04719 rad. sin(60)=0.8660.

l=4:13°=0.226893 rad. 2δ=26°=0.453785 rad. sin(26)=0.4384.

So using these values, the sum remains the same as before, so the Im f(0) is still around 33.35.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l )) * (1/k), and not 2δ.

Wait, let's try that.

Compute Im f(0) as sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) /k.

So for each l:

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 →1/0.253≈3.952.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615 →2.7615/0.253≈10.91.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096 →4.096/0.253≈16.18.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5 →3.5/0.253≈13.83.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249≈2.024 →2.024/0.253≈8.01.

Sum:3.952 +10.91=14.862 → +16.18=31.042 → +13.83=44.87 → +8.01=52.88.

So Im f(0)=52.88.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, but option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times 35.95, and option D is 251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps another factor is missing. Let me think again about the formula.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude f is expressed as:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ] P_l(cosθ).

But perhaps I should have considered the sum as (2l+1) [ exp(2iδ_l) -1 ] and then multiplied by (1/(2ik)).

When taking the imaginary part, it would be sum (2l+1) [ Im (exp(2iδ_l) -1) ] * (1/(2k)), because 1/(2ik) is real part -i/(2k), so the imaginary part is [Im (sum terms)] * (1/(2k)).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

Im f(0) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ] * (1/(2k)).

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the given phase shifts. The question states δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55, δ3=30, δ4=13, and to ignore the rest.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in degrees but I'm using radians in my calculations. Wait, no, in the sine function, the argument must be in radians. So perhaps I should compute the sine of the phase shift in degrees but without converting to radians.

Wait, that can't be right, but let me try it.

For l=1: δ=67°, 2δ=134°, sin(134°)=0.6691.

Using 67 in degrees, 2*67=134 degrees.

Similarly, l=2:55*2=110°, sin=0.9397.

l=3:60°, sin=0.8660.

l=4:26°, sin=0.4384.

So the sum is the same as before. So Im f(0)=33.35.

But perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is 33.35 *5.328. Where would that factor come from?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the sum correctly.

Let me try that.

Compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)=1. 2δ=180°, sin(180)=0 → term=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 *0.6691=2.0073 →2.0073/(2k)=2.0073/(0.506)≈3.966.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985 →4.6985/(0.506)=9.285.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062 →6.062/(0.506)=12.0.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456 →3.9456/(0.506)=7.801.

Sum:3.966 +9.285=13.251 +12=25.251 +7.801=33.052.

So Im f(0)=33.052.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )) * (ħ c)/(2 E).

Wait, because maybe Im f(0) should have units of fm. Let me think.

Wait, in the formula, Im f(0)= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k ).

k is in fm⁻¹, so 1/k is in fm.

Thus, Im f(0) is in fm⁻¹ * 1/(2k) → Wait, no: (2l+1) is dimensionless, sin(2δ) is dimensionless, so the term is (dimensionless) / (fm⁻¹) → which is fm.

So Im f(0) is in fm.

Wait, wait, because 1/k is in fm, so each term is (2l+1) sin(2δ) * (1/(2k)).

So the sum is (sum) * (1/(2k)).

Which is sum (dimensionless) multiplied by 1/(2k) (fm) → giving Im f(0) in fm.

Ah! So the Im f(0) is 33.351 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, I think I must have made a mistake. Another approach: perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k).

But 33.35 is not an option, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps the wave number k is in units of 1/fm, but the calculation gave k=0.253 fm⁻¹, so 1/k=3.95 fm.

So perhaps the correct answer is 33.35 * (1 fm) ≈33.35 fm, but none of the options match. Alternatively, perhaps I should have used (sum) * (1/k).

sum=33.351 → 33.351 * (1/k)=33.351 *3.95 fm ≈131.7 fm.

Still not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula includes an additional factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)] * (1/(2k)) * (something).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin(δ_l) instead of sin(2δ_l).

Wait, let me try that. Compute Im f(0) as sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l) / (2k).

l=0:1 * sin(90)=1 →1/(2*0.253)= 1/0.506≈1.976.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205≈2.7615 →2.7615/(0.506)≈5.459.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096 →4.096/0.506≈8.10.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5 →3.5/0.506≈6.913.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.2249≈2.024 →2.024/0.506≈4.0.

Sum:1.976 +5.459=7.435 +8.10=15.535 +6.913=22.448 +4=26.448.

So Im f(0)=26.448 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)] * (1/k).

So 33.351 * (1/0.253 )=33.351 *3.952 ≈131.8 fm.

Again, not an option.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should review the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im f(0) is indeed sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k), which gives 33.35 fm, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum with correct values.

l=0:0.

l=1:3 * sin(134°)=3 *0.6691=2.0073 →2.0073/(2k)=2.0073/(0.506)=3.966.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5 *0.9397=4.6985 →4.6985/(0.506)=9.285.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062 →6.062/0.506=12.0.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456 →3.9456/0.506=7.801.

Sum:3.966 +9.285=13.251 +12=25.251 +7.801=33.052.

So Im f(0)=33.052 fm.

But options are way higher, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im f(0)= [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)] * (1/k) * (ħ c)/(2m_e c^2), but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 177.675 fm, which is approximately 5.38 times 33.35.

Wait, 33.35 *5.38=179, which is close to option C.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 in the denominator.

Wait, earlier I used 2k in the denominator. But perhaps it's just k.

So Im f(0)= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) /k.

So 33.35 /0.253≈131.8 fm.

No, that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0)= [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)] * (ħ c)/(2 E).

Where E=50 MeV.

So sum=33.351 * (197.33 MeV fm) / (2 *50 MeV) )=33.351 *197.33/(100)=33.351 *1.9733≈65.6 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 355.351 fm, which is 355.

Wait, 355 is about 10.65 times 33.35.

Hmm, perhaps I missed a factor of 10.65, but I can't think where that would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used the sum of (2l+1) terms multiplied by  (1/(2k)) and then multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l)] * (ħ c)/(2 E).

So sum=33.351, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

E=50 MeV.

So Im f(0)=33.351 *197.33 / (2 *50 )=33.351 *197.33 /100 ≈33.351 *1.9733≈65.6 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed to choose the closest option, which is option C) 177.675 fm, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im} f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering using the given phase shifts \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and ignoring higher-order phase shifts. The scattering amplitude is related to the partial wave expansion, and the imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is determined using the formula:

\[
\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number. The wave number \( k \) is calculated using the relativistic relation \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), where \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \). This gives:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

The phase shifts are converted to radians, and the sine terms \( \sin(2\delta_l) \) are computed for each \( l \). The contributions to the sum are:

- \( l = 0 \): \( \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), contribution = 0.
- \( l = 1 \): \( \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.6691 \), contribution = \( 3 \cdot 0.6691 \approx 2.0073 \).
- \( l = 2 \): \( \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), contribution = \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
- \( l = 3 \): \( \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), contribution = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
- \( l = 4 \): \( \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), contribution = \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

Summing these contributions gives:

\[
\text{Total sum} = 2.0073 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.7134.
\]

Substituting into the formula for \( \text{Im} f(0) \):

\[
\text{Im} f(0) = \frac{16.7134}{2 \cdot 0.253} \approx \frac{16.7134}{0.506} \approx 33.05 \, \text{fm}.
\]

This result does not match any of the provided options directly. However, the closest option is \( \text{C) } 177.675 \, \text{fm} \), which is approximately 5.38 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible missing factor in the calculation or an issue with the interpretation of the problem. Based on the given options, the most reasonable choice is:
