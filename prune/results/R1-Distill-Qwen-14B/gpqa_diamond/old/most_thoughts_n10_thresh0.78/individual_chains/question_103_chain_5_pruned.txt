Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. The goal is to find the correct sequence of reactions that leads to the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options (A to D), each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which option is correct.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Breaking that down, the phenyl ring has substituents at the 3 and 5 positions: a bromo group and a nitro group. The ethan-1-one part indicates that there's a ketone group attached to the benzene ring at the 1 position. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, right? Or wait, no, ethan-1-one is actually acetone. Wait, no, wait. Oh, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. But in this case, the substituent is on the benzene ring. So the structure is a benzene ring with three substituents: a bromine at position 3, a nitro group at position 5, and a ketone group (from ethan-1-one) at position 1. Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 3, and 5 are meta to each other. So the substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions, which are all meta. No, wait. Wait, 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl would have bromo at position 3 and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, and the bromo is at 3, nitro at 5. So the substituents are 1 (ketone), 3 (bromo), 5 (nitro). So they are all para to each other? No, wait, in a benzene ring,
