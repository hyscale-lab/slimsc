Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about calculating the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, I'm a bit confused, but let's break it down.

So, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is ħ/2 multiplied by some 2x2 matrix. I remember that for angular momentum operators, the components satisfy the commutation relations, but maybe that's not directly relevant here.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That means the direction has some angles θ and φ, right? Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the angle phi (φ) would be either 0 or 180 degrees because the y-component is zero. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps the direction is given in spherical coordinates. Since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ would be 0 or π, meaning the projection is along x or z. But wait, the problem says it's an arbitrary direction in x-z, so maybe it uses an angle θ from the z-axis, and φ=0. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ) in terms of x, y, z. But wait, wait, the problem says the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Oh, but I'm supposed to find the eigenvector for the operator P along n.

Wait, the operator P is a vector operator, so P = P_x x̂ + P_y ŷ + P_z ẑ. So if I want the component along an arbitrary direction n, which is in the x-z plane, I can write P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z, since n_y is zero.

So, the operator P along n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Since n lies in the x-z plane, n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ, I think. Wait, no, wait
