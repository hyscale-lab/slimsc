Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Oh wait, right, eigenvectors and eigenvalues are important in quantum mechanics because they correspond to possible outcomes of measurements and the states the system can be in.

The operator components are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is (ħ/2) multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. So, I think the operator P itself would be a vector operator, meaning P = Px * x + Py * y + Pz * z, but wait, no, actually, more accurately, it's the sum of the components multiplied by their respective unit vectors. So P = Px x̂ + Py ŷ + Pz ẑ. But wait, in this problem, the direction is arbitrary along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n can be expressed as (x, 0, z), but since it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So n is (n_x, 0, n_z). Or more precisely, any direction in x-z plane implies that the direction vector can be parametrized by an angle θ from the z-axis, perhaps. So the direction vector n could be expressed as (sin θ, 0, cos θ) or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, but the operator P here is the angular momentum operator, right? Because the components look familiar—like the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P is analogous to the spin operator S, but scaled by ħ/2 instead of ħ. Oh wait, in standard notation, the spin matrices (like for spin-1/2 particles) are (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) multiplied by ħ/2. So yes, the operator P here is similar to the spin operator, but perhaps for a different particle, like a muon, which is a lepton with spin-1/2.

So the problem
