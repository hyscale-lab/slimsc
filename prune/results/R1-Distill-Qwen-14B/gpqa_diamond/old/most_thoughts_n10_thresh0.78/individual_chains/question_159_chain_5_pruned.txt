Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops a lot below that. I remember that when we observe objects in the universe, their light can be affected by redshift. Oh wait, if the peak is at 790 nm now, but I think it's about the rest wavelength. Or wait, maybe the peak is from the observed frame. No, the peak's wavelength is due to the source's emission being redshifted.

Wait, wait. I think the peak in the spectrum of a quasar, especially a broad emission line, might correspond to something like the Lyman-alpha emission. Lyman-alpha is at around 121 nm in the rest frame, which is in the far UV. But if we observe it at 790 nm, that's way longer. So that's a big redshift.

Redshift z is calculated by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm, observed at 790 nm. So z = (790 / 121) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121 is approximately 6.528, so z is about 5.528. So z is roughly 5.5.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's the correct emission line. Maybe it's another line. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from the Balmer break or something else. But I think for quasars, the Lyman-alpha is a common emission line to look for because it's a strong line in their spectra. So I'll go with z ≈5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance to the quasar. The universe is described by the Lambda-CDM model with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ω_m=0.3, dark energy Ω_λ=0.7, and it's flat (so Ω_k=0).

Comoving distance D_C is related to the redshift, and depends on the integral of 1/(H(a)) da from a=
