Okay, so I've got this question about polymer chemistry, specifically about ethylene polymerization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about a scientist using a dual catalyst system to introduce regular branches in a polymer made from ethylene. The setup is that he's using a homogeneous organometallic catalyst to make a high-density polymer, which I think implies a linear polymer like HDPE (high-density polyethylene), as opposed to something like LDPE which is less dense and has more branches. Wait, no, actually wait: HDPE is more branched? Or is it the opposite? Wait, HDPE has a higher degree of branching and is more crystalline, but wait, no, wait. Actually, wait, I think linear polymers are more crystalline, so maybe the first catalyst makes a linear structure, and the second is for branching.

Wait, but the question is about adding a second catalyst to introduce regular branches. So the first catalyst makes a linear chain, and the second adds branches. Or maybe they're using two different catalysts to control the type of polymerization.

The scientist is adding a second catalyst system, and only using ethylene as the monomer. The senior scientist gives statements about this. The options are the four statements, and I have to pick which is correct.

The statements are:

1) Such combined systems are already implemented on an industrial scale in the US.

2) One can use a catalyst of a group VIa transition metal in combination with specific activators.

3) Certain noble metal catalysts can be used but are too expensive.

4) Aluminum-based activators do not work for the essential additional reaction step.

I need to evaluate each statement.

So, the process is called copolymerization or perhaps chain branching. Wait, in ethylene polymerization, the main way to create branching is through a process called chain-growth polymerization where the growing polymer chain adds ethylene monomers either in a linear fashion or via branching.

Wait, I remember that Ziegler-Natta catalysts are used for producing polymers with regular structures, like HDPE and LDPE. Ziegler-Natta catalysts are typically a transition metal chloride (like TiCl3 or TiCl4)
