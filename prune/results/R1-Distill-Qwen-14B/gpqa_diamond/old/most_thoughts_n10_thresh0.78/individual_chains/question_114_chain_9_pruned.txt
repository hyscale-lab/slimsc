Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Then, the second part is that product reacting with reagent B (and water) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. Wait, no, actually, the starting material for the second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. Hmm, maybe I messed that up. Let me read that again.

Wait, no. The first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And NaCN is sodium cyanide. So, the reaction is probably an addition of CN- to the ketone. Wait, ketones reacting with CN- usually undergo some kind of addition reaction.

I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it's a nucleophilic addition. But the product here is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, so adding CN- would make
