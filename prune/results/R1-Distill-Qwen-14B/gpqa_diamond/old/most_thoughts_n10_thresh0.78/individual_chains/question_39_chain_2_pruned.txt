Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So the setup is that there are 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle in a tube along the x-axis. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. When they measured the position, none of the particles were found at x <1 or x>3. So the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the value of "a" from the given options. The options are A)1.1, B)0.85, C)0.35, D)0.6.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function's square modulus gives the probability density. The particles are only found between x=1 and x=3, so that must mean the wave function is zero outside that interval. Wait, but the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So I think I need to normalize this wave function so that the total probability is 1.

Wait, but the wave function shouldn't necessarily be zero outside 1 and 3. Because the question states that when they measured the position, none were found outside 1 and 3. Oh wait, maybe that's the result of the wave function being zero outside? Or perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between 1 and 3, and zero elsewhere. Because when they measured, all were between 1 and 3.

Wait, no. The question says when measuring, none were found outside, which implies that the probability of finding the particle outside that region is zero. So the wave function must be zero outside x=1 and x=3. But the given wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So maybe the real part is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Wait, but that can't be, because if the wave function is zero outside
