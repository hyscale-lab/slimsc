Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the solution has 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters since 1000 cm³ is a liter. There are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, but I don't think that affects this particular calculation.

Wait, so the goal is the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-. Right. Orthophosphate is HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? Hmm, wait. Orthophosphoric acid is H3PO4. It can lose protons in three steps: H3PO4 → H2PO4^- (Ka1), then H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- (Ka2), and then HPO4^2- → PO4^3- (Ka3).

So in solution, the phosphate species present would depend on the pH. But since we're mixing two different phosphates, I think they form a buffer solution. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions.

Wait a second, so the problem is mixing H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. That should buffer the solution around the second dissociation constant, Ka2. Because when you mix a weak acid (H2PO4^-) with its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), the pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa2 + log([base]/[acid]).

Once I find the pH, I can then find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation constant, Ka3.

Wait, but the question is about the orthophosphate ion, which I think is PO4^3-. But I'm a little confused because HPO4^2- is also called the dihydrogen phosphate ion. Or maybe orthophosphate refers to PO4^3-.

So the plan is:

1. Calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.
2. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.
3. Use the third dissociation step (HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-) to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Alright, let's get into the calculations.

First, find the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 136.09 g/mol.
Moles = 1.00 / 136.09 ≈ 0.007338 mol.

Each mole of KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^-.
So moles of H2PO4^- = 0.007338 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: mass is 1.00 g, Mw 177.99 g/mol.
Moles = 1.00 / 177.99 ≈ 0.005615 mol.

Each mole of Na2HPO4 gives 1 mole of HPO4^2-.
So moles of HPO4^2- = 0.005615 mol.

But wait, does the solution have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-? Yes, so they form a buffer around Ka2.

The total volume is 0.2 L, so the concentrations are:

[H2PO4^-] = 0.007338 / 0.2 ≈ 0.03669 M
[HPO4^2-] = 0.005615 / 0.2 ≈ 0.028075 M

Now, using Henderson-Hasselbalch for the second dissociation step (Ka2=6.2e-8):

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ let's calculate that. Log(6.2) is about 0.79, so 0.79 - 7 = 6.21? Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Ka2 is 6.2x10^-8. So pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8). Let's compute this using calculator steps.

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076.

Now, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (0.028075)/(0.03669) ≈ 0.766.

Log(0.766) is negative. Let's compute log(0.766). Well, log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) + (-1). Log(7.66) is about 0.8848. So log(0.766) ≈ 0.8848 -1 = -0.1152.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.1152) ≈ 7.0924.

Now, with the pH known, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation of HPO4^2-:
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So the expression is Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-])/[H+]

We have [H+] from the pH. pH is 7.0924, so [H+] = 10^-7.0924 ≈ 8.28e-8 M.

Wait, let me compute that. 10^-7.0924.

Since 10^-7 is 1e-7, and 0.0924 is exponent. So 10^0.0924 ≈ 1.237 (since 10^0.1≈1.258, but 0.09 is about 1.23). So 1e-7 / 1.237 ≈ 8.07e-8. Hmm, maybe more accurately, 10^0.0924 is approximately 1.237? Let me use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, 7.0924 is the pH, so [H+] = 10^(-7.0924) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0924). 

10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.0924) is about 0.828, because log(0.828) is about -0.08. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me find 10^(-0.0924).

We know that ln(10^(-0.0924)) = -0.0924 * ln(10) ≈ -0.0924 * 2.3026 ≈ -0.2128. So e^-0.2128 ≈ 0.809. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, using log tables.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 10^(-0.0924) = 1 / 10^0.0924.

What's 10^0.09? Approximately 1.229. 0.0924 is a bit more. So, 10^0.0924 ≈ 1.237. So 10^(-0.0924) ≈ 1/1.237 ≈ 0.808.

So [H+] ≈ 8.08e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.028075 M, [H+] is 8.08e-8.

So,

PO4^3- = (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.08e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028075 ≈ 5.0535e-14.

Divide by 8.08e-8: 5.0535e-14 / 8.08e-8 = (5.0535 /8.08) * 1e-6 ≈ 0.6258 * 1e-6 ≈ 6.258e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.26e-7 M. Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7 M, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistakes along the way?

Let me check the calculations again.

First, the moles:

KH2PO4: 1.00g /136.09 g/mol = approx 0.007338 mol. Correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005615 mol. Correct.

Concentrations:

H2PO4^-: 0.007338 /0.2 = 0.03669 M.

HPO4^2-: 0.005615 /0.2 = 0.028075 M.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) = approx 7.2076.

Ratio: 0.028075 / 0.03669 = approx 0.766.

Log(0.766) ≈ -0.115. So pH = 7.2076 - 0.115 ≈ 7.0926.

[H+] = 10^-7.0926 ≈ 8.08e-8. Correct.

Ka3 = 1.8e-12. So [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging the numbers: (1.8e-12 * 0.028075) / (8.08e-8) → let me compute this precisely.

1.8e-12 * 0.028075 = 5.0535e-14.

Divide by 8.08e-8 → 5.0535e-14 / 8.08e-8 = approx 6.258e-7.

So option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. Therefore, the answer should be A.

But wait, let me double-check the Henderson-Hasselbalch calculation to ensure I didn't make a mistake. The ratio is [base]/[acid], which is [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = (0.028075)/(0.03669) = approx 0.766.

Log(0.766) is indeed negative. Let me compute it more accurately.

Log(0.766) = log(7.66e-1) = log(7.66) -1.

Log(7.66) is closer to 0.8848, so 0.8848 – 1 = -0.1152. So the pH is 7.2076 – 0.1152 = 7.0924. Correct.

Hmm, but wait another thing: when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the solution will buffer around pH 7.09, which is in the range where the third deprotonation can occur. So the calculation to find [PO4^3-] using Ka3 should be correct.

So I think the calculation is correct, and the answer is option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- **KH₂PO₄**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of KH₂PO₄ contributes 1 mole of H₂PO₄⁻.  
  Thus, moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( 0.007338 \, \text{mol} \).

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O**:  
  Moles = \( \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005615 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each mole of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O contributes 1 mole of HPO₄²⁻.  
  Thus, moles of HPO₄²⁻ = \( 0.005615 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
The total volume of the solution is \( 200.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.2 \, \text{L} \).  
- Concentration of H₂PO₄⁻ = \( \frac{0.007338 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.03669 \, \text{M} \).  
- Concentration of HPO₄²⁻ = \( \frac{0.005615 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.028075 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH
The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), which corresponds to the second dissociation constant of H₃PO₄:  
\[
\text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}
\]  
The pKa₂ is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.2076
\]  
Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H₂PO₄⁻}]}\right)
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log\left(\frac{0.028075}{0.03669}\right)
\]  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.2076 + \log(0.766) \approx 7.2076 - 0.1152 = 7.0924
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] using Ka₃
The third dissociation of HPO₄²⁻ is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄³⁻}
\]  
The dissociation constant is:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}
\]  
The relationship is:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]  
From the pH, \([H^+]\) is:  
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.0924} \approx 8.08 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}
\]  
Substitute the values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028075)}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}}
\]  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.0535 \times 10^{-14}}{8.08 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.258 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

### Final Answer
The concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) is approximately \( 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
