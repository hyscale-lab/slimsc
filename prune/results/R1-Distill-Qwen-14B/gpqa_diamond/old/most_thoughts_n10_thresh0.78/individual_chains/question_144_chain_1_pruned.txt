Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But wait, this is about their decay, specifically the mean decay distance. 

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters. So I guess it's something related to the particle's lifetime and speed.

Wait, the mean decay length formula comes to mind. I think the formula is something like L = c * τ * βγ, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, β is v/c, and γ is the Lorentz factor. Because if the particle is moving relativistically, its lifetime from our frame of reference is longer due to time dilation.

But how do I get τ from the given parameters? Oh, right! The width Γ is related to the mean lifetime by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Γ is the energy width, and the uncertainty in energy gives an uncertainty in time. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, but wait, I have to be careful with the units.

Wait, let me get the units straight. Γ is given in MeV, which is 320 MeV. But I need to convert that into GeV because E_X and m_X are in GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So Γ is 0.32 GeV.

But wait, when using ħ in units of GeV·s, I should remember that ħ ≈
