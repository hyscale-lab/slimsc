Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's see what it's about. So, the question states that a particle of mass m moves in two dimensions with a specific potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. I'm supposed to find the energy spectrum from the options provided.

Hmm, right. I remember that in quantum mechanics, especially in two-dimensional systems, the potential can sometimes be separable into parts that depend on r and θ. If that's the case, maybe each part can be treated like a one-dimensional oscillator or something similar.

Wait, looking at the potential: the first term is (1/2) kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. Because in one dimension, a harmonic oscillator has V(x) = (1/2) m ω² x², but here, in two dimensions, it's r squared. Oh wait, but in polar coordinates, r² is like (x² + y²), so yeah, that's a 2D harmonic oscillator.

The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2) kr² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Let me compute that:

(3/2) * (1/2) kr² = 3/4 kr². Plus (3/2)*(cos2θ) * (kr²/2), which is (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ. Wait, adding the first and second terms: (1/2 + 3/4) kr². 1/2 is 2/4, so 2/4 +3/4=5/4 kr². So V(r,θ)= 5/4 kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, that simplifies to V(r,θ)= kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ]. Alternatively, factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² [ (5/4) + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, I'm trying to see if this can be expressed in terms of angular potentials. Because in polar coordinates, the potential might split into radial and angular parts for the Schrödinger equation.

Alternatively, perhaps this potential can be interpreted as the sum of a 2D harmonic oscillator plus another potential that depends on θ.

Wait, but I know that in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a particle in a central potential (which depends only on r) plus an angular part (like an angular oscillator) would have its Schrödinger equation separable.

Alternatively,
