Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. It's about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that two stars with the same mass as the Sun have planets detected using the RV method. Both planets have masses similar to Neptune. The spectral line shifts are given for each planet's host star. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find out how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I remember the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum as it moves due to the planet's gravity. The shift depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, and the inclination of the orbit. Oh, and the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is something like K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1/( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2)) )) ) )^(1/3) ) * sin(i). But since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so (1 - e²)^(3/2) is 1. And the planet masses are similar to each other, so M_p is the same for both. Also, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, so M_star is the same.

Wait, but the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star. The formula for K, I think, is K = ( (28.4 m/s) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / (M_jup) ) * ( (P yr)^(-1/3) ) ) * ( (M_star + M_p )^(-2/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) ). But maybe there's a simpler way to approach this.

Alternatively, the Doppler shift (wavelength shift) is related to the velocity. The shift in wavelength is given by delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity. So the shift is proportional to the velocity. Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses, but the shifts are different, perhaps the velocities are different.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is linked to the planet's orbital period. The velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) which relates to the planet's orbit. So K is
