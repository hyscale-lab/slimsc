Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the situation is that there's an intelligent civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super-fast spaceship that can travel at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is like super close to the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years, meaning 150 Earth years. Now, they want to send a spacecraft to Earth, and the astronaut is 22 years old from their perspective.

The question is asking how long the trip will take for the astronaut, from their own perspective. The options are A to D, with A saying the astronaut dies before reaching Earth, and the others giving specific numbers.

Hmm. This sounds like a problem involving special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. Because when you travel at such high speeds, time dilation occurs, meaning time moves slower for the traveler compared to someone on Earth.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The spaceship is moving at a high speed relative to Earth, so from Earth's frame of reference, the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud would be contracted, right? Or wait, no, actually, wait. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a galaxy about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. But the problem says the aliens are sending a ship to Earth, so the distance is approximately 160,000 light-years.

Wait, but that's from Earth's frame. From the spaceship's frame of reference, the distance would be length-contracted. So the distance they have to travel would be shorter. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be less than what it would take according to Earth's frame.

Wait, but the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, so we need to calculate the proper time. Proper time is the shortest time measured in the moving frame, which in this case is the spaceship's frame.

So, the formula for time dilation is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time, tau) is equal to the Earth time (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Alternatively, tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But wait, no. Another approach is to calculate the distance from the spaceship's perspective. So the distance is contracted by a factor of gamma. So the proper length (L) is the Earth frame length (L0) multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then the time experienced by the astronaut is L / v.

Wait, I think I need to clarify the two approaches.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Determine the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the time measured in the spaceship's frame of reference.

2. The proper time can be calculated using the formula tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t_earth is the time measured from Earth's frame.

But wait, how do I find t_earth? Because the spaceship is moving at speed v, the time it takes from Earth's perspective is distance divided by speed. But wait, the distance from Earth to the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years. So the time from Earth's frame is (160,000 light-years) / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ (160,000 / 0.99999987) years. Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.99999987 is very close to 1, so 160,000 / 0.99999987 is approximately 160,000 * (1 + 1.27e-7) ≈ 160,000 years. Because 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x for small x. But wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 1.3e-7, so x is 1.3e-7.

Wait, that's a very small x, so 1/(1 - x) ≈ 1 + x. So 160,000 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 1.3
