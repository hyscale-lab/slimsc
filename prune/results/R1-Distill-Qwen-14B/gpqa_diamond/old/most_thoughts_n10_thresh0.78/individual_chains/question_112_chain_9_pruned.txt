Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a shot. So the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring an electron in certain eigenstates and calculating the average value of an operator. Let me see what I remember.

The state given is |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so it's not normalized yet. I should probably normalize it first because probabilities are based on squared magnitudes of the amplitudes. Oh right, the normalization condition is that the sum of the squares (moduli squared) of the components equals 1.

Let me write down the components. The coefficients are (1+i) for |up> and (2-i) for |down>. So the modulus squared for the first term is |1+i|^2. The modulus of a complex number a + ib is sqrt(a² + b²), so squared it just becomes a² + b². So for 1+i, that's 1² + 1² = 2. Similarly, the second term is 2-i, so modulus squared is 2² + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 = 5. So total modulus squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2-i)/sqrt(7) ] |down> .

Now the operator's matrix elements are given as A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, else 0. Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix? Because it's for spin states, which have two eigenstates. So the matrix would be:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0 ]

Wait, because when i≠j, A_ij = ħ/2. So diagonal elements are 0, and off-diagonal are ħ/2. So the operator A is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere. Hmm, but what's the
