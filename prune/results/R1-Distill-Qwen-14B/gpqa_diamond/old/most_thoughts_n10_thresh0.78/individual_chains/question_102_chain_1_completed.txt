Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically involving a ligand-receptor pair and some constructs they made. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

So first, the setup: They identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate, so they're using a bicistronic vector, which I remember means it has two coding regions (bicistronic means two genes in one vector). The vector is lox-Cre, so I think it's using the Cre-Lox system for recombination, maybe for conditional expression or to control when the genes are expressed.

The ligand is a coiled-coil of two alpha helices, and the receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular helices, and three beta sheets. Not sure if that's super relevant yet, but maybe for understanding their structure and function.

The vector setup: The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So the ligand is first, then the receptor. And between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for the Cre recombinase. I remember that Cre recognizes loxP sites and can mediate recombination. Lox2272 is a variant where Cre can only act when it's in a certain conformation, maybe? Or perhaps it's a different orientation.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor is under the IRES regulatory element. IRES elements usually allow for internal ribosome entry, which can lead to expression of the downstream gene in a cap-independent manner, maybe allowing for expression in certain conditions or cell types.

So the vector is bicistronic, meaning it should express both the ligand and the receptor. But the stop cassettes are in between each ORF and their respective fluorescent proteins. So without Cre, the mCherry and eGFP would be downstream of the stops, which would prevent their expression. But when Cre is introduced, it should excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed along with the ligand and receptor.

They raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in Western blot after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocyte cultures. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading control worked. But wait, what was being tested with the Western? They probably wanted to see if the ligand and receptor were being expressed. But the question says that after transfection, they used these antibodies, but the main issue arises when they look at the mouse model.

They made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, right? So the Cre would be expressed under the control of the SOX10 promoter, meaning it would be active in neural crest-derived cells, like their astrocytes or other derivatives.

The offspring are born, and they visualize them under a confocal microscope looking for green signals. They don't see any green. The green is from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So the receptor-eGFP construct isn't being expressed, or the eGFP isn't fluorescent.

So why no green signal? Let's look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But I'm not sure how that affects the expression construct. Maybe if they're secreted, but the question doesn't mention that. The vector is for expression in the same cells, so probably not the issue here. Plus, the problem is about expression of the proteins, not their function.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. The Golgi is where proteins are processed, and if it's stuck there, they wouldn't reach the cell surface. But if the construct wasn't properly made, maybe. But the Western blot probably would still detect the protein if it's present, but it's under the same conditions. The question states that the blot shows signals proportional to actin, so maybe the proteins are being expressed but not detected in the Western? Or perhaps the antibodies are working.

Wait, the question says they used the antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the receptors are expressed, the eGFP should be expressed and detectable. But in the mouse, the green signal isn't seen. Maybe the construct isn't being expressed correctly in the mouse.

Option C: the enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is constitutive, I think. So perhaps without an enhancer, the expression isn't sufficient? But in culture, they transfected the construct and saw expression on Western. So in culture, it works, but in the mouse, maybe the construct isn't being expressed. But why would the mouse model not have the necessary enhancers? Maybe the CBA promoter isn't active in the cells where the Cre is active.

Wait, the Cre is under SOX10. So Cre is active in neural crest cells. The ligand is under CBA promoter, which is strong, so maybe it's expressed everywhere, but the receptor is under IRES. Hmm.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic, meaning both the ligand and receptor have their own promoters? Or are they both under the same promoter? No, wait, in a bicistronic vector, usually a single promoter drives the expression of both ORFs. Wait no, the setup says the ligand is under the CBA promoter. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the way it's written: "The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES regulatory element." So perhaps the vector has the ligand under the CBA promoter, then the receptor is under IRES. So the CBA is a strong promoter, driving the transcription of the ligand, then IRES allows for the translation of the receptor.

Wait, but in a bicistronic construct, the two ORFs are in the same transcript. The first ORF (ligand) is translated, then the IRES allows ribosome entry for the second ORF (receptor). So that would make sense. So the expression is from a single mRNA, with the ligand first, then the receptor.

But the stops are in between each ORF and the fluorescent proteins. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the mCherry is blocked because of the loxP stop cassette. Similarly, the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP is blocked by the lox2272 stop.

So when Cre is introduced (from the SOX10-Cre mice), it should excise the loxP and lox2272 sites, thereby removing the stops, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

But the mouse has the construct homozygously, meaning both alleles have the same construct. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells.

But the offspring were visualized under the confocal, and no green signal (eGFP). So why is eGFP not expressed?

Looking at the options, let's consider each.

Option A: Paracrine. If ligand and receptor are paracrine, maybe they are secreted, but that's not directly relevant to why eGFP isn't expressed. The problem is about expression, not function.

Option B: Receptor stuck in Golgi. If the receptor-eGFP is not properly trafficked, maybe the eGFP isn't at the cell surface, so you can't see fluorescence. But the Western blot uses total proteins, so if the protein is made, the blot would show it. But the question says the antibodies were used on the Western after transfection. Maybe in the mouse, the protein isn't being made, or perhaps the construct isn't being excised.

Wait, perhaps the issue is with the way the Cre is acting. The vector has two lox sites: loxP and lox2272. Cre is usually specific for loxP. But lox2272 is a variant. I think that Cre can recombine loxP sites but not lox2272 unless it's a specific variant of Cre, like 'floxed' for lox2272. Or wait, maybe the vector is set up so that the lox sites are in a way that when Cre is present, the stops are removed.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', with a loxP-stop-loxP cassette after it. Between the ligand and mCherry, so the sequence is ligand, stop with loxP sites. The receptor ORF is at 3', with a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette after the receptor and before eGFP.

So in the vector, the structure is:

[CBA promoter] --> ligand ORF --> loxP stop loxP --> mCherry ORF

Then, after the IRES element comes the receptor ORF --> lox2272 stop lox2272 --> eGFP ORF.

When Cre is introduced, it should recombine the loxP sites, excising the stop cassette between ligand and mCherry, allowing mCherry to be expressed when the ligand is expressed. Similarly, the lox2272 stop cassette after the receptor would be excised only if Cre can recognize lox2272.

Wait, but standard Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre only when in a certain configuration, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, lox2272 is a site that Cre can't typically recombine, unless it's a 'double' variant or something. Or perhaps the vector uses a different system.

Wait, no, the lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but requires a specific arrangement. Alternatively, some systems use lox2272 for 'exon trapping' because Cre can't efficiently recombine them under normal conditions, but certain modified Cre's can.

Wait, if the vector has loxP and lox2272 sites, and the Cre is wild-type, then the Cre would only recombine the loxP sites. So in the vector, the ligand's loxP stop would be excised when Cre is present, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the receptor's lox2272 stop wouldn't be recombined because Cre can't act on lox2272. So the eGFP would remain under the stop cassette, so it wouldn't be expressed.

Ah, so in this case, the Cre is only able to excise the ligand's stop cassette, but not the receptor's. So the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry, but the receptor would not be expressed with eGFP.

Wait, but the problem states that the mouse was homozygous for the construct. So each allele has the same setup. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, the Cre would excise the loxP stops in both alleles, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But for the receptor-eGFP, the lox2272 sites wouldn't be affected because Cre can't recognize them, so the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

So in the mouse, the ligand and mCherry would be expressed (maybe visible under red fluorescence), but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. So when they look for green fluorescence, they see nothing because the eGFP isn't expressed.

So why is this happening? Because the lox2272 sites aren't being recombined, so the eGFP remains under the stop cassette.

But the question is asking why there's no green signal. So the possible options relate to that.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette isn't excised, the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor, but if the stop is in between, then the receptor is expressed but the eGFP isn't. Or if they are in frame, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop is in the way.

Wait, in the construct, the receptor is followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette, then eGFP. Without the stop being excised, the receptor is expressed, and the eGFP is not. So the eGFP isn't being expressed. But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed.

So in the mouse, after Cre is introduced, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed. But the receptor's stop, which is lox2272-based, isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options, which one matches this.

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's about the construct's design. The question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. Alternatively, the issue is that the stop isn't being excised because Cre can't recognize the lox2272 sites.

Wait, but none of the options mention that. The options given are:

A) ligand and receptor are paracrine.

B) receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi.

C) enhancer missing.

D) receptor and eGFP not in frame.

Hmm, none directly address the issue of the lox2272 not being recombined.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the way the vector was constructed. If the ligand and receptor are in a bicistronic vector, each with their own fluorescent tags, but the stops are in between. The presence of the two different lox sites might mean that only one of the cassettes is removed when Cre is present.

So in the mouse, the Cre is only able to excise the ligand's loxP stop, but not the receptor's lox2272 stop. So the ligand is expressed with mCherry, but the receptor and eGFP are not expressed.

In the question, they didn't observe a green signal, which is from eGFP. So why is that? Because the eGFP isn't expressed.

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. But the construct has promoters, so that's probably not it. In the culture, the vectors were transfected, and expression was confirmed with Western.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. That would mean if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the stop is not excised due to the lox2272 issue, not because of frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the two ORFs are in the same reading frame, but in this case, the stop cassettes would prevent expression.

Wait, perhaps the construct wasn't properly designed. Because the vector is bicistronic, the two ORFs (ligand and receptor) are on the same transcript, separated by the IRES. So the ligand is translated, then the IRES allows the receptor to be translated.

But the stop cassettes are between ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. So without Cre, the mCherry and eGFP are not expressed. With Cre, the stops are removed.

Wait, but the lox2272 sites aren't being cut. So the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised. So in the mouse, only the ligand and mCherry are expressed, while the receptor and eGFP are not.

So why is the eGFP not expressed? Because the Cre can't cut the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains, preventing eGFP expression.

But none of the options directly state this. Let me look again at the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed, but that's because the stop is present, not because of frame issues. So D isn't the correct reason.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. If the protein is made but stuck in the Golgi, it wouldn't be on the cell surface, but the Western blot would show the protein. So maybe the problem is that the construct isn't expressed, so the Western wouldn't show the receptor, but the question says the blot works because the signal is proportional to actin. So they probably saw the receptors, but in the mouse model, they don't see eGFP.

Wait, but in the mouse model, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop isn't being removed. So the construct would express the receptor, but not the eGFP.

But in the question, the problem is that the mouse model doesn't show green. So the eGFP isn't expressed. So why?

Because the stop cassette isn't excised. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Because the Cre can't recombine the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains.

But none of the options directly address this. So perhaps the correct answer is another reason.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the vector setup again. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter driving the ligand expression. The receptor is under IRES, which is after the ligand. So the same transcript is made, with the ligand first, then the receptor. The IRES allows the ribosome to translate the receptor.

So both the ligand and receptor are expressed when the vector is transfected, but the fluorescent proteins are under the loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes.

In the mouse, the Cre would excise the loxP stop, so the mCherry would be expressed along with the ligand. But for the receptor and eGFP, the lox2272 stop isn't removed because Cre can't cut that, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So when they look for eGFP, it's not there. Therefore, the reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop cassette isn't excised.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the problem is elsewhere.

Looking back, the vector has the ligand under CBA and the receptor under IRES, which is a cap-independent internal ribosome entry site. Maybe the IRES isn't functional in the mouse's cells, so the receptor isn't expressed. But that would affect both the receptor and eGFP, but in that case, the Western blot would show no receptor. However, the question says that the blot shows signals proportional to actin, implying that the proteins are present.

Wait, the question says that after transfection to primary astrocyte culture, the Western blot shows signals proportional to actin. So when they transfected the plasmid, the ligand and receptor were expressed, but when they put the construct into the mouse, perhaps the expression isn't happening.

Wait, but the mouse model is homozygous for the construct in the wild-type background. So they have it in their genome, probably under the control of some regulatory elements. But the vector they used is a bicistronic construct with the ligand under CBA and the receptor under IRES. CBA is a strong promoter, but perhaps in the mouse, the IRES isn't active, so the receptor isn't being expressed.

But wait, in the initial setup, the vector is a bicistronic construct. So the same mRNA is made, with the ligand first and then the receptor, using the IRES for the receptor's translation.

But if the vector is inserted into the mouse's genome, perhaps the expression is not driven correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the vector relies on certain elements that aren't present in the mouse.

Wait, but in the mouse, the construct is placed under the control of a promoter, but the question doesn't specify. Oh, wait, the construct is designed so that the ligand is under the CBA promoter and the receptor under IRES. So in the mouse, the CBA promoter should drive the ligand, and the IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed.

But why wouldn't the IRES work in the mouse? Maybe the IRES is not functional in the cells where the Cre is active, which are SOX10-expressing cells, like neural crest derivatives.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the vector uses an IRES that isn't functional in the mouse's cells, leading to the receptor not being expressed, but the ligand is.

But the question is about the eGFP not being expressed. So if the receptor isn't being expressed, the eGFP wouldn't be either.

But the options don't mention anything about IRES functionality. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another angle: the vector has the ligand and receptor as a bicistronic unit. Each is followed by a stop cassette. The Western blot after transfection shows the ligand and receptor. But in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But in the mouse, the vector is inserted into the genome, perhaps under a promoter that doesn't support bicistronic expression. Or maybe the IRES isn't functional.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the vector isn't correctly excising both stops because the lox sites are different. So the mCherry is expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

But the answer options are A to D.

Looking again:

Option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. If the enhancer is missing, they wouldn't be expressed. But in the culture, they were expressed. So the enhancer is present in the construct. Unless in the mouse, the enhancer isn't functional. But the CBA promoter is strong and doesn't require an enhancer necessarily.

Option B: receptor stuck in Golgi. If the protein is expressed but not at the cell surface, but Western blot would detect it. So the blot would show the receptor, but not eGFP. But the question says the mouse doesn't have eGFP, so maybe the receptor isn't expressed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the Cre is required to activate both the ligand and receptor expression. But in that case, without Cre, nothing would be expressed, but they have SOX10-Cre, which should provide Cre.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the vector is set up so that Cre is required for both the ligand and receptor expression. But the vector has the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is constitutive, and the IRES for the receptor. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but the mCherry wouldn't because the stop is present. But the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP wouldn't.

Wait, no. Because the CBA promoter drives the ligand's transcription, and the IRES allows for receptor translation. The stops are after each ORF. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed and the receptor is expressed, but the fluorescent proteins are not. With Cre, the stops are removed, so both fluorescent proteins are expressed.

But in the mouse, the Cre is present, so the ligand and mCherry should be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP should also be expressed.

But the question states that the mouse was homozygous for the construct, meaning that the vector is in both alleles. They crossed it to SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous mouse. So the offspring would have the construct in both alleles and Cre in one.

But the issue is that eGFP isn't expressed. So the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't being excised.

If the problem is that the lox2272 stop isn't being excised, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But the options don't mention Cre or lox sites.

So perhaps the correct option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame.

Wait, if the stop cassette isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But frame issues would cause a problem if the stop is excised but the eGFP is in a different frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is designed such that the stop is in the same frame, so when excised, eGFP is in frame with the receptor. If not, then it's a frame shift, but the stop would prevent expression anyway.

Hmm, perhaps the issue is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut because Cre doesn't recognize them, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But since none of the options mention this, I'm stuck.

Looking at the options again, perhaps the correct answer is C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing.

Wait, the construct uses the CBA promoter for the ligand, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which is constitutive. So in the mouse, the enhancer isn't the issue. So C is probably not the reason.

Another thought: maybe the vector isn't being expressed because the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. But that's more about the construct design, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stop cassettes are in the wrong place. For example, the loxP stop is after the ligand, but the lox2272 is after the receptor. So when Cre is present, it excises the loxP, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 isn't affected, so the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't. So when they look for green (eGFP), they don't see anything.

So the reason is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. But in terms of the options given, none directly mention this. So perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in the frame. Because if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop is present, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of frame. If the stop is excised, but the eGFP is in a different frame, then it's a problem, but the stop being present is the main issue.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the design of the vector again.

The vector is a bicistronic construct: ligand (CBA promoter) -> loxP-stop-loxP -> mCherry; IRES -> receptor -> lox2272-stop-lox2272 -> eGFP.

When Cre is present, it should excise the loxP and lox2272 stops. Wait, but can Cre recombine lox2272?

I think that standard Cre doesn't recognize lox2272. Lox2272 is a variant that is recognized only by a mutated Cre, called 'floxed Cre' or something similar. So in this case, the standard Cre (from SOX10-Cre mice) can't recombine the lox2272 sites. Therefore, the eGFP stop cassette isn't excised, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed because the Cre can't act on the lox2272 sites, so the stop remains. So the answer relates to the fact that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised.

Looking back at the options, which one fits. The only option related is D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. But that's about frame, not about the stop.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the vector is designed such that the loxP and lox2272 are in a way that only one of the cassettes is excised. For example, the loxP is in a forward direction, and lox2272 is in reverse, so Cre can't act on both. So the mCherry is expressed but the eGFP isn't.

But the options don't reflect that. Given the options, the best fit might be option C: the enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the vector is designed so that the ligand is expressed, but the receptor isn't because the IRES isn't working in the mouse's cells.

But again, the options don't directly address this.

Wait, another angle: in the vector, the ligand is at 5', so it's translated first. The IRES then allows the receptor to be translated. The presence of the stop cassettes prevents the fluorescent proteins from being expressed in the absence of Cre. But if the Cre isn't able to excise both stops, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the issue is that the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is the stop is not removed. If the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't being cut by Cre, meaning the stop remains. But that's not one of the options. So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C: the enhancer is missing. Because the construct relies on the CBA promoter, which is strong, but perhaps it's not active in the mouse's neural crest cells. But no, the CBA promoter is constitutive, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't being expressed because the IRES isn't working. But the Western blot in the culture showed expression, so the IRES must be functional.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here.

Wait, another consideration: maybe the vector is such that only one of the two cassettes is excised. For example, the loxP stop is excised, but the lox2272 stop isn't. So the ligand and mCherry are expressed, but the receptor and eGFP aren't. Hence, no eGFP. So the reason is that the lox2272 stop isn't excised. But the options don't have this.

So perhaps the correct answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But that's not exactly correct, because the stop is the issue, not the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but the vector design would ensure that the eGFP is in frame with the receptor. If the stop is excised, the eGFP should be expressed. So why isn't it?

If the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the problem is that the stop isn't excised, which is due to the lox2272 not being recombined by Cre. But none of the options say that.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. But I'm not really sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the vector was designed to have the ligand and receptor in a way that when Cre is present, only the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are under a different regulation.

But that's getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 stop cassette isn't correctly placed. For example, if the stop is in the same orientation as the loxP, Cre can't excise it. But again, this is beyond the options.

Given the options, the only one that makes sense is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. But maybe the stop is in a way that if it's not removed, the eGFP is out of frame, leading to no expression. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct is designed so that the eGFP is only expressed if the stop is removed, which would require both the lox sites to be correctly recombined. Since only the loxP is, the eGFP isn't expressed.

In that case, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the lox2272 sites aren't cut, so the stop remains. But again, the options don't directly address this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette is still present, which is due to the lox sites not being compatible with Cre. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal. The reason is that Cre can only cut loxP, not lox2272.

But since the options don't address this, perhaps I'm missing something.

Another angle: the vector is in a bicistronic setup, meaning the same mRNA is used for both. If the vector isn't correctly processed, perhaps the IRES isn't working, leading to the receptor not being expressed.

But the Western blot after transfection showed the proteins were expressed, so the IRES works. So that's not the issue.

In conclusion, the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't excised, which is because the Cre can't act on the lox2272 sites. Since none of the options directly address this, perhaps the intended answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: the receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi, but that would require the protein to be made, which the Western would detect. But the question states that the Western is working, so if the receptor is expressed, the eGFP should be as well, assuming the stop is excised.

Wait, no. Because the stop isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. So the receptor would be expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So the Western would show the receptor, but not eGFP. But the question says that the eGFP isn't visible, which is expected.

But the options don't directly address this, so perhaps the intended answer is option D. But I'm not certain.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand and receptor, with fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) fused to each, respectively. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES regulatory element. Between the ligand and mCherry, there is a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and between the receptor and eGFP, there is a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. The mouse model is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, but no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design and Function**:
   - The vector is bicistronic, meaning a single transcript drives the expression of both the ligand and receptor. The ligand is expressed first, followed by the receptor via the IRES element.
   - The loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes prevent the expression of mCherry and eGFP, respectively, in the absence of Cre recombinase. When Cre is introduced, it excises these stop cassettes, allowing mCherry and eGFP to be expressed.

2. **Mouse Model and Cre Activity**:
   - The SOX10-Cre mice express Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest-derived cells. Cre should excise the loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes, enabling the expression of mCherry and eGFP.

3. **Observed Outcome**:
   - After crossing the homozygous construct with SOX10-Cre mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy. This indicates that the eGFP is not being expressed.

4. **Critical Issue**:
   - The eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not being excised. Standard Cre recombinase does not recognize lox2272 sites, meaning the stop cassette remains intact, preventing eGFP expression. This explains the lack of green fluorescence.

5. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) Paracrine relationship**: This refers to the functional interaction between ligand and receptor, not their expression. Irrelevant to the lack of eGFP expression.
   - **B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi**: If the receptor-eGFP were trafficked to the Golgi, it would still be detectable via Western blot. The absence of eGFP suggests it is not being expressed, not just mislocalized.
   - **C) Enhancer missing**: The CBA promoter is strong and does not require an enhancer for expression. The issue lies with the stop cassette, not promoter activity.
   - **D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame**: If the stop cassette were excised, the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor. Since the stop cassette is not excised, this is not the issue.

### Conclusion:
The lack of green fluorescence is due to the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette remaining unexcised, preventing eGFP expression. This is because standard Cre recombinase does not recognize lox2272 sites. None of the options explicitly address this, but the closest explanation is **D**, as the eGFP would not be expressed if the stop cassette remains intact.
