Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length, a. When a monochromatic light (wavelength λ) shines on it along the z-axis, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. And they mention that the angles are small, so we can approximate tanθ as θ. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. So, when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, right? The shape of the aperture affects the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22λ/(a), where a is the radius. But wait, in this case, the aperture is a polygon, but N is approaching infinity, so it's almost a circle. But wait, the apothem is a. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. As N increases, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem? Or wait, no, because for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R. For a regular polygon, R = a / cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²) ≈ 1. So R ≈ a. So the radius of the polygon approaches a when N is very large. So the shape becomes a circle with radius a. So the diffraction pattern should be similar to a circular aperture.

Wait, but the problem says the apothems are all of length a. So the apothem is a, which is the distance from the center to the sides. So for a circle, the apothem would be the same as the radius. So maybe the radius of the circular aperture is a. So the angular position of the minima would be based on that radius.

In the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ / a. But wait, the options have 1.220 λ/a as option C. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, wait a minute. No, wait, for a circular aperture, the first minimum is the first dark ring, and there's only one minimum in the first dark ring. Because for a circle, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot, then the first minimum. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, for a single slit, the minima are at certain angles, but for a circular aperture, it's more complex. The minima in the far field for a circular aperture occur at specific angles determined by the Bessel functions. The first minimum is the first dark ring, which is at θ = 1.22 λ / D, where D is the diameter. Wait, no, D is the diameter, so radius R is D/2, so θ = 1.22 λ/(2R). Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the formula I know, the first minimum is at θ = 1.22 λ / (2a) if a is the radius? Or wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's get this straight. The formula for the first minimum in a single-slit (which is a 1D problem) is at θ ≈ λ / (a), where a is the slit width. But for a circular aperture, the situation is different. The Fraunhofer diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ / (2a), where a is the radius of the aperture. Wait, no, perhaps I should think again.

Wait, the formula for the first dark ring (the first minimum) in a circular aperture is when the argument of the Bessel function derivative is at its first zero. The condition is when (
