Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember that when stars are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the excitation of atoms can be explained using something called the Boltzmann equation. 

So, the problem says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. I need to find out the correct equation relating their temperatures, T1 and T2.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The formula is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-Î”E/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. Oh, right, and if the statistical weights are the same, they cancel out, so the ratio depends on the exponential term.

In this case, the excitation level is twice as high for star_1. So, the ratio (n_upper/n_lower) for star_1 is 2, and for star_2, it's let's say x. Wait, no, the problem says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2. Or wait, maybe each star has their own ratio.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as R1 and star_2 as R2. So R1 = 2 * R2? Or is R1 = 2 (since it's twice as excited), and R2 is 1? Hmm, I think the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited. So, the ratio for star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or maybe star_1's ratio is 2 times star_2's ratio. Hmm, no, perhaps more accurately: For star_1, the excitation is higher, so R1 = 2 R2. But not sure, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So, the ratio for star_1 is twice the ratio for star_2. So R1 = 2 R2.

But wait, each
