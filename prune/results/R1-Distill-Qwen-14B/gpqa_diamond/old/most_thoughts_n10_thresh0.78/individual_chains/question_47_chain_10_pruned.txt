Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its IR and NMR data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out.

First, looking at the IR data. There are medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because those regions are typical for amines or amides. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or amide. Could be an ester or an amide since there's N-H present.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR. Let me break down each peak:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, probably from a CH3 group attached to something like an ethyl group. Maybe an ethyl ester?
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an NCH2 group or an ethoxy group's CH2, but ethoxy is usually around 1.2-4.0 as a quartet. Wait, but if it's a broad singlet, perhaps it's adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O or N. Wait, in an amide, maybe the NH is nearby, but in this case, the peak is at 4.0, maybe it's an ethyl group attached to oxygen. Or maybe it's part of an amino group, but the integration is 2H, so maybe -CH2-NH- or something.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. So, if it's a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group. For example, in ethyl esters, like OCH2CH3, the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1-4.3, but in this case, it's at 4.5. Or maybe it's part of a carbonyl group, like CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl.
- 7.0 (d, 2H) and 8.0 (d, 2H): Two doublets each with 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets are likely due to coupling between adjacent protons on the aromatic ring. The fact that one is at 7.0 and the other at 8.0 suggests two substituents on the benzene ring, perhaps an electron-donating group (like OCH3) and an electron-withdrawing group (like NO2), but wait, the molecular formula doesn't have enough oxygen for that. Alternatively, maybe a substituent like an amide or ester group.

Putting this together, the aromatic region indicates a para-substituted benzene. So the compound has a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Wait,
