Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

Alright, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, so first, I think this is an electrostatic potential energy problem. Because when charges are placed in a system, they have potential energy based on their positions. Since it's an isolated system, external forces aren't doing work, so the minimum energy would be when the system is in its most stable state. But wait, how does that translate to the potential energy calculation?

Wait, each charge is 2e, so each has a charge of 2 times the elementary charge, which is approximately 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge q is 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, the charges are arranged in two groups: one fixed at point P (charge Q) and twelve at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the setup is like a central charge with twelve others arranged around it at a fixed distance.

Wait, but the problem says the 13th charge is fixed at P. So the 12 are at 2m from P, meaning the distance between each of those 12 and the 13th is 2m. Also, the 12 are constrained at that distance, so their positions are fixed relative to P.

So the system's potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies between all pairs of charges. But wait, how do we calculate the potential energy for multiple charges?

I remember that the electrostatic potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant (8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²), q1 and q2 are the charges, and r is the distance between them.

But since we have multiple charges, I need to consider all possible pairs. So for multiple point charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. But wait, that's a lot of pairs. There's a formula for that, isn't there?

Yes, the formula for the total potential energy U of a system of charges is (1/2) * Σ U_ij, where the sum is over all pairs i < j. So each pair is counted once.

So let's break down the charges. There are 13 charges in total. The 13th is fixed at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P.

So, the charges are:

- Charge at P: q1 = 2e (so 3.204e-19 C)
- Each of the 12 charges at 2m: each is also 2e. So each is q2 = 3.204e-19 C.

Now, the potential energy comes from two types of interactions:

1. The interactions between the central charge (q1) and each of the 12 surrounding charges (q2). There are 12 such pairs.
2. The interactions between each pair of the 12 surrounding charges. There are C(12,2) = 66 pairs here.

So we'll calculate both contributions and sum them.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: interactions between q1 and each q2.

Each pair contributes (k * q1 * q2) / r. Here, q1 = q2 = 2e, r = 2m.

So U1 = (1/2) * 12 * [k * (2e)^2 / (2m)].

Wait, why 1/2? Because when I sum all pairs, each pair is counted once, and when I'm considering all the 12 pairs of q1 with each q2, each has a single contribution. So maybe I don't need the 1/2 here. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The formula (1/2) * sum(U_ij) comes into play when considering all pairs, but in this case, the contributions between q1 and q2 are 12 unique pairs, each contributing U_ij once. So for those 12 pairs, the total is 12 * [k*(2e)^2/(2m)].

But wait, perhaps it's better to model the entire system as the sum of all pairs, including the 12 q2's among themselves.

So
