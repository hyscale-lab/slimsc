Okay, so I'm looking at this question about neutrino flux from the Sun. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think out loud here.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago, and I need to find the ratio of the flux between two neutrino energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-900 keV. So, the ratio is Flux1 / Flux2.

First, I remember that the pp chain is a major source of energy in the Sun. The pp-III branch is a part of this chain, right? So, if it stops, that would affect the production of certain neutrinos.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces which neutrinos? I think the pp chain contributes to the production of electron neutrinos, specifically in the later stages. Like, the main pp-I branch produces positrons, and then pp-II and pp-III involve more steps. Oh right, the pp-III branch is the dominant source of high-energy neutrinos, specifically the 7Be and then the neutrinos from the decay of 7Be into 7Li, right? So these are the neutrinos we detect, like in the Kamiokande experiments.

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of those high-energy neutrinos would stop. But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, are still running, but not pp-III.

So, what's the main source of neutrinos in the Sun? Oh, the dominant source is the proton-proton chain, with the pp-III branch being a major contributor, especially for higher-energy neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, the production of those higher-energy neutrinos would drop.

But wait, neutrinos from other sources—like the CNO cycle—are also present. But I think the CNO cycle is a minor contributor in the Sun, about 1% or so, so maybe it doesn't affect the flux much. So perhaps the main impact is on the high-energy neutrinos.

Now, neutrinos have different energies based on their production processes. The pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, I think around a few MeV. Let me recall: the 7Be neutrino is about 0.47 MeV, but wait, that's 470 keV. Oh wait, but when 7Be captures a proton to make 8B, which then decays, that's a higher energy neutrino. The 8B decay produces neutrinos around 15-19 MeV, but wait, that's way higher than the bands given in the question, which are 700-800 and 800-900 keV.

Hmm, wait a second. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The neutrinos produced in the pp chain—like in the main part of the pp-I branch—are lower energy, right? The pp-I branch produces positrons, which then annihilate to produce photons, but I'm trying to remember the neutrinos. Oh, right, the neutrinos are from the decay of 7Be, which is part of the pp-III branch. So the 7Be neutrinos are about 0.47 MeV (470 keV), but that's lower than the 700 keV band. Then the 8B neutrinos are way higher, like 15 MeV, which is beyond the bands we're considering.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stopped, then the production of 7Be would stop. Oh, because the pp-III branch produces 7Be via the reaction 7Be + proton → 8B, which then decays into 7Be + e+ + νe. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get this straight.

In the pp-III branch, the process goes like this: 7Be captures a proton to become 8B, which then decays into 7Be, a positron, and a neutrino. So the neutrinos from 8B decay are high-energy, around 15-19 MeV. But wait, the question is about neutrinos in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV range. So if the pp-III branch stops, those high-energy (15+ MeV) neutrinos would no longer be produced. But what about the neutrinos from 7Be itself?

Wait, no, the 7Be is part of the pp-III branch. So if the pp-III stops, then the production of 7Be via that branch would stop. But I thought 7Be is produced in the pp-III branch. So if the branch stops, 7Be production stops, but what about the existing
