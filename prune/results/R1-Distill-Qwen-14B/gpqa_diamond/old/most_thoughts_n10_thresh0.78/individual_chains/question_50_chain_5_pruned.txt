Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops are in the Feynman diagram based on the given expression. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process and the complexity of the integral involved in calculating it.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4π)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break this down. I know that alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is related to the electromagnetic coupling. g is probably a coupling constant, maybe for a non-Abelian gauge theory like the strong force or something else. The sqrt(2) and the 8 might be numerical factors from symmetry considerations or group theory factors. The denominator (4π)^6 suggests something about the loop integrals, maybe from the integration over momentum in the loops.

Wait, loop integrals in quantum field theory often involve factors of 4π from the integration in d dimensions. Each loop integral typically contributes a factor of (4π)^something. So, the number of loops might relate to the exponent in the denominator.

Let me think about loop integrals and their dimensions. Each loop integral in 4D spacetime (which is the usual case here) contributes a factor of (4π)^2, because the integral in 4D usually gives a term like ∫ d^4k/(2π)^4, which when evaluated can give log divergences or other terms. Wait, but in regularization, especially dimensional regularization, the factors can vary, but in other methods like cutoff regularization or others, the factors are more explicit.

Wait, the overall expression has a denominator (4π)^6. Let me count the powers. So 4π is raised to the 6th power in the denominator. Each loop might contribute a (4π)^something. For example, a one-loop diagram might have a factor of (4π)^2 in the denominator. Because in a one-loop integral, the integral would be something like ∫d^4k / (2π)^4, which after some steps, gives a (4π)^2 factor when regularized or evaluated.

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. I remember that in dimensional regularization, the integral might not have the same factors, but in other regularizations, like cutoff or in some books, the Feynman integrals can give terms with (4π)^n. Let's think about the superficial degree of divergence. For a loop integral in 4D, the superficial degree is D=4L - 2I + V, but that might not directly help here.

Alternatively, thinking about the general form of loop integrals. Each loop contributes a certain number of powers of 4π. For instance, each loop in a Feynman diagram usually comes with a factor of (4π)^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime dimension. But since we're in 4D, d=4, so each loop would contribute (4π)^2. But wait, that might be when you're doing dimensional analysis or in the context of renormalization.

Wait, but the denominator in the given expression is (4π)^6. So if each loop contributes a (4π)^2 in the denominator, then the number of loops L would be 6 / 2 = 3? Because each loop gives a 4π squared in the denominator. So 3 loops would give (4π)^6 in the denominator.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose each loop brings in a factor of 1/(4π)^2. Then for L loops, it's (1/(4π)^2)^L, which is 1/(4π)^{2L}. The given denominator is (4π)^6, so 2L=6 → L=3. So the diagram has 3 loops.

Looking at the options, D is 3. So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the number of loops in the Feynman diagram, we analyze the given expression: 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2.
\]

The key factor to focus on is the term \((4
