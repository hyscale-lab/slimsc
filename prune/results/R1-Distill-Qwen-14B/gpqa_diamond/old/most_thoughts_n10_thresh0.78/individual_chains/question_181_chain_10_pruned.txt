Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I need to figure out the ratio of their flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, let's start by breaking down what the question is saying.

The Sun produces a lot of neutrinos, right? And these neutrinos come from different nuclear reactions happening in the solar core. The question mentions the pp-III branch suddenly stopping about 8.5 minutes ago. Wait, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several proton-proton (pp) chains. Oh right, there's the pp-I, pp-II, and pp-III branches. I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly the ones with higher energies because they come from more energetic reactions.

So if the pp-III branch stops, that means the production of those high-energy neutrinos would stop. But wait, the question says all other reactions remain as they were. So other branches, like pp-I and pp-II, are still producing neutrinos as usual. 

The question is asking about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So I need to think about how the pp-III branch contributes to these energy ranges.

I think the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with energies higher than those from the lower branches. For example, the pp-I chain leads to lower-energy neutrinos, and pp-III produces higher-energy ones. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy neutrinos (like those in band 2, 800-900 keV) would no longer be produced. But band 1 is 700-800 keV. Wait, but if pp-III is responsible for the higher energies, maybe band 2 is mostly from pp-III. So after it stops, the flux in band 2 would drop a lot, while band 1 might still have some contribution.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The pp-III branch is the dominant source of high-energy neutrinos. The neutrinos from the pp-III branch are in the higher energy range, so if that stops, the flux in the higher bands like band 2 would decrease. But what about band 1? Are neutrinos in band 1 still being produced, or are they
