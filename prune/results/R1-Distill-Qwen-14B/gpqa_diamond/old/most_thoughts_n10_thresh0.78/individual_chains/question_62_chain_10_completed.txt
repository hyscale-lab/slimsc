Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me draw it out mentally. Okay, the structure must have a cyclohexane ring. Attached to that ring is a methyl group, and that methyl has two substituents: a hydroxy group and a cyclohexyl group. So the methyl is connected to both the cyclohexane ring and another cyclohexyl group, as well as an OH group. Additionally, the main ring has a carbonyl group because it's a carbaldehyde. So the main ring has a carbonyl as well.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynyl is a triple bond, right? So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group attached, which is like a -C≡CH group. So starting from that, how to get to the target molecule?

Let me think about the possible reactions and reagents. The options are all sequences of steps, so I need to figure out the right order.

Looking at the target, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group connected to another cyclohexyl and an OH, plus a formyl group (carbaldehyde). So, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group attached to the main cyclohexane ring.

Wait, actually, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring is cyclohexane, with a substituent at position 1. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)—so that's a methyl group attached to the ring, which itself is attached to a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. Plus, the main ring has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) as another substituent.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me parse that IUPAC name again. The parent chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the main ring is cyclohexane with an aldehyde group. Then, the substituent is at position 1, which is the (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group.

So, the main ring is a cyclohexane with an aldehyde group at one position, and a branch at position 1 which is a CH2 group (since it's a methyl) connected to a cyclohexyl (another cyclohexane ring) and an OH group. So the structure is:

Main ring: cyclohexane with a formyl (CHO) group.

At position 1 of the main ring, a CH2 group is attached that has two substituents: OH and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but CH2 can't have two substituents if it's a methylene group. Oh wait, no—CH2 is a methane with two substituents, but wait, CH2 can't have more than two substituents unless it's a CH2 group with two branches. Wait, perhaps the structure is a CH group attached to two other groups: a cyclohexyl and an OH. So the substituent would be a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), so that would be a methyl group (so CH2-) with a hydroxy group and a cyclohexyl attached. So the substituent is CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexyl attached to the main ring? No, wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)—which would be a methyl group where one of the H's is replaced by a cyclohexyl and another H is replaced by an OH. So the group is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl), attached to the main ring.

So the main ring is cyclohexane with a carbonyl group (CHO) and a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached. Hmm.

So, the target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a branch that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

So how do we get there from ethynylcyclohexane?

Let me think about the steps.

Ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. So, if I want to add a cyclohexyl group to a carbon adjacent to the aldehyde, perhaps.

Wait, but the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main ring. So maybe we can do some cyclopropanation or other methods, but more likely, perhaps a Grignard reaction or something involving adding groups.

Wait, another thought: perhaps we can perform a hydroxylation on the triple bond. Since ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne, adding water across the triple bond could give a ketone or an alcohol.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group. So maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group.

Another approach: Let's think about the reagents in the options. The options give sequences of reagents, so perhaps I can figure out what each step does.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd; 3. Ba(OH)2; 4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, but some of these steps might be for elimination, additions, or other reactions.

Option B: 1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ H2O; 4. NH4OH.

Hmm, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation. Li in liquid NH3 is for Birch reduction or maybe for alkyne deprotonation. Ozone is for ozonolysis.

Option C: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride; 2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. Ba(OH)2.

Option D: 1. NaNH2, methanol; 2. Li/liq. NH3; 3. O3/ (CH3)2S; 4. NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 and methyl chloride would likely perform an alkylation. NaNH2 is a strong base; when used with alkyl halides, it can effect deprotonation, perhaps leading to an elimination or alkyne alkylation.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. If I treat it with a strong base like NaNH2 and a methyl halide, perhaps it's an alkyne alkylation. Because NaNH2 is a strong base, it can deprotonate the triple bond (if possible) to form a metal acetylide. Then, adding methyl chloride would alkylate it.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. The acidic protons on terminal alkynes are around pKa ~25. So, with a strong base like NaNH2 (which is more basic than, say, NaOH), it can deprotonate the alkyne to form the acetylide ion.

Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would react as an alkylating agent. So the acetylide would attack the methyl chloride, adding a methyl group to the alkyne. So ethynylcyclohexane would become (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but wait, ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. Deprotonating to form (cyclohexyl)C≡C^- Na^+. Then adding methyl chloride would add a methyl group, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3, which is 1-methyl-1-cyclohexylethyne or something like that.

So after step 1 in option C, we would have a longer alkyne.

But then, step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. That sounds like hydrogenation. So H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. Wait, but hydrogenation of an alkyne can go to cis or trans alkene, but with certain catalysts. Alternatively, using H2 and Lindlar's catalyst would give cis, but with Pd, maybe it's full hydrogenation to single bond.

Wait, but hydrogenation of the alkyne (C≡C) with H2 and Pd would typically add two hydrogens across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3 would become (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3 upon hydrogenation. Wait, no, wait—adding two Hs to each carbon? No, wait: the triple bond is between carbons 1 and 2. Hydrogenation would add two Hs to each carbon, turning C≡C into single bond. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3 becomes (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3. So the molecule becomes 1-cyclohexylethane with a methyl group? Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe after adding methyl via alkyne alkylation, we hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so the alkyne becomes a single bond. So, the product after step 2 would be (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3. But that might not be helpful.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: What if after the alkylation, the triple bond is converted to a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, that's another possibility. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps the process involves adding a substituent with a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the ethynyl group is transformed into a carbonyl group. For example, oxidation of the alkyne to a ketone or an aldehyde.

But ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. If we oxidize this, the triple bond can be converted into a ketone or a carboxylic acid, depending on conditions.

Wait, but oxidation of terminal alkynes can give either ketones or carboxylic acids. For example, O3 (ozone) followed by reductive workup (like Zn/H2O) can break the alkyne into carbonyl groups.

But let's look back at the options. Option C has O3 and (CH3)2S as the third step. Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup (like using dimethyl sulfide) would cleave the alkyne into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but in our case, the initial molecule is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a single triple bond attached to a cyclohexane. So ozonolysis would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So (cyclohexyl)C≡CH would become cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and formaldehyde? Or maybe not.

Wait, wait. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (RC≡CH) would typically give a ketone and a carboxylic acid. For example, R-C≡C-H upon ozonolysis would give R-C=O and H-C(=O)-OH. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via some other method. Wait, another possibility: hydroboration of the alkyne? Or perhaps a hydration reaction.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the triple bond is first converted into a cis or trans double bond, and then some dihydroxylation or epoxidation occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is to form a Grignard reagent.

Wait, but getting back to the target molecule, which has a formyl group. So perhaps the aldehyde group comes from the alkyne being partially oxidized.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option C: Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, alkyne alkylation to give a longer alkyne. Step 2: H2 and Pd-CaCO3. Hydrogenation of alkyne to alkane. So (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3 would become (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3. Then, step 3: O3 with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of the double bond? Wait, but if the triple was hydrogenated to single bond, then it's a single bond, which won't react with ozone. So that doesn't make sense. So perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of the alkyne to an alkene, not a single bond.

Wait, no. Hydrogenation of alkynes with H2 and Pd typically adds two hydrogens across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, the molecule after step 2 would be (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3, which is a propane chain attached to the cyclohexane. Then, ozonolysis would not act on single bonds. So perhaps this option isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the steps in option D: Step 1 is NaNH2 and methanol. So, perhaps that's deprotonating the alkyne and then quenching with methanol. Wait, what's that do? Maybe it's adding a methyl group via an alkylation. Or perhaps it's a hydroxide formation.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base. When reacting with a terminal alkyne, it deprotonates to form an acetylide. If the acetylide is then treated with a proton source, say, methanol, perhaps it would be protonated, but that might not add anything. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option D is forming an acetylide, then quenching with methanol. Wait, adding a methyl group that way? Not sure.

Option B: Step 1 is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, alkyne alkylation with ethyl chloride, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3. Then step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonating or undergoing elimination.

Wait, Li in liquid NH3 is often used for Birch reductions, which is a reaction where arenes are reduced to diols. But ethyne is an alkyne. Alternatively, it could be used for elimination reactions, forming allenes or other structures. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is being converted into a more substituted structure. Then, step 3 in B is O3 and H2O. Ozonolysis of the alkyne would break it into carbonyl groups. So, perhaps (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH2CH3 would upon ozonolysis break into two carbonyl compounds. But I'm not sure what that would give.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is between two carbons, so ozonolysis would cleave each. For example, R-C≡C-R' would become R-O and R'-O, but I'm not certain.

Another alternative is that the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then the alkene is epoxidized or dihydroxylated. But I don't see epoxidation steps in the options.

Wait, perhaps the target molecule involves a conjugated diol or some sort of dienol structure, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the synthesis involves forming a cyclohexyl group via some ring-opening or ring-forming reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from the target molecule and work backwards. Let's think about how to form the target from ethynylcyclohexane.

The target has a cyclohexane ring, a formyl group, and a branch with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the aldehyde comes from oxidation of a primary alcohol or a terminal alkyne.

Wait, the aldehyde could be formed by oxidation of a primary alcohol. So, if we have a primary alcohol, oxidizing it would give the aldehyde.

But then, how to get that primary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne becomes the aldehyde through some process. Wait, another possibility: the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl group via hydration to a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, the hydration of a terminal alkyne can be acid-catalyzed to give a ketone, but that would require the alkyne to have another substituent. For example, R-C≡CH would become R-CO-OH upon hydration? Or R-C-OH?

Wait, no. The hydration of a terminal alkyne (RC≡CH) under acidic conditions can produce a ketone (RC-O-R) or an aldehyde, but I think it usually forms a ketone. Wait, no, actually, the hydration of a terminal alkyne can produce an aldehyde.

Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of an internal alkyne (like R-C≡C-R') would give a ketone. The hydration of a terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) would give an aldehyde (R-CHO), right?

So, if we have ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexyl-C≡CH), and we perform hydration, we would get cyclohexyl-CHO, which is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But wait, that's already a part of the target molecule. But the target has more than that; it has a substituent with a cyclohexyl and OH group.

So, maybe after getting the aldehyde, we need to add a substituent to the cyclohexane ring. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to the aldehyde would form a secondary alcohol, which could then be oxidized into a ketone or something else. Hmm.

Wait, but the substituent in the target is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So perhaps that group is formed via a nucleophilic addition.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the ethynyl group is converted into a ketone, which then undergoes some kind of ring-opening or substitution to add the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis involves adding a cyclohexyl group via a nucleophilic attack after forming a carbonyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized to add both the aldehyde and the substituent.

Wait, let's think about the steps needed:

1. Convert the alkyne into a carbonyl group (aldehyde) to get the aldehyde part of the molecule.

2. Introduce the substituent with the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

So step 1 could be the hydration of the alkyne to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but how? Because ethynylcyclohexane is R-C≡CH. To convert it into R-CHO, we need to add an H and an O. So, perhaps under acidic conditions with HgSO4 and H2SO4 (hydration reagents). So, step 1 would be to treat with H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O to hydrate the alkyne into the aldehyde.

But looking at the options, some have those reagents. For example, option A step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. Option C step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Option D step 4 is NH4OH.

So perhaps the final step is the oxidation or hydration of a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed by adding a substituent to the aldehyde. But how?

Wait, maybe the aldehyde is formed first, and then a cyclohexyl group is added to the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps via a Grignard reaction. For example, adding a Grignard reagent to the aldehyde would form a secondary alcohol. But then, how to introduce the hydroxyl group?

Alternatively, maybe a conjugate addition of some sort.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a carbonyl, and then some kind of addition occurs to add the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a dihydroxylation of an alkene followed by some kind of elimination.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for the reagents that could lead to the formation of the substituent.

The substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, perhaps this is formed via a nucleophilic addition where the cyclohexyl group and the hydroxyl are added to the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps a geminal diol, which upon elimination could form something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction, where a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming an alcohol, which is then oxidized or modified.

Wait, but the substituent has both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So perhaps we need a way to add both groups to the same carbon.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the substituent is formed via a double addition. Like, a dihydroxylation of an alkene followed by some kind of ring-opening to add substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a conjugate addition of a cyclohexyl group followed by hydroxylation.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look at the options again and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkyne alkylation, adds a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond. So, after step 2, it's (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S: this is ozonolysis. But since step 2 converts the alkyne into a single bond, the molecule becomes (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3, which is propane attached to cyclohexane. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, but here there are no double bonds. So this step wouldn't react. So option C might not be correct.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: maybe deprotonate the alkyne and then quench with methanol. So, the alkyne becomes an aldehyde? Or maybe it's a hydroxide.

Wait, NaNH2 and methanol: NaNH2 is a strong base, so when you mix it with a terminal alkyne, it deprotonates to form the acetylide. Then, if you add methanol, the acetylide would react with it. Wait, but CH3OH is a nucleophile; the acetylide would attack the methyl group in CH3OH? Or would it protonate? Hmm.

Wait, the acetylide ion is a strong base. If you have a proton source, like methanol, it would pick up a proton to form the corresponding alkyne. So perhaps step 1 in D just forms the acetylide and then protonates it with methanol, giving the same starting material. That doesn't make sense. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide is treated with something else. Wait, but the reagent is methanol. So the acetylide would react with methanol in a nucleophilic substitution? Or perhaps it's a hydroxide adding.

Alternatively, maybe the acetylide is quenched with methanol, giving the alcohol. So cyclohexyl-C≡C-OCH3? No, that doesn't seem right.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: perhaps the substituent in the target is a result of a conjugate addition. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a dienol, which then adds a cyclohexyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl, and then a Grignard adds a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyls, but they can't add both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl. Unless perhaps a double addition, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the substituent is formed via a hydroboration-oxidation reaction. But I'm not sure how that would apply here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic attack on a carbonyl group. For example, if the carbonyl is activated, and a nucleophile adds, bringing in both groups.

Wait, but how would both groups (cyclohexyl and hydroxyl) be added at the same time?

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is formed via the Corey-Fuchs reaction or some other method, but I'm not familiar with that in this context.

Wait, perhaps the substituent comes from a neighboring group participation, but that's a bit advanced.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is introduced via a ring-opening of an epoxide. But I don't see any epoxidation steps in the options.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but that's more about moving substituents in carbocation structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed through a conjugate addition of a cyclohexyl group to a carbonyl, followed by some oxidation.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde and a substituent with both OH and cyclohexyl groups.

Maybe the synthesis involves forming an enolate, which then undergoes alkylation and oxidation.

Wait, another angle: The target has a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So the carbon has two substituents—OH and cyclohexyl. This suggests that the carbon was once a carbonyl group, perhaps, which was then reduced and substituted.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed through a reduction of a ketone, introducing both groups.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is converted into a ketone via some steps, which then undergoes a Grignard addition to add a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but Grignard reagents typically add once to a carbonyl group, giving a secondary alcohol. To get two substituents on the same carbon, perhaps a double addition is needed, but that's not typical.

Another possibility: The substituent is formed via a conjugate addition, like a Michael addition, but that usually adds to alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution reaction where both groups are added in a single step.

Wait, perhaps the substituent comes from a diol that is then oxidized or dehydrated.

Another approach: Think about the reagents that could introduce a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group on the same carbon.

Wait, the substituent is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So, the carbon has two substituents: -OH and -cyclohexyl. That means it's a geminal diol, but wait, geminal diols have two hydroxyl groups. Hmm, no, but in this case, it's a hydroxyl and another cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a substitution where a leaving group is replaced by both a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group. But I'm not sure how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic substitution on a good leaving group, but what would that leaving group be?

Wait, maybe the substituent is introduced via a SN2 reaction, but that usually replaces one substituent, not two.

Alternatively, perhaps a double elimination, but that's more about forming alkenes.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the possible steps each option would perform.

Looking back at the options, option B: step 2 is Li in liquid NH3. That's a Birch reduction condition, which reduces aromatic rings to diols. But ethynylcyclohexane isn't aromatic, so perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe it's a deprotonation of the alkyne to form an allene.

Wait, NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group to the alkyne, making it longer. Then, Li in NH3 might deprotonate and form a lithium acetylide, perhaps for further alkylation.

But I'm not sure.

Option D: step 2 is Li in liq NH3. So perhaps after step 1, which is NaNH2 and methanol, step 2 could be a Birch reduction or some kind of elimination.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products of each reagent.

Another angle: The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that's a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group and a formyl group. So perhaps the formyl group comes from the alkyne, and the substituent comes from adding a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a carbonyl group (the aldehyde), and then a cyclohexyl group is added to the adjacent carbon via a substitution or addition.

So, how to get the substituent onto the carbon adjacent to the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to the aldehyde. The aldehyde would react with a Grignard reagent, adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but Grignard reagents typically add to the carbonyl, forming an alcohol. So adding a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl magnesium bromide) to the aldehyde would form a secondary alcohol. But how to get both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group on the same carbon?

Wait, perhaps the Grignard reagent is not just adding one group but two. But that's not typical. Alternatively, perhaps the Grignard is used in a conjugate addition, adding to a carbonyl group in such a way that both groups are added.

Wait, perhaps the aldehyde is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard adds twice. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent comes from a dihydroxylation of an alkene, but I don't see that in the steps.

Wait, another thought: The substituent could be formed via a pinacol rearrangement, but that requires a diol.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via oxidation of a secondary alcohol. But then, how to get the secondary alcohol.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should try to see which option's steps could lead to the target.

Option C:

1. Alkyne alkylation (add methyl group).
2. Hydrogenation to single bond (propane chain).
3. Ozonolysis of the single bond? No, doesn't make sense.
So probably not.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe forms the acetylide and then adds a methyl group? Not sure.
2. Li in NH3. Maybe deprotonates and does something else.
3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. So, if after step 2, there's a double bond, ozonolysis would cleave it.
4. NH4OH. Maybe workup.

But I'm not sure.

Option B:

1. NaNH2 and ethyl chloride: alkyne becomes longer.
2. Li in NH3: maybe reduction or elimination.
3. O3 and H2O: ozonolysis.
4. NH4OH: workup.

Hmm.

Option A:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: alkyne becomes longer.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenation to single bond.
3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination to form a ketone.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: hydration.

Wait, maybe.

But let me think about option A. Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride forms (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3. Then, step 2: H2 and Pd hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, giving (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3.

Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination. So, heating with Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination, perhaps forming an alkene. So (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3 would upon elimination form (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH2 eliminating H2O or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if there's a neighboring H, perhaps it forms cyclohexyl-propene or something.

Wait, but (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3 is propane attached to cyclohexane. Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination if there's a possibility for that. Alternatively, perhaps it's used for saponification, but that's for esters.

Alternatively, maybe Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation, but I don't think so.

If step 3 is Ba(OH)2, maybe it's used for epoxidation, but I don't think Ba(OH)2 does that. Alternatively, it's used for elimination, turning the single bond into a double bond. For example, if (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3 is treated with a strong base, perhaps it can lose a molecule of H2O, but since there are no OH groups, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Ba(OH)2 is used in a Dieckmann condensation, but that's for cyclic esters.

Hmm. I'm stuck again.

Perhaps I should think of the target as having a formyl group and a substituent that's a secondary alcohol connected to a cyclohexyl. So perhaps the substituent is formed by first forming a secondary alcohol, then adding the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for the correct sequence.

Another approach: The target has a formyl group (aldehyde), which suggests that the alkyne was converted into a carbonyl group. So the first step is likely to convert the alkyne into a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, which options have a step that hydrates the alkyne into a carbonyl?

Option A step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: that's the usual hydration reagents. So perhaps step 4 in option A is to convert the triple bond into a carbonyl group, forming the aldehyde.

So, let's see:

Option A steps:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: Alkyne alkylation, adding a methyl group.

So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3.

2. H2/Pd: Hydrogenate the triple bond to single bond, making (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3.

3. Ba(OH)2: Maybe elimination to form a double bond? So (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH2 would become (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere. I'm not sure.

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: Hydration of a triple bond, but if the triple bond was already hydrogenated, this would have no effect.

Hmm, perhaps that's not the case. So maybe option A is not correct.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to single bond.

3. Oxidation to form a ketone or something.

But without knowing, it's hard.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 in option A is Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Maybe it's used for elimination, turning the single bond into a double bond.

So, (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH3 → (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is used for oxidation, but I don't think so.

Hmm.

Another option: Let's think about the target structure again. The substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. So, maybe it's formed via a conjugate addition of a Grignard reagent followed by hydroxylation.

Wait, perhaps the Grignard adds to a carbonyl group, forming an alcohol, and then another group is added. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Gabriel synthesis or some other amine-based method, but that doesn't seem relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: The substituent is formed via a Robinson annulation, which forms rings, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Claisen or aldol condensation, but that would form rings or other structures.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Since this is taking too long, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the steps.

The target has an aldehyde group and a substituent with a hydroxyl and cyclohexyl group. So, the aldehyde must come from the alkyne via hydration. The substituent comes from adding a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group to the same carbon.

Looking at the steps, perhaps option D's steps would do that.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: Maybe forms the acetylide and then quenches it with methanol, giving the aldehyde. Wait, no, methanol is a proton source. So deprotonating the alkyne and then protonating would just give back the same alkyne.

Wait, perhaps step 1 in D is adding a methyl group via alkylation. Then step 2 is Li in NH3, which could deprotonate and form a lithium acetylide, then perhaps add something else.

Hmm, no, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, where steps are:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond, so maybe hydrogenation is to an alkene.

Wait, but step 2 in option C is H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Could that hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis-alkene?

Wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and Pd typically goes all the way to a single bond. But using a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, might stop at the cis-alkene. Oh, wait, but the option says Pd-calcium carbonate. I think that's a catalyst for hydrogenation to the single bond, not the alkene.

So perhaps that's not useful.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the steps are designed to form a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that has both the aldehyde and the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond (but if it's a single bond, ozonolysis doesn't do anything).

Hmm, this is going in circles.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, because ozonolysis is a step that would break the molecule into smaller parts, which could then form the substituent.

Wait, upon ozonolysis of a longer alkyne chain, you could get fragments, but I'm not sure how that would lead to the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is done on a double bond formed earlier.

Wait, maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond. So, for example, (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH3 is hydrogenated to (cyclohexyl)CH2-CH2-CH3. Then, perhaps some dehydrogenation occurs, forming a double bond, which then undergoes ozonolysis.

But I don't see any dehydrogenation steps in the options.

Hmm.

Well, considering all this and the time I've spent, I think the correct option is option C. The reasoning is that after alkylation and hydrogenation, ozonolysis would cleave the molecule, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps option D is correct because methanol could be used in some aldehyde formation.

Wait, what if step 1 in option D is deprotonation of the alkyne to form the acetylide, and then quenching with methanol would give the aldehyde. Wait, but I thought that required different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps step 1 in D is deprotonating the alkyne and then reacting with methanol to form the aldehyde. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option C, which includes ozonolysis, which would cleave the alkyne into two carbonyls, forming the aldehyde and another fragment. Then, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 step would do something else.

But without clear reasoning, I'm not confident. However, considering the target's structure, I'll have to make a guess. I think the correct sequence is option C.


The question involves synthesizing 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (aldehyde) and a substituent at position 1, which is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group. This substituent consists of a carbon atom attached to a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a cyclohexyl group (-cyclohexyl). The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₃.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₂CH₃.  
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂, a strong base, may induce elimination or other transformations, but it is unclear how this step contributes to forming the target structure.  
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O are hydration reagents, typically used to convert alkynes to aldehydes or ketones. However, since the alkyne has already been hydrogenated, this step would not effectively form the aldehyde.  
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not align well with the target structure.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₂CH₃.  
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH₃ could deprotonate or reduce the alkyne, but it is unclear how this step contributes to the target structure.  
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O performs ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. However, the alkyne has not been converted into a double bond in this sequence.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but its role here is unclear.  
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not provide a clear path to the target structure.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride alkylate the terminal alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-CH₃.  
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₂CH₃.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, which typically cleaves double bonds. However, since the alkyne has been hydrogenated to a single bond, this step would not effectively cleave the molecule.  
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, but its role in forming the target structure is unclear.  
   - **Conclusion**: While this sequence includes plausible steps, it does not clearly lead to the target structure.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol deprotonate the terminal alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then quenched with methanol. This step likely converts the alkyne into an aldehyde.  
   - Step 2: Li in liquid NH₃ could reduce the aldehyde or introduce additional substituents, but the exact transformation is unclear.  
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S performs ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. However, the aldehyde does not have a double bond, making this step unclear.  
   - Step 4: NH₄OH is a workup reagent, but its role here is ambiguous.  
   - **Conclusion**: This sequence does not provide a clear path to the target structure.

### Final Answer:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly and directly lead to the target structure. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is selected as the most plausible sequence, despite the ambiguities in the steps.

**Answer: C**
