Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The question describes a reaction involving substance X and liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is very close to 277 K. 

I remember that 277 K is about 4 degrees Celsius, which is just above the melting point of water (0°C or 273 K). So B's melting point is near 277 K, which is close to 4°C. Hmm, what substance has a melting point around there? Maybe something like iodine? Or perhaps another element that's solid at room temperature but melts just above 0°C. Wait, perhaps it's something else. Oh, wait, maybe B is an oxide or another compound.

The product of a certain keto acid reacting with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid, since they're also called keto acids) reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. That makes me think of something like an ester or maybe a carbonate. But more likely, perhaps it's a dehydration reaction. Alternatively, maybe X is an acid catalyst? Or perhaps it's something else.

X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs. So, what reagents are commonly used? Maybe something like a halogen, like Cl2 or Br2? Or perhaps a strong base like NaOH? Or a catalyst like H2SO4? Wait, X is reacting with a liquid Y. Maybe Y is water? Or perhaps another liquid like ethanol or some other solvent.

Wait, the reaction is violent, which suggests a rapid reaction. Substances that react violently with some liquids: metals with strong acids, perhaps? Or maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid? Or maybe a reaction that produces a lot of gas quickly.

The gas W has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. So, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons in the molecule. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2O has 8 protons (from O) plus 2 H, so 10 protons. Neutrons would be 8 (from O) + 0 (H) = 8. So 10 protons and 8 neutrons, which don't match. So that's not it.

Another gas is CO2. CO2 has 1 C (6 protons) and 2 O (8 each). So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: C has 6 neutrons, each O has 8, so 6 + 2*8 = 22. Oh wait, that's equal! So CO2's molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So gas W is CO2.

That suggests that the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So, what reactions produce CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid, or maybe a hydrocarbon reacting with something. Alternatively, maybe X is a carbonate, and Y is an acid. Or X is a metal carbonate reacting with an acid like HCl.

Now, precipitate G forms. So when X reacts with Y, a precipitate is formed. Let's think of possible reactions. For instance, if X is a carbonate (like Na2CO3) and Y is a strong acid (like H2SO4), the reaction would produce CO2 gas, and a precipitate might form if the other product is insoluble. Wait, but H2SO4 is a strong acid, and if X is a carbonate, the acid would react to produce CO2, water, and a sulfate. The sulfate's solubility depends on the cation. For example, if X is CaCO3, then H2SO4 would produce CaSO4, which is sparingly soluble. So CaSO4 would precipitate.

But wait, in the problem, X is a substance that incorporates a heavier isotope. So maybe X is a metal with a heavier isotope. Wait, what if X is something like Ca? Because Ca has two main isotopes, Ca-40 and Ca-44, etc. No, wait, heavier than that. Or perhaps X is an element that has a heavy isotope, like chlorine, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37.

Wait, but the product of a keto acid and X has two oxygen atoms. Let me think. If a carboxylic acid reacts with something, maybe it's an esterification. For example, if X is an acid catalyst like H2SO4, then the reaction might involve dehydration. But the product would be an ester. Alternatively, maybe X is something else. 

Wait, when a carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol, you get an ester and water. If X were an acid catalyst, perhaps. But in that case, the product would have more oxygen atoms than the acid alone. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone, but that's not a keto acid. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is something like an acid anhydride.
