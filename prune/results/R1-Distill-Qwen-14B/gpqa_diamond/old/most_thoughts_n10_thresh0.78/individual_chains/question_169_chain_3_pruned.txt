Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it. Alright, the setup is about a decay process where two nucleons of flavor A convert into two of flavor B, and emit particles E and V. The reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The total energy spectrum of E is continuous with some endpoint Q.

Then there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one massless particle M. So the reaction would be 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is how the E spectrum changes in this case.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that in radioactive decay, when particles are emitted, their energy distributions can vary. For beta decay, for example, the electrons (beta particles) have a continuous spectrum because the decay involves a transition where energy is shared between the emitted particles and the recoiling nucleus. Wait, but in this case, the original decay emits two E and two V. The E's have a continuous spectrum.

Wait, why does a continuous spectrum occur? Oh right, it's because the decay process involves conservation of energy and momentum, but the emitted particles can have a range of energies. For example, in beta decay, the emitted electron's energy isn't fixed because the Q value is shared between the electron and the antineutrino, and the recoiling nucleus. So the energy of the electron can vary, leading to a continuous spectrum.

In the given problem, the E particles have a continuous spectrum. So in the original decay, each E can have varying energies up to some maximum Q. So if the emitted particles are E and V, perhaps the energy available is split between them, but I'm not exactly sure how it's set up.

Now, the variant reaction replaces the two V particles with a single M that's massless. So, instead of 2V, it's M. Since M is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c squared, but since it's massless, E=pc. So M's energy would depend on its momentum.

Wait, so in the original decay, we had 2A decaying into 2B, 2E, and 2V. Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum. The initial total energy is the sum of the
