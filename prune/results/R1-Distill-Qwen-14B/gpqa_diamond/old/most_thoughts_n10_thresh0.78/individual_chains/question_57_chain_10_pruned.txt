Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about scattering electrons from a nucleus. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when particles scatter, the scattering amplitude is related to something called phase shifts. Oh right, the scattering amplitude has real and imaginary parts, and the imaginary part is connected to the phase shifts.

The question gives me several phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Wait, the problem says to ignore the rest, so I guess we only consider up to δ₄. 

I think the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is something like the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by some factor. Oh right, the formula I remember is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ (sin δ_l), where k is the wave number. But wait, that's the general approach. But in this case, the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, that's the same as the forward scattering direction, right? So perhaps it's the same as the total imaginary part.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, the scattering amplitude f has real and imaginary parts, f = Re(f) + i Im(f). And the total cross-section is related to the imaginary part. Oh right, the optical theorem says that the total cross-section σ_total is 4π/k² times the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude, Im(f(0)). So, Im(f(0)) = (k/(4π)) σ_total. Wait, no, I think it's Im(f) is (1/(2k)) sum sin δ_l. Or is that for the total? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should recall the exact expression. The scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is given by:

f(s) = sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l +1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] / (2ik r_0) ) P_l(cosθ)

But for the forward direction, θ=0, so cosθ=1. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1
