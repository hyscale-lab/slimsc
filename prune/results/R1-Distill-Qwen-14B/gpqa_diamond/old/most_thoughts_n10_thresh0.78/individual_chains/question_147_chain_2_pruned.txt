Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Consider the annihilation process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest mass energy of A is 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Hmm, okay, so first, I should probably draw this out or at least visualize it. So, protons and antiprotons annihilating to produce two A⁺ and two A⁻ particles. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe that simplifies things because its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass energy. Wait, but protons and antiprotons have the same rest mass, right? Approximately 938 MeV/c² each. So the initial system is a proton and an antiproton.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps we can approximate its kinetic energy as much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe the initial energy is approximately just their rest energies plus a little bit of kinetic. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but in an annihilation process, energy and momentum must be conserved. The initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let me think about their initial momenta and energies.

Let me consider the frame where the antiproton is at rest. Wait, no, the problem says it's moving slowly, so maybe it's better to work in the center-of-momentum frame or the lab frame? Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So perhaps in the lab frame, the antiproton has a small velocity. Alternatively, maybe it's better to consider that the initial momentum is low. But since the problem involves
