Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. Let's break it down step by step. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, that looks a bit complex, but I'll try to visualize it.

First, I need to understand the structure of both the starting material and the target. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group attached. The ethynyl group is like a triple bond between two carbons. So, structure-wise, it's cyclohexane with a Câ‰¡C-H group.

The target molecule, 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, has a cyclohexane ring. Attached to it is a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH group. Wait, no. Wait, the name is a bit tricky. Let me parse it. The main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which means a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde) attached. The substituent is at position 1, which is the same carbon as the aldehyde? Or is it a branching? Hmm, wait, no. The correct IUPAC name would have the substituents as per the numbering. Wait, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexane ring where one carbon is attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, and also a formyl (aldehyde) group. Hmm, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with one carbon (position 1) having two substituents: a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group, and another substituent being the aldehyde. Or maybe the aldehyde is on the same carbon as the hydroxymethyl and cyclohexyl groups.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw this out mentally. Let's think of cyclohexanecarbaldehyde as a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, on the same carbon as the formyl group, there's a substit
