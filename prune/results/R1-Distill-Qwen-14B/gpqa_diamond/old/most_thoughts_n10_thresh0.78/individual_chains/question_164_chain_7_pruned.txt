Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. For system_1, the stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass is the sum of the two stars' masses. The options are A to D.

I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to determine the masses of the stars. The RV semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the star. Let me think about the formula. Oh right, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude is something like K = (v * (M2 sin i)) / (M1 + M2)^(1/3), but wait, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, I think the more accurate formula relates the velocity semi-amplitude to the mass of the companion. For a two-body system, the mass function comes into play. The mass function is (M2³ sin³i) / ( (M1 + M2)² ), and the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) * (1/(1 + q)) ), where q is the mass ratio M2/M1. But maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, I recall that the mass ratio q is (M2)/(M1), and that the velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So the more massive star would have a smaller RV amplitude. So in system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s, so the mass ratio would be v2/v1 = 5/10 = 0.5. That would mean M2/M1 = 0.5, so M1 is twice M2. So M1 = 2 M2, making the total mass M1 + M2 = 3 M2.

Wait, but in system
