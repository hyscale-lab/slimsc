Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the reactions and compounds involved.

The problem describes a series of reactions:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

I need to find the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

Hmm, okay, let's try to identify what these compounds might be. I'm a bit rusty, but let's think.

Step 1: A + 8 B → C (bright red). Bright red product... that makes me think of something like a metal oxide or maybe a transition metal compound. The number 8 equivalents suggests that each molecule of A reacts with 8 molecules of B. So perhaps A is a metal with a +2 charge, and B is a -1 ion. Wait, but B is a gas. Gases like H2, O2, Cl2, etc. So, if B is a diatomic gas, maybe like Cl2? Because 8 equivalents would imply that each A is combining with 8 Cl atoms.

Wait, but if A is a solid, maybe it's a metal. Let's think. If A is a metal, reacting with Cl2 gas. So, for each A atom, 8 Cl atoms are used. That would form ACl8? Wait, that's a bit high. Let me think about metals and their common oxidation states.

Another thought: maybe A is Fe. Iron can form FeCl4, but that's 4 Cl per Fe. Wait, but if it's 8 equivalents, perhaps it's a higher valency. Iron can have +2 or +3. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe A is something else. Let me think about other metals.

Wait, what about sulfur? Sulfur reacts with something? No, sulfur is a solid, but reacting with a gas. Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium (Na), but sodium would react violently with Cl2, but sodium chloride is NaCl, which is 1:1. Hmm, not 8:1.

Wait, another thought: maybe B is not Cl2 but something else. For example, if B is O2, but O2 is a gas. Then A could be a metal that forms an oxide with a high oxidation state. Let's see, for example, OsO4 is osmium tetroxide, which is a bright red solid. Wait, but that's Os reacting with O2 in a 4:1 ratio. Hmm, not matching 8 equivalents. Maybe another metal? Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal that forms a high oxidation state with O.

Wait, but the product C is a bright red solid. OsO4 is bright red, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Let's see, other bright red compounds: maybe lead dioxide (PbO2) is dark brown, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's a transition metal with a +6 oxidation state. Chromium trioxide is orange, I think. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me look at the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. So when C is hydrolyzed, it breaks down into A and two acids. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids might be like H3PO4, HNO2, or something else.

So, perhaps when C (which is a compound of A and B) reacts with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. For example, if C is a metal chloride, then reacting with water would give a metal hydroxide and HCl. But wait, the product is two different acids, F and G. So maybe C isn't a simple chloride. Alternatively, maybe C is a more complex compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfate or another polyatomic ion. Let me think.

Wait, let's consider the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of D to form E. D is a gas, so maybe D is something like H2, O2, or another diatomic gas. But D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents could be something like H2O, CCl4, or others. Let's think.

If D and B react in a 1:1 ratio, maybe D is H2 and B is something else. Wait, if B is O2, and D is H2, then H would be H2O, which is a solvent. That makes sense. So in
