Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, right? Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The compound has 8 carbons in total. Oh wait, di-substituted means it has two substituents attached to the aromatic ring.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, right, so the compound must have both a carbonyl (like a ketone or ester group) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, so two substituents. One is the carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen. Or perhaps one substituent has both? Hmm, maybe, but more likely, each substituent is separate. But wait, the carbonyl could be part of a substituent attached to the ring.

Wait, the total number of carbon atoms is 8. The ring itself is 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 carbons in total. So each substituent is probably -X and something else that adds one carbon each? Or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group that adds some carbons.

Wait, let's break it down. The benzene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents add 2 carbons, so each substituent can't be more than two carbons. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, which would be a -CO-R group. But wait, if it's a di-substituted ring, the two substituents could be a -CO-R and a halogen. But how many carbons would that add?

Wait, perhaps it's a structure where the ring has two substituents: one is a halogen (
