Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read the question again to make sure I understand it.

So, the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that's a 3-dimensional vector. I think in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and the elements are the amplitudes. But I should check if this vector is normalized. The square of the absolute values should add up to 1 for a normalized state.

Calculating the sum: (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. So 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the sum is 6, which is greater than 1. That means the vector is not normalized. So I think I'll need to normalize it first before proceeding. Or perhaps the problem assumes it's normalized, but I should probably normalize it because in quantum mechanics, states are unit vectors.

Wait, but sometimes the problem gives the state as a non-normalized vector, and you have to use it as is because maybe it's just the components and not necessarily a unit vector. Hmm, but for calculating probabilities, you usually need the state to be normalized. So maybe I should proceed with the given vector as it is, but if needed, I'll normalize it.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. The state is given as a column matrix. In quantum mechanics, the state vectors are supposed to be normalized. So perhaps the given vector is not normalized, but I should normalize it by dividing each component by the square root of the sum of squares. So let's compute that.

The sum is 6, so the normalization factor is sqrt(6). So the normalized state vector would be:

(-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6))^T.

I'll keep that in mind. So the state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T / sqrt(6).

Next, the problem introduces two observables, P and Q, each represented by a 3x3 matrix. The task is to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q in that order, i.e., first measure P, then Q.

Wait, but the order of measurements can affect the result because measuring P first could change the state for the measurement of Q. Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, measuring an observable projects the state into an eigenstate of the observable, and the state collapses. So after measuring P, the state becomes an eigenstate of P corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. Then, when we measure Q, it's done on this new state.

So the approach would be:

1. Find the possible eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.
2. Find the probability of measuring 0 for P. This would involve finding the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and then projecting the initial state onto these eigenvectors to find the probability.
3. Once we have the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0, the state after measuring 0 for P is an eigenvector (possibly a combination, but if the eigenspace is more than one-dimensional, we need to consider that).
4. Then, for each such eigenvector, compute the probability of measuring -1 for Q. Sum these probabilities multiplied by the respective probabilities from step 2.

But wait, this might get complicated. Let me think step by step.

First, let's write down the matrix P:

P is a 3x3 matrix.
First row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Second row: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Third row: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm. Let me represent it as:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Interesting. So what are the eigenvalues of P? That's the first thing to find. Because when you measure P, you get one of the eigenvalues, and the probability depends on the projection.

Similarly, for Q, but perhaps that comes after.

So first, let's find the eigenvalues of P. Let me write down the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

To find the determinant of this matrix:

The determinant for a 3x3 is a bit involved, but let's compute it.

| P - λ I | = -λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Alternatively, maybe there's some symmetry that can help.

Alternatively, perhaps P has a certain structure which makes it easier to find eigenvalues.

Looking at P, it's a symmetric matrix (since P equals its transpose), so it has real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors. That's helpful.

Looking at the structure, perhaps the matrix is symmetric and can be diagonalized by some orthogonal matrix. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps P has two non-zero eigenvalues and one zero eigenvalue. Because the trace of P is 0 (since the diagonal elements are zero), so the sum of eigenvalues is zero. Wait, let me compute the trace: the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the trace is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

So if there's a zero eigenvalue, the other two eigenvalues must be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Alternatively, perhaps eigenvalues are a, a, -2a, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a permutation matrix multiplied by some factors, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me calculate the determinant.

The determinant of (P - λ I) is:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] 
- (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ] 
+ 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the determinant.

Compute the determinant:

| -λ      1/√2      0     |
|1/√2   -λ      1/√2 |
| 0      1/√2    -λ     |

Let me expand along the first row.

Determinant = -λ * det( [ [ -λ, 1/√2 ], [1/√2, -λ ] ] )
           - (1/√2) * det( [ [1/√2, 1/√2], [0, -λ] ] )
           + 0 * det(... )

So first term: -λ * [ ( (-λ)(-λ) ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] 
= -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: -(1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ]
= -(1/√2) * [ (-λ/√2) ) ]
= -(1/√2)( -λ /√2 ) 
= (λ)/(2)

Third term is zero.

So the determinant is:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

So,

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Wait, let me compute:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) is -λ^3 + (1/2) λ.

Then, adding (λ/2), so total is:

(-λ^3 + (1/2) λ) + (λ/2) = -λ^3 + (1/2 + 1/2 ) λ = -λ^3 + λ = 0.

So the equation is:

-λ³ + λ = 0

Factor this as λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0 → λ = 0, or λ² =1 → λ=1 or λ=-1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculation because I might have made an error.

Wait, when I expanded the determinant, the second term in the expansion is (-1)^(1+2) times (1/√2) multiplied by the minor determinant.

Wait, the cofactor expansion along the first row is:

M_ij = (-1)^(i+j) * minor.

So for element a12, which is (1/√2), the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * det( minor matrix ).

The minor matrix when removing row 1 and column 2 is:

[1/√2, 1/√2 ]

[0,     -λ    ]

Wait, no. Wait, the minor when removing row 1 and column 2 is the determinant of the submatrix:

Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2], removing column 2, so the elements are [1/√2, 1/√2]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ], removing column 2: [0, -λ]

So minor matrix is:

[ [1/√2, 1/√2 ],
  [0,     -λ   ] ]

So the determinant of this minor is (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) = (-λ)/(√2)

Then, the cofactor is (-1)^(1+2) * minor determinant → (-1)^3 * (-λ/√2) → -1 * (-λ/√2) → λ/√2

So the second term in the determinant expansion is:

a12 * cofactor = (1/√2) * (λ/√2) )= λ/(2)

So the determinant equation becomes:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Let me compute:

-λ³ + (1/2) λ + (1/2) λ = -λ³ + λ = 0

Factor:

λ ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0 → λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

Yes, that's correct.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, -1.

Now, the possible outcomes for P are 0, 1, and -1.

The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P. So I need to find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0, and project the initial state onto those eigenvectors.

So, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the equations are:

Row 1: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3

Row 3: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → v2 = 0

So from row 1 and 3, v2 must be zero.

From row 2, v1 = -v3.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [v1, 0, v3]^T, where v1 = -v3.

So, let's choose v3 = a, then v1 = -a, and v2=0.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [-1, 0, 1]^T.

Because if a=1, then v = [-1, 0, 1]^T.

So the eigenspace for λ=0 is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector. So any vector in this subspace is a scalar multiple of [-1; 0; 1].

Now, the probability of measuring 0 for P is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of the initial state |ψ> with this eigenvector.

Wait, the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

Wait, no, wait. The eigenvector for P is [-1, 0, 1]^T, but perhaps it's not normalized. Let's normalize it.

The vector [-1, 0, 1]^T has length sqrt( (-1)^2 + 0 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(2). So the unit vector is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Let me denote this as |e> = [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

Now, the initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

So the inner product between |ψ> and |e> is:

( (-1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2 * 0) + (1 * 1/sqrt(2)) )

Which is (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

So the inner product is sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

Wait, but wait. That can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Hmm, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me redo the inner product calculation.

Wait, |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

|e> is [ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

So the inner product is:

( (-1)(-1/sqrt(2)) ) + (2*0 ) + (1*(1/sqrt(2)) )

= (1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (1/sqrt(2)) ) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

But wait, that's greater than 1, which can't be the case because inner products can be larger than 1 in magnitude, but when you take the square, it must be <=1 for probabilities.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the eigenvectors. Let me double-check the solution for the eigenvalue 0.

When I solved P |v> = 0, I got v2=0, v1 = -v3.

So the general solution is |v> = a [-1, 0, 1]^T, where a is a scalar.

So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of [-1, 0, 1]^T.

But I think I made a mistake in the inner product. Let me calculate again.

The inner product is (ψ | e ), where e is the eigenvector.

So the components are:

ψ₁ = -1 / sqrt(6)
ψ₂ = 2 / sqrt(6)
ψ₃ = 1 / sqrt(6)

e₁ = -1 / sqrt(2)
e₂ = 0
e₃ = 1 / sqrt(2)

So the inner product is:

ψ₁ e₁ + ψ₂ e₂ + ψ₃ e₃

= [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + (2/sqrt(6) * 0) + (1/sqrt(6) * 1/sqrt(2)) )

= (1) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + (1) / (sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) )

= [1 +1 ] / (sqrt(12)) )

= 2 / (2 * sqrt(3)) )

= 1/sqrt(3)

Ah, that's better. So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3), and the probability is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring 0 for P is 1/3.

Wait, that makes sense. So the first step's probability is 1/3.

Now, when we measure P and get 0, the state collapses into the eigenvector |e> because the eigenspace is one-dimensional. So the new state after measurement is |e> = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T / sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q. What's the matrix Q? Let me write it down.

Q is a diagonal matrix:

Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

So Q is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1.

So the eigenvalues of Q are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is [1, 0, 0]^T.

For eigenvalue 0, it's [0, 1, 0]^T.

For eigenvalue -1, it's [0, 0, 1]^T.

Now, the problem asks for the probability of measuring -1 for Q after measuring P and getting 0.

So, the state after P measurement is |e> = [ -1, 0, 1 ]^T / sqrt(2).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the state after P=0 is |e> which is the eigenvector, which is normalized. So |e> is:

[ -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) ]^T.

So now, we need to find the probability that measuring Q on this state yields -1.

The eigenvalue -1 for Q corresponds to the eigenvector |q> = [0, 0, 1]^T.

So the inner product between |e> and |q> is:

( -1/sqrt(2) * 0 ) + (0 * 0 ) + (1/sqrt(2) * 1 ) = 1/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting -1 for Q is 1/2.

So the combined probability is the probability of P=0 multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0.

Which is (1/3) * (1/2) ) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a minute: is the transition from P=0 to Q=-1 correctly calculated?

Alternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P is |e>, and then we measure Q on this state. Since Q's eigenvectors are orthogonal, the probability of getting Q=-1 is |<q|e>|^2.

Which is as I computed: 1/2.

So the overall probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check all steps.

First, when P is measured and the outcome is 0, the state becomes |e>, which is an eigenvector of P with eigenvalue 0. That's correct.

Then, measuring Q on this state: the state |e> is a combination of the eigenvectors of Q.

The eigenvectors of Q are the standard basis vectors. So |e> can be written as a linear combination of |q1>, |q2>, |q3>, where q1 is [1,0,0], q3 is [0,0,1], and q2 is [0,1,0].

So |e> = ( -1/sqrt(2) ) |q1> + 0 |q2> + (1/sqrt(2)) |q3>.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude for |q3>, which is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So yes, that's correct.

So the total probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

So the correct answer should be D) 1/6.


To solve the problem, we analyze the system's state and the measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) in sequence. The system's initial state is given as \( |ψ\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. The normalization factor is calculated as \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
|ψ\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is given by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). After computation, the eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \). For \( \lambda = 0 \), the eigenvector is determined by solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \), leading to the eigenvector:

\[
|e\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Probability of Measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |ψ\rangle \) and \( |e\rangle \):

\[
\langle e | ψ \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Thus, the probability is:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \langle e | ψ \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State After Measuring \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the system collapses to the eigenvector \( |e\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of \( Q \)
The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors:

\[
|q_1\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_2\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad |q_3\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 5: Probability of Measuring \( Q = -1 \) After \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |e\rangle \) and \( |q_3\rangle \):

\[
\langle q_3 | e \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the probability is:

\[
P(Q = -1 \,|\, P = 0) = \left| \langle q_3 | e \rangle \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Combined Probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0, Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1 \,|\, P = 0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
