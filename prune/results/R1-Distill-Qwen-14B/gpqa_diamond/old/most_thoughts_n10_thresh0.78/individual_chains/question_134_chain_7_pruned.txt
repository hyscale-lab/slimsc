Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change for such reactions can be calculated using the equation: q = m * c * ΔT, but wait, maybe I'm mixing that up with calorimetry. Alternatively, I think the enthalpy of neutralization is often based on the moles of H+ and OH- ions reacting because the process is exothermic.

Wait, let me think about the problem again. The problem states that 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. So, I need to find the enthalpy change when these three solutions are combined.

First, I should figure out the moles of each acid and base. Let's break it down.

HCl is a strong acid, so each mole contributes one H+ ion. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In aq solution, it dissociates first into H+ and HSO4^- and then HSO4^- further dissociates into H+ and SO4^2- but wait, actually, in dilute solutions, H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives two moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 dissociates into one Ba^2+ and two OH^- ions. So each mole contributes two moles of OH-.

So, let's find the moles for each:

Moles of HCl: Molarity * Volume (in liters)
HCl is 0.2 M, 500 mL is 0.5 L. So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl. Each gives 1 H+, so 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4 is 0.3 M, 300 mL is 0.3 L. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, that's 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M, 200 mL is 0.2 L. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

Wait, but wait. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So, the total H+ will be from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So total H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

Wait a second, which one is in excess? So, for neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So, if I have 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, the OH- is the limiting reagent. Because 0.2 OH- will neutralize 0.2 H+, leaving 0.08 H+ unreacted. Or wait, no, perhaps I should think about how much is neutralized.

So, when the three solutions are mixed, the total H+ comes from HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So the total H+ is 0.28 mol, OH- is 0.2 mol. So when they react, 0.2 mol of H+ and 0.2 mol of OH- will react to form water. The remaining 0.08 mol H+ will remain.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually considered per mole of H+ reacting with OH-. But in this case, the question is about the total enthalpy change when these solutions are mixed. 

Wait, but wait again. The problem statement says "the enthalpy of neutralization when [the three are] mixed." So it's the overall reaction, considering all the H+ and OH-.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ or OH- involved. So the neutralization enthalpy (ΔH) is usually taken as the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH- to form
