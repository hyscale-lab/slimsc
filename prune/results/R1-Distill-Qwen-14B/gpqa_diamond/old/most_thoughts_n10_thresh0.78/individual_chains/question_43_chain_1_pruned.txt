Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, I need to visualize the benzene ring. Benzene is a six-membered ring, all single bonds with alternating double bonds. The substituents are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, meta means each is separated by two carbons, right? So if one substituent is at position 1, the others would be at 3 and 5, but perhaps that's not the case here because there are more substituents.

Wait, no, the problem says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each of them is in a position that's meta relative to the others. That would mean each is two positions apart. For example, if the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde might be at position 3, and the cyano at position 5. But wait, that's only three substituents, and the benzene has six positions. But the problem states that there are more substituents: ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group, and para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Oh, that's a lot.

Let me break this down. Let's assign the positions on the benzene ring based on the substituents.

The carboxylic acid (let's call it COOH) is at position 1. Then, ortho to it are the hydroxyl (OH) and dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) groups. Since ortho means adjacent, positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to position 1. But wait, the problem says both are ortho to the carboxylic acid, so they must be in positions 2 and 6.

Wait, but wait
