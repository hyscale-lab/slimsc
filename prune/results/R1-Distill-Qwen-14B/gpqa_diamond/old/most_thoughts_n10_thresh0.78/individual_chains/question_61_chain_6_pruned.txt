Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the final product. Let's break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my reactions, but I'll try to walk through each part.

Alright, the first step is benzene treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitration is a common reaction, right? Benzene reacts with concentrated nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) as a catalyst. The nitration typically occurs at the meta position if there's a directing group, but wait, benzene is just benzene, so it's a meta director? Wait no, benzene itself is an activating group, so nitration would happen in the meta or para positions? Wait, no, benzene is symmetrical, so nitration can occur in any position, but in the case of benzene alone, the nitration adds a nitro group in a meta position? Or wait, no, benzene is so symmetric that any position is equivalent. So the product would be nitrobenzene, where the nitro group is attached to the benzene ring. But wait, nitration of benzene usually gives nitrobenzene, which has the nitro group as a substituent. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait, no. Nitration of benzene is a meta director because nitro groups are meta directors. But wait, when benzene is nitrated, it's the first substituent, so all positions are possible, but the product is a single isomer? No, benzene is symmetric, so any substitution would be the same. So yes, product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Hmm, Br2 with Fe is usually a bromination reaction. Iron as a catalyst, perhaps for substitution? Wait, but benzene can undergo substitution under Fe and Br2. But wait, nitrobenzene is a meta director. So when you brominate nitrobenzene, where does it add?

Nitro is a strong meta-directing group. So the bromine would add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. So in nitrobenzene, the nitro is at position 1. Then adding Br would go to position 3
