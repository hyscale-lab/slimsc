Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, I think they're used for accelerating particles to high energies, maybe protons in this case.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], with given data Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. They're asking how many revolutions the proton makes.

Wait, I need to figure out the number of revolutions. So, in a cyclotron, particles move in a magnetic field, spiraling out as they gain energy. Each time they complete a revolution, they're accelerated again by the electric field. Since the problem mentions two accelerations, does that mean two steps? Or is that just part of the process?

Let me think about how a cyclotron works. The electric field alternates, so each time the particle goes around the orbit, the electric field direction changes, giving them a kick. The frequency of this electric field has to be matched with the particle's orbit frequency as it's being accelerated. Oh right, that's why it's called a cyclotron — because the frequency is synchronized with the particle's rotation.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, I think they use a different approach because as the particles gain energy, their mass increases due to relativity. Oh, right! The mass increases, so the radius of their orbit increases, but the frequency of the alternating field must adjust to match the new orbital frequency. So the frequency ν(α) depends on the relativistic mass.

But wait, the problem gives the voltage as a function of time, which alternates with frequency ν(α), which probably depends on the particle's momentum. Hmm.

The goal is to find the number of revolutions the proton makes as it goes from T≈0 to T1=950 MeV.

So, each time the proton completes a revolution, it gains some kinetic energy. The number of revolutions N would be the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution.

Wait, but in a cyclotron, the energy per revolution is related to the voltage. Let me think about the energy gained each time. The potential difference U(t) is applied across the gap, so each time the proton goes through the electric field, it gains energy equal to the peak voltage times some factor, maybe. But since it's alternating, the actual energy per revolution depends on how the voltage is applied.

Wait, perhaps each half-revolution the proton goes through the potential, so each time it completes a full revolution, it's accelerated twice. But I'm not exactly sure; I might need to think more carefully.

Alternatively, the kinetic energy gain per revolution is approximately equal to the product of the voltage's peak value and the number of times the particle is accelerated per revolution. Since the electric field reverses each half-period, perhaps each revolution involves one acceleration. Or maybe each time it passes the gap, it gets a kick. Hmm.

Wait, in a cyclotron, the particles go through the electrodes (dees) which apply the electric field. Each time they pass through the gap between the dees, they experience an acceleration. Since the dees are alternately positive and negative, the particle gets a push each time. So for each full cycle of the electric field (period T), the particle passes two gaps (once per each half cycle), but since the field alternates, does each passing contribute to an acceleration?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think more methodically.

In a cyclotron, the magnetic field keeps the particle moving in a circle. The electric field accelerates it each time it passes through the gap. The frequency of the electric field is set to match the circular motion frequency of the particle.

The key point is that the number of revolutions N is the number of times the particle goes around the circle as it is accelerated up to the desired energy.

Each revolution, the particle gains some energy. The total energy gained is the sum of the energy gained per revolution.

So if the particle starts with T_initial ≈ 0 and ends at T_final = 950 MeV, the number of revolutions N is approximately (T_final)/(Energy per revolution).

But wait, the energy per revolution depends on the voltage. Since the electric field is U(t) = U0 cos(...), the peak voltage is U0. But how much energy is gained per revolution?

In a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains an energy equal to the potential difference. Since the electric field alternates, the particle will gain energy each time it goes through the gap. For each full revolution, the particle goes through two gaps, but wait, no, wait: in a cyclotron, the two dees are arranged such that the particle alternates between them. So each revolution, the particle goes through one gap (because after each half-circle, it's in the opposite dee and the next acceleration occurs in the next half). Wait, maybe each revolution involves one acceleration? Or two?

Alternatively, no, in a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the gap, it gets a kick. So for each half cycle of the electric field, they pass through the gap once. So each full cycle corresponds to two gaps? But I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

In a cyclotron, the dees are arranged so that the particle alternates between them. Each time the electric field switches, the particle is in the opposite dee and can move into the gap. So during each half period, the electric field is applied, and the particle crosses the gap once. So each half-cycle gives one acceleration.

Wait, but the cyclotron's frequency is matched to the particle's orbit. So each revolution occurs in a time T, which is the period of the electric field. So in each period, the particle completes one revolution and gains energy once.

Wait, I think that's the case. So each time the electric field completes a cycle (period T), the proton completes one revolution, and gains energy equal to the peak voltage multiplied by some factor. So the energy per revolution would be approximately U0 * e, where e is the charge. But wait, the potential is V, so the energy is eV. For a proton, e is positive, so each time it goes through the gap, it gains eU0. Wait, but the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos(...), so the peak voltage is U0.

So each revolution, the proton gains e * U0. Therefore, the number of revolutions N would be (T_final - T_initial)/(e U0). But since T_initial is negligible, it's approximately T_final/(e U0).

Wait, but T is given in MeV, and U0 is in kV. Let me get the units right.

First, compute the energy per revolution. Each revolution, the proton gains e * U0. Let's calculate that in MeV.

e is 1.602e-19 coulombs. U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts.

Energy per revolution, eV = (1.602e-19 C) * (190,000 V) = 1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = let's compute that.

1.602e-19 * 1.9e5 = 1.602 * 1.9e-14 = approx 3.0438e-14 J.

Convert Joules to eV: since 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 3.0438e-14 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 1.9e5 eV = 190,000 eV = 190 keV.

Wait, but wait, that's the energy per revolution. So each revolution, the proton gains 190 keV, which is 0.19 GeV or 190,000 eV.

But the target energy is 950 MeV. Wait, 950 MeV is 950,000,000 eV.

Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 1 MeV is 1e6 eV, so 950 MeV is 950e6 eV.

Wait, but wait, the energy per revolution is 190,000 eV per revolution. So total number of revolutions N = (950e6 eV) / (190,000 eV/rev) = 950e6 / 190e3 = 950e3 / 190 = (950 / 190) * 1e3 = 5 * 1e3 = 5000 revolutions.

Wait, but this is one of the options. Option B is 5300, which is close. Hmm, why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Because in reality, the energy per revolution increases as the proton's speed increases. Because as the proton gains energy, its velocity increases, so the time it takes to complete each revolution decreases. Also, the cyclotron frequency is a function of the mass and the magnetic field, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is adjusted to match the relativistic particle's frequency.

Wait, but the problem says it's a synchrocyclotron, which implies that the frequency is varying to accommodate the relativistic effects. So perhaps each revolution, the energy gained isn't exactly U0, but the same formula applies because the synchrocyclotron maintains the correct phase between the electric field and the particle's motion.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the relativistic energy.

Wait, the kinetic energy is given as T1 = 950 MeV. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So the kinetic energy is about the same order as the rest mass, which means the proton is moving at a relativistic speed. So we need to account for relativistic effects.

Wait, but if the number of revolutions is calculated based on non-relativistic energy, that would be wrong. So how does this affect the calculation?

In a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(qB), but in the relativistic case, the momentum is gamma m v, and the radius is (gamma m v)/(qB). The frequency is (qB)/(2π gamma m). So as gamma increases, the frequency decreases.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted to match the particle's cyclotron frequency, which is ν = (qB)/(2π gamma m). So the frequency changes as the proton gains energy.

But the given voltage function is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0], where ν(α) depends on the current momentum (alpha could be the angle, but not sure). But perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each revolution provides a fixed energy gain.

Wait, but earlier, when I calculated the energy per revolution as 190 keV, the total number of revolutions would be 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV/rev = 5000 rev. But the options don't have 5000. Closest is option B)5300 and option C) 3536.

So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution is actually not 190 keV. Let me think more carefully about how the particles are accelerated.

In a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the potential difference. But the electric field alternates with time, so the particle must be in the correct position when the field is applied.

But for a synchrocyclotron, which is designed to handle relativistic particles, the frequency of the applied electric field is adjusted so that it matches the particle's cyclotron frequency. So the time for each revolution is synchronized with the electric field's period.

Each time the electric field completes a cycle (period T), the proton completes exactly one revolution, and gains a fixed amount of energy.

But wait, the energy per revolution would actually depend on the voltage, but perhaps in a more nuanced way.

Wait, perhaps each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the peak voltage times the charge. So for each revolution, the particle would gain e U0 (since the voltage is U0 peak). So that gives 190 keV per revolution.

But that would give N = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000 rev. But that's not an option. The options are 1864, 5300, 3536, 2500. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the initial energy is not zero but the rest mass. But the problem says T is approximately zero. So the initial kinetic energy is negligible, but the rest energy is 938 MeV. So the target is 950 MeV, which is a bit higher than the rest mass. So the total energy is about 950 MeV + 938 MeV ≈ 1.89 GeV, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is not simply T1/(e U0) because the energy per revolution increases as the speed increases. Because as the proton gains energy, its velocity increases, so each revolution takes less time. But the applied voltage's frequency is adjusted to match the cyclotron frequency, so the number of revolutions per unit time remains such that each application of the voltage corresponds to one revolution.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think about another approach.

The voltage function is U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. Phi0 is pi/4, but perhaps that's not relevant for the number of revolutions.

The key is to find how many times the proton is accelerated as it reaches 950 MeV.

In a synchrocyclotron, each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains energy equal to the peak voltage. So each revolution, assuming it goes through the gap once, the proton gains e U0.

So the total number of revolutions N would be:

N = T1 / (e U0)

But wait, let's compute this.

Given T1 =950 MeV.

e U0 = (1.6e-19 C)(190e3 V) = 1.6e-19 * 190e3 = 3.04e-14 J.

Convert to eV: 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = 190,000 eV = 0.19 MeV.

So each revolution gives 0.19 MeV.

So N = 950 MeV / 0.19 MeV/rev = 5000 rev.

But the options don't have 5000. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the phase shift affects how many times the voltage is applied. But I'm not sure. Phi0 is pi/4, but perhaps that's about the initial phase, but not about the number of accelerations.

Alternatively, maybe the initial velocity isn't zero. Wait, the problem states that the proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. So initial energy is zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy per revolution. Maybe the energy per revolution is higher because the cyclotron's electric field is applied in a way that the particle is accelerated once per revolution.

Wait, in a cyclotron, each time the particle goes through the gap, it gains e U0. But the frequency of the applied voltage is such that each revolution occurs when the electric field switches. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the total number of revolutions is the same as the number of times the electric field switches, because each switch corresponds to one acceleration.

But wait, the field is sinusoidal, so it alternates twice per cycle. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is determined by integrating the energy over time.

But that's getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.

In the problem statement, it's mentioned that the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, what? Oh, the question says, "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV."

Wait, that's a key point. So the proton is accelerated twice. So perhaps each acceleration corresponds to one revolution.

Wait, but that would mean N=2, which isn't any of the options. That can't be right. Wait, perhaps the problem is mistranslated or I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, the problem says: "A proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, i.e. T≈0 undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950 MeV."

Hmm, perhaps the 'two accelerations' refers to the fact that the proton is accelerated twice, but that doesn't make sense because the target is 950 MeV, which is much higher than 2 * U0. So maybe it's a mistranslation, or perhaps the problem says the proton undergoes two steps of acceleration, or maybe the voltage is applied twice?

Wait, maybe the two accelerations refer to the two times the electric field changes direction, so each half-period is an acceleration. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply asking for the number of times the voltage completes a cycle, which would be the number of revolutions.

But earlier calculation suggests 5000 rev, which isn't an option. The options are around 3500 or 5300.

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution isn't 0.19 MeV. Let me recheck the calculation.

Each revolution, the proton gains e U0. U0 is 190 kV, so 190,000 volts.

e U0 = (1.6e-19 C)(190e3 V) = 3.04e-15 J? Wait, 190e3 is 1.9e5. So 1.6e-19 * 1.9e5 = 3.04e-14 J.

To convert to eV: 3.04e-14 J / 1.6e-19 J/eV = 1.9e5 eV = 190,000 eV = 0.19 MeV.

So yes, each revolution gives 0.19 MeV.

So N = 950 MeV / 0.19 MeV/rev = 5000 rev.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps my initial approach is incorrect.

Alternative approach: maybe the energy per revolution isn't e U0, but e U0 multiplied by something. Let's think about relativistic effects.

Wait, in the cyclotron, the time for each revolution T is given by T = (2π m)/(q B γ), because of the relativistic mass. But the applied electric field's frequency is adjusted to ν = 1/T, so the voltage's frequency ν(α) is changing as the proton gains energy.

But for the energy gain, each revolution, the proton gains energy e U0, but I'm not accounting for the fact that as the proton gains energy, the time per revolution decreases, so the number of revolutions increases.

Wait, but perhaps not. Because the voltage is applied in such a way that each revolution corresponds to a fixed energy gain. So the initial calculation holds.

But since the options don't have 5000, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe the voltage is 190 kV peak-to-peak, not peak? Because usually, in AC, peak-to-peak is twice the peak. Oh wait, but the given U(t) is U0 cos(...), so U0 is the peak, not peak-to-peak.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the energy. Maybe each time the electric field switches, the proton gains energy, so for each full cycle (two switches), the proton gains two times e U0. Hence, each revolution would correspond to two energy gains. So the energy per revolution would be 2 * e U0.

Wait, but that would make each revolution give 0.38 MeV, so N=950 / 0.38 = 2500, which is option D. But that's one of the options.

Wait, but why would each revolution give two energy gains? Because the field alternates, so each half-cycle (each switch) would give one energy gain. So one full cycle (two switches) would give two gains. So each revolution would involve two gains, leading to 2 * e U0 per revolution.

In that case, the energy per revolution is 0.38 MeV, so N= 950 / 0.38 = 2500, which is option D.

But why would each revolution involve two gains? Because the particle is in the gap twice per revolution?

Wait, maybe the cyclotron's dees are such that the particle passes through each gap once per revolution. So each revolution, the particle passes through two dees (once each), but each time it's accelerated once. So each revolution gives two energy gains, each of e U0.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Another way: the cyclotron's dees are two semicircular regions. Each time the particle completes a half-circle, it moves into the opposite dee. The electric field is applied across the gap between the dees, and the field alternates direction. So for each half-circle, the particle crosses the gap once, and is accelerated once.

So for each full revolution (two half-circles), the particle is accelerated twice. So each revolution, the particle gains energy twice, each time e U0. Hence, energy per revolution is 2 * e U0.

If that's the case, then the energy per revolution is 0.38 MeV, so N=950 / 0.38 = 2500 rev. Which is option D.

But wait, the first acceleration brings the proton from 0 to 0.19 MeV, but since the target is 950 MeV, using 2500 rev would give 0.38 * 2500 = 950 MeV. That makes sense.

But why did I get confused earlier? Because I thought each revolution only had one acceleration, but perhaps it's two.

Alternatively, maybe for each revolution, the particle passes through two gaps, each time gaining e U0, so each revolution adds 2 * e U0.

In that case, the number of revolutions would be 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) = 950000 / 380 ≈ 2500 rev.

So answer D)2500.

But looking back, the initial data says U(t) = U0 cos[...]. So the voltage is applied once per revolution, but the way the dees are arranged, probably each revolution allows two acceleration events.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of times the electric field switches. Each full cycle of the electric field (which is a full period) corresponds to one acceleration. But in that case, each revolution would correspond to one acceleration.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time it takes for the proton to reach 950 MeV. Each time the electric field completes a cycle, the proton gains energy e U0.

Wait, but the energy per revolution is e U0. So N = 950e6 / 190e3 = 5000.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the correct approach is that each revolution gives 2 * e U0, making N=2500, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is 190 kV, but the effective energy per revolution is 0.5 * e U0. Because the cosine function averages out.

Wait, but no, because the particle is accelerated when the electric field is in the correct phase. So the maximum voltage is applied each time, leading to maximum energy gain.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shift of pi/4 causes the first acceleration to be at a lower than peak voltage.

Wait, the problem states that the initial phase is Phi0 = pi/4. So perhaps the first acceleration occurs when the cosine is at pi/4, which is sqrt(2)/2, which is about 0.707 of U0. So the first acceleration is 0.707 * 190 kV = ~134 kV.

But the initial energy is negligible. So the first acceleration gives about 134 keV. Then the next acceleration would be at the peak, 190 keV, and so on.

Wait, but that complicates things. Because the initial phase leads to the first acceleration being at a lower voltage. So the first energy gain is less.

But how many times does the proton accelerate before it reaches 950 MeV?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the number of times the voltage completes a full cycle is the number of revolutions. If the voltage completes N cycles, each cycle gives one acceleration. So N cycles, each with one acceleration, leading to N revolutions.

But earlier, the calculation based on e U0 per revolution gives 5000 rev, which isn't an option. So perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per revolution is not e U0, but e U0 multiplied by the number of times the particle passes through the gaps.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for a formula or equation that relates the energy gained in a synchrocyclotron.

I remember that in a cyclotron, the maximum kinetic energy is given by T_max = (q U0)/(2 m) * (number of revolutions). But perhaps that's not correct. 

Alternatively, the kinetic energy can be found using the formula:

T = (n * e * U0) / 2

Where n is the number of revolutions.

Wait, but if each revolution gives e U0, then T = n e U0.

So n = T / (e U0).

Which brings us back to the initial calculation of n=5000.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps in a cyclotron, the energy per revolution is e U0. So for N revolutions, the energy is N e U0.

So N = T_max/(e U0) = (950e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) = 5000.

But no option is 5000. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the factor is different. Like, perhaps each revolution gives e U0 / 2. So N = 950e6 / (190e3 * 0.5) = 950e6 /95e3 = 10,000. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is equal to the total number of times the electric field switches, which would be 2 * number of full cycles. Because each full cycle has two switches.

So if each revolution corresponds to two accelerations, then the number of revolutions would be N = (total accelerations)/2.

But how many accelerations are needed to reach 950 MeV?

Each acceleration gives e U0. So total accelerations n = T_max/(e U0) = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. So number of revolutions is 5000 /2 = 2500.

So that would be option D.

But wait, if each revolution involves two accelerations, then the number of revolutions is 2500.

Therefore, the correct answer would be D) 2500.

But earlier, I thought each revolution corresponds to one acceleration. So maybe the key is understanding whether each revolution involves one or two accelerations.

In a cyclotron, the particle is accelerated once per revolution. Because each revolution, it goes through the gap once. Because the dees are arranged such that the particle crosses the gap once per revolution. Or wait, each revolution consists of two half-cycles, each in a different dee. So each time it goes through a gap, it's accelerated once. So for each full revolution, the particle is accelerated twice.

Ah, that makes sense. So each revolution, the proton goes through two gaps, each giving an acceleration. So each revolution, it gains energy twice: 2 * e U0.

So the total number of revolutions N is:

N = T1 / (2 e U0) = 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) = (950e6) / (380e3) = 950e3 /380 = (950/380)*1e3 = approximately 2.5 * 1e3 = 2500.

So N=2500, which is option D.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total energy required. The proton is accelerated by the electric field, which alternates with a peak voltage \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \). The total kinetic energy to be achieved is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, each revolution corresponds to two accelerations due to the alternating electric field. The proton gains energy twice per revolution, once when crossing each gap between the dees. The energy gained per revolution is therefore:  
   \[
   \Delta E = 2 \cdot e \cdot U_0
   \]  
   where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \) is the proton's charge, and \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190,000 \, \text{V} \).  
   Substituting:  
   \[
   \Delta E = 2 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19}) \cdot (190,000) = 5.9276 \times 10^{-14} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E = 0.38 \, \text{MeV}
   \]

2. **Total Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total number of revolutions \( N \) is the total energy to be gained divided by the energy gained per revolution:  
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{\Delta E} = \frac{950 \, \text{MeV}}{0.38 \, \text{MeV/rev}} = 2500 \, \text{rev}
   \]

3. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (1864)**: This is too low and does not match the calculated number of revolutions.  
   - **Option B (5300)**: This is too high and inconsistent with the energy gain per revolution.  
   - **Option C (3536)**: This is also too high and does not align with the calculation.  
   - **Option D (2500)**: This matches the calculated number of revolutions and is consistent with the energy gain per revolution.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the kinetic energy of \( 950 \, \text{MeV} \). 

Answer: D
