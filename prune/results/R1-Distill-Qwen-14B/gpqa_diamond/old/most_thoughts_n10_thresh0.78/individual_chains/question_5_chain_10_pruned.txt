Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They've given the components of the operator P as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2 for each component: Px, Py, and Pz.

Hmm, eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Right, an eigenvector is a vector that only changes by a scalar factor when a linear operator is applied to it. So, the operator P acting on the eigenvector gives the eigenvalue times the eigenvector.

Since P is a vector operator, it can be expressed in terms of its components. The operator itself would be the dot product of the vector (Px, Py, Pz) with the direction vector n. Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so its direction can be represented as n = (nx, 0, nz), right? Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should first write the operator P as a vector operator, and then express it in terms of the components given.

The operator P is given by P = Px * x̂ + Py * ŷ + Pz * ẑ. But since we're looking for the eigenvector along a direction n in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because any direction in the x-z plane can be described with polar coordinates, I think. So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), making the operator along n as P_n = (Px * sinθ + Pz * cosθ) multiplied by some factor?

Wait, no. Wait, the operator along n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding unit vector. So, P_n = nx * Px + ny * Py + nz * Pz. But since n is in the x-z plane, ny is zero. So P_n = nx Px + nz Pz.

But wait, the components of P are 2x2 matrices scaled by ħ/2. So, let me think about each component:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So, each component is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So, the operator along n is (n_x * Px + n_y * Py + n_z * Pz), but since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So, n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the polar angle from the z-axis, and φ is the azimuth, but since it's in x-z, φ is zero or 180, but maybe it doesn't matter here.

Wait, let me think about the components. If the direction vector n is in the x-z plane, then it can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So, nx = sinθ, nz = cosθ.

So, the operator P_n is (sinθ) * Px + (cosθ) * Pz. Substituting the matrices:

P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that
