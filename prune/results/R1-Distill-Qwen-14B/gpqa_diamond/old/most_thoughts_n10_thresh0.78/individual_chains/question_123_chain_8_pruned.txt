Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let me read the question again.

So, the supernova happened, and part of the ejecta is moving directly towards the Galaxy's center. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. The question is, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, okay, so we're dealing with relative velocities here. Since both frames are inertial, I think I should use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, classical mechanics doesn't apply anymore.

But wait, 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me convert that to meters per second because standard units might be better. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is approximately 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 m/s is two-thirds the speed of light. That's a significant fraction, so relativistic effects are important here.

So, let me think about this. The problem is about finding the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So, we need to relate the time experienced in one frame to the distance in another.

Wait, but the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So we need to find how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame, and then multiply by the velocity to get the distance. Alternatively, perhaps using the Lorentz factor to find the relationship between the times.

Wait, let me get the scenario straight. From the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at some velocity v. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, according to the velocity addition formula, the velocity observed in one frame (Galaxy) is u, and the velocity as observed from the ejecta is u'. Oh wait, I need to get the correct formula
