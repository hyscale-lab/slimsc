Okay, so I've got this physics problem about light diffraction through an aperture, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems (which I remember are the distances from the center to the midpoint of each side) are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light, which means it's a single wavelength λ, is shining along the z-axis and hitting the aperture vertically. This creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field region. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, we can assume the angles are small enough that tan(theta) is approximately equal to theta.

The options given are A to D, each with a different multiple of λ/a. So the answer will be one of those.

Hmm. I remember that for diffraction patterns, the single-slit and double-slit cases are the most common. But this isn't a single slit; it's a polygonal aperture. When N is very large, the polygon becomes almost a circle, right? Because as N increases, the shape approaches a circle. Wait, but the apothems are all the same. In a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So if all apothems are the same length 'a', the polygon is regular.

Wait, but when N approaches infinity, the shape tends to a circle with radius equal to the apothem? Or wait, no. Because in a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side, whereas the radius (the distance from the center to a vertex) is larger. For example, in a regular hexagon, the apothem is (s * sqrt(3))/2, where s is the side length. The radius is s. So as the number of sides increases, the apothem approaches the radius of the circle. So when N is infinite, the polygon becomes a circle, and the apothem 'a' is the radius of that circle. So in that case, the problem reduces to a circular aperture.

Wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. So for a regular polygon, each side is at a distance 'a' from the center. So as N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, but with a radius equal to the apothem. Because each point on the circumference of a circle is at the same distance from the center. So for a regular polygon with infinite sides, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the circle. So the problem reduces to a circular aperture of radius a.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I'm thinking about a circular aperture. The far field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk, which has a central bright spot and then rings of varying intensity. The first minima in that pattern occur at an angle given by the formula θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (diameter of the aperture). So the formula is θ = 1.22 λ / (2a) because the diameter is 2a. But wait, the options don't have 1.22 λ/(2a) as an option. Let me check.

Wait no, the diameter would be 2a, so the formula for the first minima would be θ = (1.22 λ)/(2a) * 2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

In the case of a single slit (which is a rectangular aperture with width 'a'), the first minimum occurs at a sinθ = λ/2. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is determined by the radius a. The formula for the first minima in a circular aperture is sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, no, I think it's θ = 1.22 λ/(a), because the diameter is 2a, and the formula uses the diameter. Wait, the formula is θ = 1.
