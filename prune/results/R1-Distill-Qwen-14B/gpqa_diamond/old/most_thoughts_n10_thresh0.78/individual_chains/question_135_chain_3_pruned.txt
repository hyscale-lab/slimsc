Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about the decay of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, okay, so this is a Lagrangian term that describes how the boson X interacts with fermions.

Wait, the Lagrangian looks a bit confusing. Let me parse it. The term is -λ f (something) ψ_f (y) ... So perhaps it's a Yukawa-like interaction. The Yukawa coupling usually has a term like g ψ ψ X or something similar. So in this case, maybe X is a scalar boson (like the Higgs) interacting with fermions.

The Lagrangian term is -λ f times something. Let me write it in LaTeX to see better. Oh, the user provided the LaTeX code, so I can expand it:

The interaction Lagrangian is:
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f (y) (\upsilon + X(y)) \psi_f (y)

Wait, that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's actually:
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda \bar{\psi}_f (y) [ (ῡ + X(y)) ] ψ_f(y)
But wait, I think the term should be something like a Yukawa coupling. Maybe it's written as:
\mathcal{L} = - \lambda f X \bar{\psi}_f \psi_f
But the way it's written here, the upsilon (ῡ) is a constant, perhaps the vacuum expectation value (VEV). So maybe the term is similar to the Higgs interaction, where the Lagrangian has a term like -λ f X ψ† ψ.

Alternatively, perhaps the interaction term is \bar{\psi}_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y), multiplied by -λ f. But this would imply that X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So X is a boson that can interact with fermions through this term.

So, the X boson's mass is 6 GeV. The question is about its possible decay products, kinematically allowed at lowest order. So we're looking for fermion-antifermion pairs that the X can decay into.

In such interactions, the X would mediate the production of fermion pairs. For example, X could decay into a pair of fermions, like f and \bar{f}.

But wait, the problem says the interaction is with fermions in general. So, the possible decay products depend on which fermions the X can couple to. Also, considering the mass of X is 6 GeV, the decay products' masses must be less than 3 GeV each because each fermion must have energy less than half the X mass (since energy is shared, but more accurately, the sum of the rest masses must be less than X's mass).

Wait, but wait. The fermion masses can't exceed half the mass of X because each fermion must have a rest mass less than or equal to m_X/2. Because in the rest frame of X, each fermion can have at most m_X/2 as their rest mass, otherwise they can't be produced.

Wait, that's correct. The threshold for a fermion f is that 2
