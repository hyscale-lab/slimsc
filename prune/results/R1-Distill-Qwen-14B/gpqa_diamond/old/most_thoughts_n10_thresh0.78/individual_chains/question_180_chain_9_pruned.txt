Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

We have an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. The mass is negligible, so I don't need to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that—probably just electric potential energy.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, okay, so I think this is about electric potential energy between charges. Since all the charges are the same, they'll either repel each other (if positive) or attract (if negative). But the problem says each has charge 2e, and e is the elementary charge, which is positive. So they're all positive. That means the 12 charges at 2m will repel the charge at point P, but since they're constrained, their positions are fixed.

Wait, but the system's energy comes from the interactions between all pairs of charges. So I need to calculate the potential energy between every pair of charges. Oh right, because each charge interacts with every other charge.

The formula for electric potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. Since all the charges are the same, each pair will contribute the same amount.

So let's break it down. There are 13 charges in total. How many unique pairs are there? For n charges, the number of pairs is n choose 2, which is n(n-1)/2.

Wait, but in this case, 12 are at 2m away from P, and the 13th is at P. So the 13th charge is fixed, and the others are fixed at 2m from it. But each of the 12 charges is at 2m from P, but what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves?

Wait, the problem doesn't specify their arrangement beyond each being at 2m from P. Oh wait, but the system is isolated, and we're looking for the minimum energy. Since the 12 charges are identical and positive, they would repel each other. So the minimum energy would be when they are as far apart as possible to minimize the repulsion energy, but wait—no, wait, wait. Wait, when the charges are as close as possible, the potential energy would be higher because like charges repel. To minimize the energy, the charges would arrange themselves to be as far apart as possible. But since they're constrained to stay at 2m from P, perhaps they're all on the surface of a sphere with radius 2m, each as far as possible from each other. But wait, the problem doesn't specify their exact arrangement, only that each is at 2m from P. So perhaps for the purpose of this problem, we can consider that the distance between any two of the 12 charges is the same as 2m. Or wait, no—wait, if 12 points are on a sphere of radius
