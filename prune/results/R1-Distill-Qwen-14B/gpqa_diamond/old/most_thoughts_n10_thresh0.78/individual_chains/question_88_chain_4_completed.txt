Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to unpack what's going on here.

So the setup is that they're tagging inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and giving them to mice orally. Then, they're using in vivo imaging. From what I remember, when you give something orally, it goes through the digestive system first. The stomach has a lot of acid, which can break down proteins. So that explains why some fluorescence was destroyedâ€”stomach acid probably digested the GFP-tagged proteins.

But some of them made it through and got to the intestinal mucus. I think that the intestinal lining has mucus that can trap things, maybe preventing them from getting into the bloodstream. So some got stuck there before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs, like the Peyer patches, are areas where immune responses are initiated.

They observed fluorescent Peyer patches, which means the GFP made it there. Then they isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in an immune context are probably B cells that are responding to the antigen. Because when B cells encounter an antigen, they start proliferating and differentiate, right?

They sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. Variable regions are part of the B cell receptor (BCR) on B cells. High variability usually suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that changes their receptors. Wait, but I thought the variable regions are determined during B cell development, like during VDJ recombination. Or is it something else?

Wait, let me think. VDJ recombination happens during the early stages of B cell development in the bone marrow. It's when the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create the unique variable regions of the BCR. That's the initial setup of the B cell's receptor.

But after the B cell is activated, they undergo something called somatic hypermutation. This process introduces more mutations into the variable regions of the BCR, increasing the diversity of the antibodies produced. This makes the immune response more specific and effective. So when they sequence the variable heavy chain genes and see high variability, that points towards somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but what about class switching recombination? That's when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't change the variable regions directly. So that wouldn't explain the variability in the variable chains.

Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, not directly about the B cell receptor variability. So option B is probably not right.

So the process happening here is somatic hypermutation. The B cells are proliferating, and each cell's BCR is being slightly altered. This leads to a diverse population of B cells with different variable regions, which is what the sequencing showed.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Stomach acid destroys some fluorescence by breaking down the GFP-tagged proteins, while others reach the intestinal mucus and eventually the Peyer patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs. Fluorescent Peyer patches indicate that GFP-tagged proteins successfully reached these immune sites. Isolating the proliferating cell population suggests the involvement of B cells, which proliferate upon antigen recognition. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability, pointing to a process that modifies the variable regions of the B cell receptor (BCR).

VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the initial variable region of the BCR. However, this process does not account for the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes after antigen exposure. Class switching recombination changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions directly. Complement activation is unrelated to B cell receptor variability. Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, introduces mutations into the variable regions of the BCR after antigen activation, increasing diversity and specificity. This process aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Thus, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
