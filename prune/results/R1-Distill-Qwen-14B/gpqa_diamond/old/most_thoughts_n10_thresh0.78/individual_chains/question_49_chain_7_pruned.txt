Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pericyclic reactions, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question involves three different reactions, all of which are sigma-tropic rearrangements. I remember that sigma-tropic rearrangements involve the movement of a pi bond into a sigma bond, which is a type of pericyclic reaction. These reactions are usually thermally induced and can be either electrocyclic (changing the ring's ring size) or sigmatropic shifts.

The first reaction is: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A.

Hmm. So, the reactants here are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with acid and heat. I'm trying to think of what kind of reaction this would be. Oh wait, when I see an alcohol and a compound with a leaving group (like a good leaving group such as a tosylate), it might be an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution. But wait, but-3-en-2-ol is not a good leaving group on its own. Alternatively, maybe the 1,1-dimethoxy group is something else.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CHNH2. That structure looks like a tertiary amine attached to two methoxy groups. But how does that react with but-3-en-2-ol? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of a Claisen or Cope rearrangement. Wait, the first reaction involves two molecules, so perhaps it's a Cope rearrangement where a conjugated diene rearranges, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in the presence of H+ and heat, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution where the amine acts as a nucleophile. Let me think: the but-3-en-2-ol has a structure like CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, but wait, but
