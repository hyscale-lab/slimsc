Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to figure it out. The question is about the decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is something I remember from my studies. Let me break it down.

The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f f-bar(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm a bit confused about the notation. Oh right, the psi with subscript f is probably the fermion field, and the f f-bar might represent some kind of Yukawa coupling. But maybe I don't need to get into that too deeply for this problem.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find what particles it can decay into. The options are all about different fermion-antifermion pairs. The key here is to figure out which fermions have a mass less than 3 GeV each because the boson's mass is 6 GeV. Because when a particle decays, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of the original particle. Since each fermion comes in pairs (like quark and antiquark or lepton and antilepton), each pair's combined mass should be less than 6 GeV.

So let's list the masses of the known fermions:

- Up quark (u): very light, around 2-5 MeV, so negligible compared to GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, about 3-6 MeV.
- Strange quark (s): around 95-100 MeV.
- Charm quark (c): about 1.2-1.5 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4-5 GeV.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, about 173 GeV. So anything involving top quarks is out of the question because 2*173 is way more than 6 GeV.
- Electron (e): nearly massless, maybe 0.5 MeV or so.
- Muon (μ): about 105.7 MeV.
- Tau (τ): approximately 1.78 GeV.
- Neutrinos: also very light, but maybe negligible.

Wait, but wait, the mass of the boson is 6 GeV. So each fermion pair must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Since each quark comes in pairs, I need to consider their masses.

Let me think about each quark:

u and d quarks are so light, their mass is negligible. So a pair of u and anti-u would be almost 0, which is definitely allowed. Same with d quarks. So any decay into u u-bar or d d-bar is allowed.

s quarks: their mass is about 100 MeV each. So 2*100 MeV = 200 MeV, which is way less than 6 GeV. So s s-bar is allowed.

c quarks: each about 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5 = 3 GeV. 3 GeV is less than 6, so c c-bar is allowed.

b quarks: each about 4.5 GeV. 2*4.5 is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So b b-bar cannot happen because the total mass is too high. The boson isn't heavy enough to produce a pair of b quarks.

What about leptons? Let's see:

e+ e-: almost no mass. So that's allowed.
μ+ μ-: each about 100 MeV, so 200 MeV total. Also allowed.
τ+ τ-: each about 1.78 GeV, so 3.56 GeV. That's under 6 GeV, so allowed.

So the possible decay products are pairs of u, d, s, c, μ, e, and τ. Wait, but wait: the top quark is way too heavy, so any decay into t quarks is impossible.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-. But wait, in this option, they include b b-bar, but as we saw, the mass is too high. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. This looks right because all the masses are under 6 GeV. Wait, but what about charm quarks? 2*1.5 GeV is 3 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, that's allowed.

Option C: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Oh wait, the t quark is way too heavy. So option C includes t t-bar which is impossible. So C is out.

Option D: X → b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. Again, includes b b-bar which we can't have. So D is incorrect.

Wait a second, let me double-check. The options are about the possible decay products. So the correct decay products should include any pair where the sum is less than 6 GeV.

So quarks allowed: u, d, s, c.

Leptons allowed: e, mu, tau.

So the possible decay pairs are:

uū, dđ, sī, cč, μ+μ−, e+e−, τ+τ−.

Looking at the options:

Option B includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e−.

So that's all the allowed ones except for the b quarks.

Wait, but wait, let me check the mass of the tau. Tau is about 1.78 GeV. So a pair is about 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So allowed.

So the correct decay options are all the ones in option B. Wait, but let me check the option again.

Wait, option B is:

c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−.

Yes, that's correct because all these pairs have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but wait another thing. The given Lagrangian is L = -λ f f-bar (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, I'm trying to remember Yukawa couplings. The interaction term would imply that the boson X couples to fermions that are in the same multiplet as ψ_f. Or, perhaps more simply, the fermions that are charged under the force mediated by X.

Wait, but the problem says the interaction is given by that Lagrangian. For the decay, the boson X can decay into any fermion pair where the X couples to those fermions.

Wait, so perhaps not all possible fermions are available because the interaction is only with certain fermions. Oh, right, because the coupling depends on the structure of the Lagrangian.

Looking at the Lagrangian: the term is -λ f f-bar (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the indices here. Let me parse this. The term seems to be something like (f f-bar) multiplied by (v + X) multiplied by ψ_f. Wait, perhaps the notation is a bit messed up. Alternatively, maybe it's a Yukawa coupling term.

In the standard Yukawa interaction, the term is something like g ψ ψ φ, where φ is the scalar field. So in this case, the interaction term would involve ψ_f multiplied by X (since v is a constant, perhaps the vacuum expectation value). So perhaps X couples to ψ_f and f.

Wait, no, the term is written as f f-bar (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm,
