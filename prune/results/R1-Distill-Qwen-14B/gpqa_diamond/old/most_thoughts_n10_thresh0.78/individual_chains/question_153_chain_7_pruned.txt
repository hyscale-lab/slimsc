Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reactions. I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. But wait, let me think this through.

The question has three parts, each with different reactants and conditions, and I need to find their products. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different products for each part.

Let's break it down step by step.

First reaction: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. The product is A.

I recall that dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile, especially in the context of the Michael reaction. It's a diethyl ester of malonic acid, and it's a good donor in conjugate additions. The other component is an alpha-beta unsaturated esterâ€”methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

In a Michael reaction, the nucleophile (like malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the structure of the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is at the 3 position, so actually, it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure would be CH2-C-OCH3 with the substituent on the beta carbon.

Wait, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But with the substituent on the 3 position, so the double bond is between C2 and C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, wait, wait, maybe I should write it properly.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or is it CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 where the p-tolyl is at the 3 position. Hmm, maybe better to think in terms of numbering. The acrylate has a double bond between C1 and C2, with a COOCH3 at C3. So, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? Or perhaps the p-tolyl is on the double bond? I think in E-configuration, the higher priority groups are opposite.

Wait, actually, I might be getting confused. Let me think of it as: The acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So, it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a substituent on the beta carbon, which is the CH2=CH part. Oh, wait, maybe:

The structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? No, that can't be. Wait, wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. But when it's 3-(p-tolyl)ac
