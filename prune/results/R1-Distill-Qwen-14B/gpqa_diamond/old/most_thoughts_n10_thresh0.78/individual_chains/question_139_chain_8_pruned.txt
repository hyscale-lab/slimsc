Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which starting materials A and B produce the given diketones when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. Hmm, let me think about what's going on here.

I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are often used in the production of diazonium salts, especially from aromatic amines. But wait, the products here are diketones, not something like a benzene ring with substituents. Oh, right, there's another reaction where ketones can be formed from certain alcohols. I think it's the Stephen reduction or maybe something else... Oh wait, wait! I remember the benzoin condensation, but no, that's for aldehydes. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the treatment involves the oxidation of alcohols. But HCl and NaNO2 usually aren't oxidizing agents. Oh wait, I think I've heard about the Hock rearrangement. Or perhaps it's about the formation of ketones from something else. Oh! I think this is about the formation of ketones from nitro compounds. No, wait, perhaps it's about the conversion of nitro groups to ketones. Or maybe it's about the conversion of alcohols to nitro groups and then to ketones? Hmm, not sure.

Wait a second, another thought: maybe this is about the production of ketones via the hydrolysis of nitriles. But the reagents don't include any nitriles. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the elimination of amines to form ketones. Wait, maybe it's about the formation of diazonium salts from aromatic amines, and then hydrolysis to produce ketones. Oh, right! I remember that when amines are converted to diazonium salts and then hydrolyzed, they can form carbonyl groups. So if the starting material is an aromatic amine, after diazotization and hydrolysis, you get a ketone. But wait, the products here are diketones, so maybe the starting materials have two amine groups in positions that would lead to two ketones upon hydrolysis.

Wait, but looking at the products: 4-isopropylcyclohexane-1,2-dione and
