Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The problem gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are various points in 3D space, like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc.

Wait, density matrices represent quantum states, right? They're used in quantum mechanics for mixed states. A pure state is a density matrix like |ψ><ψ|, but this ρ is a mixture here because it's adding two projections and then scaling by 1/2. So ρ is a mixed state.

But wait, what's the geometrical position? I'm trying to remember how density matrices relate to the Bloch sphere. Oh right, any single-qubit state can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state |ψ>, the Bloch vector r is (x, y, z), and the density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So if I can write the given ρ in that form, I can find r. Let me try that.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me compute |0><0|. The |0> state is (1, 0) in vector form. So |0><0| is a 2x2 matrix [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding these gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then, dividing by 2, ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ is (I)/2. But the identity matrix is a 2x2 matrix. Now, what's the Bloch sphere representation of this?

The general form for a density matrix on the Bloch sphere is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. So if I compare this to our ρ which is I/2, that means the terms with σ must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z must all be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

Wait, but wait a second. The identity matrix represents a completely mixed state, right? Because when you have a completely mixed state, it's like having no information about the qubit—so the state is maximally uncertain. And in the Bloch sphere, that's the origin, the point (0,0,0).

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). That must be the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix anything up.

Wait, another way to think about this is that the trace of the density matrix is 1. For the identity matrix, Tr(I) is 2, but
