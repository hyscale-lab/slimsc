Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves space travel, time dilation, and relativity. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. So, the astronaut's own time (proper time) will be different from the time measured by someone on Earth.

The setup is this: an alien civilization sends a spacecraft at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip takes from their perspective. Wait, the average lifetime of these aliens is about 150 solar years. So, if the trip takes too long in their frame, they might not survive. Let me think about this.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about that number. Oh wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way. I think it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me go with 160,000 light-years for this calculation. So, the distance D is 160,000 light-years.

But wait, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. That's really, really close to the speed of light. Wait, no, 0.99999987 is almost c but not quite. Let me compute how much time it would take from Earth's frame of reference. Time is distance divided by speed. So, t = D / v.

But wait, from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. So, D is 160,000 light-years, so t = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) â‰ˆ 160,000 / 0.99999987 years. Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.99999987 is very close to 1. Let me approximate it as 1 for simplicity to see what the order of magnitude is. So, if I did that, 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years. But wait, actually, 0.99999987 is slightly less than 1, so the time would be a bit more than 160,000 years. But wait
