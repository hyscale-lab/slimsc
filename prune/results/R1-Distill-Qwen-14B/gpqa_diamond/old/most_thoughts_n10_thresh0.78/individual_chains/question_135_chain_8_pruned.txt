Okay, so I've got this physics question about particle decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it.

The question is about the possible decays of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λf f_bar ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh right, the interaction term must be something like λ times some fermion fields interacting with X. But maybe the specifics of the Lagrangian aren't too crucial here, since the question is about kinematics.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions it can decay into. Kinematically allowed decays depend on the mass of the boson and the masses of the possible decay products.

I remember that for a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, each fermion must have a mass less than half the boson's mass. Because if the fermion's mass is m, then 2m must be less than or equal to the boson mass (M). So M ≥ 2m.

Wait, wait, more precisely, the condition is that the sum of the rest masses must be less than or equal to the mass of the decaying particle. Since each fermion in the pair has mass m, the sum is 2m. So 2m ≤ M.

So for X decaying into a pair, each fermion must have mass m ≤ M/2. Here, M is 6 GeV, so m ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses:

- Up quark (u): very light, around 2-5 MeV. So definitely less than 3 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, about 3-6 MeV. Also way below 3 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): about 95-105 MeV. Still much less.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV. So 1.5 GeV is less than 3 GeV. So c quarks are allowed.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV. Wait, 4.7 is larger than 3, so 2m would be 9.4 GeV, which is way more than 6. So X can't decay into b quarks. So options mentioning b decay are out.

Wait, but some sources say the bottom quark mass is about 4.5 GeV. So 2m would be 9 GeV, which is bigger than 6. So X can't decay into b b_bar.

Similarly, top quark (t) is about 173 GeV, way too heavy. So t can be ruled out.

What about leptons? The charged leptons:

- Electron (e^-): about 0.511 MeV. Way under 3 GeV. So e+ e- decay is allowed.
- Muon (mu^-): ~105.7 MeV. Under 3 GeV, allowed.
- Tau (tau^-): ~1.78 GeV. So 2m is ~3.56 GeV. Wait, that's more than 3 GeV. So 3.56 > 3, so no. So tau decay isn't allowed. So X can't decay into tau+ tau-.

Wait, wait, wait. 1.78 GeV is the tau mass, so 2m is 3.56 GeV. That's more than 6 GeV? Wait no, wait. Wait, the X mass is 6 GeV. So 2m for tau is 3.56 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. Wait, no, wait another correction. Because the mass of each tau is 1.78 GeV
