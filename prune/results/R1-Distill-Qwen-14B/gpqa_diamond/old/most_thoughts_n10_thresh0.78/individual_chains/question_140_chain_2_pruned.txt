Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me go through it carefully.

The question talks about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. I remember that for a molecule to have equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O, but wait, H2O has 10 neutrons (O has 8, each H has 0) and 10 protons (2 H's and 8 O). Oh wait, that's 2+8=10 protons, 8 (O) + 0+0=8 neutrons, no, that doesn't match. Wait, maybe CO or something else.

Wait, what about CO2? No, because CO2 has 22 protons (C is 6, O is 8, so 14 total; no, wait CO2 is C=6, O=8 each, so 6 + 8*2 = 22 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, O has 8 each, so 6 + 8*2 = 22. Oh wait, so CO2 would have 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So if the gas is CO2, that fits. But wait, when I think about gas released when something reacts... perhaps it's CO2 but more likely, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's NH3? Let's see. NH3: N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So total protons: 7 +3=10. Neutrons: N has 7, H has 0 each. So 7. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Another thought: maybe it's CH4? Protons: C=6, H=4 → 10. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0 → 6. Doesn't match.

Wait, maybe it's SO2? Sulfur has 16 protons, O has 8. So SO2 has 16 +2*8 =32 protons. Neutrons: S has 16 (if it's ^32S, but that's the most common?), O has 8 each. So 16 (S) + 2*8 (O) = 32. So same as protons. So that fits. But SO2 is a gas... but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility: Could it be H2O? Let me recalculate. H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Protons: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: O has 8, H has 0. So 8. Not equal. So no.

Hmm, maybe it's something like O2? O2 has 16 protons, 16 neutrons (if it's
