Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it has a stereocenter and isn't symmetrical, making it non-superimposable on its mirror image.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to determine how many are optically active. Let me go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   Wait, this is a substituted alkene. The Z designation refers to the geometry of the double bond. For something to be chiral, it needs a stereogenic center. But in this molecule, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The substituents on each carbon would be Cl, CH(CH3), and two CH2 groups. Wait, but waitâ€”since it's but-1-ene, the structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3 with substituents on C1 and C2. But wait, for a double bond to have E/Z isomerism, each carbon must have two different groups. So in this case, C1 has Cl and two H's, and C2 has CH3 (from 2-methyl), a CH2CH3, and another CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it. Structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait, the structure is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and two other substituents. Wait, maybe the structure is CHCl=CH-CH2-CH3. Oh, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in this case, 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1 with Cl, making Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-ch
