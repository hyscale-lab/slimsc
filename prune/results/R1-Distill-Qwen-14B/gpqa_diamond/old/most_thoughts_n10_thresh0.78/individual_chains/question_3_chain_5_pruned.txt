Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, a spin-half particle in a linear superposition. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh right, |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z matrix. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, expectation value. Right, the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So for a given state ψ, the expectation of an operator O is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩.

So the operator here is 10σz plus 5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation is linear, right? So I can compute each part separately.

First, let's find the expectation of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward.

The given state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write it as:

ψ = (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩

Wait, I should check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.

0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

The eigenvalues for σz on |↑⟩ is +1, and on |↓⟩ is -1. So σz |↑⟩=|↑⟩, σz |↓⟩= -|↓⟩.

So ⟨σz⟩ is the expectation value of σz for ψ. So:

⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (0.5)*⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)*⟨↓|) σz (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ )

Since σz acts on the states as eigenvalues, this becomes:

0.5*(0.5)*1 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2)*(-1) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5*(-1) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2)*1

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute it as the sum of |c_i|^2 times the eigenvalue.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a go.

The problem says a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, right? So σz is the Pauli z-matrix, I think. And the operator given is 10σz + 5σx. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, expectation value... Oh right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state vector. So I need to compute this for O = 10σz +5σx.

Breaking it down, the expectation value will be the sum of the expectation values of each term. So that would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier, because I can compute each part separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1). Let me compute |a|² and |b|².

a is 0.5, so |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b is sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2 is (3/4) because (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. 

So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. 

Wait, that's -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x-matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, right? So I can't directly compute it like σz. I remember that the expectation value of σx for a given state can be found using the components of the state.

The operator σx in matrix form is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I compute ⟨ψ|σx| ψ⟩, I can write it out explicitly.

But maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σx is 2 times the real part of the coefficient of |↓⟩ multiplied by the coefficient of |↑⟩. Wait, let's think about it.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value can be found by:
⟨σx⟩ = (a* b + a b*) where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it out. So σx is represented as:
σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨
