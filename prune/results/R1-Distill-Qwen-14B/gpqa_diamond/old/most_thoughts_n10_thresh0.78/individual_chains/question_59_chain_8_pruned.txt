Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some pH values.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, maybe I should figure out the moles of each acid and base to see what's going on.

Wait, CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

Let me jot this down. The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

First, I'll calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume 0.5 L. Moles = M * V. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So the concentration of OH- is twice the concentration of Ba(OH)2. But for moles, it's 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

So now, the strong acids (HCl) and the weak acid (CH3COOH) are providing H+ ions, and Ba(OH)2 is providing OH-.

Wait, but when you mix an acid and a base, they react. The H+ and OH- will combine to form water. The net reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O.

So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from acids and total moles of OH- from the base, then find out which is in excess.

Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. But wait, in the presence of a strong acid and a strong base, does it matter? Hmm, maybe not, because the strong acid will contribute a lot of H+ which can overwhelm the weak acid's contribution. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the base will consume some H+ from the acids.

Wait, perhaps I should treat all the H+ from the strong acids (HCl) as fully dissociated, and then the weak acid's H+ can be considered separately, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to first compute the total moles of H+ from all acids and the total moles of OH- from the base, then see what's left after neutralization. Then, depending on which is in excess, determine the pH.

So, the strong acid HCl contributes 0.08 moles of H
