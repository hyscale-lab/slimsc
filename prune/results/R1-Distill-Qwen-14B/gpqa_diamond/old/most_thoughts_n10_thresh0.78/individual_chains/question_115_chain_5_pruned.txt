Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Alright, so the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm. Right, so I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and in this case, since it's an electron and positron, their rest mass is considered. The energy and momentum must be conserved in the process.

Wait, the Lorentz factor is given as gamma for each. So the electron has gamma_e =4, and positron gamma_p=2. Since positron has the same mass as electron, but opposite charge. But in terms of momentum and energy, it's symmetric except for the direction.

Wait, but the electron is moving left to right, and the positron is moving right to left. So in the same line, but opposite directions.

So before annihilation, the total energy is the sum of their energies, and total momentum is the sum of their momenta.

But wait, let me think in terms of four-vectors. The total energy-momentum before annihilation would be the sum of the electron's and positron's four-vectors.

Electron: moving to the right (since it's from the left), so its four-momentum is (gamma_e m c^2, gamma_e m v, 0, 0). Similarly, the positron is moving to the left, so its four-momentum is (gamma_p m c^2, -gamma_p m v, 0, 0). Wait, but wait, velocity is direction-dependent. So the positron's velocity is opposite. So its momentum is opposite in direction.

But wait, since they
