Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question carefully.

So, the setup is that we're working with white lupine plants and trying to find genes that contribute to resistance against anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They've done a high-throughput experiment and found three candidate genes: G1, G2, and G3. They created knockout mutants, so each gene is disabled in the respective mutant, and also some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). 

The key thing to note is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor upstream of others. Transcription factors are proteins that help turn on other genes, so they're kind of upstream regulators.

Now, when they tested the mutants, they measured their resistance to anthracnose. The control (wild-type) has 100% resistance. The mutants have varying percentages: lower means less resistance, so plants are more susceptible.

The data given is:
- g1: 75% → So, 75% of the control's resistance. That's a 25% decrease. So, knocking out G1 reduces resistance but not completely.
- g2: 0% → No resistance. That's a big effect. So G2's function is really important.
- g3: 50% → Half resistance. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance a fair bit, but not as much as g2.
- g1g3: 10% → Only 10% of control. That's really bad. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is much lower.
- g2g3: 0% → Same as g2 alone. So when both G2 and G3 are out, resistance is zero. But wait, when G2 is out alone, it's already 0%. So adding G3 knockout doesn't change the resistance further. Hmm.
- g1g2: 0% → Both G1 and G2 knocked out, resistance is zero. So when both are out, no resistance.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0%, which is the same as when G2 is out along with G1 or G3. So maybe G2's function is critical and when it's not present, the resistance is gone regardless of other genes.

Now, the question is about the interactions between these genes. The options suggest various possibilities, like which is a transcription factor, what's epistatic, and so on.

First, I need to think about what these results imply about their functions. Let's consider each gene's contribution.

Looking at the single mutants:
- g2 has 0% resistance. So the presence of G2 is crucial for resistance. Since it's a transcription factor (as given in the problem statement that at least one is a TF upstream), perhaps G2 is the upstream TF. So G2 might be regulating G1 and G3.

In the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% → So without G1 and G2, the resistance is gone. But without G2 alone, it's also gone. So G2's function is essential, perhaps G1's function is redundant in some way? Or maybe G1 is downstream of G2.

Wait, but when G2
