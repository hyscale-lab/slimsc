Okay, I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the question is about oxygen acting as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions. The statement is incomplete, and the student needs to fill in the blanks. The options are about whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant thermodynamically and whether it reacts faster or slower kinetically in acidic solutions.

Hmm, I remember that the strength of an oxidizer relates to its tendency to gain electrons, which is its oxidizing power. The thermodynamic aspect probably has to do with the standard reduction potentials. For example, in basic solutions, maybe the oxygen is a stronger oxidant compared to acidic conditions? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, wait. I've heard that in acidic solutions, the O2 reduction is more favorable. Let's think about the standard reduction potentials. The standard potential for O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O is around +1.23 V. But in basic conditions, the same reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-, with a potential of around +0.40 V. Oh right, so the potential is lower in basic solution. A lower E° means it's a weaker oxidizing agent because it's less likely to be reduced. So thermodynamically, in basic solutions, oxygen is a weaker oxidant compared to acidic solutions. Wait, no, wait. Because in acidic solution, O2 has a higher E°, which makes it a stronger oxidizing agent. So, in basic solutions, O2 is a weaker oxidant than in acidic. So the first blank would be "weaker" in basic solutions.

Now the kinetic part: how fast does oxygen react in acidic versus basic conditions. Kinetics are about reaction rates. I think that in acidic solutions, the reaction might proceed faster because of the presence of H+ ions, which can act as catalysts or facilitate the electron transfer more quickly. For example, in the oxygen reduction reaction, H+ ions help in the protonation steps, making the reaction proceed more rapidly. So in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster kinetically.

Putting it all together, thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions (compared to acidic), and kinetically it reacts faster in acidic solutions (compared to basic).

Looking at the options:

Option C says weaker – faster. The first part is correct (weaker in basic), and the second part is also correct (faster in acidic). So the correct combination is weaker and faster.

Wait, let me double-check. The first statement is about being a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic. So O2 is a weaker oxidant in basic because E° is lower. The second part is, kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic? Faster, because higher H+ concentration probably speeds up the reaction.

So the blanks are filled as: weaker (thermodynamic in basic) and faster (kinetic in acidic). So the correct answer should be C: weaker – faster.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions.

1. **Thermodynamic Behavior**:  
   The standard reduction potential for the O₂ reduction reaction in acidic solution is higher (+1.23 V) compared to basic solution (+0.40 V). A higher reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidizing agent. Therefore, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and a weaker oxidant in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Behavior**:  
   In acidic solutions, the presence of H⁺ ions facilitates the protonation steps in the oxygen reduction reaction, making the reaction proceed faster kinetically. In contrast, in basic solutions, the absence of H⁺ ions slows down the reaction. Thus, oxygen reacts faster in acidic solutions and slower in basic solutions.

Combining these observations:  
- Thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.  
- Kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.  

The correct combination is **weaker – faster**, which corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
