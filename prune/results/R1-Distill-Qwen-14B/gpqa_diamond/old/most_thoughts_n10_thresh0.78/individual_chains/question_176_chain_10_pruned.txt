Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. 

The question is about the probabilities of measuring certain outcomes for two observables, P and Q, in a given state. The state is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1). The operators P and Q are represented by their respective matrices, and the question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring them in sequence.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to find the possible outcomes of measuring P and then, based on the state after that measurement, the possible outcomes of Q.

Wait, but wait. Observables correspond to Hermitian operators, so their eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors give the possible states when measured. So when you measure P, the system collapses into an eigenstate of P, right? And the probability of each eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the original state.

But the operator matrices are given. Let me look at P and Q's matrices.

Operator P:
First row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)
Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))
Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)
Wait, so P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

Hmm, what are the eigenvalues of P? Because the possible outcomes of P are its eigenvalues.

Let me try to find the eigenvalues. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But calculating the determinant for a 3x3 matrix can be a bit tricky. Alternatively, maybe I can guess some eigenvectors. Looking at the structure, perhaps some vectors are eigenvectors.

Wait, for example, consider the vector (1, 0, -1). Let's see if it's an eigenvector.

Applying P to it:

P*(1,0,-1) = [ (0*1 + 1/sqrt(2)*0 + 0*(-1)),
               (1/sqrt(2)*1 + 0*0 + 1/sqrt(2)*(-1)),
               (0*1 + 1/sqrt(2)*0 + 0*(-1)) ]
Which is [0, (1/sqrt(2) - 1/sqrt(2)), 0] = [0, 0, 0]. Wait, that's zero. So (1,0,-1) is in the null space. So λ=0 is an eigenvalue.

Wait, but wait. The determinant of (P - 0 I) is the determinant of P. Let me compute det(P) to see if it's zero. If it's zero, then 0 is an eigenvalue.

Alternatively, since I found a non-trivial solution, 0 is indeed an eigenvalue.

So one eigenvalue is 0. What about other eigenvalues?

Let me consider another possibility. Suppose the vector is (a, b, a). Let's see if this is an eigenvector.

Applying P to (a, b, a):

First component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))b + 0*a = b/sqrt(2)
Second component: (1/sqrt(2))a + 0*b + (1/sqrt(2))a = (2a)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) a
Third component: 0*a + (1/sqrt(2))b + 0*a = b/sqrt(2)

So for this to be an eigenvector, we need:

b/sqrt(2) = λ a
sqrt(2) a = λ b
b/sqrt(2) = λ a

Hmm, let me see. Let's take the second equation: sqrt(2) a = λ b. From the first equation, b = λ a sqrt(2). Substituting into the second equation: sqrt(2) a = λ (λ a sqrt(2)) ) => sqrt(2) a = λ² a sqrt(2). Assuming a isn't zero, we can divide both sides by a sqrt(2): 1 = λ². So λ is ±1.

Wait, but wait. Let's check for λ = 1. Then from the first equation, b = (1) a sqrt(2). So the vector would be (a, a sqrt(2), a). Let's see if this works in the second component.

Second component is sqrt(2) a. On the other hand, λ b is 1*(a sqrt(2)) )= a sqrt(2). So yes, that works.

Similarly for λ = -1. Then b = (-1) a sqrt(2). So the vector is (a, -a sqrt(2), a). Let's check the second component: sqrt(2) a. λ b is (-1)(-a sqrt(2)) )= a sqrt(2). So yes, that works as well.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

Wait, but wait. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, it has three eigenvalues (counting multiplicity). I found 0, 1, and -1. Let me check if the trace (sum of diagonal elements) is zero. Trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. The sum of eigenvalues should be zero. 1 + (-1) + 0 = 0. So that works.

So eigenvalues are 0, 1, -1.

Similarly, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue. For 0, we found (1, 0, -1) as an eigenvector. Let me check if that's correct. As I did earlier, P * (1,0,-1) = [0, 0, 0], which is correct.

For λ=1, the eigenvectors are multiples of (1, sqrt(2), 1) ? Wait, wait. Let me see. When I took the vector (a, b, a), I found that for λ=1, b = a sqrt(2). So the vector is (a, a sqrt(2), a) = a (1, sqrt(2), 1). So any scalar multiple is an eigenvector. Similarly for λ=-1, the vector is (a, -a sqrt(2), a) = a(1, -sqrt(2), 1).

So the eigenstates are:

For P=0: (1, 0, -1) up to normalization.

For P=1: (1, sqrt(2), 1). Let's normalize that. The norm squared is 1^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 +1^2 = 1 +2 +1 =4. So the normalized vector is (1/2, sqrt(2)/2, 1/2).

For P=-1: (1, -sqrt(2), 1), which has the same norm, so normalized as (1/2
