Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a pretty big molecule with multiple substituents. Wait, but wait, the question is about enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the standard enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

But the problem gives me bond energies instead. So I think I need to use the bond dissociation method here. Oh right, the method where you calculate the enthalpy change based on breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the products.

The given data is:
- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. I remember that atomization enthalpy is the energy required to break a C-C bond in graphite to form two gaseous C atoms. Or wait, maybe it's the bond energy for C-C. Hmm, sometimes the two are related. Or perhaps the atomization is the energy to break all bonds in an element to make atoms.

Wait, but in this case, the data provided includes bond energies for various bonds. So the bond energies given are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

And the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, but I'm not sure how that factors in. Maybe it's the bond energy for C-C bonds in graphite or something. Oh, perhaps the enthalpy of atomization is the energy needed to break a C-C bond into two C atoms. So if the bond energy of C-C is 200 kJ/mol, but the atomization is 1000, that seems conflicting. Maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert solid carbon into
