Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about enthalpy of formation. I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, the question here gives me some bond energies and asks to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I think I should start by recalling the formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies.

Wait, the formula goes like this: the enthalpy of formation of the compound (ΔHf°) is equal to the sum of the bond energies of the reactants (the elements in their standard states) minus the sum of the bond energies of the products (the target molecule). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, I think it's the sum of the bond energies of the bonds broken minus the bonds formed. So, ΔH = sum(bonds broken) - sum(bonds formed).

But wait, no, when we're calculating the enthalpy of formation of a molecule, it's the enthalpy required to break all the bonds in the reactants minus the enthalpy released when the bonds in the product are formed. Alternatively, another way I've heard is that the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the bond energies of the product bonds. So, that's ΔHf°
