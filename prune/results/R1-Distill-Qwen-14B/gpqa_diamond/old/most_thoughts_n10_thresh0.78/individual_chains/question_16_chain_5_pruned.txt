Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when there's chirality in the molecule. Chirality requires at least one stereogenic center, but wait, also, the molecule must not have an internal plane of symmetry or a center of inversion, I think. So, if a molecule has a stereogenic center but is otherwise symmetrical, it might not be chiral.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure here is a double bond. For a double bond, the configuration is Z. But wait, what about the possibility of E/Z isomerism and if that leads to chirality. Oh wait, for a double bond to have E or Z, the substituents on each carbon should be different. But in this case, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C double bond C-CH2CH3. Wait, but the structure is CH2Cl-C double bond CH-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, the substituents on the double bond carbons are Cl and CH2CH3 on one side, and CH(CH3) on the other? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, but wait, in but-1-ene, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, wait, no. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure is Cl-C double bond CH-CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with a double bond? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that's not a double bond. Oh wait, wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the first carbon (the one with the double bond) has a Cl and a CH2 group. The second carbon (the one also in the double bond) has a methyl group (2-methyl). So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So the formula for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon (CH2Cl), then the double bond, and the second carbon (CH) has a methyl group. So it's Cl–CH2–CH(CH3)–CH2CH3 but with the first two carbons double bonded. Wait, no, the structure should be Cl–C=CH(CH3)–CH
