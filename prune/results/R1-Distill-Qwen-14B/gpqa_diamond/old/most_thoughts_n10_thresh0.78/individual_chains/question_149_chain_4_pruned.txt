Okay, I'm trying to tackle this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me go through it step by step. So, the problem is about a small peptidic compound that's been synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound is mostly as expected except for two peaks from the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, same intensity, and consistent with the expected molecule.

Hmm, so what's going on here. Let's break it down.

First, the NMR issue. If there are two peaks for the same proton, it's not because of coupling because the integration sums to 1H and the coupling is ruled out. So maybe it's something else. One possibility is that the proton is experiencing different environments, maybe due to some kind of isomerism. Like diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But in this case, the shifts are similar, but not identical. Or wait, the problem says "similar chemical shifts", but the integrals add to 1H. So each peak is half a proton. Or maybe it's the same proton in different environments, causing splitting.

Wait, but what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Maybe if the proton is split into a doublet due to coupling with another spin, but the question says coupling is ruled out. So maybe it's not that.

Then, looking at the LC-MS data. The compound has two peaks with the same mass. So same molecular weight. So it's not a fragment. They're two separate compounds with the same mass? How? Maybe they have the same molecular formula but different structures. Alternatively, maybe they're enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, but enantiomers would have the same molecular weight and same mass spectrum, but in LC-MS, under certain conditions, they may not separate because the HPLC might not resolve them, but in this case, it shows two peaks of equal intensity. Wait, but some HPLC columns can separate enantiomers with chiral stationary phases. If the LC was run under normal conditions, perhaps the peaks co-elute, but the question says two clearly defined peaks, so maybe the column is chiral and can separate them.

Wait, but the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. If the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, and the LC is a chiral column, they would separate, causing two peaks. But the problem says both have the same mass, which makes sense for enantiomers because their mass is the same. So the NMR would show two sets of peaks, but wait, the NMR is from
