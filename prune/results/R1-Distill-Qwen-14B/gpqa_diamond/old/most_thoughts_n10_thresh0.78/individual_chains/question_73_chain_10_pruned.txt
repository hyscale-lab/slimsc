Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, relativisticâ€”so I guess I need to use special relativity equations. Let me think about what the question is asking.

The problem says: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. We need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed? Oh right, that's the speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame of reference. Since they're moving in the same direction, I think I should subtract their speeds, but not just normally because that's not how relativity works. Oh right, in relativity, you can't just subtract velocities; you have to use the velocity addition formula.

So for relative speed, I'll have to calculate it using the formula. Let me remember the formula for relative velocity in special relativity. It's (v1 - v2) divided by (1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). Right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't ignore the effects of relativity.

So here, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c. Wait, which one is the relative speed from which perspective? The problem doesn't specify, but I think it's the speed of one as seen from the other. So, say, the speed of astronaut A as seen from astronaut B's frame, or vice versa. But since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be the difference, but adjusted with the formula.

Wait, let me assign variables. Let's say u is the velocity of the second astronaut in the first's frame. So if astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, then in A's frame, B is moving at (0.5c - 0.6c) but adjusted relativistically.

Wait no, the formula is u = (v - u') /
