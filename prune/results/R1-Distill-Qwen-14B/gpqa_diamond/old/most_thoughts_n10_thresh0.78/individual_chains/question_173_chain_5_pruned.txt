Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Oh right, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, is it ħ or h? Oh, right, ħ is h/(2π), so it's h bar.

The problem says the electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, but how do I connect position uncertainty to energy? Oh, I think because energy is related to momentum. The kinetic energy of a particle is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass. So if I can find the uncertainty in momentum Δp, I can find the uncertainty in kinetic energy.

So first, let's find Δp. Using the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Oh wait, but sometimes people use the approximation without the 1/2 factor, so maybe it's better to just take Δp ≈ ħ/Δx. But for precise calculation, I should remember the factor.

Wait, the question is about the minimum uncertainty, which would be when Δx and Δp satisfy the equality condition, so I can use the exact expression. So ΔE is the uncertainty in
