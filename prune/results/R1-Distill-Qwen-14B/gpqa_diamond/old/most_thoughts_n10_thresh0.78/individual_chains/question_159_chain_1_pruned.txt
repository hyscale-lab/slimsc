Okay, so I’ve got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through. The question says that we're observing a quasar, and in the near-infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops below that. I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad or narrow, but I'm not sure how that ties into the question. Wait, maybe it's about redshift? Because if the peak is at 790 nm, but in the rest frame it's shorter, that would imply redshift.

So, I think the peak in the spectrum corresponds to a specific emission line. Like, maybe the Lyman-alpha line or something else. Wait, Lyman-alpha is around 121 nm in the UV. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer. So the quasar's emission is redshifted. Let me calculate the redshift.

Redshift z is (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) minus 1. So, rest wavelength for a certain line. Let me think, another common line is H-alpha, which is about 656 nm in the optical. But wait, the observed peak is at 790 nm. So 790 / 656 is roughly 1.204. So z would be about 0.204. Oh, but wait, if the rest frame is 656 nm, and it's observed at 790, that's a z of (790/656) -1 ≈ 0.204. So z ~ 0.2.

But another possibility is if it's a near-infrared peak. Wait, near-infrared is longer than 700 nm. Some emission lines in the infrared? Maybe the rest frame is in the UV or optical, and when observed, they're redshifted into near-infrared. Like perhaps Lyman-alpha, which is 121 nm. If observed at 790, that would be a z of (790/121) -1 ≈ 6.445. That's a much larger redshift. So which one is it?

Wait, the question says the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. So maybe it's a broad emission line, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the  rest frame near-infrared line. But I'm not sure which line. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Lyman limit? Hmm, but the Lyman limit is about 91 nm. Wait, perhaps it's the Lyman break, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is the [O III] line which is around 500 nm. Observed at 790 would be z = (790/500) -1 = 0.58. So z approximately 0.58.

Wait, but how does this help with the comoving distance? The question gives the current Hubble constant H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, and the matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy Ωv=0.7, and the universe is flat. So we need to calculate the comoving distance at a=1 (which is now), but wait, isn't a=1 the current scale factor? Or does it mean scale factor a=1 corresponds to the quasar's position? Wait, the comoving distance is a function of the scale factor. So for a=1, the comoving distance is just the distance to the quasar.

Wait, what is the comoving distance? It's the distance that would be measured between two points if space weren't expanding, considering the expansion of the universe. The comoving distance D_c is given by the integral of c/H(z) dz from 0 to z, multiplied by some factors.

But wait, the question says: "the current Hubble constant is 70 km/s/Mpc,
