Okay, so I have this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Hmm, I remember that qPCR is used to quantify the amount of a specific nucleic acid in a sample. The process involves amplifying the DNA through PCR and measuring the fluorescence each cycle, which is the Ct value.

The scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it in serial fashion and ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency was 100%, which means each cycle doubles the DNA perfectly. The R² was 1, so the data fits the curve perfectly. The slope was -3.3, which I think relates to the efficiency and how the Ct values change with concentration.

Looking at the data, each concentration's Ct values are in a triplicate. For example, at 100,000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. Wait, those are pretty close. Similarly, at 10,000, they're around 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. So each replicate varies by about 0.3 to 0.6 cycles. That seems normal because technical replicates usually have small variations.

The question is asking why there are discrepancies in the results. The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't be used for quantification. But the efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, so the curve is perfect. So this probably isn't right.

Option B claims Ct values don't agree with target amounts. But the data seems consistent—each dilution step is a tenfold decrease, and the Ct increases by about 3.3 each time (like from 33.9 to 30.6 is a 3.3 difference). Wait, let me think. Each dilution is tenfold, so the expected Ct should increase by log2(10) which is about 3.32. The slope is -3.3, which makes sense because the slope formula is -log2(efficiency). Oh wait, the slope in the equation is usually -3.322 when efficiency is 100% because each tenfold dilution would require about 3.32 cycles more to reach the same Ct.

Looking at the data: 100,000 to 10,000 is a tenfold dilution. Ct increases from 33.9 to 30.6. The difference is 3.3. So that's exactly the expected change. Similarly, 10,000 to 1000: Ct from 30.6 to 27.3. That's also about 3.3. So the Ct values do correlate well with the target amounts. So option B might not be correct.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Wait, but 3.3 cycles is about
