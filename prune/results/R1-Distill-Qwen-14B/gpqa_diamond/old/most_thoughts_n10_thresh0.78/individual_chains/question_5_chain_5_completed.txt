Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector from the given options.

First, I'll try to understand what the question is asking. The operator P is a vector operator, so it's made up of components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2, which suggests that the operator in question is probably the spin operator, since spin-1/2 particles have eigenvalues ±ħ/2.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. That probably means that the direction is not along y; it could be at some angle θ in the x-z plane, so maybe the angle is measured from the x-axis towards z. Since it's an arbitrary direction, I might need to express the operator P along that direction.

Wait, the operator here might be the spin component along the direction n. So the operator would be P·n, which is a dot product of the vector operator P with the direction vector n. So the operator along n would be P_n = (P_x, P_y, P_z) · (n_x, 0, n_z), since n is in the x-z plane, so n_y would be zero. So P_n = P_x n_x + P_z n_z.

But wait, the problem says "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n." So perhaps the operator is P in that specific direction, which would be P·n. So the eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Alternatively, maybe the operator is P itself, but then the eigenvalues would be different. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says: calculate the eigenvector of the operator P along an arbitrary direction n. Wait, no, maybe it's P_n, the component along n. So the operator is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n lies in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector equation is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Alternatively, perhaps the operator is the total spin, but I'm not sure. Wait, the eigenvalues of each component P_x, P_y, P_z individually are ± ħ/2. So when the problem says the eigenvalue is +ħ/2 for the operator along n, I think the operator in question is the component of P along n, which is P·n. So for that operator, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So my task is to find the eigenvector of P·n corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

But wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The problem statement says, "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n." Maybe it's about the spin operator in the direction n.

I think the approach is to first construct the matrix for P·n, then find its eigenvectors.

Given that n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, we can represent n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the x-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ. Because in the x-z plane, the direction can be parametrized by θ, the angle from the x-axis towards the z-axis.

So P·n would be n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Let me write down the given matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z.

Given:
P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = ħ/2 * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P_x has matrix elements:
( ħ/2 ) [ [0,1],[1,0] ]

Similarly, P_y and P_z are given.

So, P·n = (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) = (ħ/2) [ n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute that matrix.

Let me denote the matrices without the ħ/2 factor for simplicity. So the operator (P·n)/ (ħ/2) is n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z, where σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices.

So the operator matrix (P·n)/(ħ/2) is:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let me compute σ_x and σ_z:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So, n_x σ_x = [[0, n_x], [n_x, 0]]
n_z σ_z = [[n_z, 0], [0, -n_z]]

Adding them together:

[ [n_z, n_x],
  [n_x, -n_z] ]

Therefore, the matrix for (P·n) is (ħ/2) times this, so:

P·n = (ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x],
                [n_x, -n_z] ]

The eigenvalues of this matrix should be ±(ħ/2), since for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenvalues of P·n are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to the eigenvector we're looking for.

To find the eigenvector, I need to solve (P·n - (+ħ/2) I) |ψ> = 0.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x],
          [n_x, -n_z] ] - (ħ/2) [ [1,0], [0,1] ] multiplied by [a, b]^T equals zero.

Factor out (ħ/2):

(ħ/2) [ [n_z -1, n_x],
         [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ] [a, b]^T = 0.

We can ignore the (ħ/2) factor since it's non-zero, so the equation becomes:

[ [n_z - 1, n_x ],
  [n_x, -n_z -1 ] ] [a; b] = 0.

This gives two equations:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Let me write the first equation as:
(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 --> (n_z - 1) a = -n_x b --> a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

But perhaps it's easier to assume a non-zero b, and express a in terms of b, then find the ratio.

Let me take the first equation:

(n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 --> equation (1)
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 --> equation (2)

Since these are two equations, they should be linearly dependent if the matrix is singular (which it is, since it's an eigenvalue equation). So, let's find a non-trivial solution.

From equation (1):
a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

But let me see if substituting this into equation (2) gives a consistent result.

Substitute a = [ -n_x / (n_z - 1) ] b into equation (2):

n_x [ (-n_x)/(n_z -1) b ] + (-n_z -1) b = 0.

Simplify:

[ -n_x^2 / (n_z -1) ) + (-n_z -1) ] b = 0.

Multiply through by (n_z -1):

[ -n_x^2 + (-n_z -1)(n_z -1) ] b = 0.

Expand the second term:

(-n_z)(n_z -1) -1(n_z -1) = -n_z² + n_z -n_z +1 = -n_z² +1.

So the equation becomes:

[ -n_x^2 -n_z² +1 ] b = 0.

But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. So:

[ - (n_x² +n_z²) +1 ] = -(1) +1 = 0.

So this equation is 0=0, which is consistent. So the solution can be taken from equation (1).

Thus, a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b.

Let me pick b=1 for simplicity. Then a= [ -n_x/(n_z-1) ]

But wait, let me think about the denominator. n_z is cosθ, because n is (n_x, 0, n_z)= (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So n_z = cosθ.

So n_z -1 = cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(θ/2), using the identity cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(θ/2).

Thus, the denominator is -2 sin²(θ/2).

So a = [ -n_x ] / [ -2 sin²(θ/2) ] * b.

Simplify denominator:

= [ n_x ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] * b.

But n_x = sinθ, so:

a = [ sinθ ] / [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ) ] * b.

Hmm, let's see. Remember that sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2).

So a = [2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2)] / [2 sin²(θ/2)] ) * b.

The 2s cancel, and we have cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) = cot(θ/2).

So a = cot(θ/2) * b.

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as [a, b]^T = [cot(θ/2), 1]^T times some scalar.

But let me see: if I take b=1, then a= cot(θ/2).

So the unnormalized eigenvector is [cot(θ/2), 1]^T.

Wait, but this must be normalized, right? So the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

But wait, in the problem statement, the question asks for the normalized eigenvector. So I need to ensure that the vector is normalized.

So the unnormalized vector is [a, b] = [cot(θ/2), 1].

The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|² + 1.

Wait, but cot(θ/2) can be written as (cos(θ/2))/(sin(θ/2)), so |cot(θ/2)|² = [cos²(θ/2)] / [sin²(θ/2)].

So the norm squared is [cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2)] + 1 = [cos² + sin²]/sin² = 1/sin².

Thus, the norm is 1/|sin(θ/2)|.

Therefore, the normalized eigenvector is [cot(θ/2), 1] multiplied by sin(θ/2).

Which gives:

a = cot(θ/2) * sin(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2).

b = 1 * sin(θ/2) = sin(θ/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, but wait. Let me check this again.

Wait, the unnormalized vector is [a, b] = [cot(θ/2), 1].

The normalization factor is sqrt( |a|^2 + |b|^2 ) = sqrt( cot²(θ/2) +1 ) = sqrt( csc²(θ/2) ) = |csc(θ/2)| = 1/|sinθ/2|.

So when I multiply by sin(θ/2), I get [ cot(θ/2) * sinθ/2, 1 * sinθ/2 ].

Expressed as:

a = (cosθ/2)/(sinθ/2) ) * sinθ/2 = cosθ/2.

b = sinθ/2.

So the normalized vector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

This looks familiar. For spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstate along direction θ is [cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2)]^T, but since our direction is in the x-z plane, φ would be 0, so it's [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)].

So looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so the components are just these, but let me check the options.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which seems like spherical coordinates but for a different parameterization.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvector of P·n having eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the vector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, but the options are presented as the elements, but the problem states that the eigenvector is normalized. So the options should include the normalized forms.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: ( sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but in my calculation, the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], which is exactly option C.

But wait, the options give the elements as (something, something), but in the question, the operator is given with factors of ħ/2. So would the eigenvector have factors of ħ? Because the operators have ħ/2 multiplied, but the eigenvectors are typically dimensionless. So perhaps the options are expressed in terms of the components without the normalizing factors, but including ħ.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar)

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)).

Not sure about the hbar here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the eigenvector is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, let me think again. The operator (P·n) has matrix elements (ħ/2)[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ].

So when solving for the eigenvector, the process is correct, but perhaps I missed a factor of ħ/2 somewhere. Alternatively, maybe the eigenvector is the same regardless of the scaling factor of the operator, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar multiple.

Wait, regardless of the scaling, the eigenvector's direction in Hilbert space is determined by the matrix elements, so the scaling by ħ/2 doesn't affect the direction (the eigenvector itself is a direction, so scaling doesn't matter). So the components should be as I found: cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Looking back at the options, option C is exactly that. So the answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem states that the eigenvector should be normalized. So the vector [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] is indeed normalized because cos² + sin² =1.

So yes, option C is the correct answer. But wait, let me check the other options.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) factors, which suggests a different normalization. I don't think that comes into play here. It might be relevant if the direction had specific angles, but the problem says "arbitrary direction", so the eigenvector should depend on theta and phi (phi is zero here because it's in the x-z plane). So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me consider the possibility that the problem is not about the spin component but the spin itself. Alternatively, perhaps the operator is the spin in the x, y, z directions, and the question is about the eigenstate when we have the direction n arbitrary in x-z plane.

Hmm, another approach: the eigenstates for spin in a direction (theta, phi) are given by:

|+> = cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) |1>

|-> = -i sin(theta/2) |0> + cos(theta/2) |1>

Since our direction is in the x-z plane, phi=0, so the eigenstate for + is cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2).

Which matches option C.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is composed of components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each given as a $2 \times 2$ matrix multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is for the component of $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$, defined as $P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane.

The matrix for $P_n$ is constructed as:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix}
n_z & n_x \\
n_x & -n_z
\end{bmatrix},
\]

where $n_z = \cos\theta$ and $n_x = \sin\theta$. The eigenvalue equation $(P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I)|\psi\rangle = 0$ is solved for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. This leads to the normalized eigenvector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta/2) \\
\sin(\theta/2)
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This result matches the standard form of the eigenstate for a spin-1/2 particle along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane, where $\phi = 0$ (since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane). The eigenvector is normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: This does not match the derived eigenvector, as it introduces unnecessary factors of $\hbar$ and does not depend on $\theta$.
- **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$: This corresponds to spherical coordinates but does not match the derived eigenvector, which depends on $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: This matches the derived eigenvector exactly and is normalized.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: This introduces incorrect normalization factors and includes $\hbar$, which is not relevant to the eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option C**.

Answer: C
