Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's break it down. The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. In these reactions, a pi bond moves to a sigma bond position. So, the key here is to identify what each reaction produces based on the given starting materials and conditions.

The question has three parts, each with different starting materials. Let me look at each one step by step.

First reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to give product A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a molecule with two methoxy groups on a nitrogen attached to ethane. Structure-wise, it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? Or maybe it's (CH2CH3) with the amine and two methoxys on the same carbon? Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2NCH2CH3?

But wait, the other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure is CH2CH2C(OH)=CH2? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, buten-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 if it's but-2-en-2-ol, but the question says but-3-en-2-ol. So the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3. Because but-3-en-2-ol: the four-carbon chain, double bond between C2 and C3, with the OH on C2. So structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3?

Wait, maybe another approach. So the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en
