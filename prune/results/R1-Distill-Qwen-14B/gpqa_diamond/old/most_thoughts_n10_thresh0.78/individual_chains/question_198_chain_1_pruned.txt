Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Alright, let's break this down.

The question says the solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants β1 to β4 are given as 9, 40, 63, and 16 respectively. Hmm, stability constants, right. I remember that stability constants (formation constants) indicate how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

Wait, wait. So the complexes are probably Co(SCN)n^2-n, where n is the number of SCN- ions attached. The stability constants β1, β2, etc., correspond to the complexes with n=1, 2, 3, 4, right? So β1 is for [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^2-, and so on.

The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions, so that's the β2 complex. So we need to find the fraction of all cobalt species that are in the form [Co(SCN)₂]²⁻.

I think I'll need to use the formation constants to determine the distribution of the cobalt species. The idea is to calculate the concentration of each complex relative to the others. Since the solution is at equilibrium, the distribution depends on the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions.

So, the total cobalt concentration is the sum of all the species: [Co²+], [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)₂²-], [Co(SCN)3^3-], [Co(SCN)4^4-]. So c_total = [Co²+] + [CoSCN+] + [Co(SCN)₂²-] + [Co(SCN)3^3-] + [Co(SCN)4^4-].

But because the problem gives us the stability constants, I think each species can be expressed as a fraction of the total. The fractions depend on the β's and the concentrations of SCN-.

Wait, the formula for each complex's concentration is something like [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} = β_n [Co²+] [SCN^-]^n. So for each n, the concentration is β_n multiplied by [Co²+] multiplied by [SCN^-]^n.

But since the total cobalt is c_total = [Co²+] + sum of all complexes, perhaps we can express each [Co(SCN)_n] in terms of [Co²+] and then find [Co²+] such that the sum equals c_total.

Alternatively, I remember that the distribution of the species can be determined using the formation constants and the concentrations. The fraction for each species is given by (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN^-] + β2 [SCN^-]^2 + β3 [SCN^-]^3 + β4 [SCN^-]^4) )

Wait, no, not exactly. Because each β is for a specific n. So the general approach is to calculate the fraction of each complex as:

f_n = (β_n [SCN^-]^n) / (sum_{k=0}^4 β_k [SCN^-]^k )

But wait, [Co²+] would be the term for k=0, which is β_0 [SCN^-]^0. But wait, β0 is 1 because [Co²+] is the free ion, and the formation constant for the zero complex is 1 (since it's just Co²+).

Wait, no, because the way the β's are given, beta_1 is for the first complex, which is [CoSCN]^+. So the free Co²+ isn't included in the beta terms. Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, the formation constant (β) for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^{2-n} is defined as:

β_n = [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n)

So, for each n (1 to 4), the concentration of the complex is [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] = β_n [Co²+][SCN^-]^n.

But the total cobalt concentration is [Co²+] + sum_{n=1 to 4} [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] = c_total.

So substituting, [Co²+] + sum_{n=1 to4} β_n [Co²+][SCN^-]^n = c_total.

Factor out [Co²+], we get [Co²+] (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} β_n [SCN^-]^n ) = c_total.

Thus, [Co²+] = c_total / (1 + sum_{n=1 to4} β_n [SCN^-]^n )

Once we have [Co²+], we can compute each [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] and then find the fraction for n=2, which is the dithiocyanato complex.

So let's compute sum_{n=1 to4} β_n [SCN^-]^n.

Given:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

[SCN^-] = 0.1 M.

So compute each term:

β1 [SCN]^1 = 9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

β2 [SCN]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 * 0.01=0.4.

β3 [SCN]^3 =63 * (0.1)^3=63 * 0.001=0.063.

β4 [SCN]^4 =16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016.

Adding them up: 0.9 +0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646.

Then, the denominator in [Co²+] is 1 + sum =1 +1.3646=2.3646.

So [Co²+] = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

Now, compute [Co(SCN)_n^{2-n}] for each n.

For n=2, [Co(SCN)_2^{0}] = β2 [Co²+][SCN^-]^2.

Compute β2 [Co²+][SCN]^2: 40 * 0.004223 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004223 *0.01.

Calculating that:

40 * 0.004223 = 0.16892.

Multiply by 0.01: 0.0016892 M.

We need the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]²− in the total cobalt species.

So the fraction is ( [Co(SCN)_2] ) / c_total.

Which is (0.0016892) / (0.01) = 0.16892, which is 16.892%.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, let's recheck the sum.

Sum= β1*(0.1) + β2*(0.1)^2 + β3*(0.1)^3 + β4*(0.1)^4.

So:

β1 term: 9 * 0.1 =0.9.

β2:40 *0.01=0.4.

β3:63*0.001=0.063.

β4:16*0.0001=0.0016.

Adding up: 0.9 +0.4=1.3; +0.063=1.363; +0.0016=1.3646. So sum is 1.3646.

Denominator is 1 +1.3646=2.3646.

So [Co²+] = 0.01 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

Now, for n=2, [Co(SCN)_2^0] = β2 * [Co²+] * (0.1)^2.

β2 is 40.

So 40 * 0.004223 * 0.01.

Wait: 40 * 0.004223 = let's compute this: 0.004223 *40 = 0.16892.

Multiply by 0.01: 0.0016892.

So the concentration of the dithiocyanato complex is 0.0016892 M.

Total cobalt is 0.01 M.

So fraction is 0.0016892 /0.01 = 0.16892, which is about 16.89% approximately 16.9%.

Looking at the options: option D is 16.9%. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check. Oh wait, the question specifies the "percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." But I calculated this, and it's 16.89%, which is option D.

But why is option C 38.1%? Hmm, did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the [SCN] terms.

Wait, when n=2, [SCN^-]^2 is (0.1)^2=0.01. So that's correct.

Wait, let's compute [Co(SCN)_2] again.

β2 =40, [Co²+] is 0.004223, [SCN]^2 is 0.01.

So 40 * 0.004223 *0.01 = 0.00016892 M? Wait, wait no: Wait, 40 *0.004223 is 0.16892, multiply by 0.01 is 0.0016892 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the species and see their fractions. Maybe the [Co(SCN)_3] is higher.

But the question is only about the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

Wait, but perhaps I'm forgetting that the dithiocyanato complex can be [Co(SCN)_2]²−, which is blue, but maybe another complex is blue and has a different n. Wait, no, I think the blue one is n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator for [Co²+]. Wait, the denominator is 1 + sum_{n=1}^4 βn [SCN]^n.

Which is 1 + (0.9 + 0.4 +0.063 +0.0016) = 1+1.3646=2.3646. Correct.

So [Co²+] =0.01 /2.3646 ≈ 0.004223 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the species and see their concentrations.

Let me compute each [Co(SCN)_n]:

n=1:

[CoSCN+] = β1 [Co²+][SCN] =9 * 0.004223 *0.1 = 9 * 0.0004223= 0.0038007 M.

n=2: as above, 0.0016892 M.

n=3: β3 [Co²+][SCN]^3=63 *0
