Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, polar coordinates are often used, so this makes sense. I need to find the energy spectrum, which means I need to find the possible energy levels the particle can have.

Wait, I think I should try to separate the potential into radial and angular parts because solving the Schrödinger equation is easier when the potential can be split this way. Let me see: the potential has two terms, one is (1/2)kr², which depends on r² and not θ. The other term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Cos²θ can be written using the double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. But wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the potential as a sum of functions that can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or something.

Wait, but each term in the potential is a function of r squared times a function of θ. So perhaps I can separate variables. Let me write V(r, θ) as V(r) * something? Or maybe as V(r) * a function of θ. Hmm, no, not exactly. Because it's (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. So V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Wait, can this be expressed as a sum of functions each dependent on r and θ? Like, V = V1(r) + V2(r,θ). But I'm not sure that's helpful. Maybe I need to see if the potential can be expressed in terms of angular parts that can be separated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this potential in terms of a shifted harmonic oscillator. Let me think: The first term is (1/2)kr²
