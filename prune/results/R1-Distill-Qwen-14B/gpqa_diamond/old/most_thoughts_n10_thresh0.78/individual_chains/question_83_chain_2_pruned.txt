Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these titration concepts, but I'll give it my best shot.

Alright, the problem is about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Let me read it again. We start with 20.00 cm³ (which is 20 mL) of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have to pick the correct pair.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. First, I think I need to figure out the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. Then, when titrating, I'll have to consider the moles of acetic acid and how much NaOH is added at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they'll form acetate ions and water. The reaction should be something like:

CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

Right. So the equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

But before that, let's get the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 mL, concentration 0.05 M. Then we add 20 mL of water, making the total volume 40 mL.

So using M1V1 = M2V2, where M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 mL, V2 is 40 mL, so M2 is (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when titrating, the initial solution is 40 mL of 0.025 M acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid are 0.04 L * 0.025 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Because 40 mL is 0.04 L.

Now, when we titrate with 0.1 M NaOH. At equivalence point, moles of NaOH needed = moles of acetic acid. Moles of NaOH = 0.001 mol. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 mL. So equivalence point is when 10 mL of NaOH is added.

But the question asks about pH at 25% titration and equivalence. So 25% of the way to the equivalence point. 25% of 10 mL is 2.5 mL of NaOH added.

Wait, but during the titration, when you add NaOH, you convert some of the acetic acid into acetate ions. So at 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Alternatively, since 25% of the required NaOH is added, which is 2.5 mL, that's 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 mol of NaOH. Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH has been converted to CH3COO^-.

So initially, we have 0.001 mol CH3COOH. After adding 0.00025 mol NaOH, the moles would be:

CH3COOH: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol.
CH3COO^- : 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume isn't just the initial 40 mL. Because we're adding NaOH, which is 2.5 mL. So total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 mL or 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.0058824 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Wait, wait, no. pKa = -log(Ka). So let me compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) ≈ 0.267 + (-5) = -4.733. So pKa = 4.733.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that carefully.

Ka = 1.85 × 10^-5. So log(1.85)=0.267, so log(1.85e-5)=0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa = 4.733.

So now, the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.0058824)/(0.017647) ≈ 0.3333. Which is 1/3.

So log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 + (-0.477) ≈ 4.256. So approximately 4.26. Hmm, that's one of the options. Let me check the options. Option A says 4.26 and 8.52. Option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Moles of CH3COOH after 2.5 mL NaOH:

Total moles initially: 0.001 mol.

Moles of NaOH added: 2.5 mL * 0.1 M = 0.25 mmol.

Wait wait, 2.5 mL is 0.0025 L. 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol, which is 0.25 mmol. So CH3COOH will decrease by 0.25 mmol (0.00025 mol), and acetate will increase by the same amount.

So:

CH3COOH: 1 mmol - 0.25 mmol = 0.75 mmol.

CH3COO^-: 0 mmol + 0.25 mmol = 0.25 mmol.

Total volume is 40 mL + 2.5 mL = 42.5 mL = 42.5 mmol/L.

So concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.75 / 42.5 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.25 / 42.5 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So the ratio is 0.25 / 0.75 = 1/3, which is 0.3333.

So log(1/3) = log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = pKa (4.73) + (-0.477) = 4.253, so approximately 4.25. Which rounds to 4.26, which is option A's first value.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because I remember that for a 25% titration, the pH should be lower than the pKa. Oh wait, no: in the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, when [A^-] is less than [HA], the pH is less than pKa. Because if [A^-] < [HA], the log term is negative, so pH
