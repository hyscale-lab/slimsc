Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles can only occupy certain energy levels, and each level can hold a certain number of particles due to their spin. Let me think through this step by step.

Each particle is a spin-1/2 fermion, right? So, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, each quantum state can be occupied by at most one fermion. Wait, but in a one-dimensional well, the energy levels are determined by the quantum number n. Each energy level n can have multiple states, each with different spins. Oh, wait, no, spin is an intrinsic property, but the spatial part of the wavefunction determines the quantum numbers.

Wait, no, in the case of spin-1/2 particles, each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, there's two possible spin states: up and down. So each n can have two particles.

So the particles are identical and fermions, so they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each single-particle state can hold a maximum of two particles (since spin can be up or down). So in the ground state, the particles will fill up the lowest energy levels, each with two particles per level.

Wait, but how many particles are there? The question says four. So four particles. So let's think about the possible quantum numbers they can take.

In a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are given by E_n = (n²) * (π²ħ²)/(2mL²) = n² E, where E is the base energy (as defined in the problem statement). So E_1 is E, E_2 is 4E, E_3 is 9E, E_4 is 16E, and so on.

Now, when you have four particles, each with spin-1/2, each spatial state can hold two particles. So the ground state would be the lowest energy arrangement where each spatial state is filled with two particles. But wait, each spatial state can be either spin-up or spin-down. So each n can actually hold two particles.

So for four particles, we'll need to fill the lowest energy levels until all four are placed.

Let me think about how the filling goes.

First, n=1 can hold two particles. Then n=2 can hold two more. Oh wait, that's four. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(E_1) + 2*(E_2) = 2E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Wait, but wait, each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So four particles: two at E and two at 4E. So total is 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E.

Wait, but the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. Wait, the system is the collection of four particles. So the ground state is the lowest possible energy, the first excited state is the next higher, and so on.

Wait, no. Wait, the question is phrased a bit ambiguously. It says, "Calculate the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E." So each of these states refers to the total energy of the four particles in that state.

So the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible energy arrangement, which is filling the lowest available n's with two particles each. As I thought before, two in n=1 (E) and two in n=2 (4E), so total energy is 2E + 2*4E = 10E.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, is there a way to arrange the four particles in a lower energy
