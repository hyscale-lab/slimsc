Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine plants. The question is about figuring out which genes are transcription factors and how they interact based on the results of some knockout experiments. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So the setup is that they're studying resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. They found three candidate genes: G1, G2, G3. They made knockouts (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance levels are given for each mutant and double mutant compared to the wild type.

The data looks like this:

- g1: 75% (so less resistance than wild type)
- g2: 0% (super susceptible)
- g3: 50% (half resistance)
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% (very low)
  - g2g3: 0%
  - g1g2: 0%

We know at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So transcription factors usually regulate other genes. When a transcription factor is knocked out, the downstream genes it activates might not be expressed, leading to a loss of function.

Looking at individual mutants:
- g2 has 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So when G2 is knocked out, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. This suggests G2 might be a transcription factor because without it, the entire resistance mechanism might fail. Because if G2 is a TF, and it's upstream, then knocking it out would disable the pathway.
- G1 knockout gives 75% resistance. So the plant is more susceptible but not completely. Maybe G1 contributes to the resistance, but perhaps it's part of a redundant pathway or not the only one doing the job.
- G3 knockout gives 50% resistance. So it's more susceptible than wild type but not as bad as g1 or g2.

Now looking at the double mutants:
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Both G1 and G2 knocked out. Since either knockout alone of g2 gives 0%, maybe G1 doesn't contribute much when G2 is already gone. Alternatively, perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1. Wait, what's epistasis? Oh, right, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. If two mutations (double) result in a phenotype worse than either single, that suggests epistasis.

Looking at g1g3: 10% resistance. Both G1 and G3 are knocked out. If G1 alone gives 75% and G3 gives 50%, knocking both out gives 10%. That's way worse than either single. So maybe G1 and G3 are in the same pathway. Or perhaps their functions are additive but not redundant.

g2g3: 0%. Since g2 alone is 0%, adding g3 knockout doesn't change it. So in this case, the g2 mutation is masking the effect of G3. That suggests that G3's function is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is a transcription factor, and when it's knocked out, the downstream genes (like G3) aren't expressed, so knocking out G3 doesn't make it worse than g2 alone. So G3 is downstream, which would mean G2 is epistatic to G3.

Wait, what's epistasis again? Epistasis is when the phenotype of one gene (epistatic) masks the phenotype of another (hypostatic) gene. So if G2 is epistatic to G3, then the mutation in G2 (g2) would determine the phenotype regardless of G3's status.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is TF, G2 and G3 pleiotropic, G2 epistatic to G1. But our earlier analysis suggests G2 is a TF, not G1.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter (pleiotropic?), G3 epistatic to G1. Hmm, not sure. The double mutant g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than either. If they had the same promoter, maybe they are in the same pathway, but I'm not sure how that would play out.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy would mean the same gene affects multiple traits, but here G1 and G3 are different genes. So maybe not. Alternatively, pleiotropic effects might not be the right term here.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, and G1 is epistatic towards G3. Redundancy
