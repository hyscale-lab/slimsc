Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves two reactions, and then analyzing the products using HPLC. The question is about the number of peaks observed in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC columns after combining the products from both reactions.

Alright, first, let me go through each reaction and see what's happening.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup.

Hmm, LAH is lithium aluminum hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It's usually used to reduce ketones. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a ketone. LAH would reduce the ketone group. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is a six-carbon chain with a ketone group at position 3 and a methoxy group at position 5. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3, but wait, wait. Let me draw it properly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO. So, the compound is CH3CH2CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-? Wait no. Let me think. Hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-... Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, the substituents are on position 5. So 5-methoxy, so position 5 is the fourth carbon? Let me count: 1, 2, 3 (the ketone here), then position 4, 5, 6.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So the positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. So at position 5, it's CH2 group. But the compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the structure is:

Position 1: CH3
Position 2: CH2
Position 3: C=O
Position 4: CH2
Position 5: OCH3 attached to which carbon? Wait, maybe it's:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3, but wait, that's hexan-3-one, so the positions would be:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: OCH3 (so that's a methoxy group)
Carbon 6: another CH2? Wait, no, wait, the formula would be:

Actually, the correct structure for 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3, but with a methoxy group on carbon 5, which is the fourth carbon from the end. Hmm, maybe it's better to draw it as:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3. Wait, maybe I should think of it as:

The carbon chain is six carbons long. The ketone is at position 3. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2-
Carbon 5: OCH3 (attached to carbon 4?)
Wait, no. Because for hexan-3-one, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. The 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is the second from the end. So that would be:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6
So carbon 3 is the ketone, so structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But wait, the 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5, which is the fifth carbon from the first. So that's the second carbon from the end. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH3-CH3. Wait, no, that doesn't add up. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3-CH3. But for 5-methoxy, the substituent is on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, that would be carbon 5 being CH(OCH3). So the structure is:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C=O
4: CH2
5: CH(OCH3)
6: CH3?

No, because that would make it a five-membered chain, but the starting material is hexan-3-one, which is six carbons. So I think I might have to re-approach this.

Another way: 5-methoxyhexan-3-one would have the structure:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-OCH3. Wait, but that would make the chain longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-OCH2CH3. Wait, no, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the reaction. Reaction I is treatment with LAH. LAH reduces the ketone. So the ketone (C=O) becomes an alcohol (CH2OH). So the product after LAH would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. When LAH reduces a ketone, it replaces the carbonyl oxygen with a hydrogen. So the ketone group (C=O) becomes CH2OH after acidic workup? No, LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the configuration would change because LAH is a strong reducing agent that can cause racemization? Or does it preserve the configuration?

Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used with ketones, and it's known to give the alcohol with retention of configuration because it attacks from the less hindered side. Wait, no, LAH is a source of H- which is a strong base. The mechanism of LAH reduction is via a two-step process: first, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, forming an alkoxide intermediate, which is then protonated during the acidic workup.

Wait, when you reduce a chiral ketone, does the configuration of the chiral center change? Because the hydride attacks the carbonyl, which is planar. So in the case of a chiral ketone, the configuration of the adjacent chiral center might change.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the ketone is at position 3. The chiral center is at position 5 (methoxy group), which is attached to a carbon that's not the carbonyl. Wait, let me recheck the structure.

Wait, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at position 3, and the methoxy is at position 5. So the structure of the molecule is:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C=O
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH3?

Wait, no, that would make it 6 carbons: 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH(OCH3)), 6 (CH3). So the 5 position is a CH group with OCH3.

Wait, but that would make the structure:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the carbonyl is at C3, and the chiral center is at C5. So the configuration is S. After reduction with LAH, the C3 ketone becomes a CH2OH group. So the product would be 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, with the configuration at C5 being retained or not?

Wait, when you reduce a ketone, you're adding a hydride to the carbonyl carbon. The original structure is:

R2C=O → R2CH2-OH after LAH, because the acidic workup would protonate the alkoxide.

Wait no, no. LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it would turn the ketone into an alcohol.

Wait, the general reaction for ketone reduction using LAH is:

RCOR' → RCH2R'OH after workup? No, wait, the process is:

RCO R' → RCH2-OH R' after workup? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think: LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the ketone (C=O) becomes a CH2OH group.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The ketone group, which is C=O, becomes CH2-OH when reduced. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The starting compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Structure:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3-CH3. So 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is the second from the end. So that's:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So when LAH reduces the ketone, the C=O becomes CH2-OH. So the product would be CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, wait no. The ketone is at C3, so when reduced, it becomes CH2-OH. So the structure would be:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OCH3-CH3?

Wait, that's not possible because that would be seven carbons. Wait, no. Let me correct the structure.

The starting structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But with 5-methoxy, which is on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Because the 5th carbon is CH(OCH3) in a six-carbon chain.

When LAH reduces the ketone (C=O at C3) to an alcohol, it becomes CH2-OH. So the product is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the product is 3-hexanol derivative with a methoxy group on C5.

Now, the key point is whether the reduction of the ketone affects the configuration at C5.

The starting material has an S configuration at C5. When the ketone is reduced, the C3 becomes CH(OH). Does this affect the configuration at C5?

No, because the reaction is at C3, which is a different carbon. The configuration at C5 (the methoxy group) is on a different carbon, so it's not directly involved in the reaction. So the configuration at C5 remains S.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the C5 is the chiral center with S configuration. After reduction, the product is 3-hexanol with the same C5 configuration.

So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, moving on to Reaction II:

Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is a diketone. Structure: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2.

Wait, the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So it's a five-carbon chain with ketone groups on C2 and C4.

So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So two ketone groups on the second and fourth carbons of a five-carbon chain.

Now, treating with NaBH4. NaBH4 is a milder reducing agent than LAH and is not usually strong enough to reduce aromatic ketones or esters, but for regular ketones, it works. However, in the presence of excess NaBH4, perhaps it can reduce both ketone groups.

Wait, but wait. NaBH4 typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but it doesn't usually reduce esters or amides. But in this case, both are regular ketones.

So when NaBH4 is used in excess, perhaps both ketones are reduced.

Wait, no. Wait, NaBH4 can reduce ketones, but it's not typically strong enough to reduce esters or other functional groups. But in this case, both are ketones. So pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups.

So when treated with excess NaBH4, both ketones would be reduced to secondary alcohols.

So the product would be HO-CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, let me structure it properly.

Original structure:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 → CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

After reduction with NaBH4, each ketone becomes a CH(OH) group.

So the product would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, but that structure would have two alcohol groups on adjacent carbons.

Wait, that's not possible because the middle would be CH2, so the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Wait, no, because the original diketone is:

Positions 2 and 4 are carbonyls.

So after reduction, positions 2 and 4 become CH(OH).

So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)H-CH2-C(OH)H-CH3.

Wait, that's (CH3)2C(OH)CH(OH)(CH3)2? No, wait, perhaps it's:

The product would be 2,4-pentanediol, specifically (2R,4R) or (2S,4S) depending on the reduction.

Wait, but wait. The starting compound is pentane-2,4-dione, which is symmetric. So each ketone is on a symmetric position. So when reduced, the product would have two hydroxyl groups on C2 and C4.

But in solution, when NaBH4 reduces the ketones, does it form a single diastereomer, or multiple?

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is a symmetrical structure, so when reduced, it would produce a diol that's also symmetrical. So the product would be 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

Because the molecule is symmetrical, the two OH groups are mirror images, leading to an internal plane of symmetry. So the diol is meso and would not have any chiral centers.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure after reduction is:

HO-CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, the correct structure would have the OH groups on carbons 2 and 4, which are symmetric. So the molecule would be:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's not correct because the original structure isn't that.

Wait, no. The original structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione has a structure where the carbonyl groups are on C2 and C4 of a five-carbon chain.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Upon reduction with NaBH4, each ketone becomes a CH(OH) group. So the product is:

CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

Now, looking at the structure, the two OH groups are on carbons 2 and 4. Because the molecule is symmetric, the configuration at C2 and C4 would be the same. But wait, in this molecule, the two OH groups are on adjacent carbons? No, because the positions are 2 and 4, which are separated by a CH2 group.

Wait, no. Let me count:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: C(OH)H
Carbon 3: CH2
Carbon 4: C(OH)H
Carbon 5: CH3.

So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This molecule is symmetrical. So the two chiral centers (C2 and C4) are mirror images of each other. Therefore, the molecule is a meso compound. So it has two stereocenters, but they are enantiomers, leading to an overall internal plane of symmetry, so the molecule is achiral.

So the product is a meso diol, which is not chiral. So it's a single compound, not a mixture of enantiomers. So when you run this on a chiral HPLC column, it would not show any peaks because it's achiral. However, on a normal-phase HPLC, it's a single compound, so one peak.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The reaction uses excess NaBH4. Does that affect the outcome? Because NaBH4 is a stronger reducing agent when used in large amounts, but in this case, it's just ensuring that both ketones are fully reduced. So the product is definitely the diol.

So Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so not chiral.

Now, combining the products from both reactions.

Reaction I produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's see if that's a chiral compound.

The structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Is there a chiral center here? Let's look at C3.

At C3, the groups are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-OCH3 (from C4)
- CH3 (from C5?)

Wait, no. Let me look at the structure again. The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So the structure is:

Positions 1-6:

1: CH3
2: CH2
3: C(OH)
4: CH2-OCH3
5: CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, earlier I thought it's:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the C3 has four different groups:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-OCH3-CH3 (from C4 and beyond)
- Wait, no, perhaps I should list all substituents on C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(OH)
Carbon 4: CH2-OCH3
Carbon 5: CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OCH3-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me re-express this correctly.

The structure after reduction is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C(OH)H
Carbon 4: CH2-OCH3
Carbon 5: CH3?

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The molecule is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, at C3, the substituents are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-OCH3 (from C4)
- CH2-CH3 (from C5? No, wait, C5 is CH(OCH3)-. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps C3 is attached to:

- two CH2 groups, one of which leads to the OH, and another leading to the rest.

Wait, perhaps C3's substituents are:

- CH2-CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-OCH3 (from C4)
- CH2-CH2-CH3 (from C5? No, perhaps I'm getting lost here.)

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(OH)H-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

In this case, the C3 has:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-OCH3 (from C4)
- CH2-CH3 (from C5? No, perhaps C5 is a CH2 group.)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is whether the product from Reaction I is chiral.

At C3, if there are four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. Let's see:

At C3 (carrying the OH group):

- One substituent is the CH2CH3 group (from C2)
- Another is the OH group
- The third is the CH2-OCH3 group (from C4)
- The fourth is the CH2-CH3 group? Or perhaps another substituent.

Wait, perhaps.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-OCH3-CH3.

No, wait, that's seven carbons. No, perhaps it's:

At C3, the substituents are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-OCH3 (from C4)
- CH2-CH3 (from C5 and beyond?)

Wait, perhaps C3 has four different groups, making it a chiral center. So the product from Reaction I is a chiral molecule.

So Reaction I gives one chiral molecule, and Reaction II gives one meso, achiral diol.

When the two products are combined, what do we have?

From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol — this is a single compound, chiral.

From Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol — meso compound, not chiral, so one compound.

So combining these, we have two compounds in total.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Did each reaction produce only one product?

Reaction I: yes, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction doesn't change the configuration at the other chiral center (if any). So product is a single enantiomer.

Reaction II: yes, produces a meso compound, which is a single compound.

So when products are combined, there are two compounds: one chiral and one achiral.

Now, when these are run on HPLC columns.

First, normal-phase HPLC: this is a column where the stationary phase is polar (e.g., silica) and the mobile phase is non-polar. The separation is based on polar interactions; more polar compounds elute earlier.

Each compound is a separate entity. So in normal-phase HPLC, each compound would give a peak. Since there are two distinct compounds, Reaction I product and Reaction II product, we should see two peaks.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the products.

Product I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol — chiral, so it has a certain polarity.

Product II: 2,4-pentanediol — meso, so it's a single compound.

So in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

Now, the chiral HPLC column: the stationary phase is chiral, so it can separate enantiomers. For achiral compounds, it won't show any peak splitting. So let's see.

Product I: chiral, so when run on a chiral HPLC column, it would show as one peak because it's a single enantiomer. Unless the column is configured to separate enantiomers, but in this case, the product is a single enantiomer because the starting material was S, and the reduction preserved its configuration (assuming it's still a chiral center).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer. So on a chiral column, it would have one peak.

Product II: meso compound, which is achiral. So on a chiral column, it would not separate into enantiomers because it doesn't have any. So it would elute as a single peak.

Wait, but wait. Or perhaps the meso compound is a diastereomer, and the column can separate diastereomers? No, chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers, not diastereomers. Diastereomers are separated based on their physical properties, like in normal-phase HPLC.

So for the chiral HPLC column, the meso compound (Product II) is achiral, so it would elute as a single peak. The Product I is a single enantiomer, so it would also elute as a single peak.

So on the chiral column, we would see two peaks: one from Product I and one from Product II.

Wait, but wait. What about the possibility of the meso compound being a diastereomer?

No, the meso compound is a single compound with internal planes of symmetry. So when placed on a chiral column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, the meso compound would not split into peaks because it's not chiral. So it would come out as a single peak, same as any achiral compound.

So the chiral HPLC would show two peaks: one for the chiral Product I and one for the achiral Product II.

But wait, no. Because Product II is a meso compound, and it's a single compound. So in the chiral column, it would have one peak. Product I is a single enantiomer, so it would have another peak. So total two peaks on the chiral column.

Wait, but wait again. The meso compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not enantiomeric. So on a chiral column, it would elute as a single peak, just like any other achiral compound.

So the chiral HPLC would show two peaks: one for the chiral Product I and one for the achiral Product II.

Wait, but in reality, some chiral columns may not show peaks for achiral compounds because of their interactions, but I think in practice, they would still show a peak. So, in conclusion, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks, and the normal-phase would show two peaks as well.

Wait, but looking back, the answer options don't have two peaks for both. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC
D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Wait, none of the options have two peaks for both. Hmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the analysis?

Wait, let me think again about the products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me re-examine Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

Earlier, I thought that the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, a single enantiomer, because the reduction doesn't affect the configuration at C5. But wait, in the starting material, the configuration is at C5 (the methoxy group). When the ketone is reduced, does that create a new chiral center at C3? Let me see.

In the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the C5 (the methoxy-bearing carbon) has four different substituents:

- CH2-OCH3 (from C4)
- CH2-CH2-CO (from C3, but wait, in the starting material, the ketone is at C3. So C5 has:

- CH2-OCH3 (the methoxy group)
- CH2-CH3 (from C6)
- CH2-CO-CH2 (from C3)
Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me try again.

Wait, the correct structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: C(=O)
Carbon 4: CH2
Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)
Carbon 6: CH3.

So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the C5 (the CH(OCH3) group) has four substituents: two CH2 groups, a methoxy, and a CH3.

Wait, let's list them:

- Two methyl groups (from C4 and C6)
Wait, no, wait. Carbon 5 is CH(OCH3). The substituents are:

- OCH3
- CH2-C(=O)-CH2- (from C3 and C4)
- CH2-CH3 (from C6)
Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me consider the actual groups attached to C5.

Carbon 5 is attached to:

- OCH3 (methoxy group)
- CH2 group leading to C4 (which is connected to C3's carbonyl)
- CH2 group leading to C6 (which is CH3)
- and the rest? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C5 are:

- OCH3
- CH2-C(=O)-CH2- (from C3)
- CH2-CH3 (from C6)
- and a hydrogen? No, wait, because it's CH(OCH3), so it's a CH group, which would have one hydrogen.

Wait, no. CH(OCH3) would have three substituents: OCH3, and two CH2 groups (from C4 and C6), plus a hydrogen. So the substituents are:

- OCH3
- CH2-C(=O)- (from C3)
- CH2-CH3 (from C6)
- H.

Wait, but that would make four substituents, so it's a chiral center. So the configuration is S.

After reduction, the ketone at C3 becomes a CH2-OH group. So the structure becomes:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

In this product, does C3 become a chiral center?

Let's see the substituents on C3.

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (from C4 and beyond)
- and another CH2 group leading to where?

Wait, perhaps the substituents on C3 are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-CH2-OCH3 (from C4 and C5)
- CH2-CH3 (from C6? Not sure.)

Wait, perhaps it's better to count:

After reduction, the structure is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So at C3, the substituents are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-OCH3 (from C4 and C5)
- and CH2-CH3 (from C6? No, C6 is the end.)

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3 (from C4 and C5)
- and a CH2 group leading to C4?

Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here. The key point is whether C3 in the product is a chiral center.

If in the product, C3 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center, making the product chiral.

So, substituents on C3:

1. CH2CH3 (from C2)
2. OH
3. CH2-OCH3 (from C4 and C5)
4. CH2-CH3 (from C6? Or is it a different substituent?)

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let's think of the product structure:

The product is:

CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

So, the substituents on C3 (the OH-bearing carbon) are:

- CH2CH3 (from C2)
- OH
- CH2-CH2-OCH3 (from C4 and C5)
- and CH2-CH3 (from C6?)

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

1. CH2CH3
2. OH
3. CH2-CH(OCH3)
4. CH3 (from C6)

Wait, if that's the case, then C3 has four different groups: CH2CH3, OH, CH2-CH(OCH3), and CH3. So yes, it's a chiral center.

So the product from Reaction I is a chiral molecule, with a configuration determined by the reduction. The starting material is (S) configuration at C5, but the reduction creates a new chiral center at C3.

Wait, but wait. The starting material's configuration is at C5, and the reduction occurs at C3. So the configuration at C3 depends on the reduction's stereochemistry.

Wait, when LAH reduces a ketone, does it produce a specific configuration? LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to retention of configuration or racemization? Wait, I thought that LAH tends to cause racemization because it's a strong base, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no. LAH is a source of H- (hydride ions). The reduction occurs in a two-step process. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes O- which is then protonated in the acidic workup.

In the case of a chiral ketone, the adjacent chiral center may affect the approach of the hydride. But in this case, the reaction is on a ketone that's not adjacent to a chiral center, so perhaps the reduction can proceed without any specific stereoselectivity.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a chiral center at C5. When the ketone at C3 is reduced to an alcohol, it creates a new chiral center at C3. But the configuration of this new center depends on the hydride attack's direction.

But wait, in the starting material, the ketone is at C3, and the C5 is a chiral center. So when the ketone is reduced, does the configuration of C5 influence the attack of the hydride on the carbonyl?

Alternatively, perhaps the hydride attack is not influenced by the C5 configuration, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer. Would the reduction lead to a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think: when you reduce a ketone that's not part of a stereocenter, you typically get a racemic mixture, but if the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product's configuration is determined in a way that depends on the existing stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for an alternative approach. Let's think about the mechanism.

LAH reduces the ketone. The mechanism involves the hydride attacking the carbonyl carbon, which is trigonal planar. The hydride can attack from either face, potentially leading to a racemic mixture. However, if the ketone is part of a chiral environment, perhaps the approach is influenced, leading to a specific product.

But I'm not entirely sure. For the sake of this problem, perhaps it's better to proceed under the assumption that the product from Reaction I is a single chiral compound (as the starting material is a single enantiomer), leading to a single chiral product.

So, Reaction I gives one chiral compound, and Reaction II gives one meso compound (achiral).

So when combined, they have two compounds: Product I (chiral) and Product II (achiral).

Now, when run on HPLC.

Normal-phase HPLC: both are separated as they are two different compounds. So two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: Product I is chiral, so it would have one peak (since it's a single enantiomer). Product II is achiral, so it would have another peak. So two peaks on the chiral column as well.

But looking back at the answer options, none of them say two peaks in both columns. The options are:

A) 5 and 4
B) 3 and 2
C) 4 and 2
D) 3 and 3

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of Reaction II.

Wait, Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4. The product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but NaBH4 is used in excess. Does that affect anything? No, because both ketones are reduced.

But wait, perhaps the diol is actually two enantiomers, but no, because it's a meso compound, so it's a single compound.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer because the reduction leads to a new chiral center, but in reality, how many stereoisomers are formed?

Wait, if the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, and the reduction leads to a new chiral center at C3, then the product could be either R or S configuration at C3.

But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, does the reduction lead to a specific configuration at C3?

This is a key point. If the reduction leads to a racemic mixture, then the product would be a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. But if the reaction is stereospecific and leads to retention or inversion, then it would produce a single enantiomer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the mechanism again.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, and it's known to reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen is deprotonated by the aluminum species, forming an alkoxide intermediate.

In the case of a chiral ketone, the approach of the hydride can be influenced by the existing stereochemistry, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reduction proceeds with retention of configuration, but I'm not sure.

But for this problem, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so it's a chiral compound. Therefore, when run on a chiral HPLC, it would show a single peak, and on normal-phase, two peaks (the chiral and the meso compounds).

Wait, but in the earlier analysis, I thought both reactions produce two compounds. No, wait: each reaction produces one compound. So two compounds in total.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: perhaps Reaction I produces two products because the reduction leads to a racemic mixture. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, but the reduction leads to a new chiral center, which could be a racemic mixture.

Wait, but that would mean that Reaction I produces two enantiomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, each being 50% of the mixture.

So, the products from Reaction I would be a racemic mixture of the alcohol, but wait, no. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would not be racemic. Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to a diastereomeric mixture, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, so only one compound is formed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck, but let's move forward.

Assuming Reaction I produces one chiral compound and Reaction II produces one achiral compound, then combining them gives two compounds.

So, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks (each for the two compounds).

But looking at the options, the closest would be option B: 3 and 2, but that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe Reaction I produces more than one product, and Reaction II produces more than one.

Wait, another angle: perhaps Reaction II's product is actually two enantiomers. But that's not the case because it's a meso compound, which is achiral.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-express the products again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's say this is a single chiral compound.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → 2,4-pentanediol (meso), a single achiral compound.

So combining them, we have two compounds: one chiral, one achiral.

So when run on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC, the chiral compound would give one peak, the achiral would give another.

So total peaks: 2 on both columns. But none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces more than one product.

Wait, perhaps Reaction II gives more than one product. Let me think again.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione is treated with NaBH4 in excess.

Wait, perhaps the reduction doesn't stop after the first ketone is reduced. But no, NaBH4 isn't strong enough to reduce esters, but in this case, both are ketones, so both are reduced.

So the product is 2,4-pentanediol, a single meso compound.

So, no, Reaction II only produces one product.

Back to Reaction I: perhaps the reduction leads to a diastereomeric mixture, which would mean more than one product.

Wait, no. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The reduction adds a new chiral center at C3, which could be R or S. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product's configuration at C3 is determined in a way that depends on the existing configuration.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is actually two stereoisomers. So, two diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, but no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reaction adds a new chiral center. So the product would have two chiral centers: the original at C5 and the new at C3. So if the new center is a racemic mixture, it would lead to four possible stereoisomers, but perhaps only two are formed.

Wait, no. Wait, the original molecule has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration). The product adds a new chiral center at C3. So the product would have two chiral centers, leading to possible four stereoisomers.

But the reaction may only produce a single diastereomer based on the starting material's configuration. Or it may produce a racemic mixture.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to a single diastereomer, making the product a single stereoisomer.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. For the purpose of this problem, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, making it a single peak on both HPLCs.

So, bringing it all together, combining the two products:

- Product I: chiral, single compound → 1 peak on chiral HPLC, 1 peak on normal-phase.
- Product II: achiral, single compound → 1 peak on both columns.

So total peaks: 2 on normal-phase and 2 on chiral.

But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and Reaction I produces two products. How?

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to a racemic mixture. So, the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

In that case, the product would have two enantiomers, each 50% of the mixture.

So when combined with Reaction II's product (meso, single), the total compounds are three: two enantiomers and one meso.

So in normal-phase HPLC, each compound is a separate entity, so three peaks.

On the chiral HPLC, the two enantiomers would split into two peaks, and the meso would be a single peak. So three peaks.

Looking at the options, option D says 3 peaks in both. Option B says 3 and 2.

Wait, but if Reaction I's product is two enantiomers (racemic), then we have three products in total: two from Reaction I and one from Reaction II.

So, when run on normal-phase, each is a separate compound, so three peaks.

On chiral HPLC, the two enantiomers would split into two peaks, and the meso would be a single peak. So three peaks.

Which matches option D: 3 peaks in both.

But earlier analysis suggested that Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, leading to two products. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, leading to two products in total. Then the normal-phase would have two peaks, and the chiral would have two.

But the options don't include this.

Wait, perhaps the initial analysis is wrong, and Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, leading to two stereoisomers. So, combining with Reaction II's product (meso, one compound), the total would be three compounds.

So, normal-phase HPLC: three peaks.

Chiral HPLC: the two enantiomers from Reaction I would split into two peaks, and the meso would be a single peak. So three peaks.

Which would correspond to option D: 3 peaks in both.

But I thought the starting material was a single enantiomer. How could the product be a racemic mixture?

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to retention of configuration, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single enantiomer, so Reaction I gives one product, and Reaction II gives one product. So two in total.

But the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the products from both reactions are not just two, but four when considering stereochemistry.

Wait, Reaction I's product is a single enantiomer, and Reaction II's product is a single compound.

So when combined, two compounds, leading to two peaks on both columns. But again, the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the products are more complex.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I's product is a diol as well, but no, it's a monohydric alcohol.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of Reaction I's product.

Alternative approach: think about the number of stereocenters.

Reaction I's starting material has one stereocenter (C5, S). After reduction, it creates another stereocenter at C3. So the product has two stereocenters.

If the product is (R,S) or (S,R), but given the starting material is (S) at C5, perhaps the product has a specific configuration at C3.

But without knowing the mechanism, it's hard to say.

But perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, so it's a single compound.

So, products:

I: 1 chiral product.

II: 1 meso product.

Total: two compounds.

So on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: two peaks (each compound).

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the meso compound is actually not a single peak on the chiral column because it's a diastereomer?

No, the meso compound is a single compound, regardless of diastereomerism.

Wait, perhaps the meso compound is not a diastereomer but an achiral compound, so it's a single peak on all columns.

So the only conclusion is that the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2, but I'm not seeing that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the analysis.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Reaction I's product has two chiral centers, leading to two stereoisomers.

Thus, Reaction I produces two diastereomers, each with their own stereochemistry.

So, combining with Reaction II's product (one compound), we have three compounds in total.

So, normal-phase HPLC would show three peaks.

Chiral HPLC, the two diastereomers from Reaction I would each show as a single peak, and the meso from Reaction II as another peak. So three peaks.

Which matches option D: 3 peaks in both.

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers are enantiomers, leading to two peaks on the chiral HPLC.

But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the products are:

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is one product.

But when the ketone is reduced, perhaps it forms two products: a diastereomer, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a meso compound as well, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps Reaction I produces two diastereomers.

But without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is B: 3 and 2.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 4 and 2.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two compounds, leading to four in total.

Wait, Reaction I: 1 chiral compound.

Reaction II: 1 meso compound.

Combined: two compounds.

Thus, HPLC would show two peaks on both columns.

But again, the options don't have that.

At this point, I think I've made a mistake in earlier analysis, and the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B: 3 peaks on chiral and 2 on normal-phase.

Wait, no. Because Reaction I produces one product, and Reaction II produces one. So combining, two products.

Thus, on normal-phase, two peaks.

On chiral, two peaks.

But none of the options match.

Hmm. I think I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the answer is option B: 3 and 2.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again about the products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

This product has a new chiral center at C3, making it a diastereomer. So, now, perhaps the product has two chiral centers (C3 and C5), leading to four possible stereoisomers. But the reaction may produce two diastereomers.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have two chiral centers, but perhaps only two stereoisomers are formed, leading to a diastereomeric mixture.

Alternatively, perhaps only one stereoisomer is formed, making it a single product.

But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Given the time I've spent, I think I should proceed with the initial analysis: Reaction I produces one chiral product, Reaction II produces one meso product. So, two products, leading to two peaks on both columns. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 and 2.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diasteriomer, leading to two peaks on the chiral HPLC.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, meaning the molecule has two chiral centers, leading to multiple stereoisomers.

If Reaction I's product has two chiral centers, then it would have four stereoisomers, but perhaps only two are formed.

But again, without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say.

In conclusion, I think the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in both normal-phase and chiral HPLC chromatograms after combining the products.

### Reaction I:
The starting material, **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one**, is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH reduces the ketone group at C3 to a secondary alcohol, forming **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**. The reduction does not affect the configuration at C5, which remains **S**. The product is a **chiral compound** with two chiral centers (C3 and C5).

### Reaction II:
The starting material, **pentane-2,4-dione**, is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 reduces both ketone groups at C2 and C4 to secondary alcohols, forming **2,4-pentanediol**. This product is a **meso compound**, meaning it has two chiral centers (C2 and C4) but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

### Combined Products:
1. **Reaction I** produces **(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol**, a single chiral compound.
2. **Reaction II** produces **2,4-pentanediol**, a single meso compound.

Thus, the combined products consist of two distinct compounds: one chiral and one achiral.

### HPLC Analysis:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**: This method separates compounds based on their polarity. Since there are two distinct compounds (one chiral and one meso), **two peaks** are observed.
2. **Chiral HPLC**: This method separates enantiomers. The chiral compound from Reaction I will elute as **one peak** (since it is a single enantiomer), and the meso compound from Reaction II will elute as **one peak** (since it is achiral). Therefore, **two peaks** are observed.

### Conclusion:
The analysis indicates that both chromatograms should show **two peaks**. However, none of the provided answer options match this conclusion. Based on the reasoning and the closest alignment with the options, the best answer is:

**Answer: B**
