Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), right?

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the spin state of an electron is often represented as a two-component vector. So the state here is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So the state vector χ would be [3i, 4]^T, I think.

The expectation value of an observable is given by the formula <S_y> = χ† σ_y χ, where σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix. Oh right, the dagger symbol means the conjugate transpose of the vector. So I need to compute this product.

Let me write down the components. The state is χ = [3i, 4]. So the conjugate transpose χ† would be [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, χ is a column vector, so χ† is a row vector with complex conjugates. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 is 4. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, no. Wait, if χ is [3i; 4], then χ† is [3i*, 4*], which is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector. Because 3i's complex conjugate is -3i (since i becomes -i, and 3 stays). And 4 is real, so it remains 4.

Now, σ_y is given as:

[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So the product would be χ† σ_y χ. Let me compute each step.

First, compute χ† σ_y. Let's do the matrix multiplication.

χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Multiplying χ† (which is a 1x2 matrix) with σ_y (2x2), the result would be a 1x2 matrix.

So each element of the resulting row vector is computed by taking the dot product of χ†'s row with each column of σ_y.

First element (for the first column of σ_y):

(-3i)(0) + (4)(i) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

Second element (for the second column of σ_y):

(-3i)(-i) + (4)(0) = (3i^2) + 0. Wait, because (-3i)*(-i) is (3i^2), because i times i is i² = -1. So 3i^2 is 3*(-1) = -3. So the second element is -3 + 0 = -3.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute that again. The second element is χ† times the second column of σ_y. So the second column is [-i, 0]^T.

So:

( -3i ) * (-i ) + 4 * 0.

So (-3i) * (-i) is (3i^2). Hmm, wait, i times i is i² = -1. So 3i² is 3*(-1)= -3. So the second element is -3.

So χ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply that with χ, which is [3i, 4]^T.

So now, each element of the resulting vector is computed as follows. Since χ† σ_y is 1x2, and χ is 2x1, the multiplication is 1x1.

So the product is (4i)*(3i) + (-3)*(4).

Compute each term:

(4i)(3i) = 12 i². Since i² is -1, this is 12*(-1) = -12.

The second term is (-3)*(4) = -12.

So adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, but wait, S_y is the spin operator, which in terms of the Pauli matrices is (ħ/2) σ_y, right? Because the spin operators are S_x = (ħ/2) σ_x, S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y, S_z = (ħ/2) σ_z.

So the expectation value of S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the trace or the expectation value of σ_y. Wait, no, the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

Wait, because S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * <σ_y>, where <σ_y> is the expectation value of σ_y.

Wait, but in our calculation, we found <σ_y> as -24? No wait, no, because when you compute χ† σ_y χ, that's <σ_y>, the expectation value of σ_y. But let's see:

Wait, in our calculation, χ† σ_y χ is (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = (12 i²) + (-12) = 12*(-1) + (-12) = -12 -12 = -24.

So <σ_y> is -24, but that can't be right because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, so their expectation values should be between -1 and 1. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a second, maybe I messed up the computation. Let me go back.

Wait, χ is [3i,4]^T. So when I compute χ† σ_y χ, which is a scalar.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as χ† (σ_y χ).

Let me try that approach. Let's compute σ_y χ first.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So σ_y multiplied by χ = [3i, 4]^T.

Calculating each component:

First component is 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component is i*(3i) + 0*4 = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So χ† times σ_y χ is:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Compute each term:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

Adding them gives -12 + (-12) = -24.

So <σ_y> is -24, which as I thought earlier, seems way too big because σ_y's eigenvalues are ±1. Wait, this can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the state isn't normalized. Because the expectation value would only make sense if the state is normalized. So I should check if the state is normalized. The norm is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. So the norm is 5^2 = 25. Therefore, the normalized state would be (1/5)(3i, 4). But the problem didn't mention normalization, so perhaps I should proceed with the given state.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state should be normalized for probabilities to sum to 1. So maybe the given state is not normalized, and I need to normalize it. So perhaps I should compute the expectation value with the normalized state.

So let me recompute with the normalized state. The state χ is [3i,4]^T, and its norm is sqrt( (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) ) = sqrt(9 +16) = sqrt(25)=5. So the normalized state is χ_normalized = (1/5) [3i,4]^T.

So now, the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) times <σ_y>, where <σ_y> is [ χ_normalized† ] σ_y [ χ_normalized ].

So let's compute that.

First, compute χ_normalized†: [ (3i)/5, 4/5 ].

Wait, because χ_normalized is (3i/5, 4/5), so χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Now, χ† σ_y χ is [ (-3i/5), (4/5) ] multiplied by σ_y, which is [[0,-i],[i,0]], multiplied by [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

Alternatively, let's compute σ_y χ first.

σ_y * χ = [0*(-3i/5) + (-i)(4/5) , i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) ]?

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it properly. Let me compute σ_y times χ.

Wait, σ_y is:

[ 0, -i ]

[ i, 0 ]

So when you multiply σ_y by χ = [3i/5; 4/5], you get:

First component: 0*(3i/5) + (-i)*(4/5) = (-i)(4/5) = -4i/5.

Second component: i*(3i/5) + 0*(4/5) = (3i²)/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i/5, -3/5 ].

Now, χ† is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

So χ† times σ_y χ is:

(-3i/5) * (-4i/5) + (4/5) * (-3/5).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i²) / 25 = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = (-12)/25.

Adding them together: (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So <σ_y> is (-24/25).

Wait, but wait, that's the expectation value of σ_y. But S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so <S_y> is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ)/(2*25) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25, which matches that.

Wait, let me double-check the computations. So σ_y χ gives [ -4i/5, -3/5 ], correct?

Then, χ† [σ_y χ] is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ] [ -4i/5; -3/5 ].

Wait, no, the product is:

( -3i/5 ) * (-4i/5 ) + (4/5) * (-3/5 )

Wait, let's compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = (12 (-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5) * (-3/5) = -12/25.

Total is (-12 -12)/25 = -24/25.

So yes, that's correct. So the expectation of σ_y is -24/25.

Then, <S_y> is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Which matches option A: -12 hbar/25.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the formula:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle,
\]

where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli y-matrix:

\[
\sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Normalize the state
The given state \( \chi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\|\chi\| = \sqrt{|3i|^2 + |4|^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
\chi_{\text{normalized}} = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is given by:

\[
\langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle = \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}},
\]

where \( \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \chi_{\text{normalized}} \):

\[
\chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} \):

\[
\sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}}) \):

\[
\chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}}) = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
\chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}}) = \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{5}\right).
\]

Simplify each term:

1. \( \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{12(-1)}{25} = -\frac{12}{25} \),
2. \( \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) = -\frac{12}{25} \).

Adding these terms:

\[
\chi_{\text{normalized}}^\dagger (\sigma_y \chi_{\text{normalized}}) = -\frac{12}{25} - \frac{12}{25} = -\frac{24}{25}.
\]

Thus, \( \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle = -\frac{24}{25} \).

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to \( \sigma_y \) by:

\[
S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y.
\]

Therefore, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is:

\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \chi | \sigma_y | \chi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12\hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12\hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
