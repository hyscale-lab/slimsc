Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, since it's a two-dimensional metric (involving dx and dy), maybe it's a 2D surface in higher-dimensional space or perhaps a model of hyperbolic space?

Pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, the term can be a bit confusing because sometimes it refers to the tractricoid, which is a specific kind of minimal surface. But in this context, since the metric is given, perhaps it's more about the geometry described by this metric.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, wait. No, the radius in the metric is probably not the same as the geometric radius in the usual sense. Let me think.

Wait, the metric is written in terms of x and y, but perhaps it's better to switch to polar coordinates. Let me try that. Let x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then, dx² + dy² = dr² + r² dθ². So substituting into the metric:

ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ²).

Hmm, that
