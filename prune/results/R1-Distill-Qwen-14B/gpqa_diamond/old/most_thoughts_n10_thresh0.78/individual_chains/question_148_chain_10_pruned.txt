Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds known. The problem gives a series of clues about different substances (A1 to A5) and their properties and reactions. The goal is to determine the molecular weight range of substance A4.

Hmm, let me try to break down each of the clues.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction might be something like A1 → A2 + F2. But wait, when a compound decomposes into an element and another compound, that usually suggests a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a red solid that breaks down into another compound and F2 gas.

Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so it's usually unreactive. But fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent. So A1 must be a strong oxidizing agent as well. What compounds of fluorine are strong oxidizers? Fluorine itself is a strong oxidizing agent. But since it's a binary compound (with Y), perhaps Y is a halogen? Or maybe it's another element that forms strong oxidizing agents with F.

Wait, the options given are about the molecular weight of A4. So maybe I should first identify what Y could be.

The problem says that A3 is obtained by fluorination of Y. So Y reacts with fluorine to form A3. Since fluorination typically involves adding F atoms, perhaps Y is in a lower oxidation state and becomes higher. For example, if Y is Cl, fluorination could form ClF3 or something else. But I'm not sure yet.

Moving on. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. So A5 is probably a salt that, when dissolved in water, breaks down. Maybe it's a fluoride or something similar.

Let me think about the possible compounds. Fluorine forms various binary compounds, like YF, YF2, YF3, YF4, etc. Since there are five known, maybe Y is an element that can form multiple fluorides. For example, carbon can form CF4, but that's just one. Maybe chlorine? Wait, chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, but I'm not sure about ClF2. Alternatively, maybe it's oxygen since O has OF2, O2F2, etc., but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps Y is oxygen. Because oxygen forms several fluorides, like OF2, O2F2, and others. But I'm not sure if
