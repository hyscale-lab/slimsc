Okay, so I'm trying to solve this decay probability problem. Let me think through it step by step. 

Alright, the question is about radioactive decay. So, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key idea is that the probability of decay is constant over time, regardless of how much time has already passed. 

The problem states that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. So, when they say the probability is 32% within 100 minutes, I think that refers to the probability that the atom will decay at least once in that 100-minute period. 

Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, but wait—does that mean the next 150 minutes starting from the beginning, or starting from the 50-minute mark? Oh, the question says, "the next 150 minutes." Since 50 minutes have already passed, I think the next 150 would mean from the current time, so from 50 to 200 minutes total. 

But maybe I should model this properly. 

First, let me recall the formula for radioactive decay. The probability that an atom has not decayed after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. The probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but the given probability is 32% decay in 100 minutes. So, 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32. I can solve for λ here.

Let me write that down:

1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32
e^(-λ*100) = 0.68
Taking natural logarithm on both sides:
-λ *100 = ln(0.68)
λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

I can calculate that. Let me see, ln(0.68) is about ln(2/3) is negative. Wait, 0.68 is about 68% of 1. Let me compute ln(0.68). 

I know ln(1)=0, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and ln(0.68) is a bit less. Let's approximate it. Maybe using a calculator isn't possible, but let's say for the sake of calculation, ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.

So λ = 0.3857 / 100 = 0.003857 per minute.

Wait, but maybe I should get a more accurate value. Alternatively, perhaps I should just keep it symbolic for now.

So, now, we have the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes. We need the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. That is, from t=50 to t=200 minutes. 

The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 is equal to the probability that it decays by t=200 minus the probability that it decayed by t=50. Or, in other words, the probability of decaying within the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes.

Alternatively, since the decay is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability it decays in any 150-minute interval, regardless of past time. But no, wait, the memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is the same as if it had just started. So the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes would be 1 - e^(-λ * 150).

Wait, but wait. Because the decay probability is 32% in 100 minutes, which is 0.32. So the λ we found is 0.3857/100? Hmm, no, wait. Let me get back to the first equation.

So, given that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 0.32, we found λ as ln(1/(1-0.32)) / 100. Or wait: 1 - e^(-λ t) = P. So, e^(-λ t) = 1-P. So, λ = ln(1/(1-P)) / t.

In our case, P = 0.32, t=100. So λ = ln(1/(1-0.32)) /100 → ln(1/0.68) /100 → ln(1.470588)/100 ≈ 0.3857/100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

So, λ ≈ 0.003857 min^-1.

Now, the question is the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. As the decay is memoryless, the probability that it hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-λ *50).

The probability that it then decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it has decayed by t=200, minus the probability it had already decayed by t=50.

But wait, no. Because the decay hasn't happened by t=50, so the conditional probability is the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200. Which is equal to 1 - e^(-λ*(200-50)) → 1 - e^(-λ*150).

But since the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it had just started. So, it's P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Alternatively, another way to think is that the time left until decay is exponentially distributed, so the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So let me compute that.

Compute λ= ln(1/(1-0.32))/100 = ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

So, λ*150 = 0.0038566 *150 ≈ 0.5785.

So e^(-0.5785) ≈ e^(-0.5785) ≈ approximately?

We know that e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. So 0.5785 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.58. 

Wait, 0.5785 is 0.5785. Let me compute e^-0.5785. Let me think: 

We can use the Taylor expansion or linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6.

At x=0.5: 0.6065

x=0.6: 0.5488

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, and the function decreases by about 0.6065 -0.5488= 0.0577.

So for x=0.5785, which is 0.5 + 0.0785.

So delta_x=0.0785. So the function's value would be approx 0.6065 - (0.0785/0.1)*(0.6065 - 0.5488).

So 0.0785/0.1 = 0.785. So delta is 0.785 * 0.0577 ≈ 0.0453.

So 0.6065 - 0.0453 = 0.5612.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use calculator-like approach.

But perhaps I should compute 150 minutes using the given λ.

But wait, maybe I can find it another way. Let me compute the probability that it hasn't decayed after 50+150=200 minutes, minus the probability it hasn't decayed after 50 minutes. So, the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 minutes is [1 - e^(-λ*200)] - [1 - e^(-λ*50)] = e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200).

Wait, that's another way to think about it. Because the probability that it has decayed by 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*200), and the probability it has decayed by 50 is 1 - e^(-λ*50). So the probability of decaying between 50 and 200 is the difference.

But wait, in our case, the atom hasn't decayed after 50 minutes, so the conditional probability is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, yes, because e^(-λ*50) is the probability it's still there at 50, and e^(-λ*200) is the probability it's there at 200. So the difference is the probability it decayed between 50 and 200. But since we know it's still there at 50, the conditional probability is that difference divided by e^(-λ*50), which is 1 - e^(-λ * (200-50)) = 1 - e^(-λ *150), which is the same as earlier.

So, regardless, the probability is 1 - exp(-λ *150).

So let's compute that.

We have λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 = ln(1.470588)/100 ≈ 0.38566 /100 = 0.0038566 min^-1.

So λ *150 = 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

So exp(-0.57849) ≈ what?

As a rough estimate, I can note that ln(2) is about 0.6931. So 0.578 is a bit less than ln(2). Let me think about exp(-0.578). Let's compute it:

exp(-x) = 1/(e^x).

e^0.5 is about 1.6487, e^0.57 is about... let me think. e^0.57 ≈ 1.768.

Wait, e^0.5 = 1.6487, e^0.6 = 1.8221. So 0.57 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Compute e^0.57:

We can approximate it using a Taylor expansion around x=0.5.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator-like approach. Alternatively, perhaps using known values.

I know that e^0.4055 ≈ 1.5, because ln(1.5)=0.4055.

Wait, but I'm being too vague. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that e^0.57 is approximately 1.768, as I thought earlier.

Wait, let me check with another approach. Let me compute e^0.578.

We can use the formula e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24.

x=0.578.

x^2 = 0.578^2 = approximately 0.334.

x^3 = 0.578 *0.334 ≈ 0.193.

x^4 ≈ 0.578 *0.193 ≈ 0.1116.

So compute each term:

1 + 0.578 =1.578

plus 0.334/2=0.167 → 1.745

plus 0.193/6 ≈ 0.032 → 1.777

plus 0.1116/24≈0.0046 → 1.7816

So e^0.578 ≈ approx 1.7816.

But wait, does that make sense? Because e^0.5 is 1.6487, e^0.6 is 1.8221. So 0.578 is closer to 0.6, so e^0.578 is about 1.78.

So e^0.578 ≈ 1.78 → exp(-0.578)=1/1.78≈0.5618.

So approximately 0.5618.

So 1 - 0.5618 = 0.4382, or 43.82%.

Looking at the options, A is 44%, which is close. But wait, the options are 44% (A), 40% (B), etc.

But wait, maybe my approximation is a bit off. Let me recheck.

Alternatively, perhaps using the initial approach, we can compute it more accurately.

Another approach: Let me compute e^(-0.57849) using a better approximation.

We know that ln(2)=0.6931, and 0.57849 is about 0.6931 × (0.57849/0.6931) ≈ 0.57849 is 0.6931 × 0.835.

So e^(-0.57849) = (e^-0.6931)^0.835 = (1/2)^0.835 ≈.

Because e^-0.6931 is 0.5.

So (0.5)^0.835 = 2^(-0.835) = approx 1/(2^0.835).

Compute 2^0.835.

2^0.8=1.741, 2^0.835 is a bit higher.

We can compute ln(2^0.835)=0.835×ln 2≈0.835×0.6931≈0.581.

So e^0.581≈ 1.787.

So 2^0.835 ≈ e^0.581 ≈ 1.787, so 1/(1.787) ≈ 0.559.

So e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.559.

So 1 - 0.559 = 0.441, approximately 44.1%.

Which is about 44%, so option A.

But wait, are there any other factors I might have missed?

Wait, perhaps the calculation of λ. Let me recheck that.

The given probability is 32% in 100 minutes, which is 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100).

So e^(-λ *100)=0.68 → λ = ln(1/0.68) /100.

Compute ln(1/0.68): ln(1.470588)≈0.38566.

So λ=0.0038566 per minute.

So λ *150=0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

Yes, that's correct.

So e^(-0.57849)=approx 0.559.

So 1-0.559=0.441.

So 44.1%, which rounds to 44%. So option A is 44%.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 48%. Hmm. Let me double-check if I'm using the correct approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the atom decays at some point in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the previous 50. So, which would be the same as the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes from the current time.

Which is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, which is 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈ 44%.

So why isn't the answer 44%? But the options include 44% as option A.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Let me calculate it more precisely.

Wait, perhaps using the exact value of λ. Let me compute λ more accurately.

We have 0.32 = 1 - e^{-λ *100} → e^{-λ *100}=0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100.

Compute ln(1/0.68)= ln(1.470588).

Using a calculator, ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.385662. So λ= 0.385662 / 100 = 0.00385662 per minute.

So λ=0.00385662.

Then, λ*150 = 0.00385662 *150 = 0.578493.

So compute e^{-0.578493}.

Using a calculator:

e^{-0.578493} ≈ 0.5618.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me compute e^{-0.578493} accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as follows:

Use the Taylor series expansion for e^x around x= -0.578493.

But perhaps it's easier to use the known value. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps try to compute it using logarithm tables, but that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator. But since I can't, let me think of another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the fact that 0.5785 is approximately 0.58.

e^{-0.58} = 1/(e^{0.58}).

e^0.58 ≈ e^{0.5} * e^{0.08}.

e^0.5 is about 1.64872.

e^0.08 ≈ 1 + 0.08 + (0.08^2)/2 + (0.08^3)/6 + (0.08^4)/24.

Which is 1 + 0.08 + 0.0032 + 0.000341 + 0.0000106667 ≈ approximately 1.08355.

So e^0.58 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.08355 ≈ let's compute that.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872.

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.131898.

1.64872 *0.08355 ≈ but perhaps better to compute 1.08355 as 1 + 0.08 + 0.00355.

So 1.64872 * (1 + 0.08 + 0.00355) = 1.64872*(1.08355).

Compute 1.64872 * 1.08 = 1.64872 *1 = 1.64872; 1.64872 *0.08=0.131898 → total 1.780618.

Then, 1.64872 *0.00355 ≈ 0.005845.

Adding, 1.780618 + 0.005845 ≈ 1.786463.

So e^0.58 ≈ 1.7865, so e^{-0.58} ≈ 1/1.7865 ≈ 0.56.

So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.

So 44%, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the exact value.

But wait, perhaps the given options have more precise values. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So the conditional probability is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes. So the probability that it decays in the next 150 is the same as the probability that it decays in 150 minutes, starting from time zero, because of the memoryless property.

Wait, no. The memoryless property says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same as if it had just started. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ t).

In our case, t is 150, so probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 44%, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 48%, which is higher. So why is this the case? Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the exact value using precise calculation.

Let me compute λ= ln(1/0.68)/100.

Compute ln(1/0.68)= ln(1.470588)= let me use a calculator-like approach.

We can compute ln(1.470588) as follows:

We know that ln(1)=0, ln(1.4)= 0.3365, ln(1.47)= 0.38566, which matches our earlier calculation.

So, λ=0.38566/100 =0.0038566.

So 150 minutes: 0.0038566 *150=0.57849.

Compute e^{-0.57849}.

Using a calculator, e^{-0.57849}= approximately 0.5618.

So 1 - 0.5618=0.4382, which is 43.82%. So approximately 44%.

Thus, the answer should be option A:44%.

But wait, the options are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

So the correct answer is A.


To solve the problem, we use the exponential decay model, where the probability of an atom decaying by time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

Here, \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.32
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} = 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Using the memoryless property of radioactive decay, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.5785
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.5785}
\]

To approximate \( e^{-0.5785} \), we use known values and approximations. For \( e^{-0.5785} \), we estimate:

\[
e^{-0.5785} \approx 0.5618
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.5618 = 0.4382 \, \text{or} \, 43.82\%.
\]

Rounding to the nearest option, the probability is approximately **44%**.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 44%**: Matches the calculated probability.
- **B) 40%**: Too low; does not align with the calculation.
- **C) 52%**: Too high; inconsistent with the exponential decay model.
- **D) 48%**: Slightly higher than the calculated value but close.

The correct answer is **A) 44%**.

Answer: A
