Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the probabilities of measuring certain eigenstates and the average value of an operator. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, so I need to normalize this state first, right? Because the probabilities depend on the squared magnitudes, and the normalization ensures the total probability is 1.

So, to normalize, I should calculate the inner product of |alpha> with itself. Let's write it out.

The state is |alpha> = (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So the inner product <alpha|alpha> is |1+i|² + |2-i|².

Calculating each term:
|1+i|² = (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +1 = 2.
Wait no, wait, |a + ib|² is a² + b²? Oh yeah, right. So |1+i| = sqrt(2), so squared is 2.

Similarly, |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So the normalized state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, but the question says |alpha> is proportional to that, so we have to normalize. So now the state is correctly normalized.

Next part: the operator whose matrix elements are A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Oh wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out.

The matrix for the operator would be:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because when i≠j (so (1,2) and (2,1) positions), it's hbar/2, and the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero.

Hmm, interesting. So this operator is similar to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So our operator is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

But wait, maybe it's easier to find its eigenstates. Because when we measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the probabilities are the squared overlaps of the state with the eigenstates.

Alternatively, if we can diagonalize the operator, then express the state |alpha> in terms of its eigenstates, the probabilities are given by the square of the
