Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and what the HPLC chromatograms would show. Hmm.

So, the chemist is doing two reactions. Both are using mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's used for epoxidation, right? So, when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides. Oh wait, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide formation.

Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 is with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—standard (achiral) and chiral.

First, I need to figure out what products each reaction gives. Let's think about epoxidation. (E)-oct-4-ene has the substituents on opposite sides, while (Z) has them on the same side.

Epoxidation with mCPBA typically proceeds via an electrocyclic ring-opening mechanism. The reaction forms an epoxide, and the stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide's stereocenters.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, when it reacts with mCPBA, what happens? The epoxide formation would lead to a trans-dihydroxylation, but wait, no. Actually, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition, forming an epoxide with specific stereochemistry.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. Epoxidation by mCPBA is a peracid reaction. It's a concerted process where the peracid adds across the double bond, forming an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the double bond (E or Z) will influence the configuration of the epoxide's stereocenters.

For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. When the epoxidation occurs, the two new oxygen atoms will add with a certain configuration. Let me think: the peracid adds in a way that the same face is attacked. So for (E), which is trans, adding the same face would lead to a cis epoxide? Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, in epoxidation, the peracid approaches the same face of the double bond. So for (E) - trans double bond, the substituents are on opposite sides. Adding the same face would mean that in the epoxide, the two new oxygen atoms are on adjacent carbons and same face—so the resulting epoxide would have the two adjacent stereocenters in a certain configuration.

Similarly for the (Z) isomer, which is cis. Adding the same face would lead to adjacent stereocenters in another configuration.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. But since I can't, I'll try to imagine it. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are opposite. So when the same face is attacked, the
