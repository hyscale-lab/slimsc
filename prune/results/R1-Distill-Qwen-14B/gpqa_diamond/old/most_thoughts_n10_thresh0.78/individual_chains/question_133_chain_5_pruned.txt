Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's try to break it down step by step. 

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters since 1000 cm³ is a liter. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3- I think. The question also gives me the pKa values for H3PO4 as Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem gives the Ka values as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. So those are Ka1, Ka2, Ka3, respectively.

Hmm, right. So H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-, then H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-. 

Now, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me write down what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So the formula is K+ + H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it gives Na+ ions and HPO4^2- plus some water molecules. So the formula is 2Na+ + HPO4^2- + 2H2O.

So in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Since these are phosphate species, they can interconvert based on the pH of the solution. The presence of both might mean that they're in a buffer solution, but wait, the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-.

But wait, under normal circumstances, PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form and exists in very basic solutions because each dissociation is harder than the last. Let's think about the pH here.

The solution contains both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. These are the first and second salts of phosphoric acid. When both are present, the solution is probably at a pH where both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- are present, but in a buffer system. However, I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, so if the solution is buffered between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, then PO4^3- would be minimal. But maybe the solution is such that some of the HPO4^2- can deprotonate further to form PO4^
