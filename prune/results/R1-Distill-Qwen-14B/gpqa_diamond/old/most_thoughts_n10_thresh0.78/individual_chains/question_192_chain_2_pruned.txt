Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. So there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The cavity's center is at a distance s from the conductor's center. The cavity's radius is r, which is smaller than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor.

Wait, point P is outside the conductor, right? So the distance from the center of the conductor is L, which is greater than R. Also, the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. And l is greater than R as well. The angle between l and s is theta.

Hmm. I remember that when charges are inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges rearrange themselves. But since the conductor was initially uncharged, I think that the inner surface of the conductor would have an induced charge opposite to the charge inside. But wait, wait. The conductor is uncharged, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface must have a charge of -q, and the outer surface would have +q to balance it out. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral.

But wait, no. Because the conductor is neutral, any charge inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to have an induced charge of -q, leaving the outer surface with +q. Because the total conductor's charge is zero, so inner: -q, outer: +q, sum to zero. No, wait, wait. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface +q, because the conductor's net charge is zero. Hmm, maybe I should think about that again. Because the conductor has no net charge to begin with. So the induced charges must cancel each other. So if the cavity has +q, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q, and the outer surface must have +q to keep the conductor neutral. Yes, that makes sense.

But wait, in this problem, the conductor is uncharged. So when we place a +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor will have
