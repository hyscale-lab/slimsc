Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these, and I need to figure out which combination is correct.

First, I remember that SMEFT is an effective field theory that extends the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the interactions they describe. Now, when it comes to symmetries, I think that effective theories must respect the same fundamental symmetries as the Standard Model itself, unless those symmetries are broken by the new physics that's being incorporated.

So, what are the main symmetries here? Let's break them down:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a big one. The Standard Model is Lorentz invariant, meaning that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames. SMEFT, being a valid extension, must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So all operators in SMEFT must transform properly under Lorentz transformations. So option 1 is definitely included.

2. **Poincar√© Symmetry**: Wait, Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz symmetry and translational symmetry (like momentum conservation). But in effective field theories, especially when considering operators of higher dimensions, the Poincare symmetry might impose some restrictions. Wait, or does it? Because Lorentz symmetry is a subset of Poincare. But I think in SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that automatically respects Poincare symmetry. So all operators must respect it. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Because the effective theory is built from local terms, which should respect Poincare. So maybe option 2 is also required. Or does the question consider Poincare as a given if Lorentz is there?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Lorentz symmetry is part of the Poincare group. So if the theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But the question is the other way around: which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if an operator violates Lorentz symmetry, it would also violate Poincare. But do SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? I think they do, because without that, you would have non-invariant theories under boosts and translations, which isn't physical.

Wait, but wait. Maybe Poincare is a broader symmetry that includes Lorentz. So if the theory already respects Lorentz, does it necessarily respect Poincare? Or do they have to explicitly respect each?

Alternatively, perhaps the question treats Lorentz and Poincare as separate points. But in reality, if a theory respects Poincare,
