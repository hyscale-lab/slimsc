Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about a density matrix, and I'm trying to figure out where it's positioned in qubit space. Hmm, let me think. I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. Pure states are described by density matrices that are projectors, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, but this one looks a bit different.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that's interesting. So it's a sum of the projectors for the states |0⟩ and |1⟩, each multiplied by 1/2. So each term has equal weight, 1/2. I think this is a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. Because when you have equal probabilities for both basis states, that's the maximally mixed case.

Now, the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I remember that qubit states can be represented on the Bloch sphere. For a general single-qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector r. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ represents the Pauli matrices, and I is the identity matrix.

So, let me break down the given ρ. The given matrix is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that. The |0⟩⟨0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplying by 1/2, the density matrix is (I)/2.

Wait, but according to the Bloch sphere formula, ρ is (I + r·σ)/2. So if ρ is (I)/2, that would imply that r·σ is zero. Because (I + 0)/2 = I/2. So r must be the zero vector. Because the only way r·σ is zero is if r itself is zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So that must be the correct answer.

I should double-check. When the state is completely mixed, the Bloch vector is at the origin. For a pure state, the vector lies on the surface of the Bloch sphere. Since this is a completely mixed state, the vector should be at the center, which is (0,0,0). Yep, that makes sense.


The given density matrix is 

$$\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).$$

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a general single-qubit state, the density matrix can be written as 

$$\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},$$

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), we see that the denominator is 2, and the numerator is the identity matrix \(I\). This implies that the term \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}\) must be zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) must be the zero vector, i.e., \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\).

This result corresponds to the maximally mixed state being located at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct geometrical position is 

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
