Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each part is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to determine the major products. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out each reaction and match them to the choices A, B, C in the options.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile. It's a dienolate, right? The enolate will attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. So, the methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me? Or wait, no. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(C6H4-4Me)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Structure of methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be methyl ester, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=C(C(p-tolyl))COOCH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=C(C(p-tolyl))COOCH3? No, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-. So the substituent is on the third carbon? Wait no, the acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. If it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, then the p-tolyl is on the third carbon of the acrylate. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CO-O-CH2-p-tolyl? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's CH
