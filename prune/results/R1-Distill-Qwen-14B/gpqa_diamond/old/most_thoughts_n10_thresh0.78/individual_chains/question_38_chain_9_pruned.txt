Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are compounds formed by the condensation of a secondary amine with a carbonyl compound. They're often used in reactions where you want to form rings or other structures because they can undergo various reactions like electrophilic additions.

The question gives me a starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to parse that. The base name is ethanaminium, which I think is a quaternary ammonium salt. The substituents are N-methyl and N-(pentan-2-ylidene). Oh, right, the ylidene group means it's a double bond, so pentan-2-ylidene would be CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂-CH₂? Wait, no, wait. Pentan-2-ylidene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH₂-? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be (CH₂)₂CH– but with a double bond. Wait, maybe it's CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂–? Wait, let me think. Pentan-2-ylidene would be CH₂=CH–CH₂–CH₂–CH₂–? No, wait, I think the structure is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂– but with a double bond at position 2. So pentan-2-ylidene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂–. So the starting material is an enamine formed from a secondary amine and a ketone, perhaps.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine, right? So it's an ethanaminium with substituents. The structure would be something like [N–(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂– with a double bond)–CH3] with a positive charge.

The reaction is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium + reagent A → product B.

Looking at the options, each option lists a sequence of reagents (A) and the product (B).

So the question is about what happens when this enamine reacts
