Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and redshift and Lyman alpha absorption. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down.

Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. We need to find the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes.

Wait, redshift... right. Redshift (z) tells us how much the wavelength of light has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The formula I remember is z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength) / emitted wavelength.

The Lyman alpha line is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it. So for the quasar's light to be observed in the optical range after being redshifted, the wavelength must have been shifted into the visible spectrum.

So the observed wavelength (lambda_obs) has to be longer than 400 nm, which is the approximate lower limit of what optical telescopes can see. Wait, but wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms.

Oh wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength has to be at least 4000 Angstroms for ground-based optical telescopes to detect it.

So we set lambda_obs >= 4000 Angstroms. The emitted wavelength (lambda_emit) is 1216 Angstroms.

So using z = (lambda_obs - lambda_emit) / lambda_emit.

But the question is about the lower limit on redshift. So we need the minimum z such that lambda_obs is just at 4000 Angstroms.

Plugging in the numbers:

z = (4000 - 1216) / 1216 ≈ (2784) / 1216 ≈ 2.289.

Wait, but what's the exact value? Let's do the math more precisely. 4000 divided by 1216 is the same as 4000/1216 ≈ 3.29, but wait no, wait, wait. Wait, z is (lambda_obs - lambda_emit)/lambda_emit = (lambda_obs/lambda_emit) - 1.

So, lambda_obs must be >= 4000 Angstroms. So lambda_obs = 4000, then.

z = (4000/1216) - 1.

Calculate 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 * 3 = 3648. 4000 - 3648 = 352. 352/1216 ≈ 0.289. So 3 + 0.289 ≈ 3.289. So z ≈ 3.289. But wait, that would make z about 3.29.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the quasar's rest frame. When it's redshifted, the observed wavelength is longer. So if the cloud is at a redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z) Angstroms.

We need 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Divide both sides by 1216: 1 + z >= 4000/1216.

Compute 4000 / 1216: Let's compute that.

1216 × 3 = 3648. 3648 + 1216 = 4864 which is more than 4000. So between 3 and 4?

Wait, 3 × 1216 = 3648. 3648 + (352) = 4000. 352 is 352/1216 = 0.289 approx.

So 4000/1216 = 3.289 approximately.

So 1 + z >= 3.289 → z >=
