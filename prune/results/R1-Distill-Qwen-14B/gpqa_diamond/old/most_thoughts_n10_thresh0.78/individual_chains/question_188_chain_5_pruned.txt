Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance is related to the crystal structure and the lattice parameters. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

Rhombohedral crystals are a type of hexagonal crystal system, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's a separate category. Oh right, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. The lattice parameters are all the same, a = b = c, but the angles are all equal too. In this case, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. And the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, wait. Interatomic distance is the distance between atoms, but in a crystal, that's usually the lattice parameter, so I guess here a = 10 Angstroms.

The problem is to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The formula for the interplanar distance (d) is given by 1/d² equals the sum of (h², k², l²) multiplied by some reciprocal of the lattice parameters. Wait, but I think in the case of a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit different because the unit cell isn't cubic.

The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal system is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h²)/(a²) + (k²)/(b²) + (l²)/(c²) + ... other terms involving the angles between the lattice parameters... ). Oh right! Because in a cubic system, the angles are 90 degrees, but when the angles aren't 90, the formula changes.

Wait, I think the correct formula for a rhombohedral system is d_{hkl} = 1 / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) + 2(hk cos γ)/(a²) + 2(hl cos β)/(a²) + 2(kl cos α)/(a²) ) ), but wait, no, maybe I got the angles wrong. Or perhaps it's better expressed using the reciprocal of the metric tensor. Oh right, the metric tensor for a rhombohedral crystal is a bit specific.

Alternatively, I remember that the general formula for interplan
