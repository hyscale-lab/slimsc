Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. Let me think through what I know.

So, the setup is there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. The researchers want to observe the one with the higher transit probability because they have limited time. Both are detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods.

Wait, but both have the same mass. So mass isn't the varying factor here. The orbital period is different: Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So, Planet_1 orbits much faster. Oh, but wait, the period is the time it takes to orbit, so a shorter period means it's closer to its star, right?

Also, both have circular orbits. That's important because eccentricity affects transit probability, but here it's zero, so maybe that simplifies things.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. Oh, but both host stars have the same radii. Wait, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger. But maybe Planet_1's star is in a slightly different stage. Or maybe the same radius but different mass implies different densities or something.

Now, the question is about transit probability. From what I remember, the probability of a planet transiting its star depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit relative to our line of sight. But since we're assuming that the RV method has detected them, that already tells us something about their orbits. Wait, but for transits, the main factor is the alignment, which isn't directly known from RV. But in any case, I think the transit probability also depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet, as well as the orbital distance.

Wait, more accurately, the probability that a planet transits is given by the formula:

P_transit = (R_planet + R_star) / a_planet * (some factor based on inclination, but I think
