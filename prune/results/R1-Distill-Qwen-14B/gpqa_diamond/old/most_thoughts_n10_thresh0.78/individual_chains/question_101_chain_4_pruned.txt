Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A to give a specific product. I need to figure out what reagent A and catalyst B are.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me draw that in my mind. So, the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1, which is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. Cyclohexylidene suggests a cyclohexene ring, but I think in this case, it's a cyclohexane ring attached via a methylene group, but maybe conjugated in some way. Wait, or is it a cyclohexene with a double bond? No, wait, the product is 1-cyclohexylidenemethyl-pyrrolidine. So the substituent is a methylene group attached to a cyclohexylidene, which I think is like a cyclohexene where the substituent is attached to the double bond. Hmm, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group with a double bond adjacent, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe I should think about the reaction type.

So, the starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. That's a pyrrolidine ring with a methyl group on the third carbon. The product suggests some kind of addition or substitution. The product has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methylene group (-CH2-) to the pyrrolidine. Wait, but the substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl, which might be a cyclohexyl group with a double bond somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a result of some kind of ring formation.

Wait, another thought: 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with something under acid catalysis. Common acid-catalyzed reactions for amines include various types like alkylation, acylation, or perhaps ring expansion or some kind of addition.

Wait, the product looks like the pyrrolidine has a new substituent. The substituent is a cyclohexyl group connected via a methylene (-CH2-), but the name is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Oh, I think maybe it's a cyclohexene group (i.e., with a double bond) attached through a methylene group to the pyrrolidine. So maybe the structure is that the substituent is CH2-C=cyclohexane? Or perhaps more accurately, the substituent is a cyclohexylidene group, which would be a cyclohexene ring where the substituent is attached to one of the carbons in the double bond.

Wait, maybe it's a result of some
