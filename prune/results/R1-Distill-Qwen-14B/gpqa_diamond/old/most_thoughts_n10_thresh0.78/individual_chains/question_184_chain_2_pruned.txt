Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about synthesizing a specific compound using benzene as the starting material. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out the substituents on the benzene ring. The numbering is 1, 2, and 3. So, position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). Wait, actually, the way the name is written is 2-(tert-butyl), 1-ethoxy, and 3-nitro. So, on the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3.

But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so the numbering might be different. Oh, right, when numbering, we start at the lowest possible number that gives the substituents the lowest numbers. So, substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 positions.

Our goal is to get these groups in the correct positions on the benzene ring. Let's think about how each substituent can be introduced. 

The substituents are nitro (NO2), ethoxy (OEt), and tert-butyl (t-Bu). Also, I know that benzene can undergo substitution reactions, and the order in which substituents are introduced can affect the product because of directing effects and possible steric hindrance.

Nitro groups are meta-directing, while ethoxy groups are ortho/para-directing. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, ortho/para-directing substituent, but since it's bulky, it might be more para-directing because the ortho positions are harder to reach due to steric reasons.

So, the synthesis steps need to be planned carefully, considering the directing effects of each substituent.

Let me think about the steps needed. We start with benzene.

Option A starts with t-butyl chloride and AlCl3, which is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation is problematic with tert-butyl chloride because the tertiary carbocation is formed, which can lead to carbocation rearrangements. Oh wait, no, wait: if we use t-BuCl with AlCl3, the AlCl3 would help generate the t-Bu+ carbocation. But since it's a tertiary carbocation, it's stable, so it should work. So first substitution would be the t-Bu group.

Then, what's next? Option A says HNO3/H2SO4. That's nitration. So after t-Bu, we nitrate. The t-Bu is a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group), so it's ortho/para directing. So nitration would occur at either ortho or para to the t-Bu.

Wait, but after adding the t-Bu group, the next group would be the nitro group. But nitro is a deactivating group. So the order of adding the substituents could influence where they go.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are at 1,2,3 positions. Hmm. Let me imagine the benzene ring: positions 1, 2, 3 are consecutive. So, if I add t-Bu at position 1, then the next substitution (nitro) could be at position 2 or 4. Wait, but nitration is done after t-Bu addition, which is step ii in option A.

Wait, let me think again. The target structure has t-Bu at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. So, perhaps I should plan the order of substitution so that each new group is added in a position directed by the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are added in a specific order. Let me check each option's steps.

Looking at option A: The steps are i) t-Bu Cl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), ii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iii) SO3/H2SO4 (which is sulfonation?), iv) NaNO2/HCl (nitrous acid, maybe diazotization), v) dilute H2SO4, vi) H3O+ H2O/heat (hydrolysis?), vii) NaOH/EtBr (ethoxy group via SN2, perhaps), viii) Fe/HCl, ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think about each step.
