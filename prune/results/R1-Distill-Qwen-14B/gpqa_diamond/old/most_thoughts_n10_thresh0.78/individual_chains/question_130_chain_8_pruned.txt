Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about redshift and detecting hydrogen clouds with ground-based telescopes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I need to find the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected using optical ground-based telescopes.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But wait, when the hydrogen clouds are at a high redshift, the wavelength we observe is stretched due to the expansion of the universe. So if the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength 位_obs is 位_emit * (1 + z).

But wait, if the cloud is at a certain redshift, the quasar's light that passes through it gets absorbed at the rest wavelength of 1216 Angstroms. So the quasar's light would have this absorption line at that wavelength. But for us to detect this absorption line, that wavelength must be in the visible spectrum because ground-based telescopes can't see ultraviolet light effectively, right? Because Earth's atmosphere blocks a lot of UV radiation, so ground telescopes are limited to optical wavelengths.

So the Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms (which is 121.6 nm) is in the far-ultraviolet. So for ground-based telescopes to see this, the observed wavelength must be in the visible range. So the redshift z must be such that when we multiply 1216 by (1+z), the result is in the optical range.

What's the optical range? I think visible light is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So let's say the lower end is around 400 nm. Wait, but maybe a bit higher? Because if the observed wavelength is too close to the near-infrared, it might not be considered optical, but I think 400 nm is within optical.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So, let me compute what redshift would bring 121.6 nm into the visible range.

We have 位_obs = 121.6 * (1 + z) 

We want 位_obs >= 400 nm (since below that is UV, not visible from ground). Wait, no, because 400 nm is the lower limit of visible. So to be visible, the observed wavelength needs to be greater than 400 nm. So we can set 121.6*(1+z) = 400 nm. Let's solve for z.

121.6 * (1 + z) = 400  
1 + z = 400 / 121.6  
Calculate that: 400 divided by 121.6. Let me compute 400 / 120 is about 3.333, but exact value: 121.6
