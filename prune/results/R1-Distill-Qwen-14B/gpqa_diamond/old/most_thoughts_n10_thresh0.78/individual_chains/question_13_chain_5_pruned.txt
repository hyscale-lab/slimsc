Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

So, the starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, right? The (R) configuration refers to the specific enantiomer.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere. Pd/C is a catalyst used in hydrogenation reactions. Since it's a hydrogenation, the double bonds are going to be hydrogenated. Limonene has a double bond in its structure. Wait, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond. So, when hydrogenated, the double bond would add H2 across it, turning it into a single bond. But wait, I think limonene is a bicyclic structure with a bridge. So the hydrogenation would add hydrogen to the double bond, possibly leading to the formation of a cyclohexane derivative. 

Wait, limonene's structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So when hydrogenated, the double bond at position 2 would become a single bond, adding two hydrogens. So the product 1 would be the hydrogenated form, which is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane? But wait, in the options, it's cyclohexyl derivatives. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the structures. Alternatively, perhaps the initial structure is a substituted limonene. Wait, no, the starting point is (R)-limonene, which is a specific monoterpene. So upon hydrogenation, the double bond becomes single, so the molecule becomes bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But wait, the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. Oh, right, hydrogenation of a double bond consumes 1 mole of H2 per double bond, so that's why they mention 1 equivalent.

So product 1 is the hydrogenated limoneneâ€”bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. But the next step
