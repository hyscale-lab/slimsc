Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my binary star mechanics, but let me try to think this through.

The problem says there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses with different periods: 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) observations show sinusoidal variations for each star in each system. The amplitudes are given as 10 km/s and 5 km/s for system_1, and 15 km/s and 10 km/s for system_2.

The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So, I need to find the mass ratio, system_1 mass divided by system_2 mass.

I remember that in a binary star system, the two stars orbit a common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures their Doppler shifts, which give us information about their velocities around this center of mass.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) for each star is related to the mass of the other star. The formula, if I recall correctly, is K = (2πG / (P * sqrt(1 - e²))) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) ) ), but since the eccentricity e is not given, I'll assume it's circular (e=0), so the sqrt term becomes 1.

Wait, but another approach: I think the ratio of the radial velocity semi-amplitudes of the two stars is inversely proportional to their masses. Because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity since it's orbiting the center of mass closer, while the less massive star moves faster. So, K1/K2 = M2/M1. That's a key point.

Let me note down the given data:

System_1:
- Period (P1) = 2 years
- RV amplitudes: K1a = 10 km/s, K1b =5 km/s
So the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5 km/s.

System_2:
- Period (P2) = 1 year
- RV amplitudes: K2a=15 km/s, K2b=10 km/s.

Wait, but in each system, the two stars' RV amplitudes are given. So for system_1, the two stars have velocities of 10 and 5. For system_2, 15 and 10.

So, for system_1: K1a=10, K1b=5.

I think the sum of the velocities relates to the orbit sizes but perhaps the ratio relates to the mass ratio.

From the theory, in a binary system, the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So, K1a and K1b are the velocities of the two stars. Let's say M1a and M1b are the masses of the two stars in system_1. Then, M1a + M1b is the total mass of system_1.

Similarly for system_2: M2a and M2b, their sum is the total mass.

From the velocity ratio: K1a/K1b = M1b/M1a.

So, 10/5 = 2 = M1b/M1a. So M1b = 2 M1a. But wait, that would mean M1a is the smaller mass, so K1a (10) is the velocity of the less massive star. Because the more massive star has lower velocity.

Wait, no: if M1a is the mass of the star with velocity K1a=10, and M1b is the mass with K1b=5.

Then, from the velocity ratio K1a/K1b = (M1b sin i)/(M1a sin i) )= M1b/M1a.

So K1a/K1b = (10)/(5) = 2 = M1b/M1a.

Which gives M1b = 2 M1a.

Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is M1a + M1b = M1a + 2 M1a = 3 M1a.

Similarly, for system_2:

K2a=15, K2b=10.

So K2a/K2b = (M2b sin i)/(M2a sin i) )= M2b/M2a.

But wait, wait, is K2a the velocity of M2a or M2b? I think K is the velocity of the star whose mass is M2a. So for system_2, K2a is the velocity of star M2a, and K2b is the velocity of M2b.

So, K2a/K2b = M2b / M2a.

15/10 = 3/2 = M2b/M2a.

So, M2b= (3/2) M2a.

Total mass of system_2 is M2a + M2b = M2a + (3/2) M2a = (5/2) M2a.

Now, to find the mass ratio (system_1 mass)/(system_2 mass):

M1_total = 3 M1a.

M2_total = (5/2) M2a.

But what's the relationship between M1a and M2a? Hmm, I think the periods come into play here.

I remember another formula: the mass function, which relates the observed velocities and the periods.

The mass function for each star in a binary system is given by:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * 2π G )

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass ratio and the orbital periods.

Another approach: the mass ratio q = M2 / M1, where M1 and M2 are the two masses.

Wait, but for each binary, perhaps I can find the mass function for both stars and then relate them.

Alternatively, I remember that the sum of the velocities (K1a + K1b) is not directly meaningful, but the ratio is key.

Wait, another thought: the binary orbit has a certain separation, and each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. So, M1a * K1a = M1b * K1b.

Because M1a * a1 = M1b * a2, and since velocity is 2πa/P, so K1a = (2π a1)/P1, K1b = (2π a2)/P1. So, M1a * (a1) = M1b * (a2).

But a1 / a2 = (K1a * P1) / (2π) ) / ( (K1b * P1)/(2π) )) ) = K1a / K1b.

So, M1a * (K1a / K1b) ) = M1b.

Which brings us back to M1b = (K1a / K1b) M1a.

Which is what we had earlier.

But perhaps I should relate the mass functions.

Wait, the mass function for a binary system is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

And f(M) can be calculated from the observed radial velocity semi-amplitude K and the period P.

The formula is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * 2π G )

Wait, the exact formula might be a bit different. Let me recall correctly. The mass function is:

f = ( (K)^3 * P ) / ( (2π G) )

But wait, in units where G is in km^3/(s^2 year), perhaps it's better to use the version that gives f in solar masses.

Alternatively, the formula for the mass function is:

f = ( (K * sin i)^3 * P ) / ( 241 )

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. Let me think: I think the formula is f = ( (K^3 * P ) ) / (241 * (1 + q)^2 ) ), where q is the mass ratio M2/M1.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the fact that for a binary system, each component's mass function is:

f1 = ( K1^3 P ) / ( 241 )

Similarly, f2 = ( K2^3 P ) / ( 241 )

But I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I need to look for another approach.

Wait, another approach: the total mass of the binary system is determined by the orbital period and the velocity amplitudes. The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K sin i)^3 P ) / ( 241 )

But since we don't know the inclination angle i, assuming that the orbits are edge-on (i=90 degrees, so sin i=1) would maximize the RV amplitudes. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume that the observed RVs are maximum, so sin i=1.

So, for each system, the mass function would be f1 = (K1^3 * P1)/(241) and similarly for the other star in the same system, f2 = (K2^3 * P2)/(241). But wait, for each system, the same period applies to both stars.

Wait, no. Each system has a single period, P. So for system_1, both stars have the same orbital period, 2 years. So P1 = 2 years. Similarly, P2 is 1 year.

So, let's compute the mass functions for each star in each system.

But wait, the mass function f is given by:

f = ( (K^3 * P ) ) / ( 241 )

And for a binary system, the mass function is the same for both stars. Because f is (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^2 (1 + q )^3 ), perhaps? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mass can be calculated using the formula:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2 )^3 * P ) / ( 241 * G ) )^(1/ something )

Wait, perhaps another approach: the combined mass of the binary system can be found using Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law in the form:

(M1 + M2) = (4π²/G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

But a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits around the center of mass. And since a1 + a2 = a (the separation between the stars), and M1 a1 = M2 a2 (from center of mass condition), so a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a.

Alternatively, since the velocities are K1 = 2π a1 / P, and K2 = 2π a2 / P, then a1 = K1 P/(2π), a2= K2 P/(2π).

So, a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) P/(2π).

Substituting into Kepler's third law:

(M1 + M2) = (4 π² / G ) * ( (K1 + K2) P/(2π) )^3 / P²

Simplify:

= (4 π² / G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / ( (2π)^3 ) ) / P^2

= (4 π² / G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) ) / P^2 )

Simplify the denominator:

= (4 π² / G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) ) / (8 π^3 P^2 )

= (4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) ) / ( G * 8 π^3 P^2 )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4/8 = 1/2.

π² / π^3 = 1/π.

P^3 / P^2 = P.

So,

= ( (1/2) * (K1 + K2)^3 P ) ) / ( G π )

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the units here. Because G is in m^3 kg^-1 s^-2, but the velocities are in km/s and the period in years.

This might get complicated, but perhaps I can find the ratio of the masses without knowing the actual value of G.

Wait, the total mass M_total for system_1 is proportional to (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1.

Similarly, M_total for system_2 is proportional to (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2.

Wait, because the formula for M_total is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

Wait, more accurately, from the formula I derived earlier, M_total is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (G * π ) ), but since G and π are constants, the masses are proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P.

So, the ratio of M1 to M2 would be:

(M1 / M2 ) = [ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ]

So, let's compute each part.

For system_1:

K1a + K1b = 10 +5 =15 km/s.

P1=2 years.

So, (15)^3 * 2.

For system_2:

K2a + K2b =15+10=25 km/s.

P2=1 year.

So, (25)^3 *1.

So, the ratio is:

(15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1 )

Compute 15^3: 3375.

25^3: 15625.

So,

(3375 *2 ) / 15625 = (6750) /15625.

Simplify:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 270 / 625.

Again, divide by 5: 54 / 125.

54 divided by 125 is 0.432.

So, M1/M2 = 0.432.

Wait, but the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

0.432 is closest to option A (~0.4). So the factor is approximately 0.43, so system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

Wait a minute, wait. Because the question says, "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So, if M1 is 0.43 * M2, then system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So, system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

So the factor is approximately 0.43, so the answer is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check my approach. Because the formula I used assumes that (M1 + M2) is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P. But wait, perhaps the proportionality is different. Let me think again.

Wait, when I derived the M_total, it was:

M_total = ( (4 π²) / G ) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P².

And a1 + a2 is (K1 P)/(2 π) + (K2 P)/(2 π) ) = ( (K1 + K2) P )/(2 π).

So, a1+a2 = (K1 + K2) P / (2 π).

Substituting back:

M_total = (4 π² / G ) * [ ( (K1 + K2) P / (2 π) )^3 ] / P^2

= (4 π² / G ) * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) ) / P^2

= (4 π² * (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) ) / ( G * 8 π^3 P^2 )

Simplify:

= (4 * (K1+K2)^3 P ) ) / ( G * 8 π )

= ( (K1+K2)^3 P ) ) / ( 2 G π )

So, M_total is proportional to (K1+K2)^3 * P.

Thus, the ratio M1/M2 is:

[ (K1a + K1b)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K2a + K2b)^3 * P2 ]

Which, as I calculated earlier, gives 0.432.

So, system_1 is 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So, system_1 is about 0.4 times more massive than system_2. So option A is the closest.

Wait, but wait. Could I have made a mistake in considering which K values to use? For each system, the RVs are for each star. So, perhaps I should only take one of them, but I used the sum.

Wait, no. Because for each system, the two stars' velocities add to give the total velocity amplitude for the binary. Because Kepler's law uses the sum of the velocities to determine the separation.

Wait, no, because each star's velocity is inversely proportional to their mass, and the sum of the velocities is inversely proportional to the total mass.

Wait, no, the sum K1a + K1b is proportional to a1 + a2, since a1 = K1a * P/(2π), a2= K1b * P/(2π). So, a1 +a2 = (K1a + K1b) P/(2π).

So, the sum of the velocities is directly proportional to the separation a.

Which brings me back to the earlier approach.

Hmm, I think the calculation is correct. So, the ratio is about 0.43, which is option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes and the total mass of the binary systems. The total mass of a binary system is proportional to the cube of the sum of the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, multiplied by the orbital period.

### Key Data:
- **System_1**:
  - Period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
  - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1a} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_{1b} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
  - Total velocity amplitude: \( K_1 = K_{1a} + K_{1b} = 15 \, \text{km/s} \)

- **System_2**:
  - Period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{years} \)
  - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{2a} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2b} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
  - Total velocity amplitude: \( K_2 = K_{2a} + K_{2b} = 25 \, \text{km/s} \)

### Formula for Mass Ratio:
The total mass of a binary system is proportional to \( (K)^3 \cdot P \), where \( K \) is the total velocity amplitude and \( P \) is the orbital period. Thus, the mass ratio \( \frac{M_1}{M_2} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{(K_1)^3 \cdot P_1}{(K_2)^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( K_1^3 \cdot P_1 \):
   \[
   K_1^3 \cdot P_1 = (15)^3 \cdot 2 = 3375 \cdot 2 = 6750
   \]

2. Compute \( K_2^3 \cdot P_2 \):
   \[
   K_2^3 \cdot P_2 = (25)^3 \cdot 1 = 15625 \cdot 1 = 15625
   \]

3. Compute the mass ratio:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
   \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately \( 0.43 \) times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **A) ~0.4**.
