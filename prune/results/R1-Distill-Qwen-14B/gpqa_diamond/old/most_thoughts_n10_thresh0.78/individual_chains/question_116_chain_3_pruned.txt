Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

So, the problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR spectrum showing two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, it undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce Compound D. We need to identify D from the options given.

First, let's analyze Compound A's NMR. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that these protons are probably in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but 6H could be three CH2 groups. Or maybe two CH3 groups? Wait, a triplet in an NMR suggests that the neighboring group has two sets of protons. Oh wait, more accurately, the splitting is based on neighboring protons. So a triplet would come from coupling with two equivalent protons. Like a CH2 adjacent to a CH2.

Let me think: If there are 6H as a triplet, perhaps it's two CH3 groups each adjacent to a CH2. Wait, no, because each CH3 would be a singlet if they're not coupled. Wait, maybe it's a CH2CH2 group? Or perhaps, wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, no, that might not fit the triplet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2CH3)2 group. Wait, two ethyl groups attached to the same carbon. Because each ethyl group's CH2 would split into a triplet. For example, if the structure is something like CH2CH2, but perhaps more accurately, maybe it's a diethyl group attached to a central atom.

Wait, let's think: If a CH2 group is connected to two CH3 groups, then the central CH2 would have two sets of neighboring protons. Hmm, no, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that there's a CH2CH2CH3 group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, the other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each of these protons is adjacent to a group with three equivalent protons. So each proton in the quartet is next to a CH3 group. So 4H as a quartetâ€”could that be from a CH2CH2CH3 group where the middle CH2 is next to a CH3. But wait, the quartet would come from coupling with a CH3
