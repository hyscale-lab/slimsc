Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about comparing the masses of two systems based on their radial velocity amplitudes and orbital periods.

So the problem says system_1 has an eclipse period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system. Both systems have two stars, and their radial velocities (RV) show sinusoidal variations. The amplitudes for system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, and for system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. I need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2.

I remember that in binary systems, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the mass of the companion. The formula I think is K = (v * sin i) * ( (M2 / (M1 + M2)) ), but wait, maybe I should think about the mass function or Kepler's third law here.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude for each star can be related to the masses. Let me think. The ratio of the two radial velocities (K1 and K2) should be equal to the inverse ratio of their masses. Because the more massive star would have a smaller velocity since it's closer to the center of mass. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Wait, let's get the exact formula. The mass function for each star is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but since both stars are in the same system, the inclination i is the same, and for eclipsing binaries, i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is about 1.

Alternatively, there's a relation where the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. So for each system, K1/K2 = M2/M1. But wait, wait, no, I think K is proportional to (M2 sin i) / (M1 + M2) ) multiplied by something else. Hmm, maybe better to think about the mass ratio.

Alternatively, the mass ratio q = M2 / M1. Then the velocity semi-amplitudes would
