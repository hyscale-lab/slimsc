Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks that belong to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we'd expect. So, normally, each proton should give one peak. Having two peaks for the same proton could mean a few things, like splitting due to coupling or maybe something else.

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Wait, why? Because if it was coupling with another proton, like a neighboring proton, you'd see a doublet or something. But since the two peaks are similar in shift and integral, and it's the same proton, perhaps it's not coupling. Or maybe it's some other kind of splitting.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, so it's not like they're different compounds with different masses. The mass spec is consistent with the expected molecule. Hmm. So same mass, same structure? But why two peaks?

Let me think about the possible options. The options are A to D.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If that were the case, the mass would be different because a precursor would have a lower mass, right? But the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So A might not be correct.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same mass, so LC-MS would detect two peaks if the column separates them. But in 1H NMR, if the mixture is a racemic pair, you don't see splitting for the same proton because enantiomers have the same environment. Wait, but in the NMR, they see two peaks for the same proton. Enantiomers would look identical in 1H NMR because they're mirror images. So that might not explain the NMR observation. Unless... no, wait, because in that case, the integrals would add up. But why two peaks? I don't think enantiomers would cause that. So maybe B isn't right.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Wait, what's double coupling? I remember that sometimes in amide formation, if the reaction isn't clean, you can get more than one product. For example, maybe an imine or something else forms. But I'm not sure how that would lead to two peaks for the same proton. Or perhaps during the reaction, some coupling leads to two different environments for the alpha proton. Maybe it's a diastereomer? Or perhaps the protons are in different environments but same shift due to symmetry.

Wait, the question says the alpha-proton is the same in both cases. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of having two different diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton but slightly different environments, leading to small shifts. But in the NMR, the shifts are similar, so maybe it's not that. Or perhaps the peaks are due to the presence of two different isomeric forms, maybe some tautomerism or something else.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would show different shifts. Wait, but the question says the chemical shifts are similar. But the integrals add up to 1H. So if there are two diastereomers, each with the same proton, but each in a slightly different environment, perhaps their shifts are similar enough that they appear as two separate peaks. But why would their shifts be so similar?

Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment, leading to the same shift. That seems unlikely. Diastereomers usually have different shifts because their structures are different. For example, if you have two enantiomers, their NMR spectra are the same. But diastereomers have different shifts. So if it's a mixture of diastereomers, each would have their own set of peaks, but if the alpha proton is the same in both, perhaps their shifts are similar. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the question says that the two peaks in the NMR have similar chemical shifts and equal integrals together to 1H. That suggests that each is 0.5H, but that's just adding up, so maybe each is a singlet. But why would the same proton split into two?

Another thought: maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. But again, the NMR would show the same shifts because enantiomers have identical NMR. So the peaks wouldn't split. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, the initial part of the question says the compound was chemically synthesized. So maybe during the synthesis, particularly in an amide bond formation, some kind of coupling leads to two different products.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond forming. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means here. Maybe during the formation of the amide, two different linkages happened, like maybe an ether instead of an amide, but that would change the mass. Or perhaps some kind of double bond formation. Wait, but the mass is the same, so the molecular formula is the same. So perhaps it's a diastereomer.

Wait, another angle: the LC-MS shows two peaks. Since the mass is the same, but they elute at different times, it's likely that the two are diastereomers, because enantiomers would elute together on a reversed-phase column if the mobile phase doesn't separate them (unless chiral columns are used, which they usually aren't in LC-MS). So if it's a mixture of diastereomers, they would have different retention times and thus two separate peaks.

So in the NMR, each diastereomer would have the same alpha-protons, but perhaps in a slightly different environment, leading to similar shifts. So their peaks might overlap or appear as two separate but nearby peaks. But why are their shifts similar? Because the alpha-proton is in a similar environment in both diastereomers. Wait, no, diast
