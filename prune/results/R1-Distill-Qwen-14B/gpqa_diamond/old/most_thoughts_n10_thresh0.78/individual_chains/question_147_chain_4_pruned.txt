Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Wait, so protons and antiprotons annihilate each other and produce these particles A⁺ and A⁻. Each A has a mass energy of 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, but first, I remember that in annihilation processes, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that means it's not moving very fast, so maybe its kinetic energy is low compared to its rest mass? Wait, but protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So their rest masses are similar. Oh wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe the initial kinetic energy is negligible? Or maybe it's moving at a low speed.

Wait, but the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV. So the proton and antiproton are annihilating into these A particles. I guess I should think about conservation of energy and momentum here.

Let me think about the initial setup. The
