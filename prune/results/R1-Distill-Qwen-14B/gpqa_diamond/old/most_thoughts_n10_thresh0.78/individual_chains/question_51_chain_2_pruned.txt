Okay, so I have this physics problem about the potential energy of a charge near a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors, especially grounded ones, the method of images might come into play. Let me think through this step by step.

The problem says a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of the system. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I remember that the potential energy of a system often involves the work done to assemble the charges. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, any induced charges on it must arrange themselves in a certain way.

When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges will redistribute. But wait, because the sphere is grounded, any induced charges can flow to the ground. So, the sphere's potential must be zero because it's grounded. 

Oh right! The method of images says that for a grounded sphere, the induced charges can be considered as an image charge inside the sphere. The image charge would be negative, right? Because the charge outside attracts the opposite charge. The magnitude of the image charge should be equal in magnitude to q, but opposite in sign. Wait, no, for a conducting sphere, the image charge is inside. So the image charge would be -q' where q' is something? Or maybe it's -q multiplied by some factor based on the radius. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, no, for a conducting sphere, the image charge has a magnitude of q * (R/d), where d is the distance from the center. Hmm, no, I think the image charge is - q multiplied by (R/d). Wait, no, maybe it's different. Alternatively, when the sphere is conducting and grounded, the induced charge on the sphere is such that the potential of the sphere is zero. So how does that affect the image charge?

Another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to the point d away. But since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero, so any induced charges will adjust accordingly.

Wait, when the charge q is placed outside the sphere, the sphere's induced charges (positive and negative) will arrange themselves so that the potential on the sphere is zero. So the sphere's surface will have a charge distribution that's like an
