Okay, so I need to figure out why there's no green signal when visualizing the offspring under the confocal microscope. Let's break down the experiment step by step.

First, the setup: We're dealing with a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices, and the receptor is a transmembrane protein with a certain structure. They've created a bicistronic vector using lox-Cre technology.

The vector has two main ORFs: the ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter that's constitutive, I think. The receptor is after an IRES element, which allows internal ribosome entry, so both proteins can be expressed from the same mRNA. 

Wait, but there are stop cassettes in between. The ligand ORF is upstream of a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette before its eGFP. Hmm, I remember that loxP and lox2272 are recognition sites for the Cre recombinase. When Cre is present, it excises the stop cassette, allowing the downstream gene to be expressed. 

So, in the construct, both the ligand and receptor are under the control of their respective promoters, but with these stop cassettes. The ligand is under CBA, so it should be expressed when the stop is removed. The receptor is after an IRES, which is usually for a second gene in a bicistronic vector. But the presence of the stop cassette suggests that without Cre, the receptor might not be expressed.

Now, they bred mice homozygous for this construct on a wild-type background. Then, they crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development. So the Cre would be expressed under the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

Wait, but the question is about the offspring. So, the mice are homozygous for the lox-Cre construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous. Let's think about the Cre expression: since the parent is hemizygous, the offspring would probably be heterozygous for SOX10-Cre. But how does this affect the construct?

The construct in the mice would have the ligand and receptor with the loxP and lox2272 stop cassettes. SOX10-Cre would express Cre in neural crest cells, which would then recombine the lox sites. 

In the vector, the ligand is under CBA, so it's always expressed, but the stop cassette would prevent mCherry from being expressed unless Cre is present. Wait, no. The ligand ORF is followed by a stop cassette, which would terminate transcription unless Cre deletes it. So when Cre is present, it would delete the stop, allowing the ligand (with mCherry) to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, but followed by a lox2272 cassette. So, Cre would delete that stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But wait, the vector is a bicistronic construct with the ligand first, then the receptor. So, the promoter for the ligand is CBA, which is strong. The receptor is after an IRES, which is a ribosome entry site, allowing the second ORF to be translated from the same mRNA. So without Cre, the ligand's ORF would be followed by a stop, so only ligand-mCherry would be expressed as a fusion? Or is it that the stop cassette after the ligand's ORF would prevent mCherry from being expressed?

Wait, no. The ligand's ORF is fused to mCherry, but there's a stop cassette. So the mRNA would have the ligand ORF, then a stop. So the ribosome would translate the ligand and then the stop, so the mCherry might not be expressed unless the stop is removed. Alternatively, perhaps the stop is in a way that the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry only when the stop is removed. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, maybe the construct is set up so that when Cre is present, the stop cassettes are removed. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP would both be expressed.

But in this case, they crossed the mice to SOX10-Cre, which should cause the Cre
