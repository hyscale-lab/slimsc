Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR question. Let's see what I remember. So the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Wait, 6-membered aromatic ring means it's a benzene ring, right? So the total carbons in the molecule are 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add 2 more carbons. Oh wait, no, wait. Because the benzene is substituted with two groups, each substituent probably brings some carbons. Hmm.

Wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene has two groups attached. Now, the FTIR shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents must include a carbonyl, like a ketone or maybe an ester or something, and a halogen, like Cl or Br.

So, the substituents on benzene are probably a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe) and a halogen (like Cl). Let's think about that. So the molecule would have a benzene ring with two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, the other is a halogen atom.

Wait, but wait. Let me count the carbons. Benzene is six carbons. Each substituent adds some. If one substituent is a carbonyl, that's one carbon (if it's a ketone, like R-CO-R), but wait, no, wait: for example, a substituent like -COCH3 (like a methyl ketone) would add two carbons. Or if it's a carbonyl group attached directly, like -CO-R, but that depends on R.

Wait, the total is 8 carbons. So benzene (6 carbons) plus substituents. Each substituent can't be too
