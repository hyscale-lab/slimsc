Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says. Hmm. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbons in total. Oh wait, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring, right? And the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the compound has a carbonyl (like a ketone or maybe an ester or something) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but the molecular formula isn't given, but knowing the total carbons is helpful. The ring is 6-membered, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons because 6 (aromatic) + 2 = 8. Because the substituents are two groups, each substituent can contribute 1 or more carbons. Hmm.

Wait, let's think. Di-substituted aromatic ring with 8 carbons. So the ring is benzene (6 carbons), so substituents add 2 carbons total. So each substituent is either a single carbon or maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. Wait
