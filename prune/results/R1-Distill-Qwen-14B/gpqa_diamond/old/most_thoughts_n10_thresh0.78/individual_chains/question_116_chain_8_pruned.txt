Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The problem says that Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Then, Compound A undergoes monobromination to form B. B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C, which has two geometrical isomers. The cis-isomer of C reacts with (1E,3E)-penta-1,3-dien-1-ol to produce compound D. The task is to identify D from the given options.

Hmm. Let me break this down.

First, looking at Compound A's NMR. A triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. Triplets in NMR usually mean that the proton is adjacent to two other protons. Like in a (CH3)2CH group, where the CH2 would show a triplet. Wait, but wait, 6H could be two sets of triplets? Or maybe a group that's split into a triplet. Alternatively, maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to a CH2.

Wait, for a triplet, each of the two adjacent Hs would split the peak into a triplet. So, if the coupling is between two Hs, like in a CH2CH3 group. For example, (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, wait, maybe it's a neopentyl group or something else.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to three others, probably in a CH2CH2 group. Or maybe it's a CH2 group next to another CH2. Wait, quartet could be a (CH2)2 group where each CH2 is next to another CH2. But 4H in a quartet would mean each of those four is split into a quartet. Alternatively, maybe it's a single quartet integrating for four protons
