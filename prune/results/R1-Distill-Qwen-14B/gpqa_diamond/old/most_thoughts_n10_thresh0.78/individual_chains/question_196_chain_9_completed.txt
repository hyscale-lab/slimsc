Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember harmonic oscillators from my studies, but this one is relativistic, so that's a bit more complex. Let me think about what I know.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The system obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The mass is m, and the maximum amplitude is A. The speed of light is c, and I need to pick the correct expression for v_max from the options given.

Wait, relativistic oscillator... Oh right, in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed given by v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? But that's non-relativistic. Here, it's relativistic, so I guess we'll have to consider relativistic effects, probably using the energy equations or maybe the relativistic expression for momentum.

In classical mechanics, the total energy is (1/2)kA² because at maximum displacement, all energy is potential. Then, when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C, but wait, it's a relativistic scenario, so C can't be the right answer here.

Relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total mechanical energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, wait. Wait, in SHM, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But in the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx²? Or does that change too?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think in terms of energy conservation. At maximum amplitude A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero (since the oscillator is at rest there in the classical case). But in the relativistic case, maybe the potential energy expression is different, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the system's total energy is conserved, so the sum of kinetic and potential remains the same.

Wait, but wait—relativistic harmonic oscillators typically have a different form. Oh, right, the force is F = -kx, but with relativistic considerations. So the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but when the particle moves, its kinetic energy is relativistic.

So the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So E = (1/2)kA².

At the equilibrium position (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so all energy is kinetic. So E = K = (γ-1)mc², since the kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc².

Wait, but in this scenario, E is the same as (1/2)kA², so:

(1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc²

Wait, that seems right. So solving for γ:

γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

Because (1/2)kA² = (γ -1) mc² → γ = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

But γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²)

Let me denote B = (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + B

Taking reciprocal of both sides:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + B)

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + B)^2

Then, solving for v²/c²:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+B)^2 ]

Let me compute 1 - [1/(1+B)^2]:

= [ (1+B)^2 - 1 ] / (1+B)^2

= [1 + 2B + B² -1 ] / (1 + 2B + B² )

= (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2 )

Factor numerator: B(2 + B) / (1+B)^2 )

But B is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2). Let me substitute that back in:

v²/c² = [ (kA²/(2 m c²)) * (2 + (kA²/(2 m c²)) ) ] / (1 + (kA²/(2 m c²)))^2 )

Hmm, that's getting complicated. Let me factor out 1/(2 m c²) from numerator and denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make this expression simpler.

Note that B is (k A²) / ( 2 m c² )

So (1+B) is (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² )

Wait, but maybe I can write it as:

Denominator becomes (1 + B)^2 = [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ]² = (2 m c² + k A² )² / (4 m² c^4 )

The numerator is B*(2 + B) = [ (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ 2 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) ) ]

= [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] * [ (4 m c² + k A² ) )/(2 m c²) ) ]

So,

Numerator: (k A² (4 m c² + k A² )) ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Putting together:

v²/c² = [ (k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )) / (4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )² / (4 m² c^4 ) ) ]

Wait, the denominators are the same denominator? Wait, no:

Wait, the denominator of v²/c² is (1 + B)^2, which is (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2/(2 m c^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps I should rewrite as:

v²/c² = [ B (2 + B) ] / (1 + B)^2

Wait, but that might not help immediately. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express v in terms of B.

But maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, we have:

E = (1/2) k A² = (γ -1) m c²

So,

γ = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c² )

So,

γ = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c² )

Hmm, but γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / ( 2 m c² )

Wait, let me rearrange this equation.

Take reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = [ 2 m c² ] / (2 m c² + k A² )

Square both sides:

1 - v²/c² = [ (2 m c² )^2 ] / (2 m c² + k A² )²

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [ (4 m² c^4) ] / ( (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 )

= [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 - 4 m² c^4 ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2

Let me expand numerator:

(2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 = 4 m² c^4 + 4 m c² (k A^2 ) + (k A^2 )²

Subtract 4 m² c^4:

= 4 m c² k A^2 + (k A^2 )^2

So,

v²/c² = [4 m c² k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2

Factor numerator:

= [ k A^2 (4 m c² +k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2

Hmm, can I factor further? Let me see.

We can write numerator as k A^2 (2 m c² + k A^2 + 2 m c² )? Wait, no, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to factor denominator as (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2.

Wait, the numerator is k A^2 (4 m c² +k A^2 ) = k A^2 (2 m c² + k A^2 + 2 m c² )

Hmm, not sure. Let me write the expression as:

v^2/c^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 )] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Wait, but that's a bit messy. Let's try to simplify.

Let me factor the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: k A² (4 m c² + k A² ) = k A² ( (2 m c²) *2 + k A² )

Denominator: (2 m c² +k A² )^2

So,

v²/c² = [k A² (4 m c² +k A² ) ] / (2 m c² +k A² )^2

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

v²/c² = (k A² / (2 m c² +k A² )) ) * [ (4 m c² +k A^2 ) / (2 m c² +k A^2 ) ]

Wait, that's because (4 m c² +k A^2 ) = 2*(2 m c²) +k A^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 4 m c² as 2*(2 m c²). So,

v²/c² = (k A^2 (2*(2 m c^2) +k A^2 )) / (2 m c² +k A^2 )^2

= [ (k A^2 ) * [ 2*(2 m c^2 ) + k A^2 ] ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

= [ 2 (2 m c^2 ) k A^2 + k^2 A^4 ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

But I'm not seeing a clear way to simplify this. Maybe I should express v in terms of c.

Wait, perhaps I'll take the square root to find v:

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Wait, but that's sqrt(numerator) over denominator.

Wait, let me write it as:

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ] ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

But that's the same as:

= c * sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

= c * [ A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factor out k A^2 from numerator and denominator.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the denominator as (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2.

Wait, perhaps I should express everything in terms of (k A^2)/(2 m c^2). Let me denote a variable, say, beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ). So, beta = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then, our expression for v²/c² is:

v²/c² = [ (k A^2) (4 m c^2 + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c^2 +k A^2 )^2

Expressed in terms of beta:

k A^2 = 2 beta m c^2

So, substitution:

Numerator:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 +k A^2 ) = (2 beta m c^2) (4 m c^2 +2 beta m c^2 )

= 2 beta m c^2 * [ m c^2 (4 + 2 beta ) ]

= 2 beta m c^2 * m c^2 (4 + 2 beta )

= 2 beta m² c^4 (4 + 2 beta )

Denominator:

(2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2 = (2 m c^2 + 2 beta m c^2 )^2 = [ 2 m c^2 (1 + beta) ]^2 = 4 m² c^4 (1 + beta )^2

So, v²/c² becomes:

[ 2 beta m² c^4 (4 + 2 beta ) ] / [4 m² c^4 (1 + beta )^2 ]

Simplify:

The m² c^4 cancels out. 2 beta (4+2 beta ) divided by 4 (1+beta )^2.

Factor 2 in numerator:

= [ 2 beta * 2 (2 + beta ) ) ] / [4 (1+beta )^2 ]

= [4 beta (2 + beta ) ] / [4 (1 + beta )^2 ]

Cancel 4:

= [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / [ (1 + beta )^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )²

But beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), so:

v²/c² = [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) * (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2

Hmm, this seems like a dead end. Maybe I should look at the answer options to see which one resembles this expression.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m ) )^2 )

Wait, denominator inside the sqrt is 1 + 1/(something squared)

Hmm, not matching what I have.

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, denominator is 1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ) inside a square root.

Wait, my expression is v squared is [ beta (2+beta) ] / (1+beta )^2, where beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Wait, let me write v as c times sqrt( [beta (2+beta)] / (1+beta )^2 )

Which is c * sqrt( [beta (2 + beta ) ] ) / (1+beta )

Hmm, let's see. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] ) / (1 + beta ) = sqrt( [ beta (2+beta) ] ) / (1 + beta )

Wait, perhaps I can factor beta:

= sqrt( beta (2+beta) ) / (1 + beta )

= sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] ) / (1 + beta )

Hmm, not seeing a clear simplification. Let me compute beta in terms of variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can manipulate the expression to match the options.

Wait, let me consider the denominator in the expression for v²/c²:

In my expression, v²/c² = [ beta (2 + beta) ] / (1 + beta )^2

Let me expand the numerator:

beta (2 + beta ) = 2 beta + beta^2

Denominator: (1 + beta )^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2

So,

v²/c² = (2 beta + beta^2 ) / (1 + 2 beta + beta^2 )

= [ beta^2 + 2 beta ] / [ (beta +1 )^2 ]

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

= [ beta (beta + 2 ) ] / (beta + 1 )^2

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can write the numerator as (beta +1)^2 -1:

(beta +1)^2 = beta^2 + 2 beta +1

So, beta^2 +2 beta = (beta +1 )^2 -1

So,

v²/c² = [ (beta +1 )^2 -1 ] / (beta +1 )^2 = 1 - [ 1 / (beta+1)^2 ]

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(beta+1)^2

Then,

v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(beta+1)^2 )

Wait, that's a cleaner expression. Let me substitute beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) + 1 )^2 )

Simplify denominator inside the sqrt:

= c sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )/(2 m c^2 ) ) )^2 )

= c sqrt( 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )/(k A^2 + 2 m c^2 ) ]^2 )

Hmm, but looking at the answer options, none of them match this directly. Wait, but let's see:

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, that's similar but not exactly the same. Let me compute:

If I have 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2, which is [ 2 m c^2/(k A² + 2 m c^2 ) ]^2.

So,

v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [ (2 m c^2 )^2 ] / (k A^2 + 2 m c^2 )^2 )

Which is same as my expression.

So, in that case, v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which matches option D. Let me look back at the options.

Option D says: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²/(2 m c^2)))^2 )

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, in our expression, v² = c² [1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 ]

Which is v = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + beta )^2 )

And beta is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So yes, option D is correct.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy conservation.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy of the system is conserved. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), the potential energy is \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all energy is kinetic, given by the relativistic kinetic energy formula:
   \[
   E = (\gamma - 1)mc^2,
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

   Equating the total energy at equilibrium to the potential energy at maximum displacement:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
   \]

2. **Solving for \( \gamma \)**:  
   Rearranging the above equation:
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]
   Let \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \beta.
   \]

4. **Simplifying for \( v \)**:  
   Taking the reciprocal and squaring:
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \beta},
   \]
   \[
   1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \beta)^2}.
   \]
   Substituting \( \beta = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing this result with the given options, it matches **Option D**:
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct expression for the maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
