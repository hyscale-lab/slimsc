Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

The question is about an astronaut from the Large Magellanic Cloud traveling to Earth in a super fast spacecraft. The spacecraft is going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long it takes from their perspective to reach Earth. The options suggest that the time might be around 70-something years, or maybe the astronaut won't survive.

Wait, so first I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh right, the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from us. Wait, no, actually, I think it's roughly 160,000 to 170,000 light-years. Let me check that—yeah, I remember it's about 163,000 light-years. So the distance d is approximately 163,000 light-years.

The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c. That's really close to the speed of light. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be less due to time dilation, I think. But wait, how does that work again?

Time dilation in special relativity is given by the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is very close to c, gamma will be a large number.

Wait, but wait a minute. From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted, right? Because in their frame of reference, the Earth is moving towards them at 0.9999998
