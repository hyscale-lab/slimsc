Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed, but here it's relativistic, so I need to consider how relativity affects it.

The problem states that it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. The potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². So the max speed would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are different.

In relativity, the total energy is gamma times m c squared. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But how does that apply here?

For a relativistic oscillator, the total energy isn't just kinetic; it's the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic. But wait, the oscillator's potential energy is still (1/2)kA², even in the relativistic case? Or does it change?

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the energy conservation. At maximum displacement (x = A), all energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

So the total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no, in relativity, the total energy E is gamma m c², which includes the rest mass. So when the particle is at rest, E = m c². When moving, it's more.

But for the oscillator, the potential energy U at amplitude A is (1/2)k A² as per Hooke's law. So at x=A, the total energy E is U plus rest energy? Or is the total energy E just the potential energy plus the kinetic?

Wait, in the classical case, E is (1/2)kA², and at the equilibrium, all E is KE. But in relativity, I think E must be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy, plus potential.

Wait, maybe the potential energy of a relativistic oscillator is different. I'm not too sure. Alternatively, perhaps
