Okay, so I've got this problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the energy levels are quantized, right? The formula given is E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), and each energy level depends on the quantum number n. Oh wait, the energy levels for a particle in a 1D box are E_n = n²E, where E is the base energy you mentioned.

But wait, these are identical particles, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Since they're spin-1/2 particles, each state can have a maximum of two particles with opposite spins. So each energy level can hold two particles.

The well is one-dimensional, so each particle's energy is determined just by its quantum number n. For four particles, I need to figure out how they fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energy, so the particles will fill the lowest available states. Let's think about how each state can hold two particles. So the first energy level (n=1) can have 2 particles. Then the next (n=2) can also have 2. But wait, we have four particles in total. Wait, n=1 holds 2, n=2 holds 2, and n=3 would be empty in ground state. But wait, n=3 would have higher energy than n=2. So the ground state is when all four are filled in the lowest two levels.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Each energy level can hold two particles. So for four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) will each hold two particles. So the total energy would be 2 times E1 plus 2 times E2. E1 is (1²)E = E, E2 is (2²)E=4E. So the ground state energy is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, but wait, the problem states that each of the four particles is in the system, so the total energy is the sum of individual energies. Oh, but wait, each particle in a certain n contributes n²E. So if two particles are in n=
