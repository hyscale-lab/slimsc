Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds: A, B, C, D. I need to figure out which one it is based on the mass, IR, and 1H NMR data provided.

Let's start by looking at the information given.

Mass Spectrometry: Molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%), and a peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, so the molecular ion is at 156, which suggests the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The peak at 158 might be an isotope, maybe with a chlorine atom. Because chlorine has a significant natural abundance, around 35Cl is about 75% and 37Cl is about 25%, so a molecule with a Cl would have molecular ions at m/z 156 and 158. Wait, but wait—if the molecular weight is 156, and the other peak is 158, which is +2, that suggests a Cl is present. Because Cl has an atomic mass of about 35, but the isotopic peaks would be 35 and 37. So for a molecule with one Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one at 156 (35Cl) and another at 158 (37Cl). The abundance of the 37Cl is about 24-25%, so the 32% abundance makes sense for the M+2 peak. So the molecule probably contains a chlorine atom.

IR Data: Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches, but since it's in that region, maybe it's an OH group. Also, a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That area is typically for carbonyl groups (C=O). The 1720 region is a bit lower than a ketone, which is usually around 1700-1750, but it's probably a carbonyl. So maybe a carboxylic acid, ester, aldehyde, or something like that.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Its structure would have a benzaldehyde ring with OH and Cl substituents. The aldehyde group would have a strong peak around 2800-2720 (stretching) and a carbonyl at ~1720? Wait, the aldehyde's carbonyl is usually around 1720, yes. But then, the OH group would be in the aromatic ring, which might be phenolic. Phenolic OHs have broad peaks around 3500-2700, which fits the IR.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid has a COOH group. The IR would show a broad peak from OH (carboxylic acid is broad around 2500-3300, but wait, the given IR is 3500-2700, which is a bit lower. Also, the carbonyl in carboxylic acid is usually around 1700, but sometimes lower if hydrogen bonded. 1720 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid; maybe it's an ester or something else.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Chloroformate is OCOCl attached to a benzene ring. The carbonyl in that would be around 1800, I think. But the IR here is 1720, so not sure. Also, phenyl chloroformate would have an O- group, maybe an ester, but I'm not certain.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Similar to B, but the substituents are in different positions. The IR would also show a carboxylic acid OH and a carbonyl. Same considerations as B.

Now, looking at the NMR data.

1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

The peak at 11.0 ppm is a singlet. That's very downfield. What gives a singlet around 11? Probably an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, no—carboxylic acids are usually broad singlets, but this is a sharp peak? Or maybe an acidic proton like phenolic OH, but in the NMR it's a singlet. Alternatively, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but sometimes can be higher. Wait, 11 is a bit high for an aldehyde, but possible. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic -OH, but that's usually a broad peak, not a sharp singlet. Wait, the 11.0 is sharp, so maybe it's a carbonyl group with adjacent protons? Or maybe it's an aldehyde proton. Let me think.

In the options, options A and D have aldehyde or carboxylic acid groups, respectively.

Wait, option B and D are benzoic acids. So they have a COOH group. The -COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but in the NMR given, it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe the 11.0 is an aldehyde proton.

Looking at the NMR shifts:

The 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H and split into a doublet, that's typical for a meta or para substitution. Wait, no, if it's a para substituent, the coupling would lead to two doublets integrating to 2 each, which is what we see. So that would suggest a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents. Wait, but in the options, let's see:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is o-hydroxy and m-chloro benzaldehyde. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). Wait, that's three substituents. So the NMR would show more peaks perhaps, unless the substituents are in a way that causes symmetry.

Alternatively, option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a benzoic acid with Cl at position 4. So the ring would have COOH at position 1, Cl at 4, and the rest Hs. So the ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. The protons on the ring would be in the ortho and para positions relative to the substituents. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, let's imagine the ring substituents. For option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the structure is:

Cl is at position 4, and COOH is at position 1. So the ring has two substituents, Cl and COOH, in the meta positions relative to each other. So the ring would have two sets of protons: those ortho to Cl and ortho to COOH, and the meta positions. Wait, but in that case, the NMR would show more than two sets of peaks.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think about the NMR for each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So that's a 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. The ring would have three substituents. The protons on the ring would be at positions 4,5,6. Let's think: positions 4 and 6 would be ortho to Cl and meta to OH. Position 5 would be meta to Cl and ortho to OH. The coupling between these could lead to more complex splitting. But the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So maybe there's some symmetry.

Alternatively, the two doublets suggest a para-substituted ring. So perhaps two substituents that are para to each other. So for option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid: the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and 3 and 5 would be meta. Wait, but in that case, the ring protons would be split differently. Let me think about the NMR.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B), the ring would have the substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). Therefore, the substituents are across from each other (para). So the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. The protons in positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and meta to Cl. The protons in positions 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. 

In the NMR, each of these sets might split into a doublet. Let's think about the coupling:

The ortho protons (2 and 6) would be deshielded more due to the electron-withdrawing COOH group. The meta protons (3 and 5) would be deshielded by Cl, which is also electron-withdrawing. So the ortho protons might be around 8.02 ppm, and the meta around 7.72 ppm. Each as doublets. That matches the NMR data.

Additionally, the 11.0 ppm peak would be the COOH proton. But wait, in carboxylic acids, the -OH proton is usually broad, but in the given data, it's a sharp singlet. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Also, the molecular ion is 156. Let's check the molecular weights.

Option B:
