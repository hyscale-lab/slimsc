Okay, so I'm trying to solve this black hole entropy question. Hmm, I remember that entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula, I think, is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's constant h-bar (ħ), gravitational constant G, speed of light c, and Boltzmann's constant k_B. Wait, but sometimes I see the formula written as S = (A)/(4 l_p^2), where l_p is the Planck length. Oh right, because l_p squared is (ħ G)/(c^3), so that would make sense.

So the first thing I need is the area of the event horizon. The event horizon of a black hole is a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius, R = 2 G M / c^2. But wait, another approach is to use the angular size given to find the radius, and then calculate the area.

The question gives the distance d = 1e10 parsecs, which is a huge distance. The angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. Wait, angular size... Oh right, the formula for the angular size is θ ≈ R / d, when θ is in radians. But since θ is given in degrees, I need to convert that first.

Let me think, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. But wait, maybe I should be more precise. Alternatively, I can use the small angle approximation where θ (in radians) ≈ R / d, but here θ is already very small, so this should hold.

So R = θ * d. But wait, d is in parsecs, and R would be in same units as θ*d. But I need to convert everything into SI units. Let's see:

First, let's compute θ in radians:

θ (radians) = 1e-17 degrees * (π radians / 180 degrees) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 ≈ 1.74533e-19 radians.

Distance d is 1e10 parsecs. One parsec is approximately 3.0857e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.0857e16 m = 3.0857e26 meters.

So R = θ * d = 1.74533e-19 rad * 3.0857e26 m. Let me compute that:

1.74533e-19 * 3.0857e26 = 1.74533 * 3.0857e7. Let me calculate that: 1.74533 * 3.0857 ≈ 5.373. So R ≈ 5.373e7 meters. Wait, 5.373e7 meters is 5.373e4 kilometers, which is 53,730 kilometers. That seems really big, but considering it's a supermassive black hole, maybe it's plausible. Wait, let me double-check the exponents: 1e-19 * 1e26 is 1e7, so yeah, 5.37e7 meters.

But wait, if R is the Schwarzschild radius, then R = 2 G M / c^2. Alternatively, I could directly calculate the area A as 4 π R^2. So let's compute A.

A = 4 π R^2 = 4 * π * (5.373e7 m)^2.

Calculating (5.373e7)^2: 5.373^2
