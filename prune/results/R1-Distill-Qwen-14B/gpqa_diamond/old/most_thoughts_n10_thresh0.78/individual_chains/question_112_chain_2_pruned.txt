Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that we have an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, not necessarily normalized.

Wait, right, before anything else, the state must be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients should be 1. So, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i). Let me calculate the squares.

The first coefficient's absolute value squared is |1+i|². That's (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Similarly, the second coefficient is (2-i), so |2 -i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1 =5. So the total squared magnitude is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). Therefore, the state is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

I think that's correct. So the state is properly normalized now.

Next, the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The operator has a matrix representation A where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, that sounds familiar. Oh, right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli X matrix has 0 on the diagonal and 1 off-diagonal, but scaled by hbar/2 here.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and their eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the spin in the x-direction. So the eigenstates of this operator are |+x> and |-x>, and we need to find the probability of measuring the electron in each of these states.

But wait, the current state is in the z-basis. So perhaps I should express |alpha> in terms of the x-basis.

Alternatively, since the given operator is proportional to X, the spin in the x-direction, the eigenvalues of this operator are plus and minus hbar/2. And the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>.

So the probabilities we're looking for are |< +x | alpha >|² and |< -x | alpha >|².

But how do I compute these inner products?

The eigenstates of the X operator are known. Specifically, |+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-x> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, yes. So I can write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+x> and |-x>, and then the coefficients' squared magnitudes will give the probabilities.

Alternatively, I can compute the inner products directly.

Let me think. So, to find the probability of measuring +x, I need to compute < +x | alpha >.

Let me write |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>.

And |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, the inner product < +x | alpha > is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| + <down| ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

Multiplying this out:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ].

Since <up|down> is zero, because they're orthogonal, those terms disappear.

So what remains is:

(1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) * 1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) * 1 ]

Factor out 1/sqrt(7):

= (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7))) [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ]

Adding the terms in the numerator:

(1 + 2) + (i -i) = 3 + 0i =3.

So < +x | alpha > = (3) / (sqrt(14)).

Wait, because sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14). So that's 3/sqrt(14).

The probability is the squared magnitude, so |3/sqrt(14)|^2 = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(7) is sqrt(14), yes.

So 3^2 is 9, and 14 is denominator. So 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says 0.64 and 0.36. 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, and 5/14 is 0.35714, which is approximately 0.36. So that would match. But let's make sure.

Wait, the other probability would be 1 - 9/14 = 5/14 ≈ 0.357, which is about 0.36.

So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the inner product.

< +x | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

That's because <up|up> is 1 and <down|down> is 1.

So the sum inside is [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7).

(1+i + 2 -i) = 3 +0i =3. So 3/sqrt(7), multiplied by 1/sqrt(2) gives 3/(sqrt(14)).

Yes, so the amplitude is 3/sqrt(14). So the probability is 9/14.

But wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 (since 9+5=14). 5/14 is approximately 0.357.

Looking at the options, option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which seems to match.

But wait, let me check the operator's average value.

The operator's matrix is given as A_ij = hbar/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So the matrix is:

[ 0    hbar/2 ]

[ hbar/2  0 ]

Which is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix. The eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

So the expectation value is < alpha | A | alpha
