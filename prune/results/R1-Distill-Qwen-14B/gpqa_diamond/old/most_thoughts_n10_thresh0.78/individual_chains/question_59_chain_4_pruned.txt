Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with pH calculations, especially when mixing different acids and bases. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with various pH values.

Hmm, right. So, first, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are present in terms of moles. Because when you mix an acid and a base, they can neutralize each other. But wait, since there are two acids and one base, it's a bit more complicated. Oh, and acetic acid is a weak acid, while HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component.

First, for CH3COOH (acetic acid). The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = Molarity * Volume. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But I'll get back to that later.

Next, HCl. It's 400 mL, which is 0.4 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, giving 0.08 moles of H+.

Now, Ba(OH)2. It's 300 mL, which is 0.3 liters. Molarity is 0.3 M. The formula for Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- per formula unit. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-.

So moles of Ba(OH)2 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix acid and base, they neutralize each other. The H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base. So I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

But wait, the H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. However, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't fully dissociate. So I can't just add the H+ from CH3COOH and HCl directly. Hmm, that complicates things because the strong acid will contribute fully, but the weak acid won't.

Wait, maybe I should approach this by first considering the neutralization between the acids and the base.

Let me think: the total H+ comes from HCl and the dissociation of CH3COOH. But since HCl is a strong acid, it will fully donate its H+. The Ba(OH)2 will provide OH- ions, which will neutralize some of the H+.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to calculate the initial H+ and OH- contributions and see if there's an excess of one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the net H+
