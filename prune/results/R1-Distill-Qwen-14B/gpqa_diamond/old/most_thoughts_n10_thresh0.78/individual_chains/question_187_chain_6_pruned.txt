Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to figure out which of these stars meet that criterion.

ESPRESSO is a spectrograph used with the Very Large Telescope (VLT), specifically the 8m telescopes at Paranal. From what I remember, spectrographs' performance depends on various factors like the brightness of the star, the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency.

I think the key here is the star's apparent magnitude. Because the S/N ratio depends on how bright the star appears to us. Brighter stars (lower apparent magnitude) will give a higher S/N, making them easier to detect.

Wait, but the question gives absolute magnitudes for some of the options. Oh right, absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 parsecs. So to find the apparent magnitude, I can use the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. Yeah, that's right because M is the absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs.

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent V magnitude and then figure out if their flux is enough to give the required S/N.

But wait, how does apparent magnitude relate to the S/N ratio? I think the S/N depends on the flux from the star. The formula for S/N might be based on the number of photons detected. The exposure time is 1 hour, which is 3600 seconds. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, but I think the S/N is proportional to the square root of the product of the flux (f), the exposure time (t), and the efficiency of the instrument.

Wait, but maybe I should think in terms of how faint a star can be for ESPRESSO to achieve S/N 10. I need to find the faintest apparent magnitude that ESPRESSO can detect in an hour.

I remember that ESPRESSO has a high spectral resolving power, but perhaps that's not the key here. The question is about the S/N per binned pixel. Binned pixels would mean that the spectrograph is combining the light from multiple pixels to increase the signal, but that might trade off spatial resolution for higher S/N.

Alternatively, maybe the ESPRESSO's sensitivity is such that stars brighter than a certain magnitude can reach S/N 10 in an hour. So I should probably find the typical limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO.

Wait, from what I recall, ESPRESSO is designed for high-precision spectroscopy, and its performance is optimized for bright stars. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact magnitude limits. Let me think about the V magnitude. The brighter the star (lower m), the better.

Wait, another approach: the signal-to-noise ratio scales with the square
