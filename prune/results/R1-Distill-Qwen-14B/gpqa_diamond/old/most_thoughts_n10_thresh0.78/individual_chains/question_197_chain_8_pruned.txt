Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure out what's going on. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and determining the final product from the options given.

First, let's look at the data provided. The IR and NMR spectra are given, so I need to analyze those to figure out the structure of compound X.

Starting with the IR data: peaks at 3400-2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, and 1450 cm-1.

IR peaks can tell us about functional groups. The 3400-2500 range usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. Since 3400-2500 is a broad range, perhaps it's an O-H stretch, like in a carboxylic acid or an ester (maybe the acid is present). But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is indicative of a carbonyl group. 1720 is a bit lower than a typical ketone (around 1720-1700 for ketones), so maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl or something like an ester or a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H peak around 2500-3300, which seems to fit the 3400-2500 range. So maybe compound X is a carboxylic acid.

But wait, the 1610 and 1450 cm-1 peaks are in the region for aromatic C=C stretching. So compound X probably has an aromatic ring.

Now the NMR data:

1H NMR peaks:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, which would be a carboxylic acid. Because alcohols typically show up around 1-5 ppm, but a carboxylic acid's O-H is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for an aromatic ring, likely para-substituted. So, two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene, maybe with two substituents in the para positions. The 8.0 ppm is probably the more deshielded protons, perhaps next to an electron-withdrawing group like a carbonyl. The 7.2 ppm would be the other set. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene with a carbonyl group attached.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet. Maybe this is a methine (CH) group next to an electronegative atom or part of a substituent. Like in a CH2CH group or similar.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, maybe another CH2 group.
- 1.
