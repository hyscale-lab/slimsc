Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, first, I remember that in relativity, velocities don't just add up normally, right? Like, if two objects are moving at high speeds relative to each other, you can't just add their speeds in the same frame. So I think I need to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity here.

The two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively. So, from the perspective of one astronaut, what's the speed of the other? Wait, maybe the question is about the relative speed between them, regardless of the frame? Or is it from the Earth frame? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the problem says "relative speed" of the system. Oh, wait, the system is both astronauts. So maybe the relative speed between them is being asked. So I should compute the velocity of one as seen from the other's frame.

So, for that, I should use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c²), where u is the velocity of one object in the Earth frame, and v is the velocity of the other in Earth frame. Wait, but wait, the direction matters. If both are moving in the positive x-direction, the relative velocity would be the difference, but considering the direction.

Wait, let's get the correct formula. The formula for the relative velocity when moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is the velocity of the second object as seen from the first's frame. Wait, no, the formula would give the relative velocity of the second object as seen from the first.

Wait, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, what's B's velocity?

Wait, no
