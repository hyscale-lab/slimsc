Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, right? It's about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h over 4π. Oh wait, h is Planck's constant, right? And S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as 0 and -i, and the second row as i and 0. So S looks like this:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

And Ay is c times S, so let me compute that. Since c is h/(4π), Ay is:

[ [0, -i*(h/(4π))],
  [i*(h/(4π)), 0] ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait, S is multiplied by c, so the entries become c multiplied by each element of S. So each element of S is scaled by c. So the (1,2) element is -i * c, and the (2,1) is i * c.

So, the matrix Ay is:

0        -i c
i c       0

Now, the question is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. But the question is a multiple-choice, so maybe I don't need to compute everything. Hmm, but let me think about the steps.

First, to find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So, the matrix (Ay - a I) would be:

[-a,        -i c ]
[ i c,      -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c) = a² - ( (-i c)(i c) )

Wait, let me compute the product (-i c)(i c). Wait, (-i) * i is (-i^2) which is -(-1) = 1. So (i * (-i)) is -i^2 = 1. Wait, wait, maybe I should compute each term.

Wait, the product is (-i c) * (i c) = (-i) * (i) * c². Because when you multiply the (1,2) and (2,1) elements, it's (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) c² * (1), since it's the product of off-diagonal elements.

So (-i) * i is (-i²) which is -( -1 ) = 1. So the product is c² * 1.

So determinant is a² - (c² * 1) = a² - c² = 0.

So, a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c.

Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues would be h/(4π) and -h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h, and real parts are ±h/(4π). But wait, our eigenvalues are real, right? Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian? Wait, because it's part of angular momentum operator, which should be Hermitian if it's an observable.

Wait, S is a matrix. Let me check if Ay is Hermitian. The matrix Ay has elements 0, -i c in (1,2), and i c in (2,1). So the conjugate transpose of Ay would swap the off-diagonal elements and take the conjugate. The (1,2) element is -i c. Its conjugate is i c. The (2,1) element is i c, so its conjugate is -i c. So the conjugate transpose would have [0, i c; -i c, 0], which is the same as Ay because swapping 1,2 and 2,1 gives the same as original. Wait no, the original Ay is [0, -i c; i c, 0], so the conjugate transpose would be [0, i c; -i c, 0]. Which is not the same as Ay. So wait, is Ay Hermitian? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no. Wait, because S is given as:

First row 0, -i
Second row i, 0

So S is the matrix [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

What's the conjugate transpose of S? It would swap the elements and conjugate them. So the (1,2) becomes i and (2,1) becomes -i.

Wait
