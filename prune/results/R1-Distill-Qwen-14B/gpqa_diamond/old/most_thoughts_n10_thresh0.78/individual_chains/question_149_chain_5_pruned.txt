Okay, so I have this NMR and LC-MS question about a peptidic compound. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we expect. Also, the coupling can't explain it because it's ruled out. So what could cause duplicate peaks for the same proton?

Hmm, in NMR, if you have equivalent protons, they usually show as a single peak. But if the environment is not equivalent, you get separate peaks. But wait, the alpha protons are typically adjacent to the carbonyl, right? Like in an amide. So maybe the issue is with the stereochemistry.

Wait, the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass. Same mass implies same molecular weight, so same molecular formula. So it's not a different compound, like a fragment or a byproduct. What else could cause two peaks with same mass? Maybe diastereomers or enantiomers.

Wait, enantiomers have the same mass and same chromatographic retention times (if using a chiral column, but maybe the LC here isn't chiral). But in that case, if the LC isn't chiral, enantiomers would co-elute, giving a single peak. So the presence of two peaks suggests something else. Unless the LC is achiral and the two enantiomers are eluting together. Wait, but the question says two clearly defined peaks of equal intensity. Oh, so if it's a racemic mixture, but the LC can't separate them because it's achiral, so you wouldn't see two peaks. Or wait, maybe the LC is a chiral column, which would separate enantiomers. But the question says it's a small peptidic compound; perhaps it's not chiral, but wait, peptides can have multiple stereocenters.

Wait, but the problem says that the NMR has two peaks for the same alpha proton. So in the NMR, the same proton is split into two. That makes me think about diastereotopic protons. Diastereotopic protons are non-equivalent because of the molecule's symmetry. So if you have a molecule with a plane of symmetry, then the two alpha protons would be equivalent, but if the plane is broken, they become non-equivalent. But wait, the integral sums to 1H, so perhaps each peak is integrating to about 0.5H each, making a total of 1H.

But why would that happen? Let's think about diastereomers. If the compound is a mixture of diastereomers, each diastereomer would have different NMR spectra. For example,
