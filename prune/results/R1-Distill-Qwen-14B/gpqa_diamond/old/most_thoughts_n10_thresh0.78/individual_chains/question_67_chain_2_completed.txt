Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. The state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The question is about finding the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ.

Hmm, wait, but each electron's orbital angular momentum quantum number is 1, right? So for each L1z and L2z, the possible eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, +ħ, because l=1 gives m = -1, 0, +1, but scaled by ħ. So m here is actually the eigenvalue divided by ħ. So for each, m can be -1, 0, +1, corresponding to eigenvalues of -ħ, 0, +ħ.

The coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m is -1.

When we measure L1z and L2z, each will give one of their possible eigenvalues. The joint probability is the probability that both measurements give -ħ.

First, I think I need to find how the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> can be expressed in terms of the product states of individual states.

Wait, the coupled state is an eigenstate of L² and Lz, where L is the sum of L1 and L2. So the state |1,1,2,-1> is an eigenstate of L² (with eigenvalue ħ² l(l+1) = 2*3 ħ² = 6ħ²) and Lz (eigenvalue mħ = -1ħ).

But when we're looking for the probability of getting specific values for L1z and L2z, we're dealing with the product basis states. Because L1z and L2z are each individual operators, the state has to be expanded in terms of the product of eigenstates of L1z and L2z.

So the given state is a combination of states where each electron is in a particular m1 and m2 state. The total m is m1 + m2.

The coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> needs to be expressed as a sum of |m1, m2> states, such that m1 + m2 = m = -1.

Wait, but the state with l=2 and m=-1 is a specific combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But I'm not exactly sure how the expansion works. Oh right, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients come into play here. So the state |l1 l2; L, M> is a linear combination of |l1 m1> |l2 m2> states where m1 + m2 = M.

In this case, M is -1. So possible (m1, m2) pairs are:

- m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
- m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1
- m1 = -2? Wait, no, because l1 and l2 are 1 each. So m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, so the possible m1 and m2 combinations that sum to -1 are:

(-1, 0) → sum -1
(0, -1) → sum -1
That's it, because m1 can't be less than -1 or greater than +1.

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for this is something I think I remember.

The general formula for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient is:

|l1 m1> |l2 m2> = sum_{M} [ < l, M | l1 m1; l2 m2 > ] * |l M>

But here, I need the inverse process: expanding |l=2, M=-1> in terms of the product states.

The coefficients for |2, -1> would be the combination of product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = c1 |m1=-1, m2=0> + c2 |m1=0, m2=-1>

I think the coefficients c1 and c2 are sqrt( ( (something) ) ) but I'm not sure about the exact values. Oh wait, for two p orbitals (l1=l2=1), the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2 and m=-1.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I can find the expansion by considering how the states are built up.

The coupled state |2, -1> is constructed from the product states with m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for each term is sqrt( (something) ).

Wait, perhaps I can look up the exact expansion for this case. But since I'm trying to think through this, let me recall that for two angular momenta adding up to l=2, the state |2, m> is a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = m.

For m = 2: only |1,1> → coefficient √(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write down the possible states contributing to each m.

But perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact coefficients. Wait, the problem is asking about the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ. So that would correspond to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because m1 is the eigenvalue for L1z divided by ħ. So if L1z is -ħ, m1 is -1. Similarly for L2z.

So in that case, the product state would be |m1=-1, m2=-1>, but wait, that's m1 + m2 = -2, which is less than M=-1. So that product state isn't part of the coupled state |2, -1>, because the M is -1. So |m1=-1, m2=-1> has M = -2, which doesn't match. Therefore, the coefficient for that product state in the expansion of |2, -1> must be zero.

Wait, but is that correct?

Wait, the coupled state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible |m1, m2> are (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1). The |m1=-1, m2=-1> would give m=-2, which is different from M=-1, so it isn't included.

Therefore, the expansion of |2, -1> in terms of |m1, m2> states includes only the two terms I mentioned earlier. So the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not present in the expansion.

Wait, but wait. The coupled state |2, -1> is an eigenstate of Lz with eigenvalue -ħ. Each L1z and L2z are operators acting on their respective particles. The state |m1=-1, m2=-1> would contribute to the coupled state |2, -2>, right? Because m1 + m2 = -2.

So in the expansion of |2, -1>, the product states that contribute are only those with m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the state |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1> are the only ones in the expansion of |2, -1>.

Thus, the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1> is not part of |2, -1>, which means that the amplitude for that product state is zero.

Wait, but that's the joint state we're looking for. The problem is asking for the probability of both being -ħ. That corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, so the product state |m1=-1, m2=-1>.

Since this product state isn't part of the expansion of |2, -1>, the coefficient is zero. Therefore, the probability is zero.

So the joint probability is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the possible measurement outcomes.

The state |1,1,2,-1> is a superposition of states where the individual m's sum to -1. So when you measure L1z and L2z, the possible outcomes are pairs (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1. So possible outcomes are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1).

So when you make the measurements, you can't possibly get (-1, -1) because that would sum to -2, which doesn't match the M of -1 in the coupled state.

Therefore, the probability of both being -ħ is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$, where $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $l = 2$, and $m = -1$. The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$. 

Each electron's orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l = 1$, so the possible eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ are $-\hbar$, $0$, and $+\hbar$. Measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ corresponds to $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which would result in a total $m = m_1 + m_2 = -2$. However, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ is an eigenstate of $L_z$ with $m = -1$, meaning it is a superposition of product states where $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. 

The valid product states contributing to $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ are:
- $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle$
- $|m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle$

The product state $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle$ (corresponding to $m = -2$) is not part of the expansion of $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Therefore, the coefficient of this product state in the expansion is zero, and the probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.

Thus, the joint probability of obtaining $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is:
