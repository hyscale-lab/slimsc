Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. They're asking for the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But particles moving at relativistic speeds would have their lifetimes appear longer due to time dilation. So we need to calculate the Lorentz gamma factor here.

The formula for gamma is γ = E / m, where E is the total energy and m is the rest mass. Oh wait, E here is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 goes into 27 about 7.91 times. So gamma is approximately 7.91.

Then, the dilated lifetime τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 8e-16 * 7.91 is about 6.328e-15 seconds. That's the mean lifetime as observed in the lab frame.

Now, the particle will travel some distance before decaying. The distance L is velocity v multiplied by lifetime τ. But v is approximately the speed of light c for relativistic particles. So L ≈ c * τ.

The speed of light is about 3e8 meters per second. So L = 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s. Let me compute that. 3e8 * 6.328e-15 = 1.8984e-6 meters. So about 1.9e-6 meters.

But wait, the question is about the minimum resolution needed
