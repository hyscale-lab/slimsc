Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says something about not being able to know both the position and momentum of a particle exactly. Oh right, the product of the uncertainties has to be at least on the order of Planck's constant over 2π, but sometimes people just use hbar (which is h/(2π)) for approximation.

The question says the electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nm. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, how does uncertainty in position relate to energy? Oh, right, because if you know the position uncertainly, that affects the momentum, which in turn affects energy. So first, I should find the uncertainty in momentum, Δp, then relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle for position and momentum is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, but sometimes people approximate it as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. So, I'll use that as an approximation to estimate Δp.

Wait, let me double-check. The exact form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty is when it's equal to that. So I can calculate Δp as approximately ħ/(2Δx).

Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy. Because energy is related to momentum via the kinetic energy formula, which is E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. But wait, since we're dealing with uncertainties, I think that the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately (Δp)²/(2m). Because E is a function of p, so the uncertainty in E would come from the uncertainty in p.

So putting it all together:

Δp ≈ ħ / (2Δx)

Then,

ΔE ≈ (Δp)^2 / (2m)

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, constants:

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Mass of electron, m, is about 9.1
