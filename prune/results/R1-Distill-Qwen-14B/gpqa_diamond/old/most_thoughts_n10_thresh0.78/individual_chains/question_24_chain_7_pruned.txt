Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I think I can work through it. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the problem says that there's this equimolar mixture X of two liquids. When treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y, which is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, I remember that a disproportionation reaction is when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. Like, for example, when a molecule splits into two different products where one gains electrons and the other loses them.

Mixture X decolorizes bromine water. Wait, substances that decolorize bromine water are typically those with unsaturated bonds, like alkenes or alkynes. They undergo addition reactions with bromine. So mixture X has compounds with double bonds or triple bonds.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction. The result is mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Oh, right, so that means the products of this reaction don't have those unsaturated bonds anymore. Probably they've been hydrogenated or something.

Wait, but the problem says that Y is formed via a disproportionation. So maybe the starting material in X is something that can disproportionate upon hydrogenation. Oh wait, hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen, so maybe the starting material is a compound that can split into two different products when hydrogen is added.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are alkenes or alkynes, which after hydrogenation become alkanes. But how does that lead to a disproportionation? Oh, wait
