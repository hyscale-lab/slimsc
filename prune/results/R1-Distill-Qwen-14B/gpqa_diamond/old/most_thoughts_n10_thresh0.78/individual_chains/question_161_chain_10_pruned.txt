Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the mean free path of gas molecules in an electron microscope. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

So, Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to create an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to get rid of as many gas molecules as possible because, in electron microscopy, having gas around can cause problems like scattering of the electron beam, reducing image quality. 

But even after doing that, some gas particles are still present, as detected by a mass spectrometer. So the vacuum isn't perfect, but it's really good. Mike measures the mean free path of these gas molecules and calls it λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. 

But then, when he starts the electron beam, he notices something odd. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2 instead of λ1. The sample compartment's temperature is the same, so temperature isn't a variable here. Hmm, why would the mean free path change when the electron beam is on?

I remember that the mean free path depends on the pressure and the cross-sectional area for collisions. Oh wait, the formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(n * σ), where n is the number of particles per unit volume and σ is the collision cross-section. Or another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d^2 * p), where d is the diameter of the molecules, T is temperature, and p is pressure. Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but I think these are related.

In the initial state, the gas is just there, and the mean free path is λ1. But when the electron beam is turned on, the beam has a high energy because the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV. That means the electrons are moving really fast. So the electrons are hitting the gas molecules. 

Wait, but the mean free path is from the gas's perspective, right? The gas molecules moving around. But when the electron beam is on, maybe the gas molecules are being ionized or excited by the electrons. Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas molecules to move differently, like heating them or altering their density.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam is a source of energy. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize. If the gas becomes ionized, the molecules (or ions) would have different behavior. For example, charged particles might interact more strongly with the electron beam, but how does that affect their collisions with each other?

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam increases the effective pressure because the electrons are scattered by the gas, which might change how the gas molecules behave. Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is already ultra-high vacuum, so maybe the change is minimal. Or perhaps the electrons are causing the gas to heat up, increasing the temperature locally, which would affect the mean free path because temperature influences the average speed of the gas molecules. But the problem states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, so maybe that's not it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about why the mean free path would change. The initial λ1 is calculated without the electron beam. Once the beam is on, perhaps the gas molecules are being bombarded by electrons, causing them to move more, or perhaps the electron beam creates some sort of electric field that affects the gas.

Alternatively, maybe the electron beam causes the gas to become partially ionized. If the gas becomes a plasma, the mean free path would change. But wait, at ultra-high vacuum, the conditions are such that the gas is in the molecular flow regime, meaning the mean free path is much larger than the dimensions of the chamber. So, the electron beam is moving through this low-density gas.

Wait, if the gas is being ionized by the electron beam, the ions might have a longer mean free path because they're charged and might interact differently. Or perhaps the number of collisions between gas molecules decreases because ions interact differently, maybe via Coulomb forces instead of just elastic collisions. That could change the cross-section σ.

Alternatively,
