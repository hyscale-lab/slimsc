Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both exhibit eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations show that in system_1, the two stars have radial velocity (RV) variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. I need to find the mass ratio.

Wait, wait. So I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity method is used to find the masses. The stars orbit their common center of mass, and their velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. Oh right, because the center of mass is the balance point. So the more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude.

So, for each system, the two stars have velocity amplitudes that are inversely proportional to their masses. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B has v_B, then mass_A / mass_B = v_B / v_A.

But wait, the mass function in binary stars... Hmm, the mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses. But in this problem, since we're given the velocity amplitudes, I think we can find the mass ratio.

Let me think. In a binary system, the ratio of the masses (m1/m2) is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes (v2/v1). So m1/m2 = v2/v1.

In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So system_1's star A has 10 km/s, star B 5. So the mass ratio (m1/m2) would be 5/10 = 1/2. So m1 is half of m2 in system_1. So total mass of system_1 is m1 + m2 = (0.5 m2) + m2 = 1.5 m2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because in a binary system, each star's velocity is inversely proportional to their masses. So if m1 is bigger, then v1 is smaller. So in system_1, m1 is the mass of the star with 10 km/s? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The more massive star has a smaller velocity. So if star A has a velocity v1 and star B has v2, then m_A / m_B = v_B / v_A.

So in system_1, velocities are 10 and 5. Let's say star A has v1=10, star B v2=5. Then m_A/m_B = 5/10 = 0.5. So m_A is half of m_B.

So mass of system_1 is m_A + m_B = 0.5 m_B + m_B = 1.5 m_B.

Similarly, for system_2: velocities are 15 and 10. Let me call them v1=15 and v2=10. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3.

Therefore, m1 = (2/3) m2. So the total mass is m1 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

Wait a second, wait. But let me think again. System_1's total mass is 1.5 m_B, where m_B is the mass of the second star. But in system_2, the total is (5/3) m2. Hmm, but how does that relate to the masses of the systems?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the combined mass. Let me try another approach. In each binary system, the sum of the masses is (m1 + m2), and each star's mass is proportional to the inverse of their velocity.

Alternatively, the mass function for each star is m1 sin^3 i / (1 + q)^2, where q is m2/m1. But maybe that's complicating things since we don't have inclination angles. Wait, but since both systems are eclipsing, their inclination is close to 90 degrees, so sin i is about 1. So the mass function is simplified.

But maybe I can find the mass ratio directly. Let's consider each system's stars.

In system_1:

v1 = 10 km/s (star 1)
v2 = 5 km/s (star 2)

So the mass ratio m1/m2 = v2 / v1 = 5/10 = 0.5
