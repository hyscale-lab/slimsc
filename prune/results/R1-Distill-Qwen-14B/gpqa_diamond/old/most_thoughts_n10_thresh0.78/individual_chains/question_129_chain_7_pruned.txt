Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me take it step by step.

The problem is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's break down the given information.

First, the reaction scheme:
1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints:
a) When compound A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E's IR is around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are A to D, each a cyclic ketone with various substituents.

Let me start by recalling what each reaction does.

1. Reaction of A with HCN to form B. HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone (since IR shows a peak around 1750, which is typical for ketones), then B would be the cyanohydrin, where the HCN adds to the carbonyl, creating a secondary alcohol and a CN group attached.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that A has an aldehyde group. But the IR of 1750 is more in line with a ketone, as aldehydes are a bit higher, like around 1710 or so. So perhaps A is a ketone.

So step 1: A (ketone) + HCN → B (cyanohydrin). So B would have an alcohol and a nitrile group adjacent to each other.

2. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Pd is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So what would that do? The nitrile group (CN) would be reduced to an amine (CH2NH2?), but wait, no, more accurately, nitrile (RCN) upon hydrogenation with H2 and Pd typically becomes an amine, but wait, the exact conditions matter. Alternatively, if using H2 and Lindlar catalyst, it's for alkynes, but here for nitriles, which usually (with H2 and a catalyst like Ni or Pd) would reduce to amines. Wait, no, wait: Wait, nitriles reduce to amines? Or to amines via intermediates. Alternatively, nitriles can be reduced to primary amines (RCH2NH2) under certain conditions. Or wait, maybe the correct product is an amine group.

Wait, but the starting compound is a cyanohydrin. Let's think about structure. Suppose A is cyclopentanone. Then B would be cyclopentane-1,2-diol cyanohydrin? No, wait, wait. When a ketone reacts with HCN, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. So for cyclopentanone, reacting with HCN would give (1R,2R)-cyclopentane-1,2-diol with a nitrile group on one of the carbons. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the product is a secondary alcohol and a cyanide group attached to the same carbon.

Wait, no, wait. When a ketone (like cyclopentanone) reacts with HCN, it adds across the carbonyl, forming a new carbon-carbon bond. The product would have a cyanide group attached to the carbon where the carbonyl was, and an -OH group on the adjacent carbon. So for cyclopentanone, the product would be a five-membered ring with a hydroxyl group on one carbon and a nitrile group on the adjacent carbon, but wait, no: The addition would be to the carbonyl carbon. So the product would be a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon, making a geminal group. Wait, that's not possible because the carbonyl is O, so adding HCN would have the H attaching to the carbonyl C, and the CN attaching to the adjacent C. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The general reaction of ketones with HCN is the addition of HCN to the carbonyl group, forming a cyanohydrin. The structure would look like R2C(OH)CH2CN? No, maybe not. Let me think of acetone (propan-2-one). When it reacts with HCN, it forms 2-hydroxypropanenitrile, which is (R configuration) CH3C(OH)H-CN. So the product would be a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon. Wait, that can't be. Oh, wait, no— the carbonyl group (C=O) in acetone is CH3-CO-CH3. When HCN adds, the H adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the CN adds to the adjacent carbon. So the product would be CH3-C(OH)H-CN. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think: The addition of HCN to a ketone would add H to the carbonyl carbon and CN to the adjacent carbon? Or does the CN add to the carbonyl carbon?

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let's correct that. The mechanism is that the HCN adds to the carbonyl group, which is a nucleophilic addition. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, and the H would come from somewhere else, perhaps from the HCN. So for a ketone R2CO, adding HCN would give R2C(OH)CN. So the product would have an alcohol (OH) on the same carbon as the CN group, making it a gamma-hydroxy nitrile. Hmm, perhaps I should look it up, but since I can't, I'll proceed.

Wait, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. So in the case of cyclopentanone, reacting with HCN would give a cyclopentane ring where the carbonyl C becomes a CH(OH) group and the adjacent C gets a CN group. But I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps moving forward, the key is that after reduction, the nitrile becomes an amine.

So step 2: B is treated with H2 and Pd. Hydrogenation of nitrile groups typically yields primary amines. Wait, but if the nitrile is in a ring, perhaps it's a bit different. So if B is a cyclopentane ring with an OH group and a CN group on adjacent carbons, then upon hydrogenation, the CN would become a CH2NH2 group. Or perhaps, wait, maybe it's a CH2NH2 group. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile reduces to an amine. Wait, no, the reduction of nitriles (RCN) with H2 and a catalyst like Pd gives RCH2NH2, a primary amine. So the nitrile becomes a CH2NH2 group.

Wait, so in compound B, the structure would have a -CN group and an -OH group on adjacent carbons. After reduction, the CN becomes CH2NH2, so the structure would have a -CH2NH2 group and an -OH on adjacent positions.

Wait, but then in compound C, we have an amine and an alcohol group. Then, when compound C is treated with HNO2 (nitrous acid), what happens?

Hmm, HNO2 is typically used for diazotization of a
