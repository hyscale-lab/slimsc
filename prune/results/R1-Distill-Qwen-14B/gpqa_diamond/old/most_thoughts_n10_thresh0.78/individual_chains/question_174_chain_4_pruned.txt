Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my nuclear physics, but let me try to break this down.

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M, which is 0.99M. 

The question is about the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using a classical, non-relativistic approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Wait, I remember that in nuclear fission, the fragments are subject to relativistic effects because they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light. So, using classical mechanics (like Newtonian physics) might not be accurate here. The problem is asking about the difference between the relativistic and classical T1 values.

Let me outline the steps I think are needed:

1. Determine the rest masses of the two fragments.
2. Find their velocities using conservation of momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission is zero, so the fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.
3. Calculate the kinetic energy relativistically and classically for the more massive fragment.
4. Find the difference between these two kinetic energies.

Starting with step 1: The sum of the rest masses is 0.99M. Let me denote the masses as m1 and m2. Given that m1 = 2 * m2.

So, m1 + m2 = 0.99M
But since m1 is twice m2, substituting:
2m2 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99M
So, m2 = 0.99M /3 = 0.33M. Then m1 is 0.66M.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait, because the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV, but the sum of the rest masses after fission is 0.99M. But I think the rest mass energy here is M c squared, but since we're dealing with masses, perhaps we can treat M as the rest mass (in units where c=1, so E=McÂ² is 300 GeV).

Wait, but for the rest masses of the fragments, their sum is 0.99 of the initial mass. So, the initial mass is M, and after fission, the total rest mass is 0.99M. So, the rest mass energy would be 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

But wait, in terms of mass, the initial nucleus is M, and the total rest mass after is 0.99M, so the rest mass has decreased, which means energy was released (like binding energy or something).

But the problem is about kinetic energy, so that's separate.

So,
