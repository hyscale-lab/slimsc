Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but wait, no, that's when you have a bromoalkane reacting with it. Or wait, maybe it's something else. Oh right, I think red phosphorus is used in the reaction where a carboxylic acid is converted into an acid bromide or something, but wait, wait—actually, wait. Another thought: when an acid is treated with PBr3 or another phosphorus reagent, it's usually to form an acid bromide. But what about with red phosphorus and HI?

Oh wait, I've heard about the reaction where a carboxylic acid is converted into an acyl iodide. So, the reaction is likely the conversion of the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) into an acyl iodide (-COI). Because when you have a carboxylic acid reacting with excess HI and red phosphorus, the -COOH becomes -COI. Right, because the phosphorus acts as a catalyst or maybe helps in activating the acid for the reaction with HI.

So, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break that down. The main ring is cyclohexene, so a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are a formyl group (CHO) at position 2 and a vinyl group (CH2CH2, but wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-; so CH2-CH2?), wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Also, the ring has a double bond at position 3, so the ring is cyclohex-3-ene.

So the structure is cyclohexene with a double bond between C3 and C4 (assuming numbering from 1 to 6). Then, at position 2 (next to the double bond), there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the substituents are: position 2: CHO; position 5: CH2CH2 (but wait, that can't be right). Oh wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH2-CH2?), but wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5.

Wait, perhaps drawing it would help, but since I can't draw, I'll imagine it. The main ring is cyclohexene with double bond between C3 and C4. At C2, there's a formyl (CHO) group attached. At C5, there's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached.

So, the molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid. So, the carboxylic acid is at which position? Oh wait, the name ends with carboxylic acid, so the -COOH is on the cyclohexene ring. The numbering would have the COOH group at position 1, perhaps. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, then a formyl group is at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5.

So the molecule is: a cyclohexane ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. At C1 is the COOH group. At C2 is a CHO group. At C5 is a CH2-CH2 group? No, wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, so CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is more like a six-membered ring with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. C1 has COOH. C2 has CHO. C5 has CH2-CH2? No, no, it's a vinyl group, which is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent. So the substituent is a CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond, so perhaps CH2=CH- attached to C5.

So when this compound reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, the reaction converts the carboxylic acid (-COOH) into an acyl iodide (-COI). So the product would be 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid becoming 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

Wait, but let me think again. So when a carboxylic acid (RCOOH) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it forms the corresponding acyl iodide (RCO-I). So yes, in this case, the COOH becomes COI.

So the product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide. Now, the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of this product.

The index of hydrogen deficiency (also called degrees of unsaturation) is calculated using the formula: IHD = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbon atoms, H the hydrogens, X halogens (like I), and N nitrogens (if any). Since there's no N here, we can ignore it.

So I need to calculate the IHD of the product. Let's figure out the structure of the product first.

The starting material is cyclohexene, which has one double bond (so IHD from the ring). Then, the substituents are a formyl (CHO) and a vinyl (CH2=CH-) group. The COOH group becomes COI.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the ring has a double bond (from cyclohexene), so that's one double bond. The formyl group (CHO) is a carbonyl, which is another double bond. The vinyl group (CH2-CH2 with a double bond) is another double bond. And the COOH group is a carbonyl as well.

Wait, but in the starting material, the COOH group has a carbonyl (O=C-OH). So, when it becomes COI, it's O=C-I. So that's still a carbonyl group. So the number of double bonds in the product would be the same as in the starting material, except any that change.

Wait, let's count the double bonds in the starting material:

1. Cyclohexene: one double bond (C3-C4).
2. Formyl group: CHO has a double bond (C=O).
3. Vinyl group: CH2=CH- attached, so another double bond.

So that's 3 double bonds in the starting material. The COOH group is also a carbonyl (C=O), so that's another double bond. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring, so that's one. Then, the substituents: the formyl (CHO) is a carbonyl, that's another. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is another. The COOH group is a carbonyl as well. So that's four double bonds in the starting material.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the starting material is cyclohex-3-ene, which is one double bond. Then, the substituents:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO), which is a carbonyl group (another double bond).
- At position 5: vinyl (CH2=CH-), which is another double bond.
- The carboxylic acid group (-COOH) has a carbonyl (C=O), which is another double bond.

So that's four double bonds in total.

When it reacts with HI and red phosphorus, the COOH becomes COI. The structure of the product would be 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide. So the substituents are still present: formyl, vinyl, and the COI.

So the product has:

- Cyclohexene ring: one double bond.
- Formyl group: another double bond.
- Vinyl group: another double bond.
- COI group: which is C=O, so another double bond.

So four double bonds in the product as well. So the IHD would be 4.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the structure of the product. The product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

So the substituents are:

- At position 2: CHO (double bond).
- At position 5: CH2=CH- (double bond).
- The ring has a double bond (cyclohexene, one).
- The COI group: O=C-I (double bond).

So that's four double bonds. So IHD is 4?

Wait, but the question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product. So what's the formula for IHD?

IHD is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, in this case, X is the halogen, which is iodine. So in the product, we have iodine as part of the COI group, which is a substituent on the ring.

So I need to count the number of carbons, hydrogens, and iodines in the product.

Let me find the molecular formula of the product.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10 (since cyclohexene is C6H10).
- Substituents: formyl (CHO) which adds C and O, vinyl (CH2=CH-) which adds C and H, and COOH which adds O and H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count the atoms.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The formula of the starting material:

Cyclohexene: 6 C, 10 H (since cyclohexene is C6H10).

Add formyl group (CHO): adds 1 C and 1 O, and removes 1 H (because it's attached to the ring). So now, 7 C, 9 H, 1 O.

Add the vinyl group (CH2=CH-): that's 2 C and 3 H (since CH2=CH- has 2 C and 3 H; when attached, one H is lost as a bond to the ring). Wait, no: the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so it's two carbons and three hydrogens in the substituent. So:

Adding two C: 7 becomes 9 C.

Adding three H: 9 → 12 H.

Wait, but wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So each substituent is a CH2=CH- group, which is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So the group is CH2=CH-, which has 2 C and 3 H.

So, the substituents:

Original cyclohexene: 6 C, 10 H.

Add formyl group (CHO) at C2: adds 1 C and 1 O. The H in the formyl is part of the CHO group, but since it's attached to the ring, we lose a hydrogen. So cyclohexene plus CHO: 7 C, 9 H.

Add vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at C5: adds 2 C and 3 H. So now, 7+2=9 C, 9+3=12 H.

Add COOH group: COOH is -COOH. The formula for that group is C=O and OH. So the COOH group has 2 O's.

Wait, but the COOH is a substituent on the ring as well. So the structure is cyclohex-3-ene with substituents at 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), and 5 (vinyl).

Wait, perhaps it's better to count the molecular formula.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Each substituent:

- COOH is -COOH: adds 2 O, 2 H (since it's -COOH, which is -C(O)OH), but attached to the ring, so it's one more O and two H?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the molecular formula.

The cyclohexene ring is C6H10.

Adding formyl (CHO) at position 2: replaces a H with CHO. So, the formula becomes C7H9O.

Adding vinyl (CH2=CH-) at position 5: replaces a H with CH2=CH-. So adds 2 C and 3 H (since it's CH2=CH-; when attached, one H is lost from the ring). So now, C7+2=9 C, H9+3=12 H, O=1.

Adding COOH at position 1: Replaces a H with COOH. COOH is (COOH) has formula C=O-OH. So, it adds one C, two O, and two H. So adding COOH: C9+1=10 C, H12+2=14 H, O=1 + 2=3 O.

Wait, but wait, the COOH is -COOH, so it's (COOH), which is -C(O)OH. So the substituent adds one C, two O, and two H (since OH contributes one O and one H, and the C=O contributes one O). So the formula of the starting material is C10H14O3.

Because:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

CHO adds 1 C, removes 1 H: C7H9O.

CH2=CH- adds 2 C and 3 H: C9H12O.

COOH adds 1 C, 2 H, and 2 O: C10H14O3.

So the starting material is C10H14O3.

When it reacts with excess HI and red phosphorus, the COOH is converted to COI. So the substituent changes from -COOH to -COI. So in the product, the COOH becomes COI.

So the formula changes: the O from COOH is replaced by I. So the oxygen count decreases by one, and iodine increases by one.

So the product is C10H14O2I.

Wait, because COOH is O2 (since it's -COOH), and COI is O (since it's -COI). So O goes from 3 to 2 (since COOH contributed 2 O, and COI contributes 1 O). I'm not entirely sure about that; perhaps I should think again.

Wait, COOH is -C(O)OH. So the substituent is -C(O)OH: that's one C, two O (one from the C=O, one from the -OH). When it becomes COI, it's -C(O)I. So the substituent is -COI: one C, one O, and one I.

So in the starting material, the substituent COOH adds 1 C, 2 O, and 2 H (from the OH group, but when attached, one H is lost from the ring). Hmm, maybe counting the H is more complicated, but for molecular formula purposes, I think the product's formula is C10H14O2I.

Wait, the starting material is C10H14O3 (since COOH adds 1 C, 2 O, and 2 H, but one H is lost from the ring), but I'm not 100% certain. Let's see:

Molecular formula of starting material: Let's think of it as:

The base is cyclohexene (C6H10). Then, substituents:

- CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O, and removes one H. So C7 H9 O.

Then, CH2=CH-: adds 2 C and 3 H (but when attached, one H is lost, so net 2 C and 3 H added? Or net 2 C and 3 H -1 H because attached to the ring? Hmm, perhaps the vinyl group brings 3 H but replaces one, so net 2 H added? Or perhaps it's better to think that the ring originally has 10 H, adding substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula of the starting material is C10H14O3.

When COOH becomes COI, the oxygen count decreases by 1 (from 3 to 2) because COOH has two O in the substituent, and COI has one O.

So the product's formula is C10H14O2I.

Wait, but wait: COOH has the formula -COOH, which is O2. When it becomes -COI, it's O1. So the overall formula for the product would be C10H14O2I.

Wait, the starting material's formula is C10H14O3. When COOH becomes COI, the substituent changes from O2 to O1 and adds I (iodine). So the product's formula is C10H14O2I.

Wait, but the starting material had O3. So COOH contributes O2 (from the COOH group), the cyclohexene has O from the double bond? No, the double bond is C=C, no O. So the starting material's O comes from the substituents: formyl (O1), vinyl (no O), COOH (O2). So total O3.

In the product, formyl is still O1, COI is O1, vinyl has no O. So total O2.

So the product's formula is C10H14O2I.

Now, to calculate the IHD.

The formula is C10H14O2I.

But for IHD calculation, we only consider C, H, X (halogens), and N. O is ignored because it doesn't contribute to the hydrogen deficiency. Wait, no. The formula for IHD is:

IHD = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the formula for IHD is (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2, where X is the number of halogens, and N the number of nitrogens. So in this case, X is 1 (one iodine).

So, let's plug in the numbers:

C = 10.

H =14.

X =1.

N=0.

So:

IHD = (2*10 + 2 -14 -1 +0)/2.

Calculating numerator: (20 +2) =22; 22 -14=8; 8-1=7.

7/2=3.5.

Wait, that can't be. Because IHD must be an integer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula for IHD is:

IHD = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Wait, is that correct? Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for the maximum number of H in an alkane is 2C +2. Each degree of unsaturation (IHD) reduces H by 2. Each ring or double bond is one IHD, each triple bond is two IHD, etc. Each halogen (X) adds one H (since, for example, CH2Cl has one more H than CH3). Wait, no, actually, the presence of halogens doesn't affect the IHD calculation because each X is considered as a substituent without changing the number of H in terms of the underlying structure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (2C +2 - H + X - N)/2, because each X (halogen) adds a H equivalent. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Each ring or double bond contributes 1 IHD. Each triple bond contributes 2, etc. The formula for the number of H is 2C + 2 - 2*(IHD) + X - N.

Wait, another way: the formula is IHD = (2C + 2 - H + X - N)/2.

Wait, let me check a source. I remember that each halogen adds 1 H equivalent. So, in the formula, it's (2C + 2 - H + X - N)/2.

So for our case:

C=10.

H=14.

X=1.

N=0.

So:

IHD = (2*10 + 2 -14 +1 -0)/2.

Let's compute that.

20 +2 =22.

22 -14=8.

8+1=9.

9/2=4.5.

Hmm, that's not possible because IHD must be an integer.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Another approach: the standard formula for IHD is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So X is subtracted. Let me try that.

So:

(2*10 +2 -14 -1 +0)/2.

20+2=22.

22-14=8.

8-1=7.

7/2=3.5.

Hmm, still not an integer. That's a problem. So maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (2C +2 - H + X - N)/2.

In that case, for our case:

(20+2 -14 +1 -0)/2 = (22-14+1)/2 = (9)/2 =4.5.

Still not integer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula. Maybe I miscalculated the H.

Let me re-examine the product's structure.

The product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

So, the structure would have:

- The cyclohexene ring (C6H10), but with substituents.

Each substituent will replace an H on the ring.

So, the structure has:

- A cyclohexene ring: 6 C, 10 H (but with substituents, H will be less).

But let's count the H.

Each substituent on the ring is a group attached to one carbon. Each substituent reduces the H count by one because it replaces a ring H.

So, the ring has substituents at positions 1, 2, and 5.

Each substituent reduces H by one. So, the ring's H would be 10 (original) minus 3 substituents =7 H on the ring.

But wait, the substituents themselves have their own Hs.

So let's list all the substituents and their H:

1. At position 1: COI group. The structure is O=C-I. This group doesn't contribute any H (as it's a carbonyl).

2. At position 2: CHO group. CHO has one H attached to the C (the formyl H).

3. At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-). This group has two H on the CH2 and one on the CH (but wait, the structure is CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the structure is CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the two carbons.

Wait, the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So the group contributes how many H? The CH2 has two H, and the CH has one H. So total of three H in the vinyl group.

So substituent H:

- COI: 0 H.
- CHO: 1 H.
- Vinyl: 3 H.

So substituent H total: 4 H.

Now, the ring H: as the ring has substituents at three positions, the ring H would be 10 (original) -3 substituents =7 H.

So total H in the molecule: 7 (ring) +4 (substituents) =11 H.

Wait, but what about the iodine? It doesn't contribute any H.

Wait, let's recount the H.

The product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

Structure:

- The cyclohexene ring has a double bond (so that's one ring double bond, which contributes one IHD).
- Substituents:
   a. Position 1: COI: O=C-I. No H here.
   b. Position 2: CHO: CHO has one H.
   c. Position 5: CH2=CH- as a substituent. The substituent is CH2-CH2 with a double bond. So the structure is CH2-CH2, but with a double bond in between. So, the substituent is CH2=CH- attached. So the substituent has two CH2 groups but with a double bond. Wait, no, the substituent is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between them, making it -CH2-CH2- with a double bond. No, wait, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2-? No, wait, no: the vinyl group is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the structure is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups? No, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2- but with a double bond between the two carbons, so it's CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So the substituent is CH2=CH-, which has three H: two on the CH2 and one on the CH.

So substituents contribute:

CHO: 1 H.

CH2=CH-: 3 H.

COI: 0 H.

So substituent H: 4.

The ring itself, without substituents, has 10 H. Each substituent replaces one H, so 3 substituents → 10 -3=7 H on the ring.

Other H in the molecule: any in the substituents.

So total H: ring (7) + substituents (4)=11.

Wait, but let me think about the cyclohexene ring. The ring has six carbons, one double bond (so it's a cyclohexene), and three substituents. So the ring's structure would have:

Each substituent replaces one H. So the ring has (6*2 - 2) H? Wait, no. Wait, for a cyclohexene ring (C6H10), each substituent replaces one H. So with three substituents, the ring has (10 -3) =7 H.

So the total H in the molecule is 7 (ring) + substituent H (4) =11.

Wait, but the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 5. So the ring's H is 7.

Now, the molecular formula is:

- C: The starting material was formyl (C), vinyl (C), and COOH (C). Let's count:

Cyclohexene: 6 C.

CHO: 1 C.

Vinyl: 2 C.

COI: 1 C.

Total C: 6+1+2+1=10 C.

H: 11.

O: COI has 1 O. CHO has 1 O. COI comes from COOH which had 2 O, but now COI is one O. So, O is 1 (from CHO) +1 (from COI) =2 O.

I: 1.

So the formula is C10H11O2I.

Wait, that's different from my previous calculation. Because earlier I thought H was 14, but now it's 11.

But wait, this can't be. Let me think again: the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its formula would be C10H14O3 as I thought earlier. After reaction, it becomes C10H11O2I.

Wait, how? Because the reaction replaces the -OH in COOH with I. So the COOH is -COOH (COOH has two O and two H: one from the -OH and one from the carbonyl O). When it's converted to COI, the structure is -COI. So the -OH becomes -I, so the H from the -OH is lost.

So the starting material has:

COOH: -COOH → O2, H2, but attached to the ring, so one H is part of the ring structure.

After reaction, COI: O1, H0 (since I is attached directly to C).

So the starting material has H: let's see, for COOH, it's -COOH, which contributes two H (the -OH's H and the H in the formyl group? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of molecular formulas.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the molecular formula approach without getting into substituent H counts.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Its formula is:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

CHO: +1C, +1O, -1H (since it's attached to the ring).

Vinyl: +2C, +3H (but since attached, -1H → net +2C, +2H).

COOH: +1C, +2O, +2H (but attached, so -1H → net +1C, +1O, +1H).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me sum it up.

The starting material has:

Cyclohexene: 6 C, 10 H.

CHO: 1 C, 1 O, 1 H.

Vinyl: 2 C, 3 H.

COOH: 1 C, 2 O, 2 H.

But each substituent replaces a H on the ring. So the total H would be 10 (from cyclohexene) minus 3 substituents →7 H. Then, adding the substituent H:

CHO: 1 H.

Vinyl: 2 H (since the vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so the substituent has 3 H but since one is attached to the ring, it contributes 3 H? Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is CH2=CH-; it has two H in the CH2 and one H in the CH. So, three H in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's H is 10 (ring) -3 substituents (since each substituent replaces one H) →7 H on the ring. Plus substituent H: CHO has 1 H, vinyl has 3 H, COOH (before reaction) has 1 H (from -OH). So substituent H: 1 +3 +1=5 H.

Total H: 7 +5=12.

So starting material's H is 12. O is from CHO (1), COOH (2), and the ring's double bond doesn't add O. So O=3.

So formula is C10H12O3.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was C10H14O3. Hmm. Not sure.

Then, when the reaction occurs, the COOH becomes COI. So the formula changes as follows:

- COOH (O2, H1) → COI (O1, H0).

So, the product's formula would be:

C: 10.

H: 12 (starting) -1 H from COOH + 0 (since COI has no H in that position) →11 H.

O: 3 (starting) -1 (from COOH) →2 O.

I: 0 →1 I.

So product formula is C10H11O2I.

So C=10, H=11, O=2, I=1.

Now, applying the IHD formula:

IHD = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

In this case, X=1 (iodine), N=0.

So,

(2*10 +2 -11 -1 +0)/2 → (22-12)/2 →10/2=5.

Wait, that gives IHD=5.

But that can't be right because the product has the same number of rings and double bonds as the starting material, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me recount the double bonds and rings in the product.

Product structure:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 double bond →1 IHD.
- Formyl group (CHO): 1 double bond →1 IHD.
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-): 1 double bond →1 IHD.
- COI group (O=C-I): 1 double bond →1 IHD.

So that's four double bonds, giving IHD=4. But according to the formula, IHD is 5. So there's a discrepancy here.

Hmm. Where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula. Let's recount the product's molecular formula.

The product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

The formula should be:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

CHO: +1 C, +1 O, -1 H.

Vinyl: +2 C, +3 H, -1 H (so +2 C, +2 H).

COI: +1 C, +1 O, -1 H (since COOH had -OH, which becomes I).

Wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is C10H12O2I.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the product's structure and count the IHD again.

The product has:

- Cyclohexene ring (1 double bond).
- Formyl group (CHO, 1 double bond).
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-, 1 double bond).
- COI group (O=C-I, 1 double bond).

So that's four double bonds → IHD=4.

But according to the formula calculation, IHD=5.

So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the formula approach is correct, and I'm miscalculating the structure.

Wait, perhaps the product has an additional ring or double bond that I'm not accounting for.

Wait, the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 double bond). The substituents are CHO (1 double bond), vinyl (1 double bond), and COOH (1 double bond). So the starting material has four double bonds, giving IHD=4.

After reaction, the product has the same substituents except COOH becomes COI. So the product still has four double bonds.

Wait, but when COOH (which has a carbonyl group) is converted to COI, which also has a carbonyl group. So the number of double bonds remains the same.

So the product should have four double bonds → IHD=4.

But according to the formula, IHD=5.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula calculation.

Let me recalculate the formula:

Product formula is C10H11O2I.

Applying IHD formula:

IHD = (2*10 +2 -11 -1)/2 → (22-12)/2 →10/2=5.

Hmm. So according to the formula, IHD is 5, but according to the structure, it's 4. There's a contradiction here.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula approach is not considering something. Let's think again about the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is a ring substituent, but the ring itself is a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are CHO, vinyl, and COI. Each has their own double bonds.

Wait, maybe I should recount the IHD in the product.

Product's structure:

1. Cyclohexene ring (1 double bond) →1 IHD.
2. CHO group (1 double bond) →1 IHD.
3. Vinyl group (1 double bond) →1 IHD.
4. COI group (1 double bond) →1 IHD.

That's 4 IHD.

So the formula calculation might be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the product has more H. Let me try to recount.

The product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

Each substituent:

- CHO at C2: has 1 H (formyl H).
- Vinyl at C5: has 3 H (two from CH2 and one from CH).
- COI at C1: has no H.

The cyclohexene ring has 6 C, with three substituents, each replacing a H. So the ring has 10 -3=7 H.

So total H: 7 (ring) +1 (CHO) +3 (vinyl) =11 H.

So formula is C10H11O2I.

Using IHD formula:

(2*10 +2 -11 -1)/2 → (22-12)/2=5.

But structure says 4.

I must be making a mistake in the formula somewhere. Maybe the formula approach is not the best way.

Alternatively, perhaps the product doesn't have the same substituents. Wait, when COOH becomes COI, does any other change occur? No, only the COOH group is converted.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscounting the substituents' effect on the H.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of the ring. No, the vinyl is a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the product has a different structure. Let me think again.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. When the reaction converts COOH to COI, the structure becomes 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

So, the substituents are still present: formyl, vinyl, and COI.

Each substituent contributes to the IHD as follows:

- Cyclohexene (ring): 1.
- CHO: 1.
- Vinyl: 1.
- COI (from COOH, which has a carbonyl → same as before: 1.

So four double bonds, so IHD=4.

But according to the formula, it's 5.

This is confusing. Maybe I should think differently.

Perhaps the problem is that the formula approach counts the iodine as a halogen, so X=1. But perhaps in the product, the iodine is part of the substituent and doesn't add any H.

Wait, the formula is C10H11O2I.

So, using the formula:

IHD = (2*10 +2 -11 -1)/2 → (22-12)/2=5.

But the structure says four.

So where is the fifth degree of unsaturation?

Wait, perhaps the product isn't just four double bonds. Maybe there's another double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the COI group is part of a larger structure, but I don't think so. The COI is a substituent on the ring.

Wait, the product has:

- One ring double bond (cyclohexene) →1.
- One formyl double bond →1.
- One vinyl double bond →1.
- One COI double bond →1.

So four.

But the formula suggests five. So perhaps I made a mistake in the H count.

Let me recount the H:

The product is C10H11O2I.

So, H=11.

So,

IHD = (2*10 +2 -11 -1)/2 = (22-12)/2=5.

But the structure says four. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the ring has another double bond. Let me think: is the ring itself a bicyclic structure? No, it's just cyclohexene.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexene ring is part of a fused ring, but no, the name doesn't suggest that.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of the ring. But no, it's a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is part of a ring. No, it's a substituent.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a ring in the substituents.

No, the substituents are CHO, CH2=CH-, and COI.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group is part of the ring as a bridge, but no, the name says 5-vinyl, which is a substituent.

I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

If the product has four double bonds, IHD is 4.

But according to the formula, IHD=5. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the product's formula is C10H12O2I.

Wait, how?

If the product has 12 H, then:

IHD = (2*10 +2 -12 -1)/2 → (22-13)/2=9/2=4.5. Still not integer.

Wait, perhaps the product's formula is C10H13O2I.

Then,

IHD=(20+2-13-1)/2=(22-14)/2=8/2=4. That works.

So IHD=4. Which aligns with the structure.

So where did I go wrong earlier?

Perhaps the product's H is 13.

How?

Let me recount.

The product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

Structure:

- Ring: C6H10 → with substituents at 1,2,5.

Each substituent replaces a H on the ring. So ring H:10-3=7.

Substituent H:

- CHO: 1 H.
- Vinyl: 3 H.
- COI: 0 H.

Total substituent H:4.

So total H:7+4=11.

But if the product's formula is C10H13O2I, then H=13.

So perhaps I'm missing two H somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the COI group is -COI, which is O=C-I. So the C is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to I. So no H there.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't remove H from the COOH group. Let me think about the reaction.

The reaction is converting -COOH to -COI. The formula for COOH is -C(O)OH, which has 2 O and 2 H (the O from the carbonyl and the OH group). When it becomes COI, it's -C(O)I. So the H from the OH is lost.

So, the starting material's COOH group contributes 2 H (the O from the carbonyl and the OH), but in the product, it's only O from the carbonyl. So the H count decreases by one.

So, starting material H:12 → product H:11.

But then, why does the formula suggest IHD=5?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the product's formula. Let me recount the product's molecular formula.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Its formula is C10H14O3.

Reaction: COOH → COI. So, O decreases by 1 (from 3 to 2), I increases by 1 (from 0 to 1), H decreases by 1 (from 14 to 13). Wait, why?

Because COOH has two H in the -OH group and one H from the ring (since it's attached). When it becomes COI, the -OH (H) is lost, and the I is added. So, H decreases by 1.

So, product formula: C10H13O2I.

So, with C=10, H=13, O=2, I=1.

Now, IHD:

IHD = (2*10 +2 -13 -1)/2 → (22-14)/2=8/2=4.

Which matches the structure's IHD of 4.

So I must have made a mistake earlier in the H count. The product's H is 13, not 11.

So why?

Because perhaps the substituents contribute more H.

Let me recount substituent H:

- CHO: 1 H.
- Vinyl: 3 H.
- COI: 0 H.

Total substituent H:4.

Ring H: 10 (original) -3 substituents →7.

Total H:7+4=11. But the product formula is C10H13O2I.

So where do the other 2 H come from?

Ah, perhaps I forgot that the COI group is attached to the ring, which may have a hydrogen elsewhere.

Wait, no. The COI group is -C(O)I, which doesn't contribute any H.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds H elsewhere.

Wait, when the carboxylic acid is converted to acyl iodide, the reaction is:

RCOOH + HI → RCOI + H2O.

Wait, no. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is typically used to convert carboxylic acids to acyl iodides. The reaction is:

RCOOH + P + HI → RCOI + PHO.

So the H in RCOOH is lost as H2O, perhaps. So the product RCOI has one less H than RCOOH.

But in terms of the overall formula, the product loses two H (from the -OH group and another H from the ring?), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is indeed C10H13O2I, which gives IHD=4.

So, the correct answer would be 4. But looking at the options, the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Wait, the options don't have 4. Hmm.

Wait, that's a problem. The options don't include 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the product doesn't have four double bonds. Let me think again.

The starting material has:

- cyclohexene (1 double bond).
- formyl (1).
- vinyl (1).
- COOH (1).

Total 4 →IHD=4.

After reaction, COOH →COI, which has a carbonyl (1). So the product still has four double bonds.

So IHD=4.

But the options don't have 4. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction causes the loss of a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the reaction of the carboxylic acid with HI and red phosphorus leads to some other change, like the formation of a ketone or something else. But I think it's just converting the acid into an acyl iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product isn't as I thought. Maybe the vinyl group is part of a conjugated system that changes.

Wait, perhaps the product loses a double bond. For example, if the vinyl group is hydrogenated. But no, the reaction conditions are with HI and red phosphorus, which is for converting the acid to acyl iodide. It shouldn't affect the vinyl group, which is a substituent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions (excess HI) lead to some other reaction, like addition to the double bonds. But I don't think excess HI would add to the vinyl group or the ring's double bond under these conditions. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is typically for converting carboxylic acids to acyl halides, without affecting other double bonds.

So the product should have the same number of double bonds as the starting material.

So IHD=4.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction conditions. What if the reaction cleaves the carboxylic acid into something else, like a ketone or an aldehyde?

Wait, no, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts carboxylic acids to acyl iodides. For example, acetic acid becomes acetyl iodide.

So the product remains as an acyl iodide, so the carbonyl group is preserved.

So IHD=4.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's IHD is different.

Let me recalculate the starting material's IHD.

Starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Structure:

- Cyclohexene: 1 double bond →1 IHD.
- CHO: 1 → total 2.
- Vinyl: 1 → total 3.
- COOH: 1 → total 4.

So IHD=4.

After reaction, IHD remains 4.

But the options don't have 4. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps the product doesn't have the same substituents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction with HI and red phosphorus also leads to the opening of the cyclohexene ring. But that's unlikely, as HI and red phosphorus typically don't do that under these conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more complex. Wait, perhaps the ring's double bond is involved in the reaction. But I don't think so because the reaction conditions are for converting the acid to acyl iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a different structure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the product is a diiodide, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is eliminating a molecule, like water, leading to a change in the structure. But no, the reaction is substitution, not elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is C10H14O2I.

Wait, if H=14, then IHD=(20+2-14-1)/2=(22-15)/2=7/2=3.5. Still not integer.

Alternatively, H=15: IHD=(22-16)/2=6/2=3.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product has a different structure, and I'm miscounting the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane ring, not a cyclohexene. So the ring's double bond is lost.

Wait, but why would that happen? The reaction conditions are for converting the acid to acyl iodide, not for hydrogenation.

So, perhaps the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond.

So, the ring remains a cyclohexene (1 IHD).

Hmm. I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B)3, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the starting material. Let's calculate its IHD.

Starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Molecular formula: C10H14O3.

IHD = (2*10+2 -14 -0)/2 → (22-14)/2=8/2=4.

So IHD=4.

After reaction, formula becomes C10H13O2I.

IHD=(22-13-1)/2 →(8)/2=4.

So IHD remains 4.

But the options don't have 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't converting the acid to acyl iodide but to something else. For example, maybe it's undergoing a dehydration.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the elimination of a molecule, leading to a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, but I thought the reaction is substitution, not elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the structure. Let me imagine the structure again.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (CHO), and 5 (vinyl).

So, the ring has a double bond between C3 and C4.

The substituents don't affect the ring's double bond.

After reaction, the substituents are at the same positions.

So, the product has the same substituents, same double bonds.

Thus, IHD=4.

Hmm. Since the options don't have 4, perhaps the correct answer is not present. But that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the product's IHD is 3.

Wait, what if the product loses a double bond?

If the product has three double bonds, IHD=3.

How?

Perhaps the vinyl group is hydrogenated. But under the reaction conditions, with red phosphorus and excess HI, perhaps the vinyl group reacts.

Wait, but HI is a good reducing agent. Maybe the vinyl group is hydrogenated.

Wait, the reaction conditions: red phosphorus and HI. If there's excess HI, perhaps the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) undergoes hydrogenation.

In such a case, CH2=CH- would become CH2CH2 (but that's not possible as it's CH2CH3).

Wait, but that would require H2, which is not present. Alternatively, maybe the HI adds to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group undergoes addition with HI.

If the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) reacts with HI, it would form CH2I-CH2I? Or perhaps a vicinal diiodide.

Wait, but that's more of an addition reaction.

Wait, the starting material has a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached to the ring. If HI adds to it, it would become CH2I-CH2I, but that's not likely under the given conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions cause the vinyl group to add HI, converting the double bond into a single bond with two I atoms.

But that would change the structure, potentially reducing the IHD.

But I'm not certain about this. If the vinyl group's double bond is converted into a single bond with iodine substitution, then that would remove one IHD.

So, if the product has:

- Cyclohexene (1 IHD).
- CHO (1).
- COI (1).
- Vinyl group with no double bond →0.

So IHD=3.

Which would make the answer B)3.

But why would the vinyl group react under these conditions? The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI, which is usually for converting carboxylic acids to acyl iodides. The vinyl group is an electron-rich area, so perhaps it reacts with HI.

Wait, but in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, the conditions are acidic. So perhaps the vinyl group reacts, leading to the addition of HI across the double bond.

In that case, the vinyl group would become a single bond with two I atoms. Alternatively, perhaps it adds HI, forming a diiodide.

But the reaction conditions are for the acid, which is at the 1 position. So perhaps the main reaction is only the acid being converted, and the other substituents remain unchanged.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group remains unchanged.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is B)3.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the product's IHD is 3.

Wait, another approach: let's calculate the IHD for the product from the formula.

If the product's formula is C10H13O2I.

IHD = (2*10 +2 -13 -1)/2 → (22-14)/2=8/2=4.

Thus, IHD=4.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has more H than I thought. Let's recount the starting material's formula.

Starting material: 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

It's a cyclohexene ring (C6H10) with substituents.

Each substituent:

- CHO: adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 H (since CHO has one H).
- Vinyl: adds 2 C, 3 H (but since attached, one H is lost → net +2 H).
- COOH: adds 1 C, 2 O, and 2 H but attached, so one H lost → net +1 H.

So, starting material:

C:6 +1 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) =10 C.

H:10 (cyclohexene) -3 substituents (each replaces one H) =7. Plus substituent H:

CHO:1.

Vinyl:3.

COOH:1.

Total H:7 +1+3+1=12.

O: from CHO (1) + COOH (2) =3.

So formula: C10H12O3.

After reaction, COOH →COI.

So, H decreases by 1 (from 12 →11).

O:3 →2.

I:0 →1.

So product formula: C10H11O2I.

Now, IHD:

(2*10 +2 -11 -1)/2 → (22-12)/2=5.

But structure suggests four double bonds.

So I'm back to the same problem.

I think I must have made a mistake in the formula approach. Perhaps the correct IHD is 3.

Wait, perhaps the product's formula is C10H14O2I.

Which would give IHD= (22-14-1)/2= (22-15)/2=3.5. No.

Alternatively, C10H15O2I: IHD=(22-15-1)/2=6/2=3.

So IHD=3.

But why would the product have 15 H?

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is B)3.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 4, but it's not an option. Since the options don't have 4, perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps the product has an additional ring or double bond I'm not counting.

Alternatively, perhaps the vinyl group is part of a ring, making it a bicyclic structure, but that's not indicated by the name.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcounting the double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group is a substituent that doesn't contribute an IHD because it's attached to the ring.

No, the formyl group (CHO) has a double bond, so it contributes.

I'm stuck. Given the options, I'll have to choose the closest possible.

But looking back, the product's structure has four double bonds. So IHD=4, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't convert the COOH group but does something else. For example, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation, leading to a loss of the COOH group.

But the question says the product is obtained when the acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The reaction I'm familiar with is converting the acid to acyl iodide, not decarboxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the COOH to COI, but also the ring's double bond is reduced. But I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to a geminal diiodide, but that doesn't fit.

I think I'm stuck. The only way to proceed is to pick the option that best fits the structure's IHD of 4, but since that's not present, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product's formula is C10H14O2I.

So, H=14.

IHD=(22-14-1)/2= (7)/2=3.5.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is C10H16O2I.

IHD=(22-16-1)/2=5/2=2.5.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is C10H18O2I.

IHD= (22-18-1)/2=3/2=1.5.

No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product's formula is C10H16O2I.

Wait, let me think: if the product's formula is C10H16O2I, then IHD=(22-16-1)/2=5/2=2.5.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's formula is C10H18O2I.

IHD= (22-18-1)/2=3/2=1.5.

No.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Given the options, the closest is B)3, but I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the reaction removes a double bond from the starting material. Let me recount the starting material's IHD.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The substituents are CHO, vinyl, and COOH.

Each contributes a double bond.

So IHD=4.

After reaction, IHD=4.

But options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the product's index, which is 5. Because in the product, the COI group has a double bond, and the other substituents, plus the ring.

Wait, the product has:

- cyclohexene (1).
- formyl (1).
- vinyl (1).
- COI (1).

So four. But the formula says 5. So I'm stuck.

I think the correct answer is 4, but since it's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's IHD is 5.

Wait, let me recalculate:

Cyclohexene:1.

CHO:1.

Vinyl:1.

COOH:1.

Total:4.

So starting IHD=4.

Product IHD=4.

But options don't have 4.

Thus, perhaps the correct answer is 3, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the product's IHD is 3. How?

If one double bond is lost. Perhaps the ring's double bond is lost.

But why would that happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions cause the ring to hydrogenate. But I don't think so. Because the reaction with HI and red phosphorus is for the acid, not the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has a different structure.

Wait, perhaps the product is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide.

Which has four double bonds.

Thus, IHD=4.

Since the options don't include 4, perhaps the answer is not present. But that's not likely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent analysis.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting material's IHD is 3.

Wait, no, it's 4.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Perhaps I should conclude that the product's IHD is 3, and the correct answer is B.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 3, because the product has three double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the COI group doesn't contribute a double bond because it's a substituent.

No, COI has a double bond within the carbonyl.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with the formula calculation, which gives IHD=5, but that's option C.

But that doesn't align with the structure.

Wait, perhaps the formula approach is correct, and the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the product has an additional ring or a triple bond.

But the product doesn't have a triple bond.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here.

I think I'll have to conclude that the IHD is 3, so the answer is B.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. The reaction converts the carboxylic acid (-COOH) group into an acyl iodide (-COI), leaving the rest of the molecule unchanged. The starting material and product are analyzed as follows:

### Structure of the Starting Material
The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, contains:
1. A cyclohexene ring with one double bond (C3-C4).
2. A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, contributing one double bond.
3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5, contributing one double bond.
4. A carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1, contributing one double bond.

Thus, the starting material has **4 double bonds**, giving it an IHD of **4**.

### Structure of the Product
The product, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic iodide, is formed by replacing the -COOH group with -COI. The product retains all the structural features of the starting material:
1. A cyclohexene ring with one double bond.
2. A formyl group (CHO) with one double bond.
3. A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) with one double bond.
4. An acyl iodide group (-COI) with one double bond.

Thus, the product also has **4 double bonds**, suggesting an IHD of **4**.

### Formula Analysis
The molecular formula of the starting material is **C10H14O3**, and the product is **C10H13O2I**. Using the IHD formula:

\[
\text{IHD} = \frac{2C + 2 - H - X + N}{2}
\]

For the product:
- \( C = 10 \),
- \( H = 13 \),
- \( X = 1 \) (iodine),
- \( N = 0 \).

\[
\text{IHD} = \frac{2(10) + 2 - 13 - 1}{2} = \frac{22 - 14}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]

The formula confirms an IHD of **4**.

### Discrepancy with Options
