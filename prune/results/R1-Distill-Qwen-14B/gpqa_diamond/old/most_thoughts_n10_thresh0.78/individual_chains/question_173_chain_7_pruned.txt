Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in energy, so I think I need to use that principle.

The problem states that an electron is moving at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its location (Δx) is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, 0.1 nm is 0.1 nanometers, which is 1e-10 meters. So Δx = 1e-10 m.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But sometimes it's approximated as Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2, so maybe I can use that for this calculation. Alternatively, I've heard it's sometimes written with just ħ, but I'm not sure. Wait, I think the exact form is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, so maybe when they say 'minimum uncertainty', we'll take the equality, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). But I'm not 100% certain if I should use 2Δx or just Δx. Wait, no, the principle is that the product is at least ħ/2, so the minimum uncertainty in momentum would be ħ/(2Δx). So I'll go with that.

So first, let me calculate Δp. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.05457e-34 J·s. So ħ ≈ 1.05e-34 J·s.

So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10). Let's compute that denominator: 2 * 1e-10 is 2e-10. So 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24. 1.05/2 is about 0.525, so 0.525e-24 J·s/m. Which is 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, let me double-check the units. Oh right, because p is in kg·m/s, so that's correct.

Now, the uncertainty in momentum is Δp ≈ 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. But I need the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, how do I connect Δp to ΔE?

I think energy is related to momentum via the kinetic energy formula. Since the electron is moving at a high speed (2e8 m/s), but wait wait... I should check whether relativistic effects are significant. The speed v is 2e8 m/s, which is 20% of the speed of light (since light is 3e8 m
