Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me some parameters: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance, and the options are A to D with some numbers in meters.

Wait, mean decay distance. I remember that particles decay, and the mean lifetime is related to their decay width. But for a resonance like a meson, which is a boson, I think the decay width Γ is connected to the particle's lifetime τ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Oh right, τ is approximately ħ divided by Γ. Because the uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, so for Γ (which is ΔE) multiplied by τ is about ħ, so τ ≈ ħ/(Γ). 

But wait, Γ is the total decay width. So yeah, τ = ħ / Γ. Once I have the lifetime, I can find the mean decay distance by multiplying the velocity v by the lifetime τ. So distance L = v * τ.

But wait, the velocity v depends on the energy of the particle and its mass. Oh, right, because particles moving at relativistic speeds. The energy E is the total energy, so it's gamma times m c squared. So gamma = E/(m c²). Then, the velocity v can be found using beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Or maybe it's easier to calculate beta as (p c)/E, since p is the momentum.

Wait, another approach: the mean decay length is given by L = c * τ * beta gamma. Oh, since
