Okay, so I have this question about astronomy and redshifts. Let me try to think this through. The question is about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that these clouds absorb specific wavelengths of light, like the Lyman-alpha line.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms. Oh right, that's in the ultraviolet range. But ground-based telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs that light. So the only way to observe this absorption is if the wavelength shifts into the visible spectrum due to redshift.

Redshift (z) relates the observed wavelength (λ_observed) to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). So if the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms, and we need it to be visible in optical wavelengths, which I think start around 4000 Angstroms or maybe even higher? Or wait, optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, and 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength has to be somewhere in this range, say 4000 to 7000 Angstroms.

So the formula is λ_obs = 1216 * (1 + z). We need λ_obs >= 4000 Angstroms, because that's the lower end of what optical telescopes can see (since UV is blocked). So set up the equation: 1216*(1+z) >= 4000.

Let me solve for z. Divide both sides by 1216: (1+z) >= 4000/1216.

Calculating 4000 ÷ 1216. Let me do that. 1216 *3 = 3648. 4000-3648=352. 352/1216 is 0.289 approx. So 3.289. So (1+z) >= 3.289. So z >= 2.289.

Wait, but wait—am I setting the lower limit correctly? Because the question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimum z where the absorption line is just entering the visible range. So the smallest z for which the line is just visible is when λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms.

So z is approx 2.289. Looking at the options, let's see: option C is 2.4, option D is 1.9. Hmm, 2.289 is close to 2.3, so the lower limit would be approximately 2.3. So the minimum redshift is just above that. So the options probably have the closest higher value.

Wait, but wait another thing. The question says "estimate the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected." So the Lyman-alpha would be at 1216*(1+z). What if the observed wavelength is in the optical range, which is longer than 4000 Angstroms. So if the observed wavelength is longer than 4000, then z is higher than (4000/1216)-1.

But another thought: perhaps the problem is assuming that the Lyman-alpha line must be in the optical window that ground-based telescopes can observe. So the maximum redshift would be when the Lyman-alpha is at the upper end of the optical, but wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, no, the question says what's the lower limit on redshift so that the clouds can be detected. So if the cloud is at lower redshift, the absorption line is in UV, which we can't see from ground. So to be detected, the line must be shifted into the optical, so z has to be high enough. So the lower limit on z is when the Lyman-alpha is just entering the optical range.

Wait, so when z is such that λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms. So solving for z: 1+z = 4000/1216 ≈ 3.289. So z ≈ 2.289, which is about 2.29. So the minimal z is approximately 2.3. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 which
