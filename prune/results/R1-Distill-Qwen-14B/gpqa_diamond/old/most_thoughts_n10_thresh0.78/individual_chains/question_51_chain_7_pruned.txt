Alright, so I have this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out. Okay, the question is about finding the net potential energy of a system where a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm.

Wait, let me read it again. The setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of the system. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with potential energies in electrostatics, we often consider the work done in assembling the charges. But wait, since the sphere is conducting and grounded, that might change things. Oh right, a grounded conducting sphere means that any excess charge will reside on the surface, and the potential on the surface is the same as the ground. Also, the sphere being grounded might affect the induced charges.

Let me think. When a charge q is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges will redistribute. But because the sphere is grounded, the potential on its surface must be zero, right? So the sphere will have induced charges such that the potential on its surface is zero. That means the potential at the surface due to both the charge q and the sphere's own charges is zero.

Wait, but how does that affect the potential energy? Potential energy in a system of charges usually involves the work done to bring the charges together. Alternatively, sometimes you can compute it by considering the potential each charge creates at the location of the other.

But in this case, the sphere is a conductor, so the charges on it will adjust. Let me think about the method. Oh, I remember something about image charges. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges can be considered as an image charge inside or outside the sphere depending on the situation.

Wait, the sphere is grounded, so any induced charge would flow to ground, but wait, noâ€”wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the sphere is a conductor, so it's an equipotential. When you bring a charge near it, the charges on the sphere redistribute, creating an induced charge such that the potential on the surface is zero. But since the sphere is grounded, any excess charge would be neutralized by the ground. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, when a conductor is grounded, it's connected to the Earth, which is at zero potential. So any excess charges on the conductor will go
