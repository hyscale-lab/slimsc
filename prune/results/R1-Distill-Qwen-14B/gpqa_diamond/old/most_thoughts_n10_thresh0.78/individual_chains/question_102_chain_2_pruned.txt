Okay, so I'm trying to solve this science question about a ligand-receptor pair and a genetic construct. Hmm, let's see. The question is a bit detailed, but I'll break it down.

First, the setup: They've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their developmental fate, so they're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember that bicistronic means it has two ORFs, so two genes in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element, which I think allows internal ribosome entry, so both genes can be expressed.

Then there are these loxP and lox2272 cassettes. The ligand has a stop in a loxP cassette between itself and mCherry, and the receptor has a stop in lox2272. I think this is about using Cre recombinase to excise the stop cassettes, allowing the proteins to be expressed.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and did a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which is a loading control, so that's working. But when they crossed the mouse model to SOX10-Cre mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal under confocal microscopy. The green would come from eGFP, so the receptor isn't expressing, or maybe the fusion is not working.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about the expression in the mouse model, so I'm not sure how that affects the Western blot and fluorescence. Maybe not.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. That could prevent proper localization or detection. But the Western blot uses total proteins, which include all lysed cells, so maybe the amount would still show up. Unless the stop cassette wasn't excised, but the blot showed the actin loading, implying the proteins were expressed.

Option C: Missing enhancer for ligand and receptor. The CBA promoter is a strong promoter, but if the enhancer is missing, maybe the genes aren't expressed. But the Western blot detected the proteins, so perhaps the expression is working. Unless the enhancer is needed for proper expression in specific cells.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. If the ORF is not correctly in frame, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. So if the stop cassette wasn't removed, the receptor might not be expressed. Alternatively, if the frameshift caused a premature stop codon, the eGFP wouldn't be made.

Wait, the vector is bicistronic. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. So when Cre is active, it would excise the loxP and lox2272 stops. SOX10-Cre is a transgenic mouse that expresses Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells. So in the offspring, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

In the Western blot, they saw signals proportional to actin, which I think refers to the total proteins. But if the eGFP isn't expressed, the green fluorescence wouldn't be seen. So why isn't eGFP being expressed?

Looking back at the vector setup: The ligand ORF is followed by a stop in a loxP cassette. Then comes mCherry. The receptor ORF is after an IRES; it's followed by a stop in a lox2272 cassette and then eGFP.

When Cre is introduced, it should recognize loxP and lox2272 sites. So in the construct, excising the loxP-stop-loxP would allow the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as a fusion? Or maybe just ligand alone. Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, so when the loxP is excised, the ligand would be expressed, and then mCherry is after, but since the stop is removed, maybe ligand and mCherry are co-expressed as separate proteins? Or perhaps the ligand is expressed as a fusion with mCherry? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', then a stop in loxP cassette, then mCherry. So when Cre excises the loxP, the ligand ORF is expressed, and the stop is removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed, but maybe separately. Similarly, the receptor has an IRES, so it's under the control of its own ribosome. The lox2272 cassette after the receptor's ORF has a stop; so when Cre excises that, the receptor is expressed, and eGFP would also be expressed as a separate ORF.

Wait, but does the eGFP come right after the stop in lox2272, or is it part of the same ORF as the receptor? The question says the receptor ORF is at the 3' and fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. Oh, so the receptor is expressed as a fusion protein with eGFP at the end.

So the construct is:

Ligand (CBA promoter) --> loxP stop --> mCherry.

IRES --> Receptor --> lox2272 stop --> eGFP.

Wait, no, more accurately, the vector is bicistronic with two cassettes. The ligand's ORF is first, followed by a stop with loxP, then mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF, followed by a stop with lox2272, then eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

5' - CBA promoter - ligand ORF - LoxP-stop-loxP - mCherry ORF - IRES - Receptor ORF - Lox2272-stop-lox2272 - eGFP ORF - 3'.

So when Cre is introduced, which recognizes loxP and lox2272, it would delete the stops, allowing both the ligand and mCherry to be expressed, and the receptor and eGFP to be expressed.

But in the case of the mouse model, they're using SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, Cre should excise the stops, allowing ligand and receptor to be expressed, each fused to their fluorescent proteins.

So why isn't eGFP expressed? The Western blot showed signals proportional to actin, implying that something is expressed, but maybe only the ligand and mCherry, but not the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, but the vector is designed so that both the ligand and the receptor are
