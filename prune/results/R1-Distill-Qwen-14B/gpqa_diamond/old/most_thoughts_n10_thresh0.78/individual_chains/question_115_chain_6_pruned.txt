Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are such that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons. The options are A to D, some angles.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and because of conservation laws, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are opposite in direction.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma is 4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. But wait, wait—positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so it has the same mass but opposite charge. But when considering momentum, the direction matters.

So, let me think about the rest frame. No, wait, the problem is in the lab frame where the electron is moving left to right (from the left) and the positron right to left (from the right). Hmm, but wait, the electron is moving from the left towards the right, and the positron is moving from the right towards the left. So they're coming towards each other.

Wait, Lorentz factors are gamma, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But maybe I don't need to compute velocities. Let me think about their momenta and energies.

Electron: gamma is 4. Its rest mass is m_e (electron mass). So its energy is gamma * m_e c², and its momentum is gamma * m_e v. But beta is v/c, so beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Wait, but for momentum, since p = gamma m v, and v = beta c, so p = gamma m beta c.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of four-momentum. The four-momentum of each particle is (E/c, p_x, 0, 0), since they're moving along the x-axis.

For the electron moving from left to right, say positive x direction. So for the electron, Lorentz factor gamma_e =4, so E_e = gamma_e m_e c². Its momentum p_e is gamma_e m_e beta_e c. But beta_e is v_e/c; for gamma=4, beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/4²)) = sqrt(1 -1/16)= sqrt(15/16)= sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.968.

Wait wait, but the positron is moving from the right towards the left, same line. So its velocity is in the opposite direction. But same magnitude? Not necessarily. Positron's gamma is 2, so its speed is higher than the electron's speed? Wait, no. Because gamma increases with speed. So gamma of 4 implies higher speed than gamma of 2. Wait, no. Wait, higher gamma means higher speed. Because as v approaches c, gamma approaches infinity. So the electron is moving faster than the positron. Because gamma_e =4 is higher than gamma_p=2. So electron's speed is higher.

But maybe I don't need to compute their exact velocities. Since after annihilation, two photons are produced with the same energy and symmetric directions—both moving to the right but one up and one down. So the photon directions are symmetric about the x-axis, making some angle above and below.

Wait, but if both photons are moving to the right, their momenta are in the same direction? No, wait, the problem says one photon is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. So both are moving in the right direction, but one is angled upwards and the other downwards.

Wait, but the total momentum must be conserved. So the initial total momentum of the system (electron + positron) is the vector sum of their individual momenta.

Electron is moving right, positron is moving left. Wait, no, the positron is moving from the right towards the left, so in the lab frame, the positron is moving left. Wait, the electron is moving from left to right (positive x), and the positron is moving from right to left (negative x). So their momenta are opposite in direction.

Wait, but when you add their momenta, you have to consider their directions. So let me compute the initial momentum.

Electron: moving right, so momentum p_e = gamma_e m_e beta_e c in +x direction.

Positron: moving left, so momentum p_p = - gamma_p m_e beta_p c. Wait, because it's moving in the opposite direction (since positron is coming from the right, so direction is negative x). So the momentum vectors are p_e (positive) and p_p (negative).

Wait, but wait: the positron's momentum is in the negative x direction. So the total initial momentum P_total is p_e (gamma_e m_e beta_e c) + p_p (gamma_p m_e beta_p c but with negative direction). Wait, no, wait:
