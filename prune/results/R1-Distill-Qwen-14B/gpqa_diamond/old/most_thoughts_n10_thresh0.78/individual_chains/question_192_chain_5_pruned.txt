Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the setup is a bit involved, but I'll try to visualize it.

Alright, the problem says there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a smaller spherical cavity with radius r, and the center of this cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. So imagine a big sphere, and inside it, a smaller sphere-shaped hole not right at the center but offset by s.

Now, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and from the center of the cavity, it's l away. Also, the angle between l and s is theta. Both L and l are greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.

Hmm, I remember something about conductors and charges. Oh right, when a conductor is neutral, and you place a charge inside a cavity, the conductor's inner surface will have an induced charge opposite to that, and the outer surface will have the same as the placed charge. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So when you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity wall) must have -q. But since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have +q, right?

Wait, no. Wait a minute. The conductor was uncharged. So, when +q is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's inner wall) would have an induced charge of -q. But the conductor as a whole remains neutral, so the outer surface must have +q. Because the total charge on the conductor is zero: inner surface is -q, outer surface is +q, so they cancel out. Wait, no, because conductor was initially neutral. Oh wait, the charge +q is placed inside the cavity. So the conductor's inner surface must have -q (because it's induced by +q), and since the conductor itself had zero charge, the outer surface must have +q to balance. So that the total is zero for the conductor.

But wait
