Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can get tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves two reactions performed by a chemist. Both reactions are treating different alkenes with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns—both standard (achiral) and chiral ones. I need to figure out what the chromatograms will show.

First, I remember that mCPBA stands for meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid and commonly used as an oxidizing agent. It's known for epoxidizing alkenes, right? Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with a peracid to form an epoxide. So, in Reaction 1 and 2, the alkenes (E-oct-4-ene and Z-oct-4-ene) are reacting with mCPBA to form epoxides.

Wait, but after forming the epoxide, what happens next? Oh, the problem says each reaction is followed by aqueous acid. I think that's the acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the epoxide. So the epoxide would undergo some sort of cleavage under acidic conditions.

Epoxide ring-opening under acid conditions typically happens with the acid protonating the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. Since the solvent is aqueous, water is likely the nucleophile. But wait, the ring-opening of epoxides in acid usually leads to the formation of a diol. Or wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's cleavage leading to a diol or something else.

Wait no, the ring-opening of an epoxide with acid usually produces a trans diol. Because the nucleophile (like water) attacks the more substituted carbon in an SN2-like mechanism, leading to inversion of configuration. But wait, I might be mixing this up. Let me think again. The epoxide is a three-membered cyclic ether. When treated with acid, the ring opens. The acid protonates the epoxide, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then, water (or another nucleophile) attacks the less substituted carbon, because it's more electrophilic due to adjacent C-O+.

Wait, no, I think the more substituted carbon is more electrophilic because the adjacent oxygen is more stabilized. So the nucleophile attacks the more substituted carbon in a trans addition. For example, in cyclohexene oxide, when opened with acid, the attack occurs on the more substituted carbon, leading to a trans diol.

Wait, but for oct-4-ene, which becomes an epoxide, the structure would be 4,5-epoxyoctane. Then, under acidic conditions, it would open to form a diol.

Wait, but let me think about the specifics of the alkenes. The starting materials are (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are on opposite sides, while in (Z), they're on the same side.

When epoxidized with mCPBA, the geometry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide. mCPBA adds the oxygen in a specific way, leading to the epoxide retaining the stereochemistry—or does it?

Wait, I think mCPBA adds the epoxide group in a trans fashion. So if the starting alkene is E, the epoxide will have a particular configuration, and if it's Z, another. So each starting material would form a different epoxide.

Wait, no, mCPBA is a peracid and adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The reaction is stereospecific. So the geometry of the starting double bond determines the configuration of the epoxide. For example, if the starting double bond is in the E configuration, the resulting epoxide will have the two new oxygen bonds on opposite sides. Similarly for Z.

But then, in the case of oct-4-ene, whether E or Z, the epoxidation would lead to two different epoxide isomers. So Reaction 1 and 2 would produce different epoxides.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5, with substituents on opposite sides. Epoxidation would form an epoxide where the oxygen is between C4 and C5, and the configuration depends on the starting E or Z geometry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me perhaps draw this. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on C4 and C5 are opposite each other. So when mCPBA adds, the oxygen will be added in a way that the substit
