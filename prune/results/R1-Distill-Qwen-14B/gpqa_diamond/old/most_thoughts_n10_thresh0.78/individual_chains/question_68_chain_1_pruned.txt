Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in a changing magnetic field. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Wait, the particle has a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's moment is aligned with that, so I guess it's in the eigenstate of Sz with eigenvalue +1/2 or -1/2? But wait, the problem says the moment is aligned, so probably it's in the +Z direction, so the state is |+z>.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y. Both fields have the same magnitude B. So the initial Hamiltonian was probably proportional to Sz, and now it's proportional to Sy.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So I'm looking for something like <Sz> oscillating over time, and the frequency of that oscillation.

Hmm, I remember that in such quantum mechanics problems, when the Hamiltonian changes, the state doesn't change immediately, so the system is no longer in an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian. So the state will evolve according to the new Hamiltonian, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The initial state is |+z>, right? So before the field is changed, the state is |+z>. After the change, the Hamiltonian becomes something else. Let me model the Hamiltonian. The magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, so the energy is H = -mu · B. Wait, but in the problem statement, it's written as mu = gamma Sz. So the energy would be H = -gamma B Sz, but since the magnetic field is in the z direction, that's the initial H.

Wait, but in this problem, after the field is turned off and then turned on along Y, the new Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy. So H' = -mu · B', where B' is along Y. So H' would be -gamma B Sy. But wait, the sign might be positive depending on the convention. Alternatively, perhaps the Hamiltonian is H = gamma B Sy? Hmm
