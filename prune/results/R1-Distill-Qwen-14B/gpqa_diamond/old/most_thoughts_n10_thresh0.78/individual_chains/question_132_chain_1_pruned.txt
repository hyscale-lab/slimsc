Okay, I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 ratio. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. So each compound is a disubstituted benzene with some substituents, but wait, wait. Let me calculate the molecular formula. Benzene is C6H6. So C10H14 minus C6H6 is C4H8. Hmm, C4H8 is like a substituent. Wait, but each substituent in a benzene ring would typically be something like methyl groups, maybe.

Wait, wait, no, actually, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So the substituents add up to C4H8. Because 10-6=4, and 14-6=8. So the substituents are four carbons and eight hydrogens. Hmm, but wait, each substituent is probably a methyl group because each methyl is CH3, which is one carbon and three hydrogens. So if each substituent is a methyl group, how many are there?

Wait, four carbons would mean four methyl groups because each methyl is one carbon. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene. But wait, the formula would be C6H5(CH3)4, which is C10H14. Yes, that fits. So each of the two compounds in the mixture is a tetramethylbenzene derivative.

So the problem is about two tetramethylbenzenes that have different substitution patterns. The NMR spectrum is given for a 1:1 mixture. The aromatic region shows two singlets in a 1:1 ratio. The aliphatic region has three signals, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Let me think about what the NMR signals would look like for each structure.

First, in aromatic regions, the substituents affect the chemical shifts of the protons. When the substituents are in certain positions, the aromatic protons might be deshielded or shielded. But wait, in a tetramethylbenzene, all the aromatic protons are actually replaced by methyl groups if it's fully substituted. Wait, no. Wait, a tetramethylbenzene would have four methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. So the benzene ring would have four CH3 groups attached, and two positions left with H's? Or wait, no, wait, wait. No, wait, benzene has six positions. If four are methyl groups, then two are hydrogens? No, that would be a di-substituted benzene, but wait, no. Wait, wait, no, no. Wait, the substituents are four methyl groups, so each methyl is
