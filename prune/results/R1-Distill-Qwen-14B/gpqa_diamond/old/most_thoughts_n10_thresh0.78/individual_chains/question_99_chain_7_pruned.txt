Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, I've got an unknown compound and I need to identify it based on the FTIR and 1H NMR data given. Hmm, let's start by looking at the FTIR first.

The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. I remember that broad peaks in this region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad peak because the O-H is more acidic and can form hydrogen bonds. So that makes senseâ€”maybe the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Then there's a strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1. That's a key peak. I think that's the carbonyl group (C=O) stretching. Carboxylic acids have a strong peak around 1700, so that fits. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

Now onto the 1H NMR data. The problem says several peaks are observed, and none correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in double bonds, like CH2=CH. So that means the compound doesn't have any double bonds, or at least no vinyl groups, so it's a saturated compound.

Looking at the options, all of them have a COOH group because the options are all ending with COOH. So that's consistent.

In the NMR, one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmmm. Those splitting patterns must come from the neighboring protons. So the structure probably has some complex coupling, maybe from multiple adjacent groups.

Let me look at each option's structure:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, the structure is something like a central carbon attached to two ethyl groups and another CH2COOH. Wait, wait. Let me see. The central part is CH connected to two C2H5 groups and a CH2COOH. Wait, no, perhaps I should draw it:

The molecule would be: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, maybe not. Let me see the formula again. Option A is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So it's like two geminal substituents on each of the two middle carbons. So each of those two carbons (the ones attached to the ethyl groups) would have two ethyl groups and a hydrogen each.

Wait, maybe that's a bit confusing. Let me think about each option's structure.

Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So the structure is CH2CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the two middle carbons each have a methyl group and a hydrogen. And the rest is connected to the COOH.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH. So the two middle carbons each have an ethyl group and a hydrogen.

Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH. So the middle carbons each have a methyl group and a hydrogen, then a CH2COOH at the end.

Hmm. How do these structures affect the NMR splitting patterns?

In the NMR, a doublet of triplets of quartets suggests a proton that is coupled to three different sets of neighboring protons. Wait, no, wait: splitting happens based on neighboring protons. So a doublet of triplets implies that the proton is split by two equivalent adjacent groups. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's a proton that has two neighboring groups, each of which splits it into a certain pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps each proton is adjacent to two different sets of protons, leading to more complex splitting. For example, if a proton is next to another with n protons, where n is 2, and another with m, say 3, then the splitting would be a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the options have various substituents. Let's think about each.

In option D: The structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the central two carbons each have a CH3 and a H. So each of these Hs are on carbons adjacent to each other. So each H on the left central C is next to the H on the
