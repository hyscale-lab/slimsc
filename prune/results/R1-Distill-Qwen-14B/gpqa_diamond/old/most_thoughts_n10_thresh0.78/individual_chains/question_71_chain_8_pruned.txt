Okay, so I've got this astronomy question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about how I would approach this.

The question says that there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods have a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. The question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, assuming they have the same albedo.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—right, that's the temperature a planet reaches when the energy it absorbs from its star balances the energy it emits. The formula for that is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)), where a is the planet's orbital distance, R_star is the star's radius, and T_star is the star's effective temperature. Oh wait, but wait, the formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * ( (L_star/(16πσ)) )^(1/4) * (1/(a^(1/2))) ) ... No, maybe I should recall the inverse square law for radiation. 

Alternatively, the formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), but I'm a bit fuzzy. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The star emits energy proportional to T^4 * R^2. The planet absorbs that at a distance a, so the flux is (L / (4πa²)). The planet's albedo is the same, so it absorbs (1 - A) * (L/(4πa²)) * πr², where r is the planet's radius. But for equilibrium, the absorbed energy equals the emitted energy, which is 4πr²σT^4. So setting them equal: (1-A) L/(4a²) * r² = 4πr² σ T^4. Oh, but L is the star's luminosity, which is 4πR_star^2 σ T_star^4. So substituting that in, we get:

(1-A) * (4π R_star² σ T_star^4) / (4 a²) ) * r² = 4π r² σ T^4.

Simplify that,
