Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, they checked using TLC and saw that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots formed. The options are given, and I need to figure out which product structures are possible.

Hmm, I remember that hydrogen bromide (HBr) is commonly used in addition reactions, especially with alkenes. Oh right, it's a nucleophilic acid catalyst in such reactions, leading to things like bromohydrin formation or perhaps some kind of substitution.

Looking at the starting material: (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me try to visualize the structure. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The ether's chain is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait wait, no. Let me write the structure correctly.

But wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait no, butenyl is four carbons. Let me number from the oxygen. So the oxygen is on carbon 1. Then the chain is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that doesn't fit the substituents. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the substituents are 2,2-dimethyl on but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is: the first carbon is the one attached to the oxygen. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but wait, that's but-1-en-1-yl? No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4? No, that's not possible because the chain is only four carbons, so the double bond is between 2 and 3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the substituents are on position 3? Wait, no, the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 in a four-carbon chain. So the structure is: OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons. Wait, but that would require the chain to be longer. Hmm, perhaps it's better to draw it mentally as O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, the structure is OCH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, the correct structure of 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl is: the first carbon is the one attached to the oxygen. So it's CH2-CH(CH(CH3))... Wait, perhaps it's better represented as:

O
|
CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, but that wouldn't have the double bond. Oh wait, but the enyl group has a double bond. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. Wait, but that's but-1-ene... No, wait, but-3-en-1-yl? No, wait, maybe I'm confusing the numbering.

Okay, perhaps I should better structure this. But-3-en-1-yl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond starting at the third carbon. So the structure is:

O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's not possible because you can't have a double bond beyond the end. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's OCH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with
