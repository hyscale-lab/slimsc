Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum states. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. I remember that for an p orbital, the angular momentum quantum number l is 1 because p corresponds to l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. 

The problem gives the coupled angular momentum state as |1,1,2,-1>, where l1 and l2 are the individual quantum numbers, l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and m is its z-component. Wait, but wait a second. The individual l's are each 1, so when you couple them, the possible total l values are from l1 + l2 down to |l1 - l2|. So 1+1=2, and 1-1=0. So possible l values are 2,1,0. But the given state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l=2 and m=-1.

Now, the question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of them has eigenvalues of -ħ, because the z-component for each electron's orbital angular momentum is m multiplied by ħ. Wait, but wait, for individual electrons, L1z is m1*ħ, right? So each electron's Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ because m can be -1, 0, +1 for l=1.

So the problem asks for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z are -ħ. That is, m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. 

But wait, because the state is given as a coupled state, which is a combination of the individual states. So the coupled state |l1, l2, l, m> is |1,1,2,-1>. I need to find how this state is expressed in
