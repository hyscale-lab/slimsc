Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that there's a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a point r at time t, where t is greater than the time tr when the field was generated. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated to the observation point r. Oh right, I remember that when charges are moving, you have to account for retarded time because the fields take time to propagate.

Wait, scalar potential and vector potential... Right, the potentials are used in Maxwell's equations. For a static charge, the scalar potential is straightforward. But when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because you have to consider the retarded position and velocity.

So the scalar potential V is usually given by Coulomb's law divided by the distance, but when the charge is moving, I think it gets modified. I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge involves the velocity somehow. Oh wait, maybe it's (q/(4πε₀)) times something over (dc - v·d), where dc is the speed of light times d, but I'm not sure.

The vector potential A is related to the scalar potential. I think A is proportional to the velocity of the charge divided by c squared, multiplied by V. Or wait, maybe it's (μ₀ q v )/(4π something) over the same denominator as V. Let me recall: Ampère's law with displacement current, but for potentials, I think the vector potential is (μ₀ q v )/(4π) times something.

Wait, the general expressions I remember are:

V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀) * [1/(r - (v/c) t_relativistic + ... )]

But wait, in the context of retarded time, the denominator would be something like [d c - (d · v)/c], but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v/c) t_r + ...
