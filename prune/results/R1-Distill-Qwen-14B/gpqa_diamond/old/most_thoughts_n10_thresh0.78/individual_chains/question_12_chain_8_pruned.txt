Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. Let me try to think through this step by step. 

The problem says that a Pi(+) pion is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The masses given are Pi(+) at 139.6 MeV and mu(+) at 105.7 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, neutrinos are considered massless for these kinds of calculations, but I'm not entirely sure. I'll have to keep that in mind.

Since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. After the decay, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, let's denote the momentum of mu+ as p, then the neutrino's momentum is also p but in the opposite direction.

Now, the total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion because it's stationary. So that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is given by the relativistic equation E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But since we're dealing in units where c=1 (like MeV and MeV/c²), it simplifies to E² = p² + m².

So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2). For the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = p.

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p. This must equal the initial energy, which is 139.6 MeV.

So, the equation is:
sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, solving for p here. Let me call p as x for simplicity. So,
sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x = 139.6

Let me subtract x from both sides:
sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x

Now square both sides:
x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2
Expand the right side:
= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

So, subtract x² from both sides:
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x

Compute the squares numerically. Let me calculate 105.7 squared first.
105.7^2 = approx 11171.29 (since 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross term 2*100*5.7=1140; 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49, close enough).

139.6^2 is let's see: 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So, (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

So substituting back:
11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x

Wait, wait. Let me redo that. The equation after subtracting x² is:

105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2*139.6 x

Which rearranged gives:
2*139.6 x = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2

Compute 139.6^2 - 105.7^2. That's a difference of squares, so it's (139.6 + 105.7)(139.6 - 105.7).

139.6 + 105.7 = 245.3
139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9

Multiply those: 245.3 *33.9. Let's approximate.

245 *34 = 8,330? Let me compute 245*30=7350, 245*4=980; sum 8330. So 245.3 *33.9 ≈ 8330 (exact value would be a bit higher, but maybe close enough for the next step.)

So,

2*139.6 x = 8330 (approx)

So,

x= 8330 / (2*139.6) = 8330/(279.2) ≈ let's see, 279.2 * 30=8376. So 30 would be a bit too high. Let me compute 279.2 *29.83.

Wait, 279.2 *29 = 8096.8; 279.2 *0.8 = 223.36 → 29.8 gives 8096.8 + 223.36=8320.16. So 29.8 gives about 8320.16, which is close to 8330. So x is approx 29.8.

Wait, wait, but wait, actually, let me compute more accurately. Let me compute 8330 /279.2.

Dividing 8330 by 279.2.

279.2 * 29 ≈ 8096.8 (as above)
8330 -8096.8 = 233.2

So 233.2 over 279.2 is approximately 0.836.

So x ≈ 29.836 → about 29.84.

So p is approximately 29.84 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations because that seems high for a neutrino's momentum, but perhaps it's correct.

So, E_nu = p = 29.84 MeV.

E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = sqrt( (29.84)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.84^2: approx 890.4. 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

Sum is about 12062.89. Square root of that is sqrt(12062.89) ≈ 109.83 MeV.

Wait, but wait, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = 109.83 + 29.84 ≈ 139.67 MeV, which is close to the initial 139.6 MeV. So that seems to check out.

So the energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately 109.83 MeV and 29.84 MeV, respectively.

But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energies, not the total energy. Oh right, because the total energy includes rest mass energy.

So the kinetic energy (KE) is total energy minus rest mass energy.

For the muon:
KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.83 - 105.7 ≈ 4.13 MeV.

For the neutrino:
Since it's massless, its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, since E = KE for a massless particle (since m=0, KE = (pc)^2/(2m) → but when m=0, it's not defined, but in reality, for neutrinos, we often take KE = p c).

Wait, no, neutrino's rest mass is zero, so its total energy is E = p c. So its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, because E_rest is zero. So KE_nu = E_nu = p c. Since in our units, c=1, so E_nu = p, so KE_nu = 29.84 MeV.

Wait, but wait. The muon's KE is approximately 4.13 MeV, and the neutrino's KE is approximately 29.84 MeV. Now looking at the options:

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That matches closely.

But wait, the initial pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV. The decay products' energies sum to 139.6 MeV as total energy. So:

E_mu = sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = 109.83 MeV (rest mass 105.7, so KE 4.13)
E_nu = 29.84 MeV (massless, so KE same as E_nu)

Sum of energies: 109.83 + 29.84 ≈ 139.67 MeV ≈ 139.6, which is correct.

Wait, but the options have the neutrino's KE as 29.8 MeV in option D. So KE_mu is 4.12
