Okay, let's see. So, I'm trying to solve this physics problem about atomic nuclei fission. Hmm, I remember that when a nucleus undergoes fission, it splits into two smaller nuclei, and they release a lot of energy. The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the difference between the relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) calculations.

The problem states that the initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. It's at rest, so its total energy is just its rest mass energy. Then it fissions into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass M. Oh wait, so the total rest mass after fission is less than the initial, which makes sense because some mass is converted into kinetic energy and other forms like binding energy or radiation.

Wait, the sum is 99% of M. So, M is the initial mass. Let me denote the masses. Let me call the smaller fragment's rest mass m, so the more massive is 2m. Then m + 2m = 3m = 0.99 M. So, 3m = 0.99 M → m = 0.33 M. So the two masses are m = 0.33 M and 2m = 0.66 M. So the initial nucleus has mass M, and the two fragments have masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M. Their combined rest mass is 0.99 M, which is less than M, so that's the mass defect, and that's where the energy comes from.

The rest mass of the initial nucleus is 300 GeV. So M c² is 300 GeV. After fission, the fragments have rest masses 0.33 M and 0.66 M, so their rest energies are 0.33 * 300 GeV = 99 GeV for the lighter, and 198 GeV for the heavier. Sum is 297 GeV, which is 0.99 * 300 GeV. So the total rest energy after is 297 GeV, so the mass defect is 3 GeV, which is the energy released, right? But not all of that goes into kinetic energy; some might go into binding energy of the fragments or other forms, but I think for this problem, we can assume that the kinetic energy comes from the mass defect.

Wait, no, wait. The initial nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum after fission must be zero because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments will move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. So their kinetic energies will be determined by the mass ratio and the conservation of energy.

Let me think about the energies. The initial energy is all rest energy, 300 GeV. After fission, each fragment has rest energy plus kinetic energy. So the total energy is the sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energies. But initially, the nucleus is at rest, so the total energy before is just 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is (0.33M c² + T1) + (0.66M c² + T2) ) = (0.99 M c²) + (T1 + T2). But M c² is 300 GeV, so 0.99 * 300 = 297 GeV. So the sum of their energies is 297 GeV + (T1 + T2). But the initial energy was 300 GeV, so 300 = 297 + T1 + T2 → T1 + T2 = 3 GeV. So the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

But wait, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical approximation. So I need to compute T1 using both methods and find the difference.

In the classical (non-relativistic) approximation, we treat the fragments as if their kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². But in reality, since the nucleus is already moving at speeds where relativistic effects are significant, the relativistic calculation is necessary.

So, let's first compute using the non-relativistic approach. In the non-relativistic case, the total kinetic energy is (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2². But since momentum is conserved, and the initial momentum is zero, m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → m1 v1 = -m2 v2. Let me denote v1 as v, then v2 is (m1 / m2) * v, but with opposite direction. Wait, no: m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v2 = -(m1 v1)/m2. Because, if m1 is 0.33 M, and m2 is 0.66 M, m2 = 2 m1.

So, m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v2 = -(m1 / m2) v1 = -(1/2) v1.

So, the kinetic energies would be (1/2) m1 v1² and (1/2) m2 v2².

But since m2 is twice m1, and v2 is half v1. Let me compute each.

KE1 = 0.5 * m1 * v1²
KE2 = 0.5 * m2 * v2² = 0.5 * (2 m1) * ( (v1/2) )² = 0.5 * 2 m1 * v1² /4 = 0.5 * 2/4 m1 v1² = 0.25 m1 v1².

So total KE is KE1 + KE2 = 0.5 m1 v1² + 0.25 m1 v1² = 0.75 m1 v1².

But the total KE is 3 GeV. So 0.75 m1 v1² = 3 GeV → m1 v1² = 4 GeV.

But I need to find KE1, which is 0.5 m1 v1². So KE1_classical = 0.5 * m1 v1² = 0.5 * 4 GeV = 2 GeV. So T1_classical is 2 GeV.

Wait, but the problem says T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. So in the classical case, T1 would be KE2, which is the larger one? No, wait, in the non-relativistic case, since m2 is larger than m1, but v2 is smaller. Let me double-check.

Wait, m1 is 0.33 M, m2 is 0.66 M.

In the non-relativistic approach, KE1 is 0.5 m1 v1^2, and KE2 is 0.5 m2 v2^2.

But since m2 is twice m1, and v2 is (v1/2), then KE2 is (1/2) * 2 m1 * (v1/2)^2 = (1/2) * 2 m1 * v1²/4 = (m1 v1²)/4.

So KE1 is (1/2) m1 v1², KE2 is (1/4) m1 v1².

So the ratio of KE1 to KE2 is 2:1. So the lighter fragment has higher KE? That's counterintuitive, but perhaps because it's moving faster.

Wait, but wait. If m1 is 0.33 and m2 is 0.66, then m2 is twice m1. So m1 is smaller, v1 is larger.

So KE is (1/2) m v². So for m1, KE1 is (1/2)(0.33 M) v1². For m2, it's (1/2)(0.66 M)(v2)^2.

But since m1 v1 = m2 v2, because momentum is conserved. So m2 v2 = m1 v1 → 0.66 M v2 = 0.33 M v1 → v2 = (0.33/0.66) v1 = (1/2) v1.

So v2 is half of v1. So, KE2 = 0.5 * 0.66 M * (v1/2)^2 = 0.5 * 0.66 M * v1²/4 = (0.66/8) M v1².

KE1 is 0.5 * 0.33 M * v1² = (0.33/2) M v1².

So let's compute the ratio of KE1 to KE2.

KE1 = (0.33/2) M v1² = 0.165 M v1².

KE2 = (0.66/8) M v1² = 0.0825 M v1².

So KE1 is twice KE2. So the lighter fragment has higher kinetic energy. So in the classical case, the more massive fragment (m2) has KE2, which is 0.0825 M v1².

But the total KE is 3 GeV, which is KE1 + KE2 = 0.2475 M v1² = 3 GeV.

Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing units here. Let me re-express.

Wait, M is the initial mass, which has rest mass energy of 300 GeV. So, M c² = 300 GeV.

So M = (300 GeV) / c².

So, let me express everything in terms of M and c².

So, KE1 = (1/2) m1 v1² = (1/2)(0.33 M) v1².

But let me express v1 in terms of c. Because in the relativistic scenario, velocities are a significant fraction of c. But in the non-relativistic case, maybe they're not? Or perhaps for the sake of the problem, we can proceed.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum, but relativistically.

In the relativistic case, each fragment's total energy is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So, the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, for fragment 1 (mass m1 =0.33 M) and fragment 2 (m2=0.66 M):

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2

And p1 = - p2 → gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But since momentum magnitudes are equal, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But also, from energy conservation:

Total energy after fission = rest energy of fragment 1 + rest energy of fragment 2 + kinetic energy of fragment 1 + kinetic energy of fragment 2.

Which is:

m1 c² + m2 c² + T1 + T2 = M c².

But M c² is 300 GeV, and m1 c² + m2 c² = 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV.

So, T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

But how do I find T1?

Another approach: consider that in the center-of-momentum frame, which is the same as the initial rest frame (since the nucleus is at rest), the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

The relativistic kinetic energy is given by T = (gamma - 1) m c².

So, for each fragment, their kinetic energy is (gamma1 - 1) m1 c² and (gamma2 - 1) m2 c².

So T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

T2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

Also, since the momenta are equal in magnitude:

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But v1 and v2 are related through their velocities. Let me think about the relationship between v1 and v2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express v in terms of beta (β = v/c).

Then, p = gamma m β c.

So, for fragment 1: p1 = gamma1 m1 β1 c.

Fragment 2: p2 = gamma2 m2 β2 c.

Since p1 = - p2, their magnitudes are equal.

So:

gamma1 m1 β1 c = gamma2 m2 β2 c.

Cancel c:

gamma1 m1 β1 = gamma2 m2 β2.

But beta is v/c, so beta1 = v1/c, beta2 = v2/c.

We have m2 = 2 m1.

So, gamma1 m1 beta1 = gamma2 (2 m1) beta2.

Divide both sides by m1:

gamma1 beta1 = 2 gamma2 beta2.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can relate beta1 and beta2 via their velocities.

But another approach is to let's denote the speed of fragment 1 as v and fragment 2 as u. Since momentum is conserved:

gamma1 m1 v = gamma2 m2 u.

But m2 = 2 m1, so:

gamma1 v = 2 gamma2 u.

Wait, maybe let me square both sides to get into energy terms. Because energy can be expressed in terms of momentum and mass.

Wait, the energy of each fragment is E1 = gamma1 m1 c², and E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

Since E1 + E2 = M c² = 300 GeV.

And from momentum conservation, p1 = -p2.

So, p1 = sqrt( (E1)^2 - (m1 c²)^2 ) / c.

Similarly, p2 = sqrt( (E2)^2 - (m2 c²)^2 ) / c.

So, since p1 = -p2,

sqrt( (E1)^2 - (m1 c²)^2 ) = - sqrt( (E2)^2 - (m2 c²)^2 ).

But since magnitudes are equal,

sqrt( (E1)^2 - (m1 c²)^2 ) = sqrt( (E2)^2 - (m2 c²)^2 ).

So,

(E1)^2 - (m1 c²)^2 = (E2)^2 - (m2 c²)^2.

Rearranging,

E1² - E2² = (m1 c²)^2 - (m2 c²)^2.

But E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Let me denote E1 = a, E2 = b. So,

a + b = 300 GeV.

And,

a² - b² = (m1 c²)^2 - (m2 c^2)^2.

Which is (a - b)(a + b) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

But a + b = 300 GeV.

So,

(a - b) * 300 GeV = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

Compute m1 and m2 in terms of M.

m1 = 0.33 M,

m2 = 0.66 M.

So,

m1^2 - m2^2 = (0.33 M)^2 - (0.66 M)^2 = M² (0.33² - 0.66²) = M² (0.1089 - 0.4356) = M² (-0.3267).

So,

(a - b) * 300 GeV = (-0.3267 M²) c^4.

But m1 c^2 is 0.33 M c² = 99 GeV,

Similarly, m2 c² is 198 GeV.

So (m1 c²)^2 is (99 GeV)^2,

(m2 c^2)^2 is (198 GeV)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the right side.

Right side: (m1 c²)^2 - (m2 c^2)^2 = (99^2 - 198^2) (GeV)^2.

That's (99 - 198)(99 +198) ) GeV^2.

Which is (-99)(297) GeV^2 = -29403 GeV².

So,

(a - b) * 300 GeV = -29403 GeV².

Divide both sides by 300 GeV,

a - b = (-29403 GeV²) / (300 GeV) ) = (-29403 / 300) GeV ≈ -98.01 GeV.

So,

a + b = 300,

a - b = -98.01.

Adding these two equations:

2a = 300 -98.01 → 2a = 201.99 → a = 100.995 GeV.

Then, b = 300 - a = 300 - 100.995 = 199.005 GeV.

So, E1 = 100.995 GeV,

E2 = 199.005 GeV.

Now, the kinetic energy T1 is E1 - m1 c².

m1 c² is 99 GeV,

So T1 = 100.995 - 99 = 1.995 GeV ≈ 2 GeV.

Similarly, T2 = E2 - m2 c².

m2 c² is 198 GeV,

So T2 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

So the relativistic calculation gives T1 ≈ 2 GeV.

Wait, but in the classical case, earlier I thought T1_classical was 2 GeV. But wait, no, in the classical case, T1_classical is 2 GeV? Because in the non-relativistic approach, we found that T1_classical is 2 GeV, but this is for the lighter fragment, but the problem states T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment. Oh wait, no, no—wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, I think I got confused.

Wait, no. Wait a second: in the non-relativistic case, I considered the more massive fragment being the one with 0.66 M, so m2. So earlier, in the non-relativistic case, I calculated KE1 and KE2, where KE1 is for m1 (lighter) and KE2 for m2 (heavier). So in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment (m2) has KE2.

Wait, no, earlier I found that in the non-relativistic case, T1 (assuming T1 is the KE of the more massive fragment) would be KE2. But in the non-relativistic calculations, I found that KE1 is 2 GeV, KE2 is 1 GeV. So T1_classical would be KE2 = 1 GeV.

Wait, let me recheck.

In the non-relativistic approach, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV. KE1 (lighter fragment) is 2 GeV and KE2 (heavier) is 1 GeV. So in the non-relativistic case, T1_classical is 1 GeV.

But in the relativistic calculation, I found T1 (for the more massive fragment) is approximately 1.005 GeV.

Wait, so the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical T1 is 1.005 GeV - 1 GeV = 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, 0.005 GeV is 5 MeV (since 1 GeV = 1000 MeV).

So the difference is 5 MeV. But wait, what about the opposite? The question says, what is the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1 value. So correct T1 is approximately 1.005 GeV, and classical is 1 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV. So the correct answer is B) 5 MeV.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the classical approach, the more massive fragment has KE2, which is 1 GeV. The relativistic approach gives T1 = 1.005 GeV. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

Wait, but let me check the relativistic calculation more precisely.

Wait, the exact calculation gave a = 100.995 GeV, so T1 is 1.995 GeV? Or wait, no. Wait, earlier I said E1 is for the more massive fragment?

Wait no, no. Because E1 is the energy of the first fragment. Wait no, no, the way I set it up earlier: E1 is the energy of the fragment with mass m1 (0.33 M) and E2 is the fragment with m2 (0.66 M). So E1 is 100.995 GeV, so it's the lighter fragment, and E2 is 199.005 GeV, the heavier fragment.

So, T1 is the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is m2. So T1 = E2 - m2 c² = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment's KE is 1 GeV.

So the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV, classical is 1 GeV. The difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the answer is B) 5 MeV.


To solve the problem, we analyze the fission process and calculate the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment using both relativistic and classical (non-relativistic) approaches. The difference between these two values is then determined.

### Problem Setup
- The initial nucleus has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV.
- After fission, the two fragments have rest masses in a 1:2 ratio. Let the lighter fragment have mass \( m \), and the heavier fragment have mass \( 2m \). The total rest mass of the fragments is 99% of the initial mass \( M \), so:
  \[
  m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M \implies m = 0.33M, \quad 2m = 0.66M.
  \]
- The rest energies of the fragments are:
  \[
  m c^2 = 0.33M c^2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}, \quad 2m c^2 = 0.66M c^2 = 198 \, \text{GeV}.
  \]
- The total rest energy of the fragments is \( 99 + 198 = 297 \, \text{GeV} \), leaving a mass defect of \( 300 - 297 = 3 \, \text{GeV} \), which is converted into kinetic energy.

### Relativistic Calculation
Using relativistic energy conservation:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = M c^2 = 300 \, \text{GeV},
\]
where \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m c^2 \) and \( E_2 = \gamma_2 (2m) c^2 \). The total kinetic energy is:
\[
T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}, \quad T_i = (\gamma_i - 1)m_i c^2.
\]
From momentum conservation, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal:
\[
\gamma_1 m v_1 = \gamma_2 (2m) v_2.
\]
Solving these equations, the relativistic energies of the fragments are:
\[
E_1 = 100.995 \, \text{GeV}, \quad E_2 = 199.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
\[
T_1 = E_2 - (2m)c^2 = 199.005 - 198 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

### Classical Calculation
In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is distributed based on the mass ratio. Using conservation of momentum and energy:
\[
m_1 v_1 = m_2 v_2, \quad T_1 + T_2 = 3 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
The lighter fragment (mass \( m \)) has higher kinetic energy due to its higher velocity, while the heavier fragment (mass \( 2m \)) has lower kinetic energy. Solving:
\[
T_1 = 1 \, \text{GeV}, \quad T_2 = 2 \, \text{GeV}.
\]
Here, \( T_1 \) corresponds to the kinetic energy of the heavier fragment.

### Difference Between Relativistic and Classical Values
The relativistic kinetic energy of the heavier fragment is \( 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \), and the classical value is \( 1 \, \text{GeV} \). The difference is:
\[
\Delta T_1 = 1.005 - 1 = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical approximation is **5 MeV**.

**Answer: B**
