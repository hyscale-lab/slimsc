Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem is about two electrons in p orbitals. Their combined angular momentum state is given as |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. The options are A to D.

Hmm. Right, in quantum mechanics, when dealing with angular momentum, the states are typically represented by quantum numbers. For each electron, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is given here as 1 for both. So each has l1=1 and l2=1.

The coupled state is given with l=2 and m=-1. Wait, l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, which combines l1 and l2. So the possible values of l range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2. Here, 1+1=2, so that's correct.

Now, the problem says we're to measure L1z and L2z, each of which corresponds to the z-component of the orbital angular momentum for each electron. So L1z is for the first electron, L2z for the second.

Each L_z has eigenvalues m * ħ. So for an electron, the possible m values are -l, ..., 0, ..., +l. Since l is 1 for each, m can be -1, 0, +1 for each electron.

But wait, the question is about getting both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So each electron's m would need to be -1, because m * ħ = (-1) * ħ = -ħ.

So for each electron, L1z and L2z would be -ħ. So the question is: what is the probability of both electrons having m=-1 when we measure their z-components.

But wait, the state is given as |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1>. So I think this is a coupled state, meaning that it's an eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators L² and L_z, where L is the sum of L1 and L2.

So in such a coupled state, the individual
