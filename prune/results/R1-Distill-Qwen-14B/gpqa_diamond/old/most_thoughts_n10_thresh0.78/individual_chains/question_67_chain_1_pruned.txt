Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about the angular momentum states of two electrons in p orbitals. I remember that p orbitals have a principal quantum number l equal to 1, right? So each electron has l1 and l2 both equal to 1.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, so that's |l1, l2, L, M> I think. L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, which is 2 here because l1 and l2 are 1 each. And M is the total z-component, which is -1.

The problem asks for the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each L1z and L2z would be -ħ when measured.

Wait, but in an angular momentum state, the eigenvalues are given by m times ħ. So for each electron, the possible m values are -1, 0, +1 since l=1. So the possible eigenvalues for L1z and L2z are -ħ, 0, +ħ.

But the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So to find the probability, I think I need to expand this state in terms of the product states of individual m1 and m2. Because each product state is |m1, m2>, and the coupled state is a combination of these.

The total angular momentum L is l1 + l2, so maximum possible L is 2, which is the case here. The state |l1, l2, L, M> can be expressed in terms of the |m1, m2> basis. 

So, for L=2 and M=-1, what are the possible m1 and m2 combinations that add up to M=-1? M is m1 + m2. So m1 + m2 = -1.

Each m can be -1, 0, or +1. Let's list the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to -1:

1. m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1.
2. m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1.
Wait, are there more possibilities? Let's see: m1 can be -1,0,1; same for m2.

What about m1=1,
