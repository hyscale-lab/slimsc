Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. It's about the Standard Model extension and the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmm, I remember that pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when there's a spontaneous symmetry breaking, especially when the symmetry isn't completely broken. But wait, the Standard Model has the Higgs mechanism, right?

Looking at the Lagrangian given, let me parse it step by step. The terms include i bar{N}_R gamma^mu partial_mu N_R, which looks like a Dirac term for some fermions. Then there's (1/2)(partial^mu phi)^2, which is a kinetic term for a scalar phi. The |D^mu S|^2 term suggests that S is a scalar under a gauge symmetry, so it's in a representation that gets covariant derivatives. The next term is -(y_i/2) phi bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c. Oh, so that's a Yukawa coupling for the fermions N_iR with the scalar phi. 

The S is a scalar doublet, so maybe it's similar to the Higgs field in the Standard Model. The phi is a singlet, and the N_iR are singlet fermions, so they don't carry any SU(2) or U(1) charges. The potential V(phi, S, H) is probably where the interesting things happen in terms of symmetry breaking.

The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as <phi>^2 = x^2 + v^2, and <phi> =x, <h>=v. Wait, but h isn't in the given fields. Oh, maybe h is another field, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Lagrangian has H which isn't mentioned—maybe H is part of the scalar fields in the potential. 

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 through radiative corrections. I know that in the Standard Model, the Higgs is a pseudo-Goldstone boson when you have a custodial symmetry, but that's more in the context of the Higgs quartic coupling and the masses of the W and Z bosons.

But wait, the problem mentions an extension, so perhaps there are multiple Higgs fields here. The Lagrangian includes S, which is a doublet, and phi, which is a singlet. Maybe S is the Higgs doublet, and phi is another singlet scalar. So the potential V(phi, S, H) might lead to multiple Higgs bosons after symmetry breaking.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a doublet, and when it gets a VEV, it breaks SU(2) × U(1) down to U(1)em. The Goldstone bosons are absorbed by the W and Z, leaving the physical Higgs. But in this case, since
