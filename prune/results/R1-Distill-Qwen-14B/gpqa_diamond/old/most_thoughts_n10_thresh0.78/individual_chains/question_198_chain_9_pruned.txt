Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about cobalt(II) ions in a solution with thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. The question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants relate to the formation of complexes. The higher the beta, the more stable the complex. So β4 is 16, which might be for the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. Wait, but what about the dithiocyanato complexes? Oh wait, wait. The blue dithiocyanato complex is probably [Co(SCN)_2]^0 or some other form. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the complexes are formed stepwise. Each βn is the formation constant for the nth complex. So β1 is for [CoSCN]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^- , and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Wait, but the problem is about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions. So that's β2=40, which corresponds to [Co(SCN)_2]^0.

Wait, but the question is about the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_2]^+ or something else. Wait, I might be mixing up the colors. Alternatively, perhaps the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- which is the tetrathiocyanato complex. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, I should look up the common complexes. Oh right, the blue color usually comes from the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex. So maybe the beta4=16 is for that. Wait, but β2 is 40, which would be [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, maybe I'm wrong about the colors. Alternatively, perhaps [Co(SCN)_2]^+ is a different color. Hmm.

Wait, but
