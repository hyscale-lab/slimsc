Okay, so I've got this pretty complex question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The person created a bicistronic vector with certain features and tested it, but the results didn't show the expected green signal. I need to figure out why.

Hmm, so the vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one construct. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. So, when the vector is expressed, the ligand and receptor should be produced. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES element upstream, which usually allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate ORF after the ligand.

The vector has stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272. So, in the ligand's case, there's a stop between the ORF and mCherry, which is flanked by loxP. Similarly, the receptor has a stop before eGFP, flanked by lox2272. I remember that Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can excise the DNA between them. So, if the vector is in a cell with Cre, the loxP sites would cause the stop cassette to be excised, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But wait, the setup here has a bicistronic vector, so maybe the stop cassettes are there to prevent read-through from one ORF into another, ensuring that each is expressed independently.

Now, the researcher made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and used them in a Western blot. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading control worked. So the proteins were being expressed. They then bred a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background. Then they crossed these mice to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, and Cre under its control would be active in neural crest cells, I think. The idea here is that Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing the fluorescent proteins (mCherry and eGFP) to be expressed.

But when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal. So the eGFP wasn't expressed. Why?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. So they act on different cells. But the question is about their expression in the same cells, I think. The construct is in the same vector, so if Cre is active in the same cells, both ligand and receptor should be expressed. So this might not explain why eGFP isn't showing up.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the receptor wasn't trafficked properly, eGFP wouldn't be visible. But the question is about expression in the mouse, so if the construct wasn't properly made, maybe the eGFP isn't being made at all. Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not functional if the receptor isn't correctly processed, but the Western blot probably would have detected the receptor's presence, so I'm not sure.

C) Enhancer for expression is missing. Both the ligand and receptor have their own promoters, I think. The ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is under IRES, which doesn't require a promoter but allows for internal ribosome entry. So maybe the issue is that the CBA promoter isn't active, but the IRES should allow some expression. Or perhaps the IRES is not functional. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the stop cassette without Cre would prevent expression. Wait, in the vector, the ligand is under CBA, then the stop, then mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry wouldn't because the stop is in place. Similarly, the receptor has an IRES, so the ribosome would translate it after the ligand. Wait, no, the IRES is between the ligand and receptor? Or is the ligand ORF first, then the IRES, then the receptor? Wait, the vector is bicistronic, so the first ORF is ligand under CBA, then the IRES, then the receptor. So the CBA promoter drives the transcription of the first ORF (ligand), and the IRES allows for translation of the second ORF (receptor). So the stop cassettes are after each ORF, so that without Cre, the stops would block any reading beyond, so the mCherry would not be expressed from the ligand, and eGFP not from the receptor. But when Cre is present, it would excise the stops, allowing the fluorescent proteins to be expressed as fusion proteins with the ligand and receptor, respectively.

Wait, no. Let me try to visualize the construct: the ligand is first, then a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, then mCherry. So the ligand would be expressed as ligand-mCherry fusion, but only if the stop is removed. Similarly, the receptor is after an IRES, and then a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette and eGFP. So the eGFP would be part of the receptor-eGFP fusion.

If the mice are homozygous
