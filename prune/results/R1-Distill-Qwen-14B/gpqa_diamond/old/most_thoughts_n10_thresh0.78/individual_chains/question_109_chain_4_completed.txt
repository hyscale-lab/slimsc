Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state that emit a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that for the final state, the isospin T(NN), angular momentum S(NN), and spin L(NN) satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, I think I need to correct that. Oh right, actually, I remember that for identical particles, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. But since the nucleons are identical fermions, their total wavefunction has to be anti-symmetric. The total wavefunction is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts. So the product must be antisymmetric, meaning if one part is symmetric, others must be antisymmetric.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So isospin is zero. That implies that the isospin part is symmetric because for T=0, the wavefunction is symmetric under exchange.

Wait, no. Wait, the isospin state with T=0 is actually symmetric or antisymmetric? I think for identical particles, the isospin part when combined with spin and spatial parts needs to form an overall antisymmetric wavefunction. Oh, maybe I should recall that the isospin part for identical particles (like two nucleons) can be symmetric or antisymmetric, but when combined with the spatial and spin parts, the total must be antisymmetric.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's take it step by step.

The initial state is 1S0. So, the term symbol is 1S0, which in the spectroscopic notation is (2S+1)L J. Wait, wait. The 1S0 notation: S is the total spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, and J is the total angular momentum. So, for 1S0, S=0 (since 2S+1=1 implies S=0), L=0 (S is the spectroscopic symbol for L=0), and J=0.

So the initial state has spin S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the initial parity must be equal to the product of the final states' parities and the parity change due to the emission. Parity is a multiplicative quantum number, so the initial parity P_initial = P_final * P_X.

Wait, but parity is conserved in strong and electromagnetic interactions, but not in weak. The problem says to make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity, so I think parity is conserved here.

So initial parity: for 1S0 state, since L=0, the parity is (-1)^L = 1. Because parity operator P acting on a state with orbital angular momentum L gives (-1)^L times the state. So initial parity is 1.

After emission, the final state is the NN state plus the emitted particle X. So the parity of the system would be the product of the parities of the NN state and X. Because parity is multiplicative.

Wait, no. Let's clarify. The parity of the system before emission is the same as the parity after emission. So the parity of the initial state (1S0) is 1. After emission, the parity of the NN system plus the parity of X must equal the initial parity. So:

P_initial = P_final_NN * P_X.

Because the parity operator applied to the combined state is the product of the parities. So 1 = P_final_NN * (-1) → P_final_NN = -1.

So the parity of the NN state after emission must be -1.

Now, the NN state after emission is in some state, and the emitted particle X is in its own state. So the parity of the NN state is P_NN, and X has parity P_X = -1. So the total parity is P_NN * (-1) = 1. So P_NN must be -1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let's recheck. The initial parity is 1. After emission, the parity is P_NN * P_X. So 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So the NN state after emission must have parity -1.

Now, the parity of the NN state is determined by their orbital angular momentum L. The parity is (-1)^L. So for the NN state to have parity -1, we need (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd. So L can be 1,3,5, etc. But in the options, the NN states have L values of D (which is l=2), S (l=0), P (l=1), etc. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (D is l=2) → parity (-1)^2=1. But we need parity of NN state to be -1. So option A would have P_NN = 1, which can't be because that would make the total parity 1 * (-1) = -1, but initial is 1. Wait, no. Wait, initial parity is 1, final is P_NN * P_X. So 1 = P_NN * (-1). So P_NN must be -1.

So for the NN state in option A, L=2 → parity 1. So P_NN=1. Then total parity is 1 * (-1) = -1. But initial parity is 1. So that would violate parity conservation. So option A is a possible candidate for not being allowed. But wait, I'm not sure because I might have this inverted.

Wait, maybe I should think of the parity as the parity of the entire system. So the initial system is the NN in 1S0, parity +1. After emission, the NN state has parity P_NN, and X has parity P_X. The total parity is P_NN * P_X. So for parity conservation, 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So the NN state must have parity -1. So their orbital angular momentum L must be odd. So L can be 1,3,5,... which correspond to P (l=1), F (l=3), etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (D is l=2) → parity is (+1). So 1 * (-1) = -1. That would mean the total system's parity is -1, but the initial is +1. So parity is not conserved. So this option is not allowed.

Option B: 3S1 → L=0 (S is l=0) → parity is (+1). Again, same issue as A. So total parity would be -1, which doesn't match the initial. So B is not allowed.

Option C:3D3 → L=2 → parity (+1). Again, same problem. So C's parity wouldn't match. Wait, but the options are for the final state of NN. So if the NN state in option C has L=2, its parity is +1. Then the total parity is (+1) * (-1) = -1 → which doesn't match initial 1. So that's not allowed.

Option D:3P0 → L=1 (P is l=1) → parity (-1)^1 = -1. So the NN state's parity is -1. So total parity is (-1) * (-1) = +1, matching the initial. So D is allowed.

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So options A, B, and C have L even (0 or 2), which would give their P_NN as +1. So that would make the total parity -1, which doesn't match the initial. Only D has P_NN=-1, which makes total parity +1.

Wait, but wait, the way the problem is described, the options show that the initial state is 1S0, and the NN state after emission is something else, and the emitted particle is X (like a pion, perhaps, or another boson, but the problem states X has intrinsic parity -1).

So the options are about the possible transitions. The options are in the form 1S0 → [NN state] + X.

So for each option, the NN state after emission is given. So for each option, I need to check two things: angular momentum conservation and parity conservation.

Wait, but the problem says to use conservation of both angular momentum and parity. So each option must satisfy both.

But let me think about the angular momentum part. The initial state has J=0 (since it's 1S0: J=0). The final state's angular momentum must sum to J=0 as well, considering all particles. But since X is emitted, it's a bit more involved. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so J_initial = J_final.

But for the NN system to emit a particle X, we have to consider the angular momentum of the NN and X.

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the parity and the Pauli statistics condition given. Let me read the note again.

The note says the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So the initial state is 1S0: S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emission, the final NN state has some (2S' +1)L'J' and emits X. So the total J_initial must equal the total J_final. But since the initial J is 0, the final total J (NN + X) must also be 0.

But perhaps it's more straightforward to think in terms of parity and the Pauli condition.

But perhaps the main points are:

- The parity of the NN state must be -1 (since 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1). So the NN state after emission must have L even or odd? Wait, because parity of the NN state is (-1)^L_NN. So (-1)^L_NN = -1 → L_NN must be odd.

So any option where the NN has L even is invalid due to parity.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2 (even) → parity +1. So this would mean the total parity is -1, which doesn't match initial 1. So option A is invalid.

Option B:3S1 → L=0 (even) → parity +1 → same problem. Invalid.

Option C:3D3 → L=2 (even) → same issue. Invalid.

Option D:3P0 → L=1 (odd) → parity -1. So total parity 1, which is correct. So D is allowed.

Wait, but the question asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the ones that don't satisfy parity conservation are A, B, and C. But wait, the options list only four options, so perhaps more than one isn't permitted, but the question is which is not permitted. Hmm, but the options are A, B, C, D; the question says which is not permitted. So the correct answer must be one of them.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in considering the parity. Let me double-check.

The initial state's parity is 1. After emission, the parity of the system (NN + X) must be 1. So P_NN * P_X = 1 → P_NN = 1 * (-1) ? No, because P_X is given as -1. So P_NN * (-1) = 1 → P_NN = -1.

So the parity of the NN state is -1, which requires L to be odd.

So any option where the NN's L is even would lead to P_NN = +1. So when multiplied by P_X (-1), the total parity would be -1, which can't be because initial is 1. So these options are invalid.

So options A, B, and C have NN states with L=2, 0, and 2 respectively. All even, so their P_NN is +1.

So their total parity would be 1 * (-1) = -1, which doesn't match the initial 1. So options A, B, C are invalid due to parity violation.

Option D, on the other hand, has L=1 (odd), so P_NN = -1. Multiplying by P_X (-1) gives 1, which matches initial. So D is allowed.

But the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted, so the options are:

A) 7D1 → L=2 → invalid.

B)3S1 → L=0 → invalid.

C)3D3 → L=2 → invalid.

D)3P0 → L=1 → valid.

So the options A, B, C are invalid. But the problem says which is not permitted, so the answer would be any of A, B, or C. But the options only give four choices, so perhaps I've missed something.

Wait, perhaps I should also consider the Pauli statistics condition. The problem states that Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Wait, the problem says that in the final state, T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

But wait, T(NN) is the isospin of the final state. The problem says T(NN) = 0.

So 0 = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2.

Which can be rearranged as S(NN) + L(NN) = -1 mod 2 → which is same as 1 mod 2.

So S + L must be odd.

So, in the final state, the sum of the spin (S) and orbital angular momentum (L) of the NN system must be odd.

Wait, but what are S and L here? For the NN system, S is the total spin, which is the same as the initial state? Or does it change when a particle is emitted?

Wait, the spin of the NN system is part of their total angular momentum. The initial state was 1S0, meaning S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emission, the NN state will have some S', L', and J' such that J' is the total angular momentum of the NN system. But when X is emitted, the total angular momentum must be conserved.

But perhaps for this problem, the main focus is on the Pauli condition and parity. Let me consider each option and check both conditions: parity and the Pauli condition.

Let's go through each option.

Option A: 7D1 → the NN state has L=2 (D), so L=2. The term is 7D1. The 7 indicates (2S'+1)=7 → S'=3. So S'=3.

So for the Pauli condition: T=0 = S + L + 1 mod 2.

S=3, L=2 → 3 + 2 =5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. So 0 = 1 +1 mod 2 → 0=0? Wait, wait, the condition is T = S + L + 1 mod 2.

Wait, the equation is T = (S + L + 1) mod 2.

Since T=0, 0 = (S + L +1) mod 2 → S + L +1 ≡ 0 mod 2 → S + L ≡ 1 mod 2.

So for option A: S=3 (odd), L=2 (even): 3 +2=5 → 5 mod2=1 → which satisfies S + L ≡1 mod2. So condition is satisfied.

But for parity, as we saw earlier, L=2 leads to P_NN=+1. So the total parity would be -1, which is invalid. So option A is invalid.

Option B:3S1 → L=0 (S), S'= (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

Pauli condition: S=1 (odd), L=0 (even) → 1+0 =1 → mod2 is 1. So condition is met.

Parity: L=0 → P_NN=1 → total parity 1 * (-1) = -1. Which doesn't match initial 1. So B is invalid.

Option C:3D3 → L=2, S'= (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

Pauli condition: S=1, L=2 → 1+2=3 → mod2 is 1. So condition is satisfied.

Parity: L=2 → P_NN=1 → total parity is -1, which is wrong. So C is invalid.

Option D:3P0 → L=1 (P), S' = (2S'+1)=3 → S'=1.

Pauli condition: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → mod2 is 0. So 0 = (0 +1) mod2 → 0=1? No, wait, the condition is T= S + L +1 mod2. So 0 = (1 +1 +1) mod2 → 0= (3 mod2=1) → 0=1? No, that's a problem. Wait, that can't be.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck.

In option D, S'=1, L'=1.

The condition is T = (S + L +1) mod2.

So S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → 2 mod2=0.

Then T = 0 +1 mod2 → 1 mod2=1. But T is given as 0. So condition isn't met. So option D violates the Pauli condition. So it's invalid.

Wait, but earlier when considering parity, option D was the only one that satisfied parity, but it fails the Pauli condition. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, the problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod2). So T is the isospin, and S and L are the spin and orbital angular momentum of the NN system.

Wait, S is the spin quantum number, which is S=0 or 1, depending on whether the nucleons are in a singlet or triplet state. But in the final state, the NN's spin is S', which is part of their state.

So, for each option, the NN state has a certain S' and L'. So for each option, T' = S' + L' +1 mod2 must equal 0.

Option D: S'=1, L'=1.

So 1 +1 +1 =3 → mod2 is 1. So T' would be 1, but the problem states T'=0. So this violates the Pauli condition.

But earlier, parity in D was correct. So D has correct parity but wrong Pauli condition. So D is invalid.

Wait, so all options except D have parity wrong, and D has Pauli condition wrong. So which is the correct answer?

Wait, but the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the forbidden option would be the one that either violates parity conservation or the Pauli condition.

So, looking at each option:

A: Parity invalid, Pauli condition met → forbidden.

B: Parity invalid, Pauli condition met → forbidden.

C: Parity invalid, Pauli condition met → forbidden.

D: Parity valid, Pauli condition not met → forbidden.

Wait, that's confusing. All options have either parity or Pauli condition violated. But the problem says only one is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck the Pauli condition calculation for each option.

For the Pauli condition, T=0 = (S + L +1) mod2 → S + L +1 ≡0 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

So S + L must be 1 mod2.

So for each option:

Option A: S=3 (odd), L=2 → 3 +2=5 → 5 mod2=1 → yes, condition met.

Parity: L=2 → P_NN=1 → invalid.

Option B: S=1 (odd), L=0 → 1 +0=1 → condition met.

Parity: L=0 → P_NN=1 → invalid.

Option C: S=1, L=2 → 1+2=3 → mod2=1 → condition met.

Parity: L=2 → P_NN=1 → invalid.

Option D: S=1, L=1 → 1+1=2 → mod2=0 → condition not met. So T would be 0 +1 mod2=1, which doesn't match T=0.

Parity: L=1 → P_NN=-1 → condition met. But Pauli condition not met.

So in this case, all options except D have parity wrong, and D has Pauli wrong.

But the question is asking which is not permitted. So the partial wave that either violates parity or the Pauli condition.

But the options have four possibilities, and the correct answer is the one that is forbidden due to either condition.

Wait, but the question says "Make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity." So both must be conserved. So any option that violates either is invalid.

So the problem is which partial wave is not permitted, i.e., which option violates either.

So, let's list each option:

A: Parity invalid, Pauli met → forbidden.

B: Parity invalid, Pauli met → forbidden.

C: Parity invalid, Pauli met → forbidden.

D: Parity valid, Pauli invalid → forbidden.

So all options are forbidden, which can't be right. That suggests I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Let me re-examine the condition.

The problem states: Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2).

Wait, I think I got the equation wrong earlier. Because it's T = S + L +1 mod2.

So, for T=0,

0 ≡ S + L +1 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

So for each option:

A: S=3 (mod2=1), L=2 (mod2=0) → 1+0=1 → yes.

B: S=1 (1), L=0 (0) → 1 → yes.

C: S=1, L=2 →1+0=1 → yes.

D: S=1, L=1 →1+1=2→ mod2=0. So 0 ≡1? No, not allowed.

So for D, the Pauli condition is not met.

So, options A, B, C meet the Pauli condition but violate parity, and D meets parity but violates Pauli.

But the question is which is not permitted. So all four options are invalid except none, which can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the Pauli condition. Maybe the equation is T = S + L +1 mod2, but I should have T=0, so:

S + L +1 ≡0 mod2 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

So for each option:

A: 3+2=5 →5 mod2=1 → yes.

B:1+0=1→ yes.

C:1+2=3→ yes.

D:1+1=2→ no.

So, options A, B, C meet the Pauli condition, but their parity is -1, which violates parity conservation. So these options are forbidden because of parity.

But D meets parity but violates Pauli. So it's forbidden because of Pauli.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So which option is forbidden. Since all options are forbidden, but the options must have one correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the parity is being considered differently. Let me think again about parity.

The initial state has parity 1. The final state's parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X). So parity must be conserved, so:

P_initial = P_NN * P_X → 1 = P_NN * (-1) → P_NN = -1.

So the parity of the NN state must be -1, which is (-1)^L = -1 → L must be odd.

So in the options, which options have L odd?

Looking at the options:

Option A: D→ L=2 → even → P_NN=1 → parity not conserved → invalid.

Option B: S→ L=0 → even → invalid.

Option C: D→ L=2 → even → invalid.

Option D: P→ L=1 → odd → P_NN=-1 → parity conserved → valid.

But wait, option D has L=1, which satisfies parity. But does it meet the Pauli condition?

In option D, S'=1 (since (2S+1)=3 → S=1), L'=1.

So S + L =1+1=2 → mod2=0. So 0 +1 mod2=1. So T would be 1. But T is 0. So Pauli condition not met.

So even though option D has correct parity, it fails the Pauli condition.

So option D is forbidden because of Pauli.

But the other options are forbidden because of parity.

So the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. So all four options are forbidden, but the only option that satisfies parity but fails Pauli is D, and the others fail parity but satisfy Pauli.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the particle X is emitted. So perhaps I should think about the spin and angular momentum of X as well. Because the total angular momentum must be conserved.

Wait, the initial state has J=0. After emission, the NN system plus X must have total J=0. So the angular momentum of the NN (J_NN) and the angular momentum of X (J_X) must combine to give J=0.

But I'm not sure how to include that into the consideration here, as the problem seems to focus on parity and the Pauli condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the emission of X carries away some angular momentum, but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the problem is only considering the parity and the Pauli condition, not the angular momentum. Because the problem statement specifically says to make use of conservation of both angular momentum and parity.

Hmm, but then all options would be invalid, which can't be the case. So perhaps I should reevaluate.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. The condition is T = S + L + 1 mod2. But perhaps I should consider the spatial part's symmetry.

Wait, the Pauli exclusion principle for identical particles requires that the total wavefunction (which is a product of spatial, spin, and isospin parts) be antisymmetric under exchange.

The spatial part's parity is (-1)^L, the spin part's symmetry is determined by S: for spin state S, the symmetry is (-1)^S, since for identical fermions, the spin state must combine with the spatial part to form an overall antisymmetric wavefunction.

Wait, the total wavefunction is Ψ_total = ψ_space * χ_spin * φ_isospin.

For identical fermions, Ψ_total must be antisymmetric under exchange.

The spatial part's exchange gives (-1)^L, the spin part gives (-1)^S, and the isospin part gives (-1)^T.

Because for each part, exchanging the two particles would change the state by (-1)^L, (-1)^S, (-1)^T, respectively, depending on their exchange properties.

So the product must be antisymmetric, so (-1)^L * (-1)^S * (-1)^T = -1.

So:

(-1)^{L + S + T} = -1 → L + S + T must be odd.

Because (-1)^{odd} = -1.

So L + S + T ≡1 mod2.

But the problem states that T = S + L + 1 mod2. Let's see.

The condition from Pauli is T = S + L +1 mod2.

So substituting into the equation L + S + T =1 mod2.

Substituting T = S + L +1 → L + S + (S + L +1) = 2S + 2L +1 → mod2, 2S and 2L are 0 → 1 mod2.

Which is correct. So the condition is satisfied.

But for the given problem, T=0.

So 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S + L =1 mod2.

Which is what I derived earlier.

So in each option, we need to check if S + L ≡1 mod2 and if the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L = -1.

So let's reevaluate each option.

Option A:

NN state: 7D1 → S'=3 (since 2S+1=7 → S=3), L'=2.

So S=3 (mod2=1), L=2 (mod2=0).

So S + L =1 +0=1 → meets condition.

Parity: (-1)^2 =1 → which would require P_X=-1 → total parity 1 * (-1) =-1. But initial is +1 → parity not conserved. So option A is invalid.

Option B:

3S1 → S'=1 (2S+1=3 → S=1), L'=0.

S=1, L=0 → sum 1 → condition met.

Parity: (-1)^0 =1 → total parity -1 → invalid.

Option C:

3D3 → S'=1, L'=2.

S=1, L=2 → sum 3 → mod2=1 → condition met.

Parity: (-1)^2=1 → total parity -1 → invalid.

Option D:

3P0 → S'=1, L'=1.

S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → mod2=0 → doesn't meet condition. So condition not met.

Parity: (-1)^1 =-1 → total parity (-1)*(-1)=1 → condition met.

So, in this case, D meets parity but violates Pauli condition, while A, B, C meet Pauli but violate parity.

The problem is to choose which partial wave is not permitted. So any of these would be invalid, but the options only have four choices.

Wait, but the problem says to make use of both conservation laws. So any option that violates either is not permitted.

But the question is asking for which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is the one that violates either condition. But the options are A, B, C, D.

Wait, but I'm getting that all options are invalid, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing which options meet the conditions.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the emitted particle X is a boson, so its spin is integer, but I'm not sure if that affects the parity.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the parity of the initial and final states.

The initial state is 1S0 → parity +1.

The final state is the NN state plus X. The parity of the final system is P_NN * P_X.

So P_initial = P_final → 1 = P_NN * P_X → because X has P_X=-1, P_NN must be -1.

So all options where the NN's L is even are invalid because P_NN would be +1, leading to P_final =-1, which is wrong.

Only options where the NN's L is odd (P_NN=-1) are allowed in terms of parity.

Looking back, only option D has L=1 (odd), so it meets parity.

But in option D, the Pauli condition is not met because S + L=2 (even), so condition S + L =1 is not met. So option D is invalid due to Pauli.

So the only option that meets parity is D, but it fails Pauli. The other options fail parity but meet Pauli.

So the question is which is not permitted, so all four are invalid, but I must choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the question is only focusing on parity, and the Pauli condition is a distractor. But I think I should stick to the problem's setup.

Looking back, the question gives four options and asks which is not permitted. Since option D meets the parity condition but fails the Pauli condition, it's still not permitted. So the correct answer is D.

But wait, the other options fail parity, so they're also invalid. So perhaps the correct answer is A, B, or C because they fail parity and are invalid. But the way the question is phrased, it's which partial wave is not permitted, implying one correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the parity condition and not the Pauli condition. But that's unlikely because the problem explicitly mentions Pauli statistics.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Pauli condition. Maybe the equation is T = (S + L) + 1 mod2 → T = S + L +1 mod2.

In that case, for T=0, S + L +1 ≡0 → S + L ≡1 mod2.

So for D: S=1, L=1 → sum 2 → mod2=0 → 0+1=1 mod2. So T=1, which doesn't match T=0. So condition not met.

So D is invalid.

But the other options:

A: S=3, L=2 →3+2=5 → mod2=1 → condition met.

But parity invalid.

So the only option that meets parity is D, but it fails Pauli. The other options fail parity but meet Pauli.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So all options except D fail parity, and D fails Pauli.

So the correct answer is D, because it's the only one that meets parity but fails Pauli. So in the options given, the one that doesn't meet Pauli (D) is the one that is not permitted.

Wait, but the problem asks which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer is the one that either fails parity or Pauli.

So, among the options, D is the only one that meets parity but fails Pauli, while the others fail parity but meet Pauli. So the permitted options are none, but only D meets parity, so it's the only possible choice, but it's invalid due to Pauli.

But the question is which is not permitted, so perhaps D is the correct answer.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the conservation of parity and the Pauli condition provided.

### Key Information:
1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state, with:
   - Total spin \( S = 0 \),
   - Orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \),
   - Total angular momentum \( J = 0 \),
   - Parity \( P_{\text{initial}} = (-1)^L = +1 \).

2. **Emission of Particle X**:
   - Particle \( X \) has intrinsic parity \( P_X = -1 \).
   - After emission, the NN system must satisfy:
     - Conservation of parity: \( P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X \), implying \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \).
     - Pauli condition: \( T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), with \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \).

3. **Parity of NN State**:
   - Parity of the NN state is \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{NN}}} \).
   - Since \( P_{\text{NN}} = -1 \), \( L_{\text{NN}} \) must be odd (i.e., \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1, 3, 5, \dots \)).

4. **Pauli Condition**:
   - For \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), the condition becomes:
     \[
     S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \implies S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
     \]

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 7D^1 \)**
- \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \) (even), so \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^2 = +1 \).
- Parity check: \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match the initial parity \( +1 \). **Parity violated**.
- \( S_{\text{NN}} = 3 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 7 \)), so \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). **Pauli condition satisfied**.
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option B: \( 3S^1 \)**
- \( L_{\text{NN}} = 0 \) (even), so \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^0 = +1 \).
- Parity check: \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match the initial parity \( +1 \). **Parity violated**.
- \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), so \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). **Pauli condition satisfied**.
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option C: \( 3D^3 \)**
- \( L_{\text{NN}} = 2 \) (even), so \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^2 = +1 \).
- Parity check: \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (+1) \cdot (-1) = -1 \), which does not match the initial parity \( +1 \). **Parity violated**.
- \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), so \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 2 = 3 \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). **Pauli condition satisfied**.
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option D: \( 3P^0 \)**
- \( L_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (odd), so \( P_{\text{NN}} = (-1)^1 = -1 \).
- Parity check: \( P_{\text{NN}} \cdot P_X = (-1) \cdot (-1) = +1 \), which matches the initial parity \( +1 \). **Parity conserved**.
- \( S_{\text{NN}} = 1 \) (from \( 2S+1 = 3 \)), so \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} = 1 + 1 = 2 \equiv 0 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). This does not satisfy the Pauli condition \( S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \). **Pauli condition violated**.
- **Conclusion**: Invalid due to Pauli condition violation.

### Final Answer:
The only option that satisfies parity conservation is **D**, but it fails the Pauli condition. Therefore, **D** is the partial wave that is not permitted.
