Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. Alright, the spins are S1, S2, and S3, each can be +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So I need to consider all the possible configurations of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum up the exponentials.

First, let me figure out how many possible states there are. Each spin has two options, so total states are 2^3 = 8. That's manageable. I can list them all.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the possible values of H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Because E is proportional to H, so let's compute H for each state.

Each S is ±1. Let's see: H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, each term is the product of two spins. So each term can be +1 or -1. Let's consider all possibilities.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to look for symmetries or find the possible values of H.

Hmm, each term is the product of two spins. Let's think about all possible combinations.

Alternatively, perhaps H can be expressed in terms of the sum of S's. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to go through each possible state.

Wait, but let's see: each spin is +1 or -1. Let me consider all 8 possible states.

The states are all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3.

Let me enumerate them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
H = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
H = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(1) = -1 + 1 -1 = -1

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
H = (1)(-1) + (1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(1) = -1 -1 +1 = -1

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
H = (-1)(1) + (-1)(-1) + (1)(-1) = -1 +1 -1 = -1

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(1) = 1 -1 -1 = -1

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
H = (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-1) = 1 +1 +1 =3

Wait, so in the two states where all are +1 and all are -1, H is 3. In the other six states, H is -1. So that's interesting.

So for each state, E = -J H, so E = -J*3 for H=3, and E = -J*(-1) = J for H=-1.

Wait, wait no: E is negative J times H. So for H=3, E = -J *3.

And for H=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J *1.

Wait, so each state contributes exp(-β E) to Z. So for H=3, E=-3J. So exp(-β (-3J)) = exp(3J β). For H=-1, E= J. So exp(-beta J) = exp(- J beta).

Now, how many states have H=3? Two states (all +1 and all -1).

How many have H=-1? The other six.

So Z is sum over all states exp(-beta E) = 2 * exp(3J beta) + 6 * exp(-J beta).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option A: Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6e^(Jβ). Hmm, no, that's the opposite.

Option B: Z= 2 e^(3Jβ) +6e^(-Jβ). Oh, yes, that's what I got.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. E = -
