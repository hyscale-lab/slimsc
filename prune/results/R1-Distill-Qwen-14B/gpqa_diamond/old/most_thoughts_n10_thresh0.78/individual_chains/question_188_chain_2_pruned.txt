Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about calculating the interplanar distance of a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my crystallography, but let me try to think this through.

First, the question gives me that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, I think in a crystal, the interatomic distance refers to the lattice parameter 'a'. Oh right, in a cubic crystal, a is the edge length. But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal. Rhombohedral is part of the hexagonal system, right? Or wait, no, maybe it's a type of cubic system? I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, rhombohedral has all edges equal and all angles equal, so it's a special case of the cubic system where the angles are not 90 degrees. So the lattice parameters are a, a, a, and angles α, β, γ, all equal.

So the interatomic distance is the edge length 'a' here. So a = 10 Angstroms.

The question is about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is given by the formula d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk + hl + kl) * cosθ ), but wait, is that the correct formula for rhombohedral systems? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, another thought: The inter
