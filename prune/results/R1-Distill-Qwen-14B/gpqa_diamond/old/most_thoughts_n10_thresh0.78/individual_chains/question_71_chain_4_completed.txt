Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a)), where R is the star's radius and a is the planet's orbital distance. But wait, since all the planets are around the same star, R and the star's luminosity should be the same for all. So the temperature ratio would mainly depend on the distance from the star.

The planets are in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 has 2*P1, and so on. I think Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is just the radius. So, P^2 ∝ a^3. So a = (P^2)^(1/3) = P^(2/3) * some constant.

So for each planet, a is proportional to P^(2/3). Since the ratio of periods is given, I can assign Planet_1's period as 1 unit, so Planet_4 has a period of 3.5, and Planet_2 has 2. So let me calculate the ratio of their distances.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature depends on the reciprocal of the square root of the distance. Because T is proportional to (L / (16πσ a²))^(1/4). Wait, but since L is the same for all and albedo is same, the ratio of T would be inversely proportional to the square root of the ratio of their distances. Or more accurately, T ∝ (1/a)^(1/2).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff * ( (R_star / (2 a) ) )^(1/2 ), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature. So T is proportional to sqrt( R/(2a) ), but since R is same, T ∝ 1/sqrt(a). So the ratio of temperatures between two planets would be sqrt( a2 / a1 ), but since T ∝ 1/sqrt(a), the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a4 ).

But since a is proportional to P^(2/3), I can write a2 = k * P2^(2/3), a4 = k * P4^(2/3). So a2 / a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). So the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( (P2/P4)^(2/3) ) = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me recast that. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T4/T2 = sqrt(a2)/(sqrt(a4)) ) = sqrt( a2 / a4 ). But a = k * P^(2/3), so a2/a4 = (P2/P4)^(2/3). So sqrt(a2/a4) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

So now, P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So P2/P4 is 2/3.5. Let me compute that: 2 divided by 3.5 is the same as 4/7, right? Because 3.5 is 7/2, so 2/(7/2) = 4/7.

So (4/7)^(1/3). Hmm, I need to find the cube root of 4/7. Wait, 4 is about 1.55 cubed (since 1.5^3 is 3.375, 1.6^3 is 4.096). Wait, no, wait: 1.5874^3 is approximately 4 because (1.5874)^3 ≈ 4. But wait, 4/7 is about 0.5714. So the cube root of 0.5714.

Let me think: 0.5714 is approximately 0.571. The cube root of 0.571. I know that 0.8^3 is 0.512, and 0.83^3 is about 0.83 * 0.83 is 0.6889, times 0.83 is about 0.5717. Oh wait, that's close. So 0.83 cubed is approximately 0.571. So the cube root of 0.571 is approximately 0.83. So (4/7)^(1/3) is about 0.83. So T4/T2 is 0.83. 

Wait, but wait a second. I thought T4 is the temperature of planet 4, and T2 is planet 2. So if the cube root of (2/3.5) is about 0.83, then the ratio T4/T2 is 0.83. So the equilibrium temperature of planet 4 is about 0.83 times that of planet 2. So the ratio is approximately 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \( a \), and \( a \) is proportional to \( P^{2/3} \) from Kepler's third law. Thus, the temperature ratio \( T_4 / T_2 \) depends on the cube root of the ratio of their orbital periods:

\[
T_4 / T_2 = \left( \frac{P_2}{P_4} \right)^{1/3}.
\]

Given the orbital period ratios of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, Planet_2 has a period \( P_2 = 2 \) and Planet_4 has \( P_4 = 3.5 \). Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7}.
\]

Taking the cube root:

\[
\left( \frac{4}{7} \right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium temperature of Planet_4 is approximately 0.83 times that of Planet_2. Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is:

**C) ~0.83.**
