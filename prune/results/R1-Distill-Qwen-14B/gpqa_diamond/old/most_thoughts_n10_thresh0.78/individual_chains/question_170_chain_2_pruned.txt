Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve some matrix operations, so I'll need to recall how that works.

The given spin state is (3i, 4). Wait, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors. So (3i, 4) would be a two-component vector. But I should double-check: yeah, the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so the state vector must also be 2x1. So the state χ is [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: <S_y> = <χ| S_y |χ>. Oh right, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction, and σ_y is the Pauli matrix for y. Remember that S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y because the spin operators are (1/2) times the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The σ_y matrix given is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

So, the expectation value calculation would involve a few steps. First, I should compute χ† S_y χ, right? Or perhaps it's better to compute χ† σ_y χ and then multiply by ħ/2.

Wait, so let me write down S_y as (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So the expectation value would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of σ_y in the state χ.

So, the procedure is:

1. Compute the expectation value of σ_y: <σ_y> = χ† σ_y χ.
2. Multiply that by ħ/2 to get <S_y>.

Now, let's compute χ† σ_y χ. First, χ is [3i, 4]^T. So χ† would be the conjugate transpose, which would be [ -3, 4i ]. Wait, because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 remains 4, but since it's a row vector, it's [ -3,
