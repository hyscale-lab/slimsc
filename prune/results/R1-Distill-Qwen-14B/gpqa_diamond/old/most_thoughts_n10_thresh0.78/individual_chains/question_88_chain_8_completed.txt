Okay, so I have this question about immunology and rotavirus. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are delivered to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability.

Hmm, what do I know about rotavirus and the immune response? Rotavirus is a common cause of gastroenteritis, right? And I remember that Peyer patches are specialized areas in the intestinal wall that are part of the mucosal immune system. They're involved in detecting pathogens in the gut.

When you give something orally, especially a protein like the capsid, the immune system in the gut will respond. The Peyer patches have these structures called M cells that sample the contents of the intestine. The antigens are then presented to immune cells there.

Now, the inner capsid proteins are probably acting as antigens. The mice's immune system is responding to them. The fact that the variable heavy chain genes have high variability suggests that a process that diversifies the antibodies is happening.

Let me think about the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in B cells after they've been activated. It's a process where mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptor genes, increasing diversity. This leads to affinity maturation.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for destruction. But it doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the diversity of the antigen-binding site. It's more about the function of the antibody.

D) VDJ recombination: This is during the initial development of B cells in the bone marrow. It's the process where the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segments are combined to create unique antigen receptors. But wait, isn't that during the early stages of B cell development?

Wait, but in this scenario, they're looking at the variable heavy chain after the B cells have been activated. So the initial VDJ would have happened during development, but the high variability observed in the Peyer patches suggests that something else is adding more diversity after that.

Oh, right! Somatic hypermutation occurs in the germinal centers, which are part of the secondary lymphoid organs. Germinal centers are sites where B cells undergo proliferation and somatic hypermutation, leading to the production of more diverse antibodies. The Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and contain structures similar to germinal centers.

So in the question, after the rotavirus proteins are taken up, the B cells in the Peyer patches would undergo activation and proliferation. During this, somatic hypermutation occurs, leading to a high variability in the variable regions of their heavy chains. This process is what's being observed when they see high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

So the correct answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The question involves the immune response to GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus in mice. After oral delivery, some fluorescence was lost due to stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but fluorescent Peyer patches were identified. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population suggests a process that diversifies the antigen-binding sites of antibodies.

- **Option A (somatic hypermutation):** This process occurs in germinal centers, where activated B cells undergo mutation in the variable regions of their B cell receptors, increasing diversity. Since Peyer patches contain structures similar to germinal centers, this is a likely explanation for the observed variability.

- **Option B (complement activation):** While complement activation is part of the immune response, it does not directly contribute to the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

- **Option C (class switching recombination):** This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase the diversity of the antigen-binding site.

- **Option D (VDJ recombination):** This process occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow, combining V, D, and J segments to create unique antigen receptors. However, the high variability observed here is due to a process that occurs after B cell activation, making this option unlikely.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by somatic hypermutation, which occurs in germinal centers and similar structures like those found in Peyer patches. This process diversifies the antibody repertoire, leading to the observed results.

Answer: A
