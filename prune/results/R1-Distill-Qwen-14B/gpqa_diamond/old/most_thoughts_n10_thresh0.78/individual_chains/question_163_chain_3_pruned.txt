Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with these kinds of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm. Right, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when you add a strong acid, they should react, right? Because acid-base reactions typically neutralize each other.

So, let me start by recalling the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I think, so when it reacts with a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or H2SO4, but since it's monobasic, probably HCl?), it will form Fe^3+ ions and water.

The reaction should be something like:
Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but wait. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So each OH- would react with one H+ to form water. So the stoichiometry makes sense.

Now, let's figure out the molar masses to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The problem says 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. What's the formula weight?

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is 17.01 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(17.01) = let me calculate that.

55.85 + 3*17.01 = 55.85 + 51.03 = 106.88 g/mol. So the molar mass is approximately 106.88 g/mol.

The number of moles of Fe(OH)3 is mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.88 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 moles. Let me write that as approximately 9.357e-4 moles.

Since the reaction with H+ is 1:3, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve completely. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 9.357e-4 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

The acid solution provided is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So to find the volume needed, I can use the formula:

Molarity = moles / volume (in liters)
So volume = moles / Molarity.

Converting moles to volume: 0.002807 moles / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 L, which is 28.07 cm³. Oh wait, but wait—wait a second. The options don't have exactly that. Let me look:

Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04. Option B is around 30 cm³. Hmm. So why is my calculation giving 28.07, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the stoichiometry again. Because Fe(OH)3 is a base, when it dissolves in acid, each OH- requires an H+. So for each Fe(OH)3, you need 3 H+ ions. So yes, 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. So that part seems right.

Wait, but wait—could the acid
