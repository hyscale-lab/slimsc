Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A) 4, B) 8, C) 6, D) 2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is specifically a transition metal catalyst, probably for ring-closing or ring-opening metathesis. I think it can also do cross metathesis, but in this case, the starting material is a single alkene.

Wait, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene has five carbons with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? Or wait, no. Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and there's a methyl group on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, if it's 3-methylpent-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2? Wait, wait. Let me count: pent means five carbons. So 1 2 3 4 5.

So 3 is the third carbon, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)? No, wait, no. Let me think again. Wait, no, wait. 3-methyl on pent-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, wait, the pent chain is five carbons. So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2. So positions are:

1 (CH2-), 2 (CH-), 3 (CH(CH3)-), 4 (CH2-),
