Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about uncertainty principles, which I remember from my high school classes but I'm a little fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through.

The question is about an electron moving at a certain speed, and we're given the uncertainty in its position. We need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy. Hmm, right, this sounds like Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. I remember that the principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) to the uncertainty in momentum (Δp), and there's a formula involving Planck's constant.

Wait, the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), right? Or is it h-bar over 2? No, wait, h-bar is ħ, which is h/(2π). So maybe the exact formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. Or wait, sometimes I see it written as Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), because ħ is h/(2π). So both are equivalent. I'll have to keep that straight.

So the problem gives me Δx as 0.1 nm. Let me convert that to meters because the other units are in standard SI units. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

Now, I need to find the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. I'm a bit confused here. How does energy tie into this? Oh, right, the uncertainty in energy relates to the uncertainty in momentum because energy and momentum are related via kinetic energy equations. Since the electron is moving, its kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where p is momentum and m is mass.

Wait, but how do I connect the uncertainty in momentum to the uncertainty in energy? Oh, because the kinetic energy is a function of p, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be related to the uncertainty in p, Δp.

So, first, let me find Δp using the uncertainty principle. Since Δx is given, Δp is at least ħ/(2Δx). Wait, because the minimal uncertainty is when Δp = ħ/(2Δx), right? So that would be the smallest possible Δp, and hence the smallest possible ΔE.

Wait, is it ħ/(2Δx) or h/(4πΔx)? Let me think
