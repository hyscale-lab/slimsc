Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify an organic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step. 

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about the possible structure. The formula has 9 carbons, 11 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and two oxygens. So, maybe it's a substituted benzene ring with some functional groups attached.

Looking at the IR data: there are medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are usually indicative of N-H stretches. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, amide, ester, or maybe an acyl chloride. But since acyl chloride is less likely, maybe it's an ester or amide.

Now the 1H NMR data. Let's parse through each peak.

1. 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, which usually indicates a CH2CH3 group. So maybe an ethyl group attached somewhere. The triplet comes from two neighboring protons, so ethyl (CH2CH3) would fit.

2. 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests possibly exchange with something else, but in aromatic substitution, maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps an N attached group. Wait, if it's a benzamide, the amide N is connected to something. Alternatively, maybe an ethyl ester group. Or perhaps a methylene next to an oxygen.

3. 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet, 2H. Quartet usually is next to a CH2. Wait, quartet can also come from coupling with two protons on either side. But considering the ethyl group at 1.20 ppm, maybe this quartet is the CH2 connected to the oxygen, like in an ester group. For example, in ethyl ester, OCH2CH3. Wait, but ethyl ester groups usually appear as a quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm for the CH2 adjacent to O. Hmm, in this case, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure, like a coupling with another group.

4. 7.0 ppm (d, 2H): Doublet, 2H. This suggests a pair of protons in a para-substituted aromatic ring. Maybe a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents opposite each other. 

5. 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, 2H. Also on the aromatic ring, maybe ortho to something else.

Putting this together, the aromatic region suggests a disubstituted benzene, perhaps para-substituted. The doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm might correspond to two substituents on the ring, each causing the adjacent protons to be doublets.

Looking at the options:

A) 3
