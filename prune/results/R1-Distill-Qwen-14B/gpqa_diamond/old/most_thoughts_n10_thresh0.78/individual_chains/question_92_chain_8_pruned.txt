Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. The formula given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that looks a bit complex with multiple substituents and double bonds. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, wait. The problem gives me some data about bond energies, so maybe I'm supposed to use the bond energy method instead of directly looking up the standard enthalpies of formation.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. And various bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Oh wait, bond energies are usually per bond, right? So each bond contributes that energy when broken or formed.

So, to find the enthalpy of formation of the compound, I think I need to calculate the total energy required to break all the bonds in the elements (like the C-C bonds in graphite or whatever the standard state is) and then subtract the energy released when the compound's bonds are formed. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

The formula for calculating enthalpy of formation using bond energies is: Delta H formation = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds]. But wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the energy changes when the compound is decomposed into its constituent atoms, then the atoms form the compound. Alternatively, the formula is sum of the bond energies of the reactant bonds minus the bond energies of the product bonds. Or wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Because when you form bonds, energy is released, so the products' bonds would have higher bond energies if the reaction is
