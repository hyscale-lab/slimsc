Okay, so I've got this question about Grubbs catalyst and a racemic compound. Hmm, let's break it down. The compound is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mix of enantiomers, right? So the starting material is both R and S configurations at the stereogenic center. 

Grubbs catalyst is for olefin metathesis, I think. Metathesis involves breaking and reforming double bonds. So the molecule is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me draw that. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But it's 3-methyl, so the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and carbon 3 has a methyl branch. So structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene has five carbons, so positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would be a methyl on carbon 3. So carbon 3 is CH2, but wait:

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the structure. Let's number from the double bond. 1-ene is between C1 and C2. So the structure is:

1       2       3       4       5
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, that's five carbons. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 has a methyl group. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. So that's 3-methylpent-1-ene, right?

Now, since it's racemic, that means it exists as two enantiomers. But what's the stereogenic center here? The double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would have a double bond, and then on C3, we have the methyl group. Wait, but in this structure, is there a stere
