Okay, so I need to find the entropy of a supermassive black hole given the angular size of its event horizon. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically through the formula S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and c, ħ, G, k_B are constants. But wait, I might be mixing up some constants here. Alternatively, I think the formula is S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), but I'm not entirely certain about the exact coefficients. Oh well, maybe I can proceed and see if I get the right order of magnitude.

The question gives the angular size θ, which is 1e-17 degrees. Since the black hole is at a distance d of 1e10 parsecs, I can use the small angle approximation where the angular size θ (in radians) is approximately equal to the ratio of the radius r (of the event horizon) to the distance d: θ ≈ r/d.

So first, I need to convert θ from degrees to radians. Because 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let's compute that. θ is 1e-17 degrees. So θ_rad = 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me calculate that: π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416 / 180 is approximately 0.0174533. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * 0.0174533 = 1.74533e-19 radians.

Now, using θ_rad ≈ r/d, so r = θ_rad * d. Let's plug in the numbers. d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, I need to make sure all the units are consistent. Hmm, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters, right? So d in meters is 1e10 parsecs * 3.086e16 m/parsec. Let me compute that: 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

So r = θ_rad * d = (1.74533e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) = Let's compute that: 1.74533e-19 * 3.086e26. 1e-19 * 1e26 is 1e7. So 1.74533 * 3.086 is approximately 5.36, so 5.36e7 meters. Wait, that's 5.36e7 meters, which is 5.36e4 kilometers. That seems plausible for a supermassive black hole's event horizon. Or wait, actually, isn't the Schwarzschild radius for a supermassive black hole much larger? I think the Schwarzschild radius R_s is about 3 km per solar mass. So a million solar masses would give R_s = 3e6 km, which is 3e9 meters. Wait, my calculation here gave r as 5e7 meters, which is 5e4 km. So maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me recompute r. θ_rad is 1.74533e-19. Multiply by d = 3.086e26 m.

So 1.74533e-19 * 3.086e26 = (1.74533 * 3.086) * 1e7, since 1e-19 * 1e26 = 1e7.
