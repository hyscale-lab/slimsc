Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read through it again and try to break it down step by step.

The question involves mixtures X and Y, and a hydrocarbon Z. I'll start by summarizing the information given.

Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When X is treated with platinum (Pt) and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is also an equimolar mixture of two liquids, but these don't decolorize bromine water. Importantly, this reaction is a disproportionation. 

Then, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation with Pt under severe conditions, they each produce only one substance, Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%, and it's a solvent commonly used. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning that it's probably a saturated compound, like an alkane.

Another point is that mixture X has no conjugated multiple bonds in its molecules. So, the starting substances in X are likely alkenes or alkynes but not conjugated.

Let me think about the reaction steps.

First, mixture X is treated with Pt and heated. Pt is a catalyst, often used in hydrogenation reactions. But wait, the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine, meaning it might not have double bonds anymore. Since X could have been a mixture of alkenes, perhaps the reaction is hydrogenation, but the problem says that Y is formed via disproportionation. Oh, wait, so it's a disproportionation reaction, not simple hydrogenation.

Wait, the reaction is a disproportionation. So, maybe one of the components in X is an alkyne. Because when alkynes undergo hydrogenation, they can form different products. For example, a dihydrogenation step would produce an alkene, but with more hydrogen, it goes to an alkane. But wait, perhaps it's the opposite: sometimes alkenes can undergo hydrogenation, but in the presence of certain catalysts, maybe they can disproportionate.

Alternatively, maybe mixture X contains two different alkenes, but when treated with Pt and heat, they undergo some kind of dehydrohalogenation or other reaction. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the key point is that X decolorizes bromine, which means it has unsaturated bonds (like double or triple bonds) that can react with Br2. Y does not, so Y must have fully saturated bonds (all single bonds). So, X must have alkenes or alkynes, and Y has alkanes.

But then, when X is hydrogenated (with Pt under severe conditions), it gives Z. Similarly, Y when hydrogenated also gives Z. So, both X and Y
