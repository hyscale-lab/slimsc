Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are particle accelerators, right? They use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact differences. Oh wait, I think synchrocyclotrons use a varying magnetic field to keep the particles in sync with the electric field oscillations, which allows them to keep accelerating as they go around.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is about 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Maybe that refers to two stages or two different parts of the process. Not sure yet. 

The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The given data is Φ0 = π/4 and U0=190kV. I need to find how many revolutions the proton makes.

I think the key here is to relate the energy gain to the number of revolutions. In cyclotrons, the particles move in a circular path, and each time they complete a revolution, they gain a certain amount of energy from the electric field.

Wait, but wait. In a cyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is set to match the natural Larmor frequency of the particles in the magnetic field. But in a synch
