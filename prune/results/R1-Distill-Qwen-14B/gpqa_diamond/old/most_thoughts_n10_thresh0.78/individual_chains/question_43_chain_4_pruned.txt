Okay, so I've got this IUPAC nomenclature question here about a benzene ring with a bunch of substituents. Hmm, let me see. I remember that for benzoic acid derivatives, the carboxylic acid group is considered the principal functional group, so it's on position 1. But wait, in IUPAC nomenclature, the numbering starts from the functional group in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So the benzoic acid is at position 1, right?

So the molecule has a carboxylic acid (COOH), a carbaldehyde (CHO), and a cyano group (CN) all meta to each other. Oh wait, meta means they're three positions apart. So if COOH is at position 1, the cyano and aldehyde would be at positions 3 and 5, or 5 and 3? Or maybe I should think about their relative positions.

Wait, the question says all three are meta to one another. So that means each substituent is meta to the other two. So for benzene, which has six positions, three substituents each meta would form a sort of triangle. Let me think: positions 1, 3, and 5? Because each is two apart. Wait, no, meta is three positions away, which is the same as being two positions apart in the other direction. So if COOH is at 1, the next meta would be 3 and 5. So perhaps COOH is 1, CN is 3, CHO is 5? Or another arrangement.

But wait, the question also mentions substituents ortho to the carboxylic acid. Ortho is positions 2 and 6. So the substituents ortho to COOH are a hydroxyl (-OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2). So that would be positions 2 and 6. But wait, which one is in which position? Does it matter for numbering?

And para to the COOH is a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is position 4
