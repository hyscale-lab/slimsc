Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativity. But let's take it step by step. So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system.

Hmm, the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. Wait, so both are moving in the same direction. The options are given, so I need to calculate the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

First, I think the relative speed isn't just the difference of their speeds because we're dealing with relativity. So, I can't just subtract 0.5c from 0.6c, right? Because at high speeds, the classical velocity addition doesn't apply. Oh wait, wait, wait—no, the relative speed between them isn't just the difference because each is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. But wait, wait, the problem says "relative speed"—so from one astronaut's perspective, how fast is the other moving?

Wait, right, so in special relativity, the velocity addition formula is needed. The formula is u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), where u and v are velocities relative to another frame. So here, let's think: the first astronaut (mass 2m) is moving at 0.6c, and the second (3m) is moving at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from the perspective of the first astronaut, what's the speed of the second?

Wait no, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should consider their velocities in the same reference frame and compute the relative speed as from one to the other. So let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B at 0.5c, both in the same direction. So from A's frame, B's speed is (0.5c - 0.
