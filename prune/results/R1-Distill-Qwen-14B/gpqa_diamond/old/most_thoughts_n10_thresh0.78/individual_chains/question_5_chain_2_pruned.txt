Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with eigenvectors and eigenvalues, especially for operators in arbitrary directions. But let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon. The operator is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P (which is probably the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2) have eigenvalues corresponding to their possible measurement outcomes.

Wait, so P is a vector operator, right? So P can be expressed as P = P_x σ_x + P_y σ_y + P_z σ_z, where σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are the Pauli matrices. Each component P_x, P_y, P_z is given with their respective 2x2 matrices, multiplied by ħ/2.

Let me write down what each component is:

P_x is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Oh right, because the Pauli matrices are:

σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So each component of P is just (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix.

Now, the operator we're interested in is along a direction n in the x-z plane. That means the direction lies in the x-z plane, so its y-component is zero. So the direction vector n can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the angle from the z-axis, and phi is the angle in the x-y plane. But since it's in the x-z plane, phi is zero or pi, so the direction has no y-component.

So the operator P acting along n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction. So the operator P_n is given by:

P_n = (P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ) 

Because n_x is sinθ (since n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ)), and n_z is cosθ.

Wait, actually, the general expression for an operator along a direction n is the dot product of the vector operator P with n. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y=0, so P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So n_x is sinθ (assuming theta is the polar angle from z-axis), n_z is cosθ. So P_n = (sinθ) P_x + (cosθ) P_z.

Let me compute that. Substitute P_x and P_z:

P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So let's compute each part:

First term: sinθ (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] = [[0, sinθ ħ/2], [sinθ ħ/2, 0]]

Second term: cosθ (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]] = [[cosθ ħ/2, 0], [0, -cosθ ħ/2]]

Adding them together:

P_n = [[cosθ (ħ/2), sinθ (ħ/2)], [sinθ (ħ/2), -cosθ (ħ/2)]]

Wait, let me make sure:

First row, first element: cosθ (ħ/2)
First row, second element: sinθ (ħ/2)
Second row, first element: sinθ (ħ/2)
Second row, second element: -cosθ (ħ/2)

So P_n is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
            [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Hmm, okay. Now we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, wait. Because the eigenvalues of the Pauli matrices are ±1. So when you have P·n, which is a combination of the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2, the eigenvalues should be ±(ħ/2). Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, so any linear combination (like P·n) would have the same eigenvalues.

So the eigenvalue we are looking for is +ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

Let me set up the equation. Let |v> be a 2-component vector [a; b]. Then,

P_n |v> = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
                 [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

So we can write the equations:

(ħ/2) [ a cosθ + b sinθ ] = (ħ/2) a
(ħ/2) [ a sinθ - b cosθ ] = (ħ/2) b

We can factor out (ħ/2) from all terms, so they cancel out. So we get:

a cosθ + b sinθ = a   --> equation (1)
a sinθ - b cosθ = b   --> equation (2)

Let me rearrange both equations.

From equation (1):
a cosθ + b sinθ - a = 0
a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0

From equation (2):
a sinθ - b cosθ - b = 0
a sinθ + b (-cosθ -1) = 0

So now we have a system of two equations:

1) a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0
2) a sinθ + b (-cosθ -1) = 0

We can write this as:

( cosθ -1 ) a + sinθ b = 0
sinθ a + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0

This is a homogeneous system. For non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. But since we're looking for eigenvalues, another way is to solve the two equations.

But perhaps it's easier to consider the ratio of a and b. Let's denote k = a/b. Then a = k b.

Substitute into equation 1:

( cosθ -1 ) (k b) + sinθ b = 0
b [ (cosθ -1)k + sinθ ] = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ (k b) + ( -cosθ -1 ) b = 0
b [ k sinθ + (-cosθ -1) ] = 0

Assuming b ≠ 0 (otherwise trivial solution), we can divide by b:

From equation 1: (cosθ -1) k + sinθ = 0
From equation 2: k sinθ + (-cosθ -1) = 0

So equation 1: k (cosθ -1) = - sinθ → k = [ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Equation 2: k sinθ = (cosθ +1 ) → k = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

So equate the two expressions for k:

[ - sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 ) = (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

Let me simplify. Let me write the left side:

- sinθ / (cosθ -1) = [ - sinθ ] / [ -(1 - cosθ) ] = [ sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

So left side is sinθ/(1 - cosθ )

Right side: (cosθ +1 ) / sinθ

Set equal:

sinθ/(1 - cosθ ) = (cosθ +1 )/ sinθ

Multiply both sides by (1 - cosθ) sinθ:

sin²θ = (1 - cos²θ )

Wait, because (cosθ +1)(1 - cosθ) = 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So sin²θ = sin²θ → 0=0.

Hmm, so the two equations are consistent and give the same condition. So k can be expressed either way.

Let me pick one expression. Let's take equation 1:

k = - sinθ / (cosθ -1 )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -1:

k = sinθ / (1 - cosθ )

Now, using the identity that 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting:

k = [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] / [2 sin²(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So k = cot(theta/2 ) → a = k b = cot(theta/2 ) b

So, a = [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] b

Let me set b = sin(theta/2 ) for simplicity. Then a = cos(theta/2 )

So the eigenvector is [ a; b ] = [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]^T.

But I should check the normalization. The norm squared is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Since theta is in the x-z plane, we might have to consider whether the components are real or complex.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the Pauli matrices and their eigenvectors. For example, the eigenstates are the spin-up and spin-down states along a particular direction. Spin-up along n is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2 ))^T, and spin-down is (−sin(theta/2 ), cos(theta/2 ))^T. Or something like that.

Wait, I think that in the case of spin-1/2 particles, the eigenstates for spin along direction n are given by:

|+> = [ e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) ; e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2) ]

But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero. So e^{-i phi/2} = 1, so the state is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but looking at the options, one of them is option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but looking at the options:

Option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), so that's exactly what I have here. But wait, the question is about the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the state I have is normalized already?

Wait, what's the normalization? Let's compute |a|^2 + |b|^2.

a = cos(theta/2 ), b = sin(theta/2 )

So |a|^2 = cos²(theta/2 ), |b|^2 = sin²(theta/2 )

Sum is cos² + sin² = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Wait, but the options have some options with hbar multiplied in, like option A, D. But in our solution, the components are just cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the eigenvector is for the operator P which is expressed in terms of P_x, P_y, P_z. Each of these is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

But the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, so the eigenvectors are normalized as I found.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches our solution. But let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which looks like the spherical coordinates for a point on the sphere, but that would be for a different parametrization, like for a spin-1 system perhaps, but we're dealing with spin-1/2. So option B is probably for higher spin.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, but I'm not sure how that would come into play here. Also, the presence of hbar in the components is a bit odd because eigenvectors are usually dimensionless.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar, and then trigonometric functions of theta/2. That seems more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the eigenvector we found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)], but the question is giving the components in terms of some hbar. Wait, no, the eigenvectors are just vectors, their components are dimensionless. So option C is correct.

But wait, looking at the options again, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but let me confirm the direction of the operator.

Wait, the operator P is given, but I think the problem is actually about the spin operator. So the eigenvector is for the spin component along n, which would be the same as I derived.

But wait, looking again at the problem statement. It says, "the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator vec{P} for a muon along an arbitrary direction vec{n} lying in the x-z plane." So vec{P} is the operator, and the eigenvector is an eigenstate of P along n.

So I think my earlier approach is correct, leading me to option C as the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me think again. Since the operator is (P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ), the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait, another approach: because the operator is a 2x2 matrix, and the eigenvalues are ±ħ/2, the eigenvectors can be found as I did, leading to [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So answer C would be correct.

Wait, but what about the other options? Let me see. Option D has sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3) multiplied by hbar and trigonometric functions of theta/2. That seems to add some coefficients, which I don't think are present in this problem.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the eigenvector is not [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)] but something else. Because in the earlier step, when I set b = sin(theta/2), perhaps that's not the only possibility. Alternatively, I could have set a = cos(theta/2), but perhaps the actual eigenvector is expressed differently.

Wait, perhaps I need to reconsider the direction. Because the direction is along n, which is in the x-z plane, so phi=0. So the spinor should be [e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2), e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2)]^T. But since phi is zero, it's [cos(theta/2
