Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. The options are A to D, with numbers 8, 4, 10, and 7. Hmm, okay.

First, I'll break down each step of the reaction to understand what's happening.

Step 1: The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. It's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, sodium iodide and dibromomethyl groups... Oh, I remember that sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, especially in an SN2 reaction. Also, when there's a dihalide like dibromomethyl, maybe some kind of elimination or coupling is happening here. Oh, right! This sounds like a Diels-Alder reaction setup. But wait, the diene and dienophileâ€”no, wait, the starting material is a diene. Let me think.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo structure with a diene. The other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is itself a diene, right? But it has two dibromomethyl groups on carbons 5 and 6.

Wait, but the starting material (bicyclo) is a diene as well. So perhaps the first step is a Diels-Alder reaction between the bicyclo compound and the cyclohexadiene? Or perhaps it's a coupling reaction where the diene acts as a dienophile, but that doesn't make much sense because the dienophile is usually more electron-deficient.

Alternatively, maybe it's a [4+2] cycloaddition between the two dienes, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the first reaction uses 2 equivalents of the cyclohexadiene. So maybe each equivalent is adding across the bicyclo structure. Alternatively, perhaps the tert-butoxy group is leaving, and we're getting some kind of substitution.

Wait, tert-butoxy is a good leaving group? No, wait, tert-butoxy is O-t-Bu, which is a poor leaving group because it's a strong base. Oh, but with sodium iodide, perhaps it's a Finkelstein reaction. But Finkelstein is usually for swapping halides, like iodide for bromide or chloride. Wait, but in this case, the starting material has an oxygen leaving group. Hmm, maybe elimination is more likely.

Alternatively, maybe
