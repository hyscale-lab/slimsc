Okay, so I've got this problem about diatomic molecules and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and a photon is absorbed to switch to the next lowest energy state. I remember that in the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized and have both rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the molecule is at the ground state for both vibrations and rotation.

When a photon is absorbed, the molecule moves to the next state with the lowest energy. That probably means the next higher energy level. But what's the order of energy levels here? I think vibrational energy levels are higher than rotational ones because the vibrational energy is much larger. So the next state would likely involve an increase in the vibrational state, or maybe a change in both.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." Oh, that suggests the next possible state, which might be the first excited state. So it's moving from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited state, which could be either an increase in rotational or vibrational energy.

But wait, in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of both. The energy levels are quantized, and the transition depends on the selection rules. For diatomic molecules, the vibrational transitions are typically Δv = ±1, and rotational transitions are ΔJ = ±1, but I'm not entirely sure about the selection rules here. Oh wait, the selection rules for vibrational transitions usually allow Δv = ±1, and for rotation, ΔJ = ±1. But when a photon is absorbed, it can cause a change in either or both, depending on the photon's energy.

But the problem states that the molecule is in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would likely be the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or perhaps a rotationally excited state (v=0, J=1). But I'm not sure which of these requires a lower energy photon.

Wait, the energy of a photon depends on its frequency, which is determined by the energy difference between the
