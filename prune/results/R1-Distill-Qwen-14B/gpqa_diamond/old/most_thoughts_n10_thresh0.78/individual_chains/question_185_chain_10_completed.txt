Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about Hamiltonian operators and eigenvalues. Hmm, let me think. The question gives me a Hamiltonian H equal to epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh right, sigma is the Pauli vector, which is made up of the Pauli spin matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The dot product would be sigma_x n_x + sigma_y n_y + sigma_z n_z. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2. The operator H must have eigenvalues because it's a Hermitian operator, right? All Hamiltonians are Hermitian, so the eigenvalues should be real.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix in the direction of n would depend on the components. Oh wait, more generally, for a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator S is (hbar/2) sigma. So S·n would have eigenvalues plus and minus hbar/2. But this H is epsilon times sigma·n. So maybe I can think of H as proportional to the spin component in the direction of n.

If H is epsilon multiplied by the dot product, then the eigenvalues should be proportional to epsilon. Because when you have a dot product of sigma and a unit vector, the eigenvalues are plus and minus 1. Wait, let me think again. The term sigma·n is a matrix, and its eigenvalues are the components of sigma in the direction of n. Since n is a unit vector, the maximum eigenvalue would be 1, the minimum -1.

So the eigenvalues of sigma·n are ±1. Then H = epsilon (sigma·n ), so each eigenvalue would be multiplied by epsilon. So H's eigenvalues would be ±epsilon. That would make the eigenvalues plus and minus epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B says plus epsilon and minus epsilon. Option C has hbar/2 factors. Wait, why would that be? Oh, because sometimes Pauli matrices are multiplied by hbar/2 in the spin operator. But in this problem, H is just epsilon times sigma·n, so the factor is epsilon, not involving hbar. So the eigenvalues are simply ±epsilon, which is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. I should double-check. The Pauli matrices when multiplied by a unit vector n form a matrix whose trace is zero. The trace is the sum of eigenvalues, so if the eigenvalues are ±a, the trace is zero because a -a =0. Which matches because sigma·n has trace 0. And the determinant would be (1)(-1) = -1. Does sigma·n have a determinant of -1? Hmm, the matrix sigma·n is a 2x2 matrix. Let's take an example: say n is along z. So sigma·n is sigma_z, which is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. The determinant is (1)(-1) -0= -1. So yes, the determinant is -1. The product of the eigenvalues is determinant, so (±a)(∓a) = -a². But in our case, a is 1, so product is -1. So eigenvalues are ±1, so our initial conclusion holds.

So H would have eigenvalues ±epsilon. So option B is correct.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), as this operator is a projection of the Pauli matrices in the direction of \( \vec{n} \). Since \( H \) is proportional to \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \), not just \( \pm 1 \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as it matches the eigenvalues derived from the Hamiltonian.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not include a factor of \( \hbar/2 \).
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \) and is unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

Answer: B
