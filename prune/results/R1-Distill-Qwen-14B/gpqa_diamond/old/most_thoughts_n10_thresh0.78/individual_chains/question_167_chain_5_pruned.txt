Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. It's about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, let me think through this.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). So first, I need to compute N when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Let me plug in the values. Phi is -pi/4, so 2*phi is -pi/2. Sin(-pi/2) is -1. Alpha is 0.5, so 2*alpha squared is 2*(0.25) = 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. 

So N squared is 1 + (-1) * 0.6065. That would be 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Therefore, N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275. But wait, N is a normalization constant, so the state should be normalized. Let me check: |cos(phi)|^2 + |sin(phi)|^2 multiplied by some factors? Wait no, because the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha> with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), multiplied by 1/N.

Wait, but the normalization is given by N squared being 1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²). So when phi is -pi/4, sin(2phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 is 1 - exp(-2 alpha²). Let me compute that.

With alpha = 0.5, 2 alpha² = 2*(0.25) = 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approx 0.6065. So N^2 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6273.

Wait, but the state is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So when I compute the density matrix rho for |psi>, it's |psi><psi|.

The problem is about calculating the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussianity here is measured as the relative entropy between the state and a Gaussian state. But for the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of coherent states, it's highly non-Gaussian because it's a macroscopic superposition. So the relative entropy should be positive, indicating non-Gaussian features.

But wait, what is the reference Gaussian state tau? I think the reference is typically the state that the non
