Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is about finding the energy at which the gamma rays' lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. Hmm, I remember something about photon-photon interactions and pair production. Let me try to think this through.

The reaction given is γγ → e+ e-. So, a high-energy gamma-ray photon interacts with a CMB photon to produce an electron-positron pair. The average energy of CMB photons is given as 10^-3 eV. I think the CMB photons are the low-energy ones, while the gamma rays are the high-energy ones here.

Wait, the problem is about the lifetime of the gamma rays being limited by this process. So, I guess this involves the probability of the gamma-ray photon annihilating with a CMB photon before it travels a certain distance. The mean free path or something like that? The mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. If the mean free path is shorter than the size of the universe, then the lifetime would be limited by this process. So, if the gamma rays have a mean free path smaller than the universe's size, they won't travel far and their number would decrease, hence their lifetime is limited.

But wait, the question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. So, when the cross-section for this interaction becomes significant, the gamma rays would not propagate far, so their lifetime is determined by their interaction time.

I think the cross-section for pair production by photon-photon interactions (like this) depends on the energy of the photons. The formula for the cross-section might be something like σ ∝ 1/(s) or something else, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. But wait, the cross-section for pair production from two photons is a bit tricky.

Alternatively, I remember that the interaction rate depends on the photon density, their energy, and the cross-section. The interaction probability per unit length (like in a photon's path) would be n * σ * v, where n is the number density of the target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity. But wait, since both photons are moving, it might be a bit more complicated. But perhaps for high
