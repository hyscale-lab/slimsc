Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, let's think through it step by step.

So the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (p) is the reciprocal of distance (d) in parsecs, so d = 1/p. Wait, no wait, actually, the formula is p = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with parallax. So we're looking at N, the number of stars, as a function of the parallax range. I think this involves some volume considerations because stars are spread out in space.

Since stars are uniformly distributed, the number in a certain volume should be proportional to the volume. So if I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be the surface area of the sphere (4πr²) multiplied by dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be proportional to 4πd² * dr.

But wait, the question isn't about distance, it's about parallax. Parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let me substitute that into the expression. So d² is (1/p)^2 and dr is the change in distance. But since p is 1/d, dr would relate to the change in p. Let me see.

If I have a small change in parallax dp, how does that relate to dr? Since p = 1/d, the derivative dp/dd is -1/d². So dp = - (1/d²) dd. Rearranging, dd = -d² dp. But since we're dealing with small changes, the negative sign just indicates direction, but when considering absolute values, we can ignore it. So |dd| = d² dp.

Now, substituting d = 1/p into |dd|: |dd| = (1/p)^2 dp. So the volume element dr (which is dd) becomes (1/p²) dp in terms of parallax.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of parallax shells. The number of stars in a shell between parallaxes p and p + dp would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a shell in terms of parallax is 4π (d)^2 * (dd). But since d = 1/p, and dd = (1/p²) dp, substituting gives 4π (1/p)^2 * (1/p² dp). So that's 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, that seems off. Let me double-check. The shell's volume should be 4πd² dd. So with d = 1/p and dd = (1/p²) dp, the volume becomes 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to 1/p^4, because the
