Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about reactions involving mCPBA and what happens when the products are run on HPLC columns. Hmm, let me think through this carefully.

Alright, the question says that a chemist does two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene and Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then the products are combined and run on both standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

Wait, what's mCPBA do again? Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So when an alkene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. But wait, the stereochemistry might matter here.

In Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. Since mCPBA is an electrophilic reagent, the epoxidation tends to happen in a way that forms the more substituted epoxide if possible, but I think the main thing is that for each starting alkene, whether E or Z, the epoxidation will form an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry.

Wait, oct-4-ene has four carbons on each end. So (E) and (Z) would refer to the configuration of the double bond. E is trans, and Z is cis.

When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes is a peracid epoxidation, which is stereospecific. The peracid adds across the double bond, creating an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the double bond. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The epoxidation via mCPBA proceeds through a cyclic transition state. The peracid adds across the double bond, and the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene.

Wait, no, actually, no. I think the addition is such that the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting double bond's configuration. For example,
