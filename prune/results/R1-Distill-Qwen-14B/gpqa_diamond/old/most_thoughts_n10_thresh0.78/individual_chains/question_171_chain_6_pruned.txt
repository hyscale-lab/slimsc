Okay, so I've got this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question is asking me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced when they undergo an electrophilic substitution with excess bromine. The bromine is in excess, so I guess that means the reaction goes to completion, and probably more than one substitution occurs, but the question is about the mono-bromo derivative. Wait, no, no, wait. Oh, the question says only one monobromo is formed. So each will substitute once.

So each of these substituents on the benzene ring will direct the bromine in a certain way. The position where the bromine adds will depend on the substituent's directing effects. Electron-donating groups activate the ring and are ortho/para directors. Electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring and are meta directors, unless they're strong EDG.

Looking at the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating group, EDG by alkyl chain. So it's an ortho/para director.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Wait, that's benzoyloxyethoxy group? No, wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Or maybe I'm misreading. Oh wait, no, the substituent is -COOEt. So that's an ester group. Esters are usually meta directors because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. But wait, the ester is an electron-withdrawing group via the carbonyl, but the oxygen is an EDG in some cases. Wait, actually, esters are deactivating because the carbonyl pulls electrons away. So they are meta directors.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine substituent. Chlorine is an interesting case. It's an electron-withdrawing group (because of its electronegativity) but it's ortho/para directing. Because, although it's deactivating, the lone pairs on Cl can donate into the ring through resonance, making the ring more activated in ortho and para positions than meta.

Wait, so Cl is a deactivating (because of -I effect) and orth
