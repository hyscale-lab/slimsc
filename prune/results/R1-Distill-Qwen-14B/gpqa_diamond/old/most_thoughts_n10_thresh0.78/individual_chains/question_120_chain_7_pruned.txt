Alright, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution with parallax. Hmm, okay. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. The parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So, a star with a larger parallax is closer to us, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away. Got that.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniform distribution implies that the number density of stars is the same in all directions. So, if I imagine a small volume around a point, the number of stars in that volume depends only on the size of the volume, not the direction.

I think I need to relate the number of stars per unit range of parallax to the parallax itself. So, how does the number of stars change as parallax changes?

Let me think about the relationship between parallax and distance. Parallax plx is given by plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Or wait, actually, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / (distance in parsecs). So, distance d (in parsecs) = 1 / plx.

Now, the number of stars in a thin shell at distance d with thickness dr would be the surface area of the shell multiplied by the number density of stars. Since the distribution is uniform, the number density is constant. So, the number of stars N in a thin shell is approximately 4π d² * (dr) * n, where n is the number density.

But wait, I'm being asked about the number per unit range of parallax. So, perhaps I should express this in terms of plx rather than d.

Let me change variables. Since d = 1/plx, then dr = (-1/(plx²)) d plx. Hmm, because dr = derivative of d with respect to plx times d plx. Let's see: d = 1/plx, so dr/dplx = -1/(plx²). So, dr = -d plx / plx².

But since I'm considering a thin shell between plx and plx + dplx, I can approximate the number of stars N in this shell as:

N = 4π d² * (dr) * n

Substituting d = 1/plx and dr from above:

N = 4π (1/plx)^2 * ( -d plx / plx² ) * n

Wait, the negative just indicates direction, but since we're dealing with magnitudes, maybe I can ignore the sign. So, taking absolute value, N = 4π (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx²) * n

Simplify that: N = 4π n (1/plx²) * (d plx / plx²) )

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express the substitution correctly.

Wait, the surface area is 4π d², which is 4π (1/plx)^2.

The thickness dr in terms of plx is |dr| = (1/plx²) d plx. Because as plx increases, distance decreases, so when plx increases by dplx, distance decreases by dr = (1/plx²) dplx.

So, substituting into N:

N = 4π d² * dr * n = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (d plx / plx²) ) * n.

So, N = 4π n (1/plx^4) (d plx)

Wait, that's 4π n / plx^4 multiplied by d plx. So, the number of stars per unit range of plx (d plx) would be proportional to 1/plx^4.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of plx, so the number density in plx space. So, the number of stars per unit plx (d plx) is N/(d plx) = (4π n) * (1/plx^4).

Wait, but that seems too steep. Because as plx increases (which means closer stars), there should be more stars in a given plx range, right? Wait, wait, no, because the number per unit plx would actually decrease as plx increases.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars in a thin shell is N = 4π d² dr * n. Since d = 1/plx, dr is the change in distance. But we're considering a change in plx, dplx. So, dr = (d dplx) = ( -1/plx² ) dplx.

Wait
