Okay, I need to figure out the possible decay channels for the boson X based on the given Lagrangian and the mass of X being 6 GeV. Let me start by understanding the problem.

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f_bar ψ(y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, looking again, maybe it's written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, perhaps that's a typo. Oh wait, maybe the correct form is more like -λ f [ψ_f]^dagger (v + X) ψ_f. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as L = λ f ψ_f bar (v + X) ψ_f. But the exact form might not matter as much as the interaction terms.

Wait, the interaction term would be something like λ f ψ_f† (X) ψ_f, meaning that the boson X couples to the fermion ψ_f. So the vertex would involve X and two fermions of type ψ_f. So X can decay into a pair of these fermions.

But wait, what is ψ_f here? I'm a bit confused. The fermion field could be, say, a lepton or a quark. The problem doesn't specify, but perhaps the fermions ψ_f are quarks, since the term uses f and f bar.

Wait, looking at the options, the decay products are things like b bbar, c cbar, etc., which are quarks. So perhaps ψ_f is a quark field.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So for a decay X → f fbar, the sum of the masses of the fermions must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because the rest mass of X is 6 GeV, and in the center-of-mass frame, the invariant mass must be at least twice the rest mass of the decay products.

So each fermion f must have a mass
