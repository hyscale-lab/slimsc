Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I remember that these spectrographs have different magnitude limits, so I need to figure out which stars are bright enough for both.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different properties. I'll need to calculate their apparent magnitudes to see if they fall within the observable range of both instruments.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, which I think means apparent magnitude less than 17 because lower magnitudes are brighter. And HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag, so apparent magnitude less than 16. So any star that's brighter than 16 mag would be visible to both, but ESPRESSO can also see up to 17. But wait, no, the question says 'brighter than 17' for ESPRESSO. Wait, no, magnitude works in reverse—lower numbers are brighter. So if a star has apparent V magnitude brighter than 17, that would mean it's less than 17, right? Because 17 is fainter than 16. So ESPRESSO can detect down to 17 mag, which is fainter than HIRES's 16 mag.

So to be detected by both, the star's apparent magnitude must be less than or equal to 16 because that's the stricter limit. Because if a star is fainter than 16 (like 16.5), HIRES can't see it, but ESPRESSO can. Wait, but the problem asks for stars detectable by both, so they must be within the range where both can see them. So the apparent magnitude must be ≤16 mag for HIRES, and ≤17 for ESPRESSO. So the overlap is up to 16 mag.

So I need to compute each star's apparent magnitude and see which are ≤16.

Let me go through each star:

Star1: Absolute magnitude Mv is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Oh wait, absolute magnitude is how bright it would appear
