Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are considered inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so we're dealing with relative motion and maybe some time dilation? Or is it about velocity addition? Because both frames are inertial, so perhaps I should use the Galilean transformations instead of the Lorentz ones, since the velocities might be high but I'm not sure if relativistic effects are significant here. Let me think.

Wait, the speed given is 60,000 km/s. Let me convert that to a fraction of the speed of light to see if relativistic effects matter. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times the speed of light. Hmm, that's 20% the speed. So maybe relativistic effects are non-negligible. Oh wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution, so maybe it's more of a kinematics problem rather than a gravitational one.

Wait, the question is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame. So, Galaxy's frame is the rest frame, and the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But no, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving at that speed towards the ejecta. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no. Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because the velocity is just opposite in the two frames. So the two frames are moving at 60,000 km/s relative to each other.
