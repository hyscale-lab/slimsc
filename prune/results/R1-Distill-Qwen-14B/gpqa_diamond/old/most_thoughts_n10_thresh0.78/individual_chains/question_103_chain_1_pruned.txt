Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound from benzene. Let me read the question carefully.

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, so that's a ketone with substituents on the benzene ring. Let me break it down. The phenyl group attached to the ketone (ethan-1-one) has bromo and nitro groups. The positions are 3-bromo and 5-nitro. Wait, numbering the benzene ring, that would mean the nitro is at position 5, which is meta to the ketone group. And bromo is at position 3, which is ortho to the ketone? Let me visualize the structure.

Ethan-1-one is acetone, so the carbonyl is on the ethyl group. So the benzene ring is attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the benzene ring is at position 1 of the ethanone. Then, the substituents on the benzene are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, nitro at 5, bromo at 3.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric. So maybe the substituents are in meta positions relative to each other? Let me think. If the ketone is at position 1, then the bromo is at 3 (which is two positions away, so meta), and nitro at 5 (also meta). Wait, but 3 and 5 are adjacent positions to each other. So the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone, which are themselves adjacent.

Now, the question is about the sequence of reactions starting from benzene. So I need to plan the synthesis steps.

The target has three substituents: nitro, bromo, and the ketone group.

But benzene is starting material. So I need to add these groups in the correct order so that the directing effects of the substituents allow the next group to be added in the desired position.

Let's recall that nitro groups are strong meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para but deactivating. The ketone group (like an acetyl group, which is an electron-withdrawing group) is also meta-directing.

Wait, but the ketone is attached as an ethan-1-one, so it's an acetyl group attached to benzene. So benzene ring attached to a carbonyl (C=O) connected to a CH2CH3? Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, so when attached to benzene, the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2C=O, but wait, actually, ethan-1-one is (CH3)COH? Wait, no, wait. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone. Structure is (propan-2-one), which is (CH3)2CO. Oh wait, no. Wait the position of the ketone. For ethane, the possible ketone would be (CH3)CO, but wait, ethan-1-one would have the ketone at position 1. Hmm, maybe I should double-check the nomenclature.

Wait, ethan-1-one: the longest chain has two carbons, with the ketone at position 1. So that's not possible because a ketone requires at least two carbons on each side. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's a benzene ring with
