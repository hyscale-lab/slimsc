Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's see, the question is about identifying compound X after a reaction. The product's NMR data is given, and I need to figure out what the original compound was.

The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh right, but under certain conditions, maybe it's used for something else. Wait, no, no, wait: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a strong, bulky base. Oh, but wait, sometimes it's used in the context of epoxide formation. Or wait, no, maybe it's more about elimination reactions. Oh, but wait, another thought: there's a reaction called the ring-opening of epoxides, but sometimes bases can induce that. Alternatively, maybe it's used for other types of ring-forming reactions, like in some cyclopropanations? Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps the question is about the formation of an epoxide? Because the product's NMR shows some signals that might be from an epoxide.

Wait, but the product's data is given. So the product is the result after the reaction. So the starting material, compound X, must have reacted to form this product. Let's think about what reaction this might be.

Wait, the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which I think is a base. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation. Wait, no, epoxidation usually uses peracids. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diene or something else.

Wait, no, perhaps the reaction is an elimination. Because sometimes, in the presence of a strong base, alcohols can eliminate to form alkenes or epoxides. Hmm, wait, but the product's NMR
