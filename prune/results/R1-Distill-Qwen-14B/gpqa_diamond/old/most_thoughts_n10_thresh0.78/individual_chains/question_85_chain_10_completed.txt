Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, the question says there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun's, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods, which probably means we can get both mass and radius from those.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and a radius of 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same for both, I can ignore that in the calculation.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Oh right, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. The formula I remember is something like Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4).

Wait, but wait, albedo is the same for both, so the ratio would simplify a bit. Let me think about the steps.

So, the star's effective temperature is given as 6300 K, which is a bit cooler than the Sun (which is around 5778 K, I think). The star's luminosity can be found using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σTeff^4. But for the planet's equilibrium temperature, I don't need to compute the actual luminosity because the ratio will involve the star's T and R, maybe.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is: Te = T_star * sqrt( (R_star) / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ). Since A is the same for both, that term will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio will be T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) is sqrt( a2/(a1) ). So it's sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But how do I find a1 and a2? Because the question mentions the RV method and the shifts in the forbidden line. The RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit, which relates to the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula: K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and the planet masses are much less than the star's mass (1.5 solar masses), M_planet is negligible compared to M_star, so K ≈ ( (2π G) / P )^(1/3) * ( M_planet sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )

But wait, the question gives the shifts in terms of wavelength. Shifts are given in Angstroms. For the RV method, the velocity is related to the Doppler shift via the formula Δλ/λ = v/c. So the measured velocity K is (Δλ) * c / λ.

Given the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å, and the shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So K1 = 0.03e-10 m / 6300e-10 m * c ≈ (0.03 / 6300) * c. Wait, but I need to compute the velocities.

Wait, actually, the formula is v = (Δλ/λ) * c. So for Planet1, the shift is 0.03 Å, so Δλ = 0.03 Å. λ is 6300 Å. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, where c is the speed of light. Similarly for v2: 0.04 / 6300 * c.

But K is the semi-amplitude of the RV, which is the velocity of the star due to the planet. So K1 = v1, K2 = v2.

But wait, the formula for K is ( (v) ) = ( (27.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(P^(1/3) )) ) ) * (1/sqrt(1-e²)) )

But since e=0, and P is the orbital period, but without knowing the period, how can I find a? Because a is related to P via Kepler's third law: (a^3)/(P^2) = G(M_star)/(4π²)

But without knowing P, I need another approach.

Alternatively, knowing that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (P)^(1/3) ) ). Hmm, but if the inclination angle i is the same for both planets (since both transit, so i is likely 90 degrees), sin i =1.

Wait, but I don't know P for each planet. Hmm. Maybe I can find the ratio of a1 and a2.

Wait, from Kepler's third law: (a^3) = (G M_star P² ) / (4 π² )

But I don't have P. However, perhaps I can find the ratio of a1 and a2 using the ratio of K and M_p.

Because K is proportional to (M_p) / a^(1/2) ), because from the formula: K = (v) = (2 π G )^(1/3) (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) (a^(1/3)) )

Wait, because from the formula, K = (v) = ( (2π G ) / (P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But from Kepler's law, P² = (4 π² a³ ) / ( G (M_star + M_p) )

Substituting P into the K equation:

K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( ( M_star )^(2/3) ) ) * ( ( 4 π² a³ / (G M_star) )^(-1/6) ) )

Wait, let me try to substitute P.

P = sqrt( (4 π² a^3 )/( G M_star ) )

So P^(1/3) = ( (4 π² a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(1/6 )

So K = ( (2 π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * ( (4 π² a^3 )/( G M_star ) )^(-1/6 )

Simplify the exponents:

Let me compute the exponents for each term.

2 π G to the 1/3.

4 π² a^3 to the -1/6.

G is in the denominator inside the a^3 term, so when raised to -1/6, it becomes G^(1/6).

Similarly, M_star in denominator, so (M_star)^(-1/3) from 4 π² a^3 / (G M_star).

Wait, perhaps it's better to combine the terms.

Wait, (4 π² a^3 / ( G M_star )) )^( -1/6 ) = [ a^3/(G M_star) ) *4 π² ]^(-1/6 )

But 4 π² is a constant, so when raised to -1/6, it becomes (4 π²)^(-1/6).

So K becomes:

(2 π G )^(1/3) * M_p / (M_star^(2/3)) ) * (4 π² )^(-1/6) * (G M_star a^3 )^(1/6 )

Wait, because [a^3/(G M_star)]^(-1/6) = (a^3)^(-1/6) )*(G M_star )^(1/6 ) = a^(-0.5) G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6 )

So putting it all together:

K = [ (2 π )^(1/3) G^(1/3) ) * M_p ] / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (4 π² )^(-1/6 ) * G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) a^(-1/2 )

Multiply the G terms: G^(1/3 + 1/6 ) = G^(1/2 )

M_star terms: M_star^( -2/3 + 1/6 ) = M_star^(-1/2 )

So K = (2 π )^(1/3) * (4 π² )^(-1/6 ) * M_p * sqrt(G) ) / ( sqrt(M_star) ) * a^(-1/2 )

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps we can simplify.

Let me compute the constants:

(2 π )^(1/3) * (4 π² )^(-1/6 )

Let me write 4 as 2^2, so 4 π² = 2^2 π².

So (4 π² )^(-1/6 ) = (2² π² )^(-1/6 ) = 2^(-2/6) π^(-2/6 ) = 2^(-1/3) π^(-1/3)

So the constants part:

(2 π )^(1/3) * (2^(-1/3) π^(-1/3) ) ) = [ 2^(1/3) * 2^(-1/3) ) ] * [ π^(1/3) * π^(-1/3) ) ] = 2^0 * π^0 = 1.

So the constants cancel out.

So K becomes M_p * sqrt( G ) / ( sqrt( M_star ) ) * a^(-1/2 )

Wait, so K = ( M_p / sqrt( M_star ) ) * sqrt( G ) / sqrt( a )

Wait, but sqrt(G) is a constant, so K is proportional to ( M_p ) / sqrt( a ) )

Because M_p and a are variables here.

So K ∝ M_p / sqrt(a )

Therefore, K1 / K2 = ( M_p1 / sqrt( a1 ) ) / ( M_p2 / sqrt( a2 ) ) )

Which can be rearranged to ( K1 / K2 ) = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We can solve for sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = ( K1 / K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again.

From K ∝ M_p / sqrt( a ), so K = (some constant) * M_p / sqrt( a )

Thus, K1 = C * M_p1 / sqrt( a1 )

K2 = C * M_p2 / sqrt( a2 )

Dividing both equations: K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We can rearrange to find sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = ( K1/K2 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

But I have K1 and K2 from the given shifts.

Wait, K is the velocity amplitude. So K1 = (0.03 Å / 6300 Å ) * c , and K2 = (0.04 Å / 6300 Å ) * c.

So K1/K2 = (0.03)/(0.04) ) = 3/4 = 0.75

So K1/K2 = 0.75

M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses.

So M_p2 / M_p1 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

So sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = (0.75) * (0.714) ≈ 0.75 * 0.714 ≈ 0.5355.

So a2 ≈ (0.5355)^2 * a1 ≈ 0.2867 a1.

Wait, but actually, the ratio sqrt(a2/a1) is 0.5355. So a2/a1 = (0.5355)^2 ≈ 0.2867 → a2 ≈ 0.2867 a1.

Wait, no: sqrt(a2/a1) = 0.5355 → a2/a1 = (0.5355)^2 ≈ 0.2867 → a1 = a2 / 0.2867 ≈ 3.48 a2.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let's go back.

Equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because earlier, I derived that the ratio Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because the formula is Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ... so when taking the ratio Te1/Te2, the R_star and T_star terms cancel out, and we're left with sqrt( a2 / (a1) ) because:

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if sqrt( a2 / a1 ) is 0.5355, then T1/T2 = 0.5355 → T1 is cooler than T2 by that factor.

Wait, but wait. Let's recap:

The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - A )^(1/4) )

So Te1/Te2 = [ sqrt( R/(2a1) ) ] / [ sqrt( R/(2a2) ) ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is what I have earlier.

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

And from the earlier calculation, sqrt( a2 /a1 ) = 0.5355.

So Te1 / Te2 ≈ 0.5355.

So the ratio is approximately 0.5355, which is about 0.53 when rounded.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, option A is ~0.98, D is ~1.05, B is ~1.30.

So the ratio is Te1/Te2 ≈ 0.53, so the ratio is approximately 0.53.

But wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

We have K1/K2 = 3/4 = 0.75

M_p2 / M_p1 =5/7 ≈0.7143

So sqrt(a2/a1) = (K1/K2) * (M_p2/M_p1) = 0.75 * 0.7143 ≈ 0.5357.

So sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈0.5357.

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈0.5357.

Which is approximately 0.5357, so 0.536. So the ratio is about 0.536.

But wait, the question asks for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. So it's T1 over T2.

So the ratio is approximately 0.536. So 0.53 is option C.

Wait, but wait another point. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the distance. So the approach seems correct.

So the equilibrium temperature ratio is (Te1)/(Te2) ≈ 0.5357.

So the correct answer is option C, ~0.53.

But wait, let me think again about whether the ratio is correct.

Because, the formula for Te is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So the planet that is farther from the star will have a lower equilibrium temperature.

So if a1 is larger than a2, then Planet1 is farther, so T1 is lower than T2. So the ratio T1/T2 would be less than 1.

In our calculation, sqrt(a2/a1) is about 0.5357. So Planet2 is closer, so T2 is higher.

So the ratio T1/T2 is 0.5357, which is option C.

Yes, that's correct.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e = T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \left(1 - A\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo (\(A\)), the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Here, \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) are the orbital distances of Planet1 and Planet2 from the star, respectively. To find this ratio, we need to determine \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) using the radial velocity (RV) data provided.

The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

where \(M_p\) is the planet's mass and \(a\) is its orbital distance. Rearranging, we find:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Solving for \(\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{K_1}{K_2} \cdot \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}
\]

The RV shifts are given as \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), so:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

The masses of the planets are \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\) and \(M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\), so:

\[
\frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 0.75 \cdot 0.714 \approx 0.5357
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx 0.5357
\]

This corresponds to a ratio of approximately \(0.53\), meaning Planet1 has a lower equilibrium temperature than Planet2.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **A) ~0.98**: Incorrect, as the ratio is much smaller than 1.
- **B) ~1.30**: Incorrect, as this would imply Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, which contradicts the data.
- **C) ~0.53**: Correct, matches the calculated ratio.
- **D) ~1.05**: Incorrect, as the ratio is closer to 0.53, not 1.05.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
