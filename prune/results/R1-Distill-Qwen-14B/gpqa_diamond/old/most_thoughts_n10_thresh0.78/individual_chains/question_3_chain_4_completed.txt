Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a spin-half particle in a specific state, which is a linear combination of spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. And the problem asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator gives the average value you'd expect to measure if you measured that observable many times on identically prepared systems. So for an operator O, the expectation value ⟨O⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

Wait, right, the state here is a linear combination of the eigenstates of σz, which are |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Since σz is the Pauli z-matrix, its eigenvalues are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The operator in question is 10σz +5σx. So to find the expectation value, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So I need to compute the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them.

Let me write down the state vector more clearly. The state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1. So (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 1. So it's normalized, which is good.

First, calculate ⟨σz⟩. Since σz |↑⟩ = |↑⟩ (because σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ ), and σz |↓⟩ = -|↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the inner product of ψ with σz acting on ψ.

So ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ = (0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓| ) σz (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ ) )

Expanding this, the cross terms would involve σz acting on the other states. But since σz is diagonal in the computational basis, the cross terms (like σz |↓⟩ in ⟨↑|) would be zero. Let me see:

Each term would be 0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|σz|↑⟩ + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σz|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σz|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ⟨↓|σz|↓⟩.

But σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, so ⟨↑|σz|↑⟩ = +1. Similarly, σz|↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩, so ⟨↓|σz|↓⟩ is -1.

The cross terms, ⟨↑|σz|↓⟩ is ⟨↑| (-1 |↓⟩ ) which is -⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0. Similarly, ⟨↓|σz|↑⟩ is ⟨↓| (+1 |↑⟩ ) = 0. So those cross terms vanish.

So the expectation value becomes:

0.5^2 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1) = (0.25)(1) + (3/4)(-1) → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me compute it again. Oh, because the coefficient for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4). So the first term is 0.5^2 *1 =0.25. The second term is (3/4)*(-1) = -0.75. Summing them gives 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2. The expectation value of σz is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). So |a|^2 is 0.25, |b|^2 is 3/4=0.75. So 0.25*1 + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Right, that's correct.

So the expectation of σz is -0.5. Therefore, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But in this case, since the state is in the σz basis, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that σx can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as:

σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|

So when you apply σx to |ψ⟩, you get:

σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 σx |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) σx |↓⟩.

But σx |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σx |↓⟩ = |↑⟩. So σx |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩ is the inner product of (0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓| ) with (0.5 |↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↑⟩ ).

So when we multiply, we get:

0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|↓⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|↑⟩.

Wait, let's compute each term:

First term: 0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|↓⟩ → 0.25 * 0 =0.

Second term: 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2 ) * ⟨↑|↑⟩ → (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) *1 = (sqrt(3)/4).

Third term: (sqrt(3)/2) *0.5 * ⟨↓|↓⟩ → (sqrt(3)/4) *1 = sqrt(3)/4.

Fourth term: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * ⟨↓|↑⟩ → (3/4)*0=0.

So summing all terms: 0 + sqrt(3)/4 + sqrt(3)/4 + 0 = (sqrt(3)/4)*2 = sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, let me calculate that again. Wait, sqrt(3)/4 plus sqrt(3)/4 is (2 sqrt(3))/4 = sqrt(3)/2. So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, but wait. Another way to think about it: for a spin-1/2 system, the expectation value of σx is given by ( |b|^2 - |a|^2 ) where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩ and b is that of |↓⟩. Because:

⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + 2 Re( a b* ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ ) + |b|^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

But σx has off-diagonal elements. Alternatively, perhaps another approach is better. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, σx in the basis of |↑⟩, |↓⟩ is represented by the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in that basis, any state |ψ⟩ can be written as [a, b]^T, where a is the coefficient of |↑⟩, and b is that of |↓⟩.

So the expectation value of σx is given by ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, which is [a*, b*] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [a; b].

Which would be a* b + b* a.

So for real coefficients a and b (as in this case, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2), it's 2ab. Because a* =a, b* =b, so 2ab.

So in this case, a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2 ) = (2)*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2 )= (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2 *2) ) → Wait, let me compute it: 2ab= 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2 )= (2 * 0.5 ) * (sqrt(3)/2 )= (1) * (sqrt(3)/2 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Yes, that matches the earlier calculation. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660254.

So putting this together, the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is:

10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Calculating each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 * 0.8660254 ≈4.330127.

So adding them together: -5 +4.330127 ≈ -0.669873.

Wait, this is approximately -0.67. But wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866. So 5 * 0.866 is 4.33. So 10σz gives -5, adding 4.33 gives -0.67.

Wait, but the question gives options up to one decimal place. So let's compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should perform the exact calculation first.

So, 10σz +5σx gives:

10*(-1/2) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) → -5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2.

Wait, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205080757.

So 5 sqrt(3) is approximately 8.66025403785.

Divide by 2: 4.3301270189.

So, -5 +4.3301270189 = -0.6698729811.

So approximately -0.6699, which to one decimal place is -0.7 (since the second decimal is 6, which is >=5, so round up the first to -0.7).

Wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, the number is approximately -0.6699, which is -0.67 when rounded to two decimal places. But the question asks for up to one decimal place.

So, to one decimal, it's -0.7 because 0.6699 is closer to 0.7 than 0.6 when considering one decimal place.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.6699 is 0.67 when rounded to two decimals, but when rounded to one decimal, it's 0.7.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think: in the number -0.6699, the first decimal is 6 (tenths place), the next is 6 (hundredths). When rounding to one decimal, you look at the hundredths place. Since the hundredths digit is 6, which is >=5, you round the tenths place up: 6 becomes 7. So the number becomes -0.7.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options:

Option C is -0.7. Option A is -1.4, option B is 1.65, option D is 0.85.

So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute the expectation value of σx.

We have |ψ⟩ = a |↑⟩ + b |↓⟩, with a=0.5, b= sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value of σx is 2ab, as we determined earlier. So 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2 )*2 → wait, no, 2ab is 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2 )= (2 * 0.5 * sqrt(3) ) / 2 = (1 * sqrt(3)) / 2 = sqrt(3)/2.

Yes, that's correct. So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is indeed approximately 4.3301.

So, 10σz gives -5, adding 4.3301 gives -0.6699, which rounds to -0.7. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | O | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) have eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(+1) + |b|^2(-1)
\]

where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). The probabilities are:
\[
|a|^2 = 0.5^2 = 0.25, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25(+1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented in the \( |\uparrow\rangle, |\downarrow\rangle \) basis as:
\[
\sigma_x = |\uparrow\rangle\langle\downarrow| + |\downarrow\rangle\langle\uparrow|
\]

The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab
\]

Substituting \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle
\]

Substitute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.6699
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
The value \( -0.6699 \) rounds to \( -0.7 \) when rounded to one decimal place.

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
