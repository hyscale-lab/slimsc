Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break this down.

First, I'll draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize it better. Benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. So, numbering the ring, the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. Wait, 1 would be the first substituent, 2 the second, and 3 the third. But in benzene, numbering depends on the substituents' priorities. The substituents have different priorities based on functional groups. Nitro is higher priority than ethoxy, which is higher than tert-butyl. So the numbering starts from the highest priority group. But wait, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the numbering goes in such a way that the nitro is at position 3, ethoxy at 1, and tert-butyl at 2.

Wait, but in the actual structure, let's think about the substituents. Let me imagine the benzene ring with three substituents. Let's say position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. But wait, the numbering would be such that the substituents get the lowest possible numbers. So which substituent gets the lowest number? Nitro has the highest priority, so it would be position 1, then ethoxy (since O is higher than C), but wait, the substituents' order for priority is: nitro (NO2), then ethoxy (OEt), then tert-butyl (C(C)3).

Wait, the priority order for
