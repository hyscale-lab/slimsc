Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

Astronomers are studying three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They used the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that matters here. The problem gives me ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, masses, and asks about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1.

The key data points are:

- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4, which would mean Planet1 is hotter than Planet2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, equilibrium temperature is given by the formula. Oh right, equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Or wait no, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance, and its albedo. But the problem says the albedos are all equal, so that's the same for all.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula: T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^{1/4} ), or something like that. Wait, maybe the formula is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)) * ( (1 - A)/1 )^{1/4} }, where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital distance, and A is albedo.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the inverse square law. The flux from the star at distance a is F = L / (4πa²), where L is luminosity. The planet absorbs (1 - A) * F, and then radiates as a blackbody, so equilibrium temperature T is given by the equation:

T^4 = (F * (1 - A) ) / (4σ ), where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

So, F = L/(4πa²), so substituting that in:

T^4 = (L/(4πa²) * (1 - A) ) / (4σ) )

Simplify: T^4 = (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ a² )

So, T is proportional to sqrt( L^(1/2) ) / a^(1/2) ), wait, let me rearrange.

Let me take the ratio T1 / T2: (T1/T2)^4 = ( (L1 a2² (1 - A2) ) ) / ( L2 a1² (1 - A1) ) ), but wait, wait, in our case, the problem says all albedos are equal, so (1 - A) is the same for all three. So that term cancels out.

So, (T1/T2)^4 = ( L1 / L2 ) * (a2² / a1² )

Wait, but wait, the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1 = 1.4 * T2
