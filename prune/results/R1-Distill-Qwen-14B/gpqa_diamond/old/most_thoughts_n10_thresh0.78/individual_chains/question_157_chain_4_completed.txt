Okay, so I've got this question about designing a molecular diagnostic kit for a retrovirus outbreak. Hmm, let's break it down.

First, I remember that retroviruses have RNA as their genetic material. So when a person is infected, their body might produce antibodies against the virus. But for a diagnostic test, especially for quick detection, molecular methods are usually more reliable because they can detect the virus earlier than antibody tests.

The question is about designing a kit. So, I'm thinking which method is best for detecting a virus quickly. PCR-based methods are probably the way to go since they can amplify small amounts of genetic material. But what type of PCR?

Option A says nested PCR based on symptoms. Wait, symptoms aren't enough for designing a reliable test. You need specific genetic information to target. Plus, nested PCR is more time-consuming and maybe not the quickest for a diagnostic kit.

Option B suggests cDNA sequencing first. Oh right, cDNA is made from RNA. So if the virus is RNA-based, you'd need to reverse transcribe it to cDNA. Real-time PCR is good because it can quantify the amount of a target in real-time, making it both accurate and quick. That sounds promising.

Option C talks about DNA sequencing. But retroviruses have RNA, not DNA. Unless the virus has integrated into the host genome, but I think the initial test would target the RNA. So maybe this isn't the best approach.

Option D uses ELISA for IgG antibodies. ELISA is used to detect antibodies, which the body produces in response to the virus. But this method might not be as quick because it requires the immune response to develop, which can take time. Also, some patients might not produce enough antibodies, especially early in the infection. So PCR is probably better for early detection.

So putting it together: the first step is to identify the virus. How? Well, since it's a retrovirus, the genetic material is RNA. So I think you'd need to extract RNA from the patient samples and maybe do reverse transcription to make cDNA. Then, using that, you can design primers for PCR.

Wait, but do you need to sequence it first? Or can you just use known sequences? Oh, I think the scenario is that the virus is new or not well characterized. So you might have to identify it first. For that, you'd probably extract the RNA, make cDNA, and sequence it to find specific regions to target with PCR.

Once you have the sequence, you can design primers for real-time PCR, which would allow quick and accurate diagnosis because it's quantitative and can detect even small amounts of the virus.

So looking back at the options, option B says first identify using cDNA sequencing, then real-time PCR. That makes sense.

Option A's nested PCR might not be as efficient as real-time PCR. Option C is DNA sequencing, which doesn't fit for RNA viruses. Option D is for antibodies, which is slower.


To design a molecular diagnostic kit for detecting a retrovirus, it is important to consider the nature of the virus, which has RNA as its genetic material. Molecular methods like PCR are preferred for quick and accurate detection, as they can detect the virus earlier than antibody-based methods like ELISA. Among PCR-based options, real-time PCR is particularly advantageous due to its ability to quantify the target in real time and provide rapid results.

Option A suggests using nested PCR based on symptoms, but symptoms alone are insufficient for designing a reliable test. Symptom-based approaches lack specificity and do not provide the necessary genetic information for targeting the virus.

Option B involves identifying the virus through cDNA sequencing. Since retroviruses have RNA, reverse transcription is required to generate cDNA for sequencing. This step is crucial for obtaining specific genetic information to design primers for real-time PCR. Real-time PCR is then used for quick and accurate diagnosis, making this option the most appropriate.

Option C proposes DNA sequencing, but this is not suitable for RNA-based retroviruses. The genetic material of retroviruses is RNA, not DNA, so this approach would not align with the needs of the diagnostic kit.

Option D suggests an ELISA kit targeting IgG antibodies. While ELISA can detect antibodies produced by the immune response, it is slower because it relies on the development of antibodies, which may take time. Additionally, early-stage infections may not yield sufficient antibodies for detection, making this method less ideal for quick diagnosis.

Given these considerations, the best approach is to first identify the virus using cDNA sequencing to obtain the necessary genetic information, followed by the development of a real-time PCR kit for quick and accurate diagnosis.

Answer: B
