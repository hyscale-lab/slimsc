Okay, so I have this problem about a vector field and calculating the volume integral of its divergence. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that this has something to do with Gauss's Law, but wait, let me think through it step by step.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, in spherical coordinates, it's directed radially. That makes sense because the field is only along the radial direction. The magnitude is 1/r², so the vector field must be f(r) = (1/r²) * r_hat, right? Because r_hat is the unit vector in the radial direction.

Now, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of f inside a sphere of radius R. So I need to compute ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of a sphere.

Wait, divergence. I remember that divergence measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. So how do I find the divergence of f(r)?

In spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that's purely radial (only A(r) r_hat) is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² A(r)). Because for a purely radial vector field, the divergence simplifies to the derivative of (A(r) r²) divided by r².

So in this case, A(r) is 1/r². Let me plug that into the formula.

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ]

Simplify inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero.

Wait, so ∇ · f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

So the divergence of f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Because at r=0, 1/r² is not defined. Oh right, the origin is a point where the field might have a singularity. But in the region we're integrating (r from 0 to R, I think), except at r=0, it's zero.

Wait, but if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere except possibly at the origin, then the integral of the divergence over the volume should be zero, right? Because you're integrating zero over a region. But wait, wait. There's a possibility that the divergence isn't zero at the origin because the field isn't defined there.

Wait, but the integral is over the volume. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at a single point (the origin), then the integral should still be zero because a single point has no volume. So the integral would be zero.

But wait, another approach: let me think about using the Divergence Theorem. The Divergence Theorem says that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the surface integral of the vector field dotted with the outward normal over the surface.

So, ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA over the sphere of radius R.

But f is (1/r²) r_hat. So on the surface of the sphere, r = R. So f = (1/R²) r_hat. The outward normal on the sphere is also r_hat. So f · n = (
