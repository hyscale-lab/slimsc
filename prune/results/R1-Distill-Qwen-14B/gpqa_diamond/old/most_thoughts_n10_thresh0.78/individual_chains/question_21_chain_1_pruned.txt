Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Hmm, I remember that constitutional isomers have different connectivity, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements.

The question has two parts, A and B. Part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate.

Let's tackle part A first. Tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen and the simultaneous reorganization of double bonds, like in keto-enol tautomerism. For tautomerism to occur, there must be a resonance structure possible, which usually requires adjacent double bonds or a ring structure that allows for such shifts.

Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is actually a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms, each connected as ketones. So for example, it's like a benzene ring with two keto groups opposite each other. So, would it undergo tautomerism? Well, tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen between two adjacent atoms, like in enols and ketones. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups but does it have any adjacent H's that can shift? Wait, benzene is fully conjugated, so the double bonds are delocalized. If the two ketone groups are in para positions, maybe there's a possibility for tautomerism. Alternatively, maybe it can't because the structure doesn't allow for conjugation that would facilitate the tautomer shift. Hmm, not entirely sure.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: This compound has three ketone groups on a six-membered ring, alternating with single bonds. So, positions 1, 3, and 5 are ketones. Wait, that's a pretty rigid structure. If it's a cyclohexane ring, each ketone is separated by a single bond. So, each ketone is at every other carbon. Now, can this compound undergo tautomerism? Tautomerism usually requires adjacent carbonyl groups or some conjugated system to allow the shift. Here, each ketone is separated by a single bond, so maybe no adjacent Hs for the shift. Alternatively, maybe the ring structure allows some conjugation that could support tautomerism. Or perhaps the trione is so symmetrical that any tautomer would be the same as the original structure. Wait, but in a six-membered ring, the positions are all conjugated through the ring, so maybe there's a possibility of resonance. But wait, considering the actual structure, if all the carbonyl groups are in 1,3,5 positions, perhaps the molecule doesn't have the necessary H's to shift. Wait, for tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to the carbonyl. Let me imagine the structure. Each ketone is at positions 1,3,5. The ring is cyclohexane, so each carbon is connected to two others. The adjacent carbons to the ketones would be positions 2 and 6 for position 1, positions 4 and 2 for position 3, etc. Are any of those adjacent positions having H's that can shift? Hmm, perhaps not,
