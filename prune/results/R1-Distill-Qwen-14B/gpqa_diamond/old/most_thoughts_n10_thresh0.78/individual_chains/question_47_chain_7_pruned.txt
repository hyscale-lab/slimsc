Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The IR shows strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, the compound's formula includes an N and O2, so maybe these are from amide groups or something with an amino group. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, we're probably dealing with an amide or ester or maybe a ketone, but given the formula, more likely an amide or ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H): That's a triplet, which suggests a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. The triplet typically comes from coupling with two adjacent protons, so maybe it's an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom, like O or N.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an exchange process, like NH or OH. Wait, but in 4.0 ppm, maybe it's adjacent to an electronegative atom. Could be an N with two Hs, or maybe an OCH2 group, but if it's broad, more likely an amino group? Or perhaps an ethyl group attached to something else, but the 4.0 ppm is a bit high for OCH2.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quartet. A quartet with 2H. This could be a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2 group. Like in an ethyl group where each CH2 is next to another. Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would typically show up as a triplet around 1.2 ppm (the CH3) and a quartet around 4.1 ppm (the OCH2). Hmm, but here the quartet is at 4.5. That's a bit higher. Maybe it's an amide group? Or maybe a carbonyl adjacent to another group.

7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. So, probably a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions. The peaks at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm indicate some deshielding. The higher chemical shift (8.0) suggests more electron-withdrawing groups. Maybe a nitro group, but the formula doesn't have more N. Or perhaps an amide group attached to the ring, which would deshield the para protons.

Now, putting this together. The compound has a benzene ring with substituents. The formula is C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of Unsaturation: (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. So, 2*9 +2 =20. Minus 11 H, gives 9. Plus 1 N (since each N is considered as +1 in the formula) but wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So, X (halogens) are zero. So:

(2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2=10/2=5 degrees of unsaturation. Benzene ring is 3 (from the ring plus three double bonds?), or wait, no. Benzene is 3 degrees (one ring and three double bonds). Wait, no, each ring or double bond is one degree. Benzene is three double bonds plus a ring, so 4 degrees. Wait, no, the formula for degrees of unsaturation is (each ring or double bond counts as one). So benzene is three double bonds and one ring? No, benzene is a ring with three double bonds, so it's 4 degrees? Wait, no. Let me just count correctly. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. So for C9H11NO2: C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2, X=0.

So (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = (10)/2=5. So 5 degrees. Benzene ring is three double bonds and one ring, but wait, no. Benzene has three double bonds, that's three degrees, plus the ring is another? No, a ring is one degree. So benzene is 4 degrees. Then the rest: the substituents contribute the remaining one degree.

Wait, but the formula is C9H11NO2. So benzene (C6H5) plus substituents. Let's think: substituents could be an amide or ester group. For example, for an ester, that's a carbonyl (one degree) and an ether linkage, which doesn't add. So for the substituent, we have maybe an amide group (CONH-) or an ester (COO-).

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Benzamide is Ar-CO-NH2. Wait, but looking at the IR, there's a strong peak at 1720, which would fit an amide carbonyl. But amide carbonyls are usually a bit lower, like around 1650. Oh wait, but sometimes they can be higher, especially if conjugated. Alternatively, an ester carbonyl is around 1720, so maybe that's more likely.

Looking at the NMR:

The triplet at 1.20 (3H) suggests an ethyl group attached via oxygen or nitrogen. The quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) could be an OCH2 (like in an ester). The 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) might be an NH group, but wait, if it's an amide, the NH would be around 5-8 ppm. Alternatively, the broad singlet at 4.0 could be an OCH2 group, but that doesn't usually be broad. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: looking at the options.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So, structure is O

Benzoate would be O=C-O- attached to a benzene ring. So, the ester group is O-CO-OCH2CH3? No, wait, benzoate is the ester of benzoic acid. So structure is COOEt (ethyl ester) attached to the benzene ring. But then, where is the amino group?

4-Aminobenzoate ethyl ester would be
