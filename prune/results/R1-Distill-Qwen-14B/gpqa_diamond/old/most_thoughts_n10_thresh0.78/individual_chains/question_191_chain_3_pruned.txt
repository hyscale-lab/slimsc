Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. It's a bit complicated, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. I think I should draw this structure or at least visualize it. So, cyclohexanone (a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 1). At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group, which is a CH2OH. At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2CH2 group but with a double bond. Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is at the 2 position, which would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl. So the structure is CH2-C(CH2?) No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is attached at C2. So it's CH2-C(CH3)=. Hmm, no, wait. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2CH2 but with the double bond at 1. So the structure is CH2=C(CH3)-, but wait, that would be allyl group perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's isopropenyl. Oh wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=C(CH2-) but I might be mixing up the numbering. Alternatively
