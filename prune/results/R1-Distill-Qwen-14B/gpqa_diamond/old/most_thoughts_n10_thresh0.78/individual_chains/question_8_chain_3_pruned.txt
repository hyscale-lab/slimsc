Okay, I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. So let's see what the question is about.

We have an experiment with white lupine plants and a fungal disease called anthracnose. The goal is to find which genes contribute to resistance. They found three candidate genes, G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants for each and some double mutants. 

The key point is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. That probably means it's regulating the expression of the other genes. Transcription factors usually activate or repress other genes, so if one is upstream, it might control the others.

The experiment's results are about the resistance levels of the mutants compared to the wild-type. The controls have 100% resistance, and the mutants have varying percentages. Lower percentages mean more susceptibility, right?

Looking at the data:

- g1: 75% → less resistant than wild type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance by about 25%.
- g2: 0% → completely susceptible. So the wild type must be very dependent on G2. Maybe G2 is critical for resistance.
- g3: 50% → halving resistance. So knocking out G3 makes them less resistant.
Now the double mutants:

- g1g3: 10% → very susceptible. That's worse than either single mutant.
- g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone.
- g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone.

Hmm. Let's think about what this means. 

First, looking at G2: g2 alone is 0%, and any double mutant involving G2 (g1g2 and g2g3) is also 0%. So G2's knockout is lethal for resistance. That suggests that G2 is crucial. Maybe G2 is the upstream transcription factor that activates other genes, like G1 and/or G3. Because if G2 is knocked out, none of the other genes can function properly, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but in the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out (like in g1g2), the resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. So perhaps G2 is the only one that matters for resistance. Or maybe G2 is the one that's upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream. 

Now, G3: g3 is 50% resistance. So without G3, the plant's resistance is halved. But in the double mutant g2g3, resistance is 0%, same as g2 alone. That might mean that when G2 is already knocked out, G3 doesn't contribute anything. Which would make sense if G3 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 isn't working, G3 can't do anything.

What about G1? g1 is 75% resistance. So without G1, plants are 75% as resistant as wild-type. But when you have g1g2, it's 0%. So without G2, G1 doesn't matter much. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2 as well. 

But wait, when G1 is knocked out along with G3 (g1g3), the resistance is 10%. That's worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So perhaps when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the effect is more severe than each alone. That suggests that G1 and G3 are not completely redundant but might be working in parallel pathways or maybe have additive effects.

Wait, but when you have G2 working, G1 and G3 are probably contributing. So perhaps G2 is the transcription factor activating both G1 and G3, which in turn do something else to contribute to resistance.

Wait, let's think about the epistasis here. Epistasis is when one gene's effect masks the effect of another. So an epistatic gene is upstream. Because if gene A is upstream of gene B, the phenotype of the double mutant (A- B-) would look like the more severe of the two single mutants, or perhaps even more severe if both are needed.

Alternatively, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the double mutant A- B- would have the same phenotype as A- alone. Because A is upstream; without A, B's function doesn't matter.

Looking at the data:

g1g2 has 0% resistance, same as g2. So perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when G2 is knocked out, the resistance is 0 regardless of G1's status.

Similarly, g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

What about g1g3? When both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. G1 alone is 75%, G3 alone is 50%. So combining both brings it down to 10%. So G1 and G3 are not epistatic to each other; their effects are additive.

So, the hierarchy seems to be G2 is at the top. G2's product is necessary for any resistance. Then, G1 and G3 are downstream. 

In terms of the options:

Option A says G1 is a transcription factor. But in our analysis, G2 is the transcription factor because the resistance is completely lost when G2 is knocked out. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B says G2 is the transcription factor. That makes sense. Then G1 and G3 have the same promoter; not sure about that. It says G3 is epistatic towards G1. Wait, that would mean G3 is upstream. But our data shows G2 is upstream of both. So B might not be correct.

Option C: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Hmm, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. I'm not sure how that applies here. Alternatively, maybe 'pleiotropy' isn't the right term here. The key is epistatic relationships.

Option D: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 show gene redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Gene redundancy would mean that either gene can compensate. But in the data, the double mutant of G1 and G3 is worse (10%). So it's not redundancy; perhaps they're additive. So D's second point might not be correct.

Wait, looking back at the options. Let's reevaluate.

Which option has G2 as the transcription factor? Options A: G1 is TF. B: G2. C: G2. D: G2.

So A can be eliminated because the data suggests G2 is the key.

Now, looking at the other parts.

Option B says G1 and G3 have the same promoter. I don't know if that's relevant. The data doesn't directly address that. So maybe this isn't the right choice.

Option C says G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. Pleiotropy would mean that each gene affects multiple traits, but in this context, maybe it's that each gene contributes to the same pathway. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G1 and G3 are in the same pathway but contribute additively. Let's think about the double mutants. g1g3 is 10%, which is less than either single mutant. So each gene contributes some positive effect, and together they have a bigger effect.

If two genes are in the same pathway, and the product of each gene contributes additively to the pathway's function, then the double mutant would have a more severe phenotype than either single mutant. 

So if G2 is the transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, and G1 and G3 each contribute some function necessary for resistance, then knocking out both would make the resistance much worse. 

So in the wild-type, G2 activates G1 and G3. G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance. So in g1, you lose G1's
