Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to figure out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember that in such systems, the molecule absorbs certain wavelengths of light, which causes electrons to get excited. Then, when they drop back down, they emit light. Oh right, this is about the photoelectric effect and maybe the complementary color.

So, the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I think I need to find the wavelength corresponding to this energy because the color absorbed would be related to that.

The formula connecting energy and wavelength is E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Let me plug in the numbers. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. The energy E is 2.3393 eV. Oh wait, I should convert eV to Joules because the units need to match.

1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-19 Joules. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let's calculate that. 2.3393 * 1.602 is approximately 3.745, so 3.745e-19 J.

So E = 3.745e-19 J. Now, rearrange the formula to solve for λ: λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 3.745e-19 J.

Let's compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then divide by 3.745e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.745e-19 = approximately 5.309e-7 meters. Oh wait, that's 530.9 nanometers because 1e-9 meters is a nanometer. So 531 nm.

Wait, what color is 531 nm? I remember the visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 531 is in the green part? Or wait, wait, maybe I got the wavelength wrong because the energy of the emitted light is the one we're looking at. Wait, when a compound absorbs a certain wavelength, it emits the complementary color? Or wait, no, when a compound absorbs light, it's the absorbed wavelength that determines the color we see as the complementary. Hmm.

Wait, if a compound emits light at 531 nm (green), that would mean it absorbed a higher energy (shorter wavelength) because emission is usually at a longer wavelength than absorption? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, wait, no, actually, in fluorescence or phosphorescence, the emitted light is usually at a longer wavelength than the absorbed (because it involves a transition from a higher to lower energy state, but maybe I'm getting confused here.)

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the energy difference between the excited and ground states. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy, right? Because to get excited, the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy than the emitted one. So the emission is when the molecule drops from a higher energy state (after absorbing) to a lower one, emitting a photon of lower energy.

So, the energy of the absorbed photon (E_abs) would be higher than the emitted photon (E_emit). So E_abs = E_emit + something.

Wait, but in this question, the dyed emits at 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon would have higher energy than that. Because the molecule absorbs a photon, gets excited, and then when it relaxes, emits a photon of lower energy.

Oh wait, no, wait. When the molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoted to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it can emit a photon. The energy of the emitted photon depends on the energy gap between the excited state and the state it drops to.

Wait, if the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy than that because it's moving from a lower energy to a higher energy state.

So the absorbed wavelength would be shorter (higher energy) than the emitted wavelength.

Wait, but the question is what color is absorbed. Because when the molecule absorbs a certain wavelength, it doesn't emit that same wavelength. So the color we see is the complement, or the color that's transmitted or reflected.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think step by step.

The energy emitted is 2.3393 eV. The corresponding wavelength is about 531 nm, which is green. So if the molecule emits green light, the absorbed light must be in a different region.

Wait, but the emitted light is the result of the molecule dropping from an excited state. So the energy required to get into that
