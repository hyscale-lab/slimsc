Okay, let's try to figure out this physics problem. So, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power, and we're supposed to find the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle and the form of the power function.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they produce electromagnetic radiation, and the power radiated depends on the angle θ and the wavelength λ. The setup is a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, the charge distribution is spheroidal, and it's oscillating, which means it's an oscillating dipole maybe?

Wait, the radiation pattern for a dipole... right. For a dipole radiator, the radiation is stronger along the equatorial plane (θ = 90 degrees) and weaker along the axis (θ=0 or 180). The radiation pattern is given by the dipole formula. The power per unit solid angle should be proportional to (sinθ)^2, I think. Because the dipole's radiation is symmetric around the equator.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. For a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (radiation zone) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So, the maximum power would be when sinθ is maximum, which is at θ=90 degrees. Wait, but the question is when θ is 30 degrees. So, the fraction of maximum power at θ=30 would be (sin30)^2 divided by the maximum value.

Wait, let's calculate that. Sin(30) is 0.5, so (0.5)^2 is 0.25, or 1/4. So the fraction is 1/4. But wait, the maximum is at θ=90, so yes, sinθ is 1 there, so the maximum power fraction at θ=30 is 0.25 times the maximum. But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. So the fraction would be 1/4. So that leads me to think that the fraction is 1/4, which is option B or C.

Now, the other part is the form of the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle as a function of λ and θ. The power per unit solid angle usually depends on the radiation
