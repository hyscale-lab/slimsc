Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about radioactive decay. Hmm, the question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. But wait, 50 minutes have already passed and it hasn't decayed yet. Now they're asking what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let's think it through.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed, right? Oh wait, but wait a minute, the probability given is for a specific time period. So they're saying that within 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance. 

Wait, so the decay probability is given as P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is time. But here, they've given P(100) = 0.32. So I can find λ first.

Let me calculate λ. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). Rearranging that, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Calculating ln(0.68), I remember that ln(0.7) is approximately -0.3567, but 0.68 is a bit lower. Let me get more precise. Using a calculator, ln(0.68) is about -0.38566. So λ would be 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the situation is that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. I need to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean from the start, or from the current time? Oh, right, the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But since in radioactive decay, the process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next t minutes is independent of how much time has already passed. So whether it's after 50 minutes or not, the probability of decaying in the next 150 is the same as if it were starting now.

Wait, but wait. The initial decay probability was given for 100 minutes. So maybe I should model it differently. Let's think: The half-life is a related concept. The 32% decay in 100 minutes. Wait, but 32% is not a half-life. The half-life (T_1/2) is the time when 50% have decayed. So perhaps I can find T_1/2 from the given
