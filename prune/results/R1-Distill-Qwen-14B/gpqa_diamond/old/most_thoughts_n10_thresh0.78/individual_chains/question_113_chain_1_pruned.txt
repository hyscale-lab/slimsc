Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectral data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question gives me information from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. I need to figure out the chemical formula from the options given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Starting with the FTIR data. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 probably indicates an -OH group, like in an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. But wait, carboxylic acids have a very broad O-H stretch, which fits the broad peak. However, looking at the other peaks: 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or ester. The 1650 might be another carbonyl, maybe an aromatic ring's conjugated carbonyl or perhaps an amide, but since the options don't include nitrogen, maybe it's an ester or something else.

Wait, but for the 1650 peak, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Like a carbonyl in an aromatic ring? No, more likely, it's something like a conjugated carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester where the carbonyl is at around 1700 and another peak nearby, but not sure yet.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl protons are typically in the range around 4.5 to 6.5 ppm, depending on substitution. So the presence of vinyl groups suggests there's an alkene or aromatic ring with protons. But given the FTIR has a broad O-H, maybe it's something like an ester with an aromatic ring? Or perhaps an alcohol with an alkene.

Then, the mass spec shows a fragment at m/z 45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let's think: 45 is a common mass for a fragment like C3H7O or maybe (CH3CO)+, which is 43, but no. Alternatively, maybe a methoxy group (OCH3) would be 31, but that's not it. Oh wait, 45 could be the tropylium ion (C7H7+ is 91, no). Alternatively, 45 could be the mass of a fragment like (CH2)2O or something else. Let me think about possible fragments that sum up to 45. For instance, the methyl group attached to something. Alternatively, maybe CH3CO+ is 43, but that's not 45. Wait, perhaps it's a ketene ion? Not sure.

Let me think about the options. The options are all C6H?O and O2 possibilities.

Option A: C6H12O2
Option B: C6H10O
Option C: C6H10O2
Option D: C6H12O

So the degrees of unsaturation can help. For each formula:

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2C +2 - H - O*2)/2 ?

Wait, wait, the formula is: DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But O is not directly considered, because each O can contribute to double bonds or rings. Hmm, perhaps I should compute it as (2C + 2 - H - X + N - P)/2, but since O isn't in the DoU formula, but each carbonyl group counts as a double bond.

Wait, the correct formula for degrees of unsaturation is:

DoU = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2

Since in the problem, X and N are zero, DoU =
