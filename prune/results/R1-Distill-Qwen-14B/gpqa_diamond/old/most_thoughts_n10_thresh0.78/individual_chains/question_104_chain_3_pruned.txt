Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. 

The question says that two stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. 

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift in the spectral line, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of Planet #2 is compared to Planet #1.

Wait, I think the key here is the Doppler shift and how it relates to the orbital period. The Doppler shift (or the semi-amplitude of the velocity) is used to find the planet's mass. But the exact formula is a bit fuzzy for me. 

I recall that the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by a formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period. The formula is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (1) / ( (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) * something. Wait, maybe it's better to look up the exact formula.

Wait, I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * ( c ) / ( (P)^(1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much less than the Sun), the (1 + M_p/M_star) term is approximately 1. So the formula simplifies.

Wait, another approach: maybe K is inversely proportional to the square root of the period? No, I think it's more related to the cube root. Because orbital velocity relates to the period in a way involving Kepler's third law.

Oh wait, Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis divided by the mass of the star. But since the star's mass is the same for both, maybe that's a factor.

But wait, the Doppler shift is related to the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the mass of the star, and the orbital period. Let me think.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ] / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, 1 + M_p/M_star ≈ 1, so we can ignore that term. So K ≈ (27 pi G)^(1/3) * M_p / M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / P^(1/3)) ) * sin i.

Wait, but since both planets are around stars with the same
