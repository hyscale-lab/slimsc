Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. Let me take a deep breath and start breaking it down.

The problem is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options give different sequences of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one. Ugh, okay, let's visualize the target molecule first.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the structure is a benzene ring with substituents. Let me draw it mentally. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 1 is where the ketone is attached. So, position 1 is the ketone (ethan-1-one, which is a methyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, but wait, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one?), no, wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO? No, wait, ethan-1-one is a ketone where the carbonyl is at the first position. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is O=C-CH2CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is actually impossible because ketones have two R groups on the carbonyl. Oh wait, perhaps it's acetophenone? Because ethanone is acetone (propan-2-one). Wait, maybe the target is a benzene ring with a ketone group (like acetophenone) and other substituents.

Wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So phenyl group attached to a ketone. So it's a phenyl group connected to a carbonyl, which is connected to a methyl group. So that's acetophenone with substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, numbering the benzene ring: the ketone is at position 1. Then positions 2
