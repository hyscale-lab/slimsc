Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem is about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime (tau_0) is given as 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So the lab frame lifetime would be gamma times tau_0, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma is calculated using the formula gamma = E/(m c²). Wait, but since energy is given in GeV and mass is in GeV/c², I can probably compute gamma without worrying about units conversion beyond what's given.

So the energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. Let me double-check that: 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 times 8 is 27.28. So 27 is a bit less than 8 times, maybe about 7.917.

So tau_lab = gamma * tau_0 = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that. 7.917 *8 = 63.336, so 63.336e-16 s is the lab lifetime. Wait, wait, wait. No, 8e-16 s multiplied by 7.917 gives 63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 seconds, right? Because 1e-15 is 0.1e-14, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to express it. Anyway, it's about 6.33e-15 seconds.

But wait, the problem is about the resolution needed to observe the decay. I think the resolution refers to the ability to distinguish the decay products' paths, which depends on the length over which the decay can occur. The longer the lifetime, the further the particles can travel before decaying, so the larger the decay length.

The minimum resolution needed would be such that at least 30% of the decays are observed. So I think we need to find the decay length so that 30% of the particles decay within that length, and the rest go further, but since the question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30%, perhaps we need the length where 30% of the particles have decayed, which would be the mean decay length multiplied by some factor, maybe using the exponential decay formula.

Wait, the decay follows an exponential decay law. The probability that a particle decays before time t is P = 1 - e^(-t/tau_lab). So if we want 30% of the particles to decay, we can set P = 0.3, and solve for t.

But wait, the decay length L is given by v * t, where v is the velocity of the particle. Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the average decay length first.

Wait, perhaps the mean decay length is c * tau_lab * beta gamma, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, the lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0. The speed of the
