Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which I think means we're only focusing on their orbital angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1, 1, 2, -1>, where l₁ and l₂ are the orbital angular momenta of each electron, and l and m are the total angular momentum quantum numbers.

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z (the z-components of each electron's orbital angular momentum) and finding both to have eigenvalues of -ħ. So, each Lz would give -ħ, and I need to find the probability that both happen.

Hmm, okay. I remember that for angular momentum coupling, when you combine two angular momenta, you get a total angular momentum state. The state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is the coupled state. But here we're given that state as |1,1,2,-1>. So each electron has l=1, and the total is l=2, m=-1.

Wait, but the problem is about measuring the individual L₁z and L₂z. So, I think we need to express the coupled state in terms of the product of the individual states.

Each electron in a p orbital has l=1, so their m₁ and m₂ can be -1, 0, +1. The total m is m₁ + m₂. But in the coupled state, m is given as -1.

Wait, but the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is the same as |l=1, l=1, l=2, m=-1>. So the state is a combination of all possible m₁ and m₂ that sum to m=-1.

But the question is about the joint probability of both L₁z and L₂z being -ħ. For each electron, the eigenvalue of Lz is mħ, right? So for L₁z = -ħ, m₁ must be -1. Similarly, L₂z = -ħ implies m₂ is -1.

So the question is: what's the probability that when measuring both electrons' m values, both are -1. Because if both are -1, then m₁ + m₂ = -2, but wait, the coupled state here has m = -1. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait wait, the coupled state has m=-1, which is the total m. So for the state |1,1,2,-1>, the sum of m₁ and m₂ is -1. So the individual m₁ and m₂ can vary as long as m₁ + m₂ = -1.

But the question is about both m₁ and m₂ being -1. Because if m₁ is -1 and m₂ is -1, their sum is -2, which doesn't match the coupled state's m=-1. So that can't happen. Therefore, the probability of both being -1 is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is a linear combination of
