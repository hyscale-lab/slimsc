Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says a star is detectable if it achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, I have to figure out which of the listed stars meet this condition.

I remember that the signal-to-noise ratio is influenced by factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. ESPRESSO is used with the VLT, which is a big telescope, so it should be good for gathering light.

The link given is about ESPRESSO. I should try to recall its capabilities. ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph. High resolution usually means it can separate spectral lines better, but it might have lower throughput because it's more specialized. Oh wait, but for S/N, it's more about how much light it can collect.

I think the S/N formula relates the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the system's efficiency, and the star's flux. The formula I remember is something like S/N = (Sqrt(N_photons)) / noise, but maybe it's better to think in terms of magnitude and exposure time.

Wait, there's a formula for calculating the expected S/N ratio for an astronomical observation. I think it's something like:

S/N ≈ 5.98 × 10^(-0.4*(m - m_lim)) × sqrt(t × b) 

Where m is the apparent magnitude of the star, m_lim is the limiting magnitude (the faintest star detectable), t is the exposure time in seconds, and b is the number of pixels per spectrum or some binning factor. But I might be mixing up some variables here.

Alternatively, another version I've heard is S/N = 5.98 × 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) × sqrt(t) ), where m0 is the magnitude that gives a S/N of 1 in the exposure time t. Hmm, not too sure, but I think the key is to figure out the apparent magnitude of each star and whether it's bright enough.

Wait
