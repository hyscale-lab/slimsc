Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I think I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene groups. Ring-closing metathesis specifically is when two alkenes in the same molecule rearrange to form a ring. 

The target molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that structure to visualize. So cyclohexene has a ring with six members. The double bond is at position 1, which I think is between C1 and C2? Wait, cyclohexene is usually numbered so that the double bond is between C1 and C2, making it 1-ene. So substituents are at C3, C4, and C5. At C3 and C4, there are methyl groups, and at C5, an isopropyl group.

So the starting material must have the necessary substituents connected by alkenes that can undergo metathesis to form the ring. Ring-closing metathesis usually requires two alkenes that are on opposite ends of a chain. When they undergo metathesis, the alkenes swap partners, forming a ring and releasing two smaller alkenes as byproducts.

So the starting material is an octadiene because after forming the ring (losing two carbons as ethylene), we get a six-membered cyclohexene. Octa means eight carbons, so the starting material has eight carbons, and after ring closing, it becomes six, losing two as ethylene. 

Looking at the options, all are octadienes with various substituents. Let me list the options:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene
That's two double bonds at positions 1 and 7 of an 8-carbon chain. Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8 positions. So the chain is 8 carbons long, with double bonds at the very ends, and substituents at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl).

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene
Double bonds at 2 and 6. So between 2-3 and 6-7. Substituents at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl).

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene
Double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. Substituents at 3,4 and 5.

Option D:4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene
Hmm, substituents are at 4 (isopropyl) and 5,6 (methyl). So that's different.

The key is to find which starting material, when undergoing ring-closing metathesis, would form the cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5 positions.

Ring-closing metathesis involves two alkenes in the same molecule. The two alkenes will exchange partners. So one end of each double bond becomes part of the ring, and the other ends form ethylene (or maybe something else if substituents are present, but in this case, it's likely ethylene).

Let me think: the starting material should have two alkenes such that when they undergo metathesis, the substituents end up correctly in the ring.

So, the target cyclohexene has substituents at C3, C4, and C5. That suggests that the substituents in the starting material are positioned such that when the ring forms, they come together correctly.

In the starting material, if there are two alkenes, the positions of the substituents should be such that when the ring forms, they are adjacent in the ring.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material as an octadiene. Let's number it from 1 to 8.

If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene (option A), the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. So substituents are at 3,4 (methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). 

When metathesis occurs, the two alkenes (1-2 and 7-8) would undergo ring closure. The rings would form by connecting the end carbons of each double bond.

So the 1-2 double bond would connect to the 7-8 double bond. So the ring would form between carbon 2 and carbon 7. Wait, but that's a big jump. Let's see: carbon 2 and carbon 7 are connected, so that would create a ring of 6 carbons (positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7? Wait, no, wait how. Let me think about the positions.

Alternatively, maybe the correct way is to think about the two alkenes in the starting material. For ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes should be positioned on the ends of a chain. So for example, if the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 6 (like option C: 1,6-diene), then the chain would have those double bonds on either end, but in the middle, maybe.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to imagine the starting material as a diene, with substituents in the middle. When the two alkenes undergo metathesis, they form a ring.

So, the starting material would have substituents at certain positions, and the ring would bring those substituents into the correct positions on the cyclohexene.

Let me think about the target molecule again. The cyclohexene has substituents at C3, C4, and C5. So in the starting material, these substituents (methyl and isopropyl) must be positioned such that when the ring forms, they end up at those positions.

In the starting material, if we have a chain with substituents at positions 3,4,5, then during ring closure, the two alkenes would "connect" ends. For example, if the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene (option A), then the substituents are at 3,4,5.

Wait, let me imagine the structure.

Structure of option A:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

CH2=CH - CH(CH3) - CH(CH3) - CH(CH2CH2CH3) - CH2 - CH2=CH2?

Wait, no, perhaps it's a straight chain. Let me write the structure as CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))... Wait, maybe that's not right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at 3,4,5 positions in a chain of 8 carbons, with double bonds at 1 and 7.

Wait, but octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. So the substituents are at 3,4,5 (methyl, methyl, isopropyl).

So when ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (1-2 and 7-8) would swap partners. So the 1-2 double bond would break, and the 7-8 would break, and the ends would connect.

So the 2 and 7 carbons would form a new double bond, and the 1 and 8 would form ethylene? Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, in ring-closing metathesis, the process is:

Each alkene breaks into two parts, and the ends are reconnected. So, for each alkene, the two carbons on either side of the double bond are parts that are being exchanged.

So, for the 1,2 double bond in option A: the parts would be [1] and [2], each connected to something else.

Similarly, for the 7,8 double bond: [7] and [8].

In the metathesis, the [2] from the first double bond would connect to [7] from the second, and [1] would connect to [8].

Wait, no, maybe it's more like:

The two alkenes would exchange ends. So the first alkene (1-2) would exchange with the second (7-8). So the new connections would be 1 connected to 7 and 2 connected to 8. Or wait, perhaps:

The metathesis would form a new ring by connecting the two alkenes. The four carbons involved (1,2 and 7,8) would form a ring, but that would require four carbons, which can't form a cyclohexene. Hmm, maybe I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to model the starting material and see which option, upon ring-closing, gives the target.

Let me try each option.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

Structure: positions 1-2 double bond, 7-8 double bond. Positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups, position 5 has isopropyl.

When ring-closing, the 1 and 7 would form a ring by connecting. So the chain from 1 to 8 would form a ring by connecting 1 to 7. But wait, that would make a 6-membered ring? Because from 1 to 7, there are six carbons in between.

Wait, 1 to 7 is a seven-carbon chain, but if you connect 1 to 7, you need to consider the positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the starting material as a straight chain with two double bonds. So when the two ends (1 and 7) undergo metathesis, they form a ring.

In that case, the ring would have 6 members (since the chain is 8 carbons, and connecting 1 and 7 would leave 6 carbons in the ring?).

Wait, wait. Let me think: octa-1,7-diene has double bonds at the ends. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, I think I'm getting the substituent positions wrong.

Wait, the substituents: 3,4 are methyl, 5 is isopropyl.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH(CH3))
Wait, isopropyl is CH(CH2CH3)2? Or CH(CH3)2? Wait, isopropyl is -CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, no. Isopropyl is -CH(CH3)2. So substituent at position 5 is isopropyl, so it's CH(CH3)2.

So the structure for option A is:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)2?) Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's:

Positions:
1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH(CH3))?
Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Maybe substituent at 5 is isopropyl, so:

Position 5 is CH(CH3)2.

So structure:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH3)2? No, isopropyl is CH(CH3)2.

Wait, perhaps it's:

1  2  3 4 5 6 7 8

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) ... No, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2?

Wait, but that's a 10-carbon chain, which is more than octa. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH2CH3) ? No, wait, isopropyl is CH(CH3)2, so perhaps:

Position 5: CH(CH3)2.

So the chain is:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH(CH3)2)
Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's better to think about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material for option A is:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, that's an 8 carbon chain with substituents at 3,4,5.

But I'm getting stuck on the structure. Maybe I should think about the ring-closing process instead.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes in the starting material will form a new ring. Each alkene is split into two fragments, and the ends are connected. So for each double bond, say R1-CH2-CH2-R2, it would become R1-CH2 and CH2-R2. Then, in metathesis, the R1-CH2 would connect to the CH2-R2, forming R1-CH2-CH2-R2, but in a ring.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in the starting material, the substituents must be in positions such that when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions on the ring.

So, the target substituents are at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents must be positioned in such a way that during the ring closure, they end up in the correct places.

Looking at option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7. Substituents at 3,4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

If the ring-closing occurs between the 2 and 6 positions, then the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material for option B is:

Positions 2-3 double bond, 6-7 double bond.

So the substituents at 3,4,5 are in the middle. Let's see:

Imagine breaking the 2-3 double bond into CH2 and CH2, and the 6-7 into CH2 and CH2. Then, the ring would form by connecting the two ends. So the ring would be formed between positions 3 and 6, making a six-membered ring.

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, perhaps the two alkenes are in positions that when they undergo metathesis, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material has the substituents in positions such that when the two alkenes are parts of a chain, the substituents are in the correct place for the ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the starting material where the substituents are located in such a way that in the starting material, they are three carbons apart.

Wait, the target molecule has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents should be in positions that, when the ring is formed, they end up adjacent.

Alternatively, let's think about the number of carbons between the substituents. For the ring to form correctly, the substituents should be positioned such that when the ring is formed, they're in the right places.

Another approach: the target is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the cyclohexene has the substituents at positions 3,4,5. The starting material must have the substituents in a way that when it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, these substituents are in the correct positions.

Suppose the starting material is an octadiene. The ring-closing will form a six-membered ring by connecting two ends of the octadiene. The substituents in the starting material should end up in the positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

Let me imagine the starting material as the octadiene with substituents at 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, those substituents are now at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

For example, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene with substituents at 3,4,5, then ring-closing between 1 and 7 positions would form a cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5.

Wait, how does that work? Let's number the starting material as follows:

1: CH2=
2: CH2
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH3)2 (isopropyl)
6: CH2
7: CH2=
8: CH2

Wait, but that's an 8-carbon chain. The double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8.

When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (1-2 and 7-8) would exchange ends. This would connect carbon 2 to carbon 7, forming a ring. Let's count the carbons in the ring.

So, the ring would consist of carbons 2,3,4,5,6,7. That's six carbons, making a cyclohexene. The substituents at 3,4,5 would then be at positions 2,3,4 in the cyclohexene. But wait, the target has substituents at 3,4,5. Hmm, perhaps not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps when the ring forms, the substituents end up at 3,4,5.

Wait, let's model the starting material as:

1: CH2=CH-
2: CH2-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH(CH3))2?
Wait, perhaps it's better to model the starting material as:

Starting material is octa-1,7-diene, so the structure is:

CH₂=CH-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₃)-CH(CH₂CH₃)-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂=CH₂

Wait, that's 8 carbons. So positions 1-2 double bond, 7-8 double bond.

Substituents are at 3 (methyl),4 (methyl),5 (isopropyl).

When metathesis occurs, the 1 and 7 positions will form the ring. So the chain from 1 to 7 is positions 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. When the ring forms, 1 connects to 7, forming a six-membered ring.

Wait, but that would mean that the ring includes carbons 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, which is seven carbons. No, wait, if the starting material is eight carbons, and the ring is formed by connecting 1 and 7, then the ring would consist of 6 carbons: 1,2,3,4,5,6. Wait, no, because 7 is connected back to 1, so the ring would be 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1, which is seven carbons. That's a seven-membered ring, but the target is a six-membered ring. So perhaps option A is not the correct starting material.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. How many carbons are in the ring after metathesis?

The starting material is an octadiene (8 carbons). After ring-closing, two carbons (as ethylene) are released, so the ring is 6 carbons. So the starting material must have a chain where, upon forming a ring, it loses two carbons (ethylene), leaving a six-membered ring.

So, for a six-membered ring, the starting material's chain between the two alkenes must have 6 carbons. Because when you form the ring, the two alkenes (each at the ends) will connect, but you lose two carbons as ethylene.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think of the starting material as having two alkenes at positions that are four apart, so that when they form a ring, the remaining chain is six carbons.

No, perhaps the correct way is that the starting material has two alkenes such that the number of carbons between them is four (so that the ring formed is six-membered, because 4+2=6). Wait, that's perhaps the key.

Because, for ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes are spaced such that when they form a ring, the ring has the desired number of members.

So the target is a cyclohexene (6-membered), so the starting material must have two alkenes that are four carbons apart, so that when the ring forms, it's six carbons.

Wait, let me think about the positions. Suppose the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 5 in an eight-carbon chain. The number of carbons between them is 3 (positions 2,3,4). Hmm, that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to count the number of carbons between the two alkenes. For a six-membered ring, the two alkenes should be four carbons apart (since 4 + 2 [ethylene] = 6).

Wait, perhaps a better way is to think in terms of the number of carbons in the chain between the two alkenes. If the starting material has a chain with two alkenes, the chain between them should have four carbons (so that when the alkenes form a ring, the ring is six-membered).

So the starting material would have the two alkenes separated by four carbons. So if the starting material has eight carbons total, the alkenes would be at positions 1 and 6, because from 1 to 6, there are four carbons in between (positions 2,3,4,5). Then, the ring would form by connecting 1 and 6, creating a six-membered ring (since from 1 to 6 is five bonds, so six atoms).

Wait, that's perhaps correct. So the starting material should be an octadiene with double bonds at positions 1 and 6.

Looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So, double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7.

Let me model this. The starting material is:

Positions 1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH3)2 (isopropyl)
6: CH-
7: CH2=
8: CH2

Wait, but octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH3)2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, I'm not sure.

But the important thing is that in the starting material, the substituents (methyl at 3,4 and isopropyl at 5) are positioned between the two alkenes. When ring-closing metathesis occurs, the two alkenes (1-2 and 6-7) would form a ring by connecting 2 and 7, but considering the substituents, maybe they end up in the correct positions.

Wait, perhaps when the starting material with double bonds at 1 and 6 undergoes metathesis, the ends (positions 2 and 7) form the ring. So positions 2 through 7 would form a six-membered ring. Let me count: positions 2,3,4,5,6,7. That's six positions, forming a cyclohexene. The substituents at 3,4,5 would then be at positions 3 (same as original), 4 (same), and 5 (same), but within the ring.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. So if the starting material has substituents at 3,4,5, which are in positions 3,4,5 in the starting chain, after the ring forms, they'd be in positions 2,3,4 of the ring? Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: in the starting material, substituents are at 3,4,5. After forming the ring, the substituents would be at positions 2,3,4, but the target has them at 3,4,5. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the substituents in the starting material are positioned such that in the ring, they end up at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe the substituents in the starting material are at positions 4,5,6, but that's not the case in the options.

Let me think differently. The target has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, the substituents must be on the same positions relative to the alkenes.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the position 3 is a methyl, 4 is methyl, and 5 is isopropyl. Then, after ring-closing, these substituents become positions 3,4,5.

Wait, if the starting material is option C: double bonds at 1 and 6, with substituents at 3,4,5. When the ring forms by connecting 1 and 6, the substituents would be at positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Wait, how? Let me imagine the starting material is:

Positions 1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH2CH3)2
6: CH-
7: CH2=
8: CH2

When the ring forms between 1 and 6, the ring includes positions 1,2,3,4,5,6. That's six positions, forming a cyclohexene. The substituent at 3 becomes position3, 4 becomes position4, 5 becomes position5 of the ring.

Yes, that makes sense. So the target substituents are correctly positioned.

So the starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but let me double-check.

After ring-closing, the substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the starting material become positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Yes, that's correct. Because in the starting material, the substituents are flanked by the two double bonds (positions 1 and 6). So when the ring forms, those substituents are placed correctly.

Looking back at the options, option C is the correct starting material.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the target molecule and the given options. 

The target molecule, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with methyl groups at positions 3 and 4, an isopropyl group at position 5, and a double bond between positions 1 and 2. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene groups in a molecule to form a ring, typically requiring a starting material with two alkenes positioned such that their exchange forms the desired ring structure.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). If ring-closing metathesis occurs between the double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, the resulting ring would include positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, forming a six-membered ring. However, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material would correspond to positions 2, 3, and 4 in the ring, which does not match the target molecule.

2. **Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7, with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). If ring-closing metathesis occurs between the double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7, the resulting ring would include positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, forming a six-membered ring. However, the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material would correspond to positions 3, 4, and 5 in the ring, which matches the target molecule. This option is a potential candidate.

3. **Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7, with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). If ring-closing metathesis occurs between the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7, the resulting ring would include positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, forming a six-membered ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material would correspond to positions 3, 4, and 5 in the ring, which matches the target molecule. This option is also a potential candidate.

4. **Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene**  
   This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, with substituents at positions 4 (isopropyl), 5 (methyl), and 6 (methyl). If ring-closing metathesis occurs between the double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8, the resulting ring would include positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, forming a six-membered ring. However, the substituents at positions 4, 5, and 6 in the starting material would correspond to positions 2, 3, and 4 in the ring, which does not match the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Both options B and C can form the target molecule, but option C, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene, is the most straightforward starting material because the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material directly correspond to positions 3, 4, and 5 in the target molecule after ring-closing metathesis.

Answer: C
