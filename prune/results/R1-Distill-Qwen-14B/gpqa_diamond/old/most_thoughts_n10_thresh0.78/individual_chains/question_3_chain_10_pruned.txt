Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. 

Hmm, expectation values. Right, the expectation value of an operator gives the average outcome of a measurement on the state. So I need to calculate ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

Wait, I remember that the expectation value is linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier.

First, let me find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that might simplify things. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The state ψ is a linear combination: ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, the coefficients are a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Let me check that a² + b² equals 1. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. 0.25 + 0.75 is 1. Yep, that's correct.

The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩. Since σz is diagonal in this basis, it's easy. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates, the expectation value is |a|²*(+1) + |b|²*(-1).

So |a|² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. |b|² is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm. σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is off-diagonal in the σz basis. So I can't directly use the same method as σz. I need to compute the expectation value another way.

The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

σy = [[0, -i],
       [i, 0]]

σz = [[1, 0],
       [0, -1]]

So, to compute ⟨σx⟩, I need to find ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Let me represent the state ψ as a column vector. Since |↑⟩ is (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0, 1), then ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is a vector in 2D: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

To compute ⟨σx⟩, I can write it as ψ† σx ψ, where † denotes the conjugate transpose. Since all coefficients are real here, it's just the transpose.

So σx ψ is the matrix product. Let's compute that.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So multiplying by ψ:

First element: (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2
Second element: (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5

So σx ψ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Now, ψ† times σx ψ is the dot product of ψ and σx ψ.

So (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) ?

Wait, no. Wait, ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], and σx ψ is [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]. So their dot product is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

Wait, let me compute that:

= (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5)
= (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4)
= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it using the coefficients.

Wait, another approach: Since σx is the spin-x operator, the expectation value can also be found using spin in the x-direction. But perhaps more accurately, it's the expectation value given the state.

Alternatively, another method: If the state is a
