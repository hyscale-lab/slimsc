Okay, so I've got this qPCR question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

The scientist is setting up a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and diluted it in serial dilutions. He ran three technical replicates for each concentration. The efficiency is 100%, which I think is perfect, meaning each cycle doubles the DNA. The RÂ² is 1, which means the data fits perfectly, so the curve is a straight line with all points on it. The slope is -3.3.

Looking at his results, each concentration has three Ct values. Let me jot them down:

100000 copies: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
10000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6
10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3

Wait, so each dilution reduces the copies by 10-fold each time. So 100000, 10000, 1000, 100, 10. That's five points, each 10-fold apart.

The question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D.

I remember that in qPCR, the Ct value is inversely proportional to the amount of target. So more copies mean lower Ct. Each 10-fold dilution should correspond to an increase in Ct by a certain number of cycles, based on the efficiency.

Since the efficiency is 100%, that means each cycle doubles the DNA. So each 10-fold dilution would require a certain number of cycles to reach the detection threshold.

Wait, in a perfect scenario with 100% efficiency, the Ct values should increase by a fixed amount when you dilute the sample. Let me calculate what that fixed amount should be. 

The formula for the change in Ct between dilutions is based on the efficiency. Since efficiency (E) is 100%, which is 1 in decimal. The formula for the delta Ct between two consecutive dilutions (n and n-1) is delta Ct = log2(1/E). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the formula. Let's think again.

The relationship between Ct and the log of the starting quantity is linear. The equation is Ct = -K log(Q) + C, where K is related to the efficiency.

When you have a 10-fold dilution, the quantity Q becomes Q/10. So the change in log(Q) is log(Q/(10)) = log(Q) - 1.

So the change in Ct would be K*(1) because it's log(Q) multiplied by K. So delta Ct = K * (1) = K.

But wait, K is the reciprocal of the slope. Slope is given as -3.3. So K = 1/3.3? Wait, no. The equation for the line in a qPCR calibration curve is usually Ct = slope * log(Q) + intercept. So the slope is related to the efficiency.

Wait, actually, the slope is negative because as Q increases, Ct decreases. The formula I recall is that slope = -3.3219 divided by the efficiency (E), but since E is 1, the slope would be approximately -3.3219. But in the problem, the slope is -3.3, which is close to that value. That makes sense because a 100% efficient PCR would have a slope around -3.3219
