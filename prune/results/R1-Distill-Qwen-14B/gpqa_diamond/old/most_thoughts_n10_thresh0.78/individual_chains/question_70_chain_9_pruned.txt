Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, it's about some reactions and figuring out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A to D, each with different symmetry groups.

Alright, let me break down the information step by step. The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. I remember that nitric oxide (NO) is a gas, and when it reacts with something, maybe in a specific ratio, it forms a red product. Oh wait, I think copper reacting with nitric oxide might form something. Or maybe it's a different metal. Wait, another thought: when copper reacts with nitric acid, it can produce copper nitrate, water, and NO or NO2 depending on conditions. But wait, in the first reaction, it's gas B, not acid. Alternatively, maybe B is O2? No, O2 is a gas, but reacting with a solid metal in 8 equivalents... Maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with oxygen? But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the product C reacts with D and B in other reactions. Let me look at the second reaction: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous. Then, C with water gives back A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). That's a big hint. So when C is in water, it hydrolyzes to form a metal (or maybe a salt) and acids. That makes me think of something like a metal nitrate hydrolyzing into the metal, nitric acid (which is strong), and maybe another acid, like maybe nitrous acid (HNO2) which is weaker? Or wait, another possibility: if C is a metal oxide, like CuO, when it reacts with water, it would form a metal (like Cu) and H2O, but water isn't an acid. Hmm, maybe C is a nitrate salt. Let me think.

Wait, the first reaction: solid A +8 equivalents B → C. If B is Cl2? No, but then C would be some chloride. Or perhaps B is sulfur? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is NO, which is a gas. Wait, that might not make sense because 8 equivalents seem high. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, another angle. Looking at the second reaction: product E is formed when C reacts with D. Also, D reacts with B in 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. Solvents include things like H2O, ethanol, maybe. So if D and B make a solvent, maybe D is something like H2O, but then B would have to be something that reacts with H2O to form a solvent. Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, if B is NO, and D is O2, then they could form something else. Or perhaps B is NH3; but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought. The product C when hydrolyzed gives back A, and two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak. Common strong acids are HCl, HNO3, H2SO4. Weak acids include HCN, HCOOH, HNO2, etc. So if C is a nitrate salt, say, maybe A is copper metal. So when C (say Cu(NO3)2) reacts with water, it hydrolyzes to form Cu(OH)2, which isn't an acid. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, if C is a nitride? Not sure.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate. Let me think of a reaction where a metal reacts with a diatomic gas to form a nitrate. For example, copper reacting with nitric oxide? Or maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with oxygen to form an oxide, but that doesn't involve nitric oxide. Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium, B is Cl2, but that would form NaCl. Hmm, but 8 equivalents of Cl2 reacting with sodium? That seems unlikely, as sodium is very reactive and Cl2 is diatomic, so 8 moles would require 4 moles of Cl2 per mole of sodium, but that doesn't fit the 8 equivalents.

Wait, perhaps A is copper, B is nitric oxide. But copper reacting with nitric oxide? Or maybe B is oxygen? Let me think: copper reacts with oxygen to form CuO. But CuO is a black solid, not red. Oh, wait, bright red product could be something else. Oh! I remember that when metals like silver react with certain conditions, they form red products. No, not exactly. Wait, another possibility: maybe product C is Cu2O, which is a red solid. So, if A is copper, and B is O2, then 8 equivalents of O2 reacting with copper to form Cu2O. Let me check stoichiometry. For 2 Cu + O2 → 2 CuO. Wait, but that's for CuO. But if it's Cu2O, maybe the reaction is 2 Cu + (1/2) O2 → Cu2O. So, 8 equivalents of O2 would require 16 moles of Cu. But that seems a bit much. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe B is another gas. Suppose B is O3 (ozone), but that's less common. Alternatively, perhaps B is H2S? No, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the second reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E. E is extremely hazardous. Also, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D and B are 1:1 to make a solvent. Let's list possible H solvents. Maybe H is water? But B would then have to be H2O as well, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, H could be ethanol, but then D and B would have to react to make ethanol. Maybe D is CO and B is O2? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is NH3. So D and B react to form NH3. For example, if D is H2 and B is N2, then 3 H2 + N2 → 2 NH3. But that's 3:1 ratio, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: when C reacts with D, it produces E. E is extremely hazardous. What are some extremely hazardous chemicals? Maybe something like sarin gas, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, maybe E is something like phosgene, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN, but that's produced from reactions involving cyanide.

Wait, but let me go back to the hydrolysis reaction. C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is weak. So if C is a nitrate salt, say, then hydrolysis would give nitric acid (strong) and another acid, perhaps nitrous acid (HNO2, weak). So for example, if C is NaNO3, then hydrolysis would give HNO3 and perhaps another acid, but wait, sodium nitrate hydrolyzes to give NaOH and HNO3? No, wait, sodium nitrate is NaNO3. When it hydrolyzes in water, it might not react much because it's a salt of a strong base (NaOH) and a weak acid (HNO3). So if C is NaNO3, then hydrolysis would give NaOH (strong base) and HNO3. Wait, but the question says acids F and G, not a base. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps C is something like NH4NO3 (ammonium nitrate). When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze. But I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: if C is a metal nitrate like Cu(NO3)2, then hydrolysis would produce Cu(OH)2 (a base) and HNO3. But the question states that the products are acids, so maybe it's not a metal nitrate.

Wait, another possibility: what if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2? When it reacts with water, it forms Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But again, that's a base and a weak acid (NH3 is a weak base). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitrite salt. For example, if C is NaNO2, then hydrolysis would produce HNO2 (weak acid) and NaOH (strong base). But the question says two acids, F and G. So that may not fit.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitro compound. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a different kind of compound.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the possible forms of E. E is formed from C and D. D reacts with B in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Let me think of possible H solvents and their reactions.

If H is H2O, then D and B must react to form H2O. So D could be H2 and B is O2, but that's a 2
