Okay, so I have this question about a scientific experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. Hmm, I need to figure out why there's no green signal when they look at the mice under the confocal microscope. Let me break down the problem step by step.

First, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The vector has two ORFs, ligand and receptor. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. So the vector has ligand-mCherry and then receptor-eGFP.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor is after an IRES element, which I remember allows for internal ribosome entry. IRES elements can allow the second gene to be expressed without needing a separate promoter if the first ORF is translated. So maybe the receptor is co-expressed with the ligand?

Looking at the stop cassettes: between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. Oh wait, these are stop cassettes, which prevent expression unless a Cre is present to excise them. So, in the absence of Cre, the ligand and receptor would not be expressed because the stop cassettes block their ORFs.

Wait, but the vector is a lox-Cre vector. I'm a bit confused about how this works. Oh, wait, the lox-Cre system is for Cre-mediated recombination. So when Cre is present, it would excise the stop cassette. So in the vector, without Cre, the ligand and receptor would be blocked. But if the cells have Cre, the stop cassettes are cut out, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But wait, the bicistronic construct has the ligand and receptor, right? So the vector probably allows expression of both, but only when Cre is present to remove the stop signals.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. After that, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins in a Western blot. So they probably checked whether the ligand and receptor were being expressed. But the question says they breed a mouse model homozygous for the construct in the wildtype background. Then they crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. So the offspring would have the Cre under SOX10 control, which is a neural crest specifier. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre should be active in those cells.

Wait, but why does this matter? Oh, because the Cre would excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells. So in those cells, ligand and receptor would be expressed. But they didn't see a green signal. eGFP is the fluorescent tag on
