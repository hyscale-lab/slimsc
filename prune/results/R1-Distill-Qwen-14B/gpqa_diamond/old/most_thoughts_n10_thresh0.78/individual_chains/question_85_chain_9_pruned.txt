Okay, so I've got this problem about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Each planet has different masses and radii, but they both have the same albedo. I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Wait, no, actually, the general formula is T_eq = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4) ), but maybe it's better to express it in terms of the star's properties and the planet's distance.

Wait, the star's luminosity L can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR_star²σT_star^4. So substituting that into T_eq, we get:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) )

But wait, albedo is the same for both planets, so the (1 - albedo) term cancels out when taking the ratio. So I can ignore that for this problem.

So, the equilibrium temperature for each planet will depend on the square root of (R_star divided by (2a)), where a is the planet's orbital distance from the star.

Wait, but how do I find the orbital distances of the two planets? The problem gives me information about the Doppler shifts caused by each planet. I think the RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. But how does that relate to the planet's mass and orbital period?

I recall that the RV method measures the star's velocity as the planet's gravitational pull causes it to wobble. The maximum velocity (v) is related to the planet's mass (M_p), the star's mass (M_s), and the orbital period (P). The formula I remember
