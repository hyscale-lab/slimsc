Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about quasars and the comoving distance in a universe described by the Lambda-CDM model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops a lot. I remember that when we observe objects at high redshifts, there's something called the Lyman-alpha forest, which affects the optical spectrum. But wait, quasars can have something called the Lyman break, which is a sharp drop in their spectra blueward (shorter wavelengths) of a certain rest-frame wavelength. Oh right! The Lyman limit is about 912 Angstroms, which is 91.2 nm in the rest frame. So if the peak is at 790 nm, that's near the Lyman-alpha line, I think. Wait, Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. Hmm, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the Lyman series is in the UV, so if a quasar's emission lines are redshifted into the optical, that tells us about its redshift. The peak here is at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared. So if the peak is in the observed frame, what would that correspond to in the rest frame?

Wait, but the question is about the comoving distance. Oh, right, the peak could be the Lyman-alpha emission line. If the peak is at 790 nm, then the rest wavelength is 121.6 nm (Lyman alpha). So z would be (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) - 1. So 790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.5, so z ≈ 5.5.

Wait, let me compute that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.499, so z is about 5.499, so roughly z=5.5.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the peak might be the Lyman break. The Lyman break occurs at the wavelength beyond which the intergalactic medium (IGM) is opaque due to the Lyman-alpha absorption. So the rest wavelength where
