Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

So the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but wait—does that mean the spots are cooler regions or hotter? I think dark spots on a star are cooler because they appear darker, so they emit less light. So the spots themselves would have a lower temperature than the surrounding photosphere.

But how does that affect the overall effective temperature of the star? Oh right, the effective temperature is like an average based on the total emitted radiation. So if a part of the star's surface is cooler (spots) and the rest is at the original Teff, the overall Teff would decrease.

Now the main question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio is observed to decrease when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless versus when it has spots.

Wait, the ratio of level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So when there are spots, the ratio is lower. Hmm, but why?

Oh, right, this is about the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. The formula is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature.

So the ratio of n1/n2 would be the inverse of that, right? So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ).

But wait, the problem says the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in level 1 to level 2 decreases when the star has spots. So when there are spots, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So, let's think about what causes the ratio to decrease. Let me think: the ratio depends exponentially on T. So higher T would make the exponent bigger, but wait, it's (E2-E1) divided by kT. So if T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes smaller because the denominator is bigger. So the exponential term becomes smaller, meaning that the ratio n1/n2 would decrease if T increases. Because a bigger T would make the denominator larger, causing the exponent to decrease, so exp(small positive) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. The energy difference between two levels is E2 - E1, let's say positive (so E2 > E1). Then (E2 - E1)/kT is positive. So, when T increases, this fraction decreases because the denominator increases. So exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) becomes smaller as T increases. Hence, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(kT) ) would decrease as T increases.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So in the spotted case, the overall Teff is lower. So when the star has spots, n1/n2 is lower because T is lower. Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k*T) becomes larger because T is smaller. So exp of a larger positive number is larger, so n1/n2 would be larger when T is lower? But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which corresponds to a lower T (5500 K) compared to when it's spotless (6000 K). So this seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I got the levels wrong. Let me think: if the transition corresponds to a wavelength of ~1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet or far UV? Wait, 1448 Å is about 144.8 nm, which is ultraviolet. The ionization potential of Ti I (neutral titanium) is... Let me think, titanium has an atomic number of 22. The first ionization potential is about 6.9 eV. So for a transition that emits a photon of energy E = hc/lambda. Let's compute E: h is 6.626e-3
