Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity, right? But wait, the question says the planets are in orbital resonance and their periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. 

Wait, the planets are in resonance, so their orbital periods are in the given ratios. But how does that help me find their equilibrium temperatures? I think the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * (L/(16πσ D^2))^0.25, but maybe there's a simpler way. Oh right, the formula can also be approximated as T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2a)), where a is the orbital distance. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, the standard formula is Te = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (2ε) )^0.25 * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), where ε is the emissivity. But since all planets have the same albedo and assuming emissivity is the same (like ε=1 for simplicity), the ratio of their temperatures would depend on the inverse square root of their orbital distances.

But wait, the planets are in a system where their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods are P
