Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and the pp-III branch stopping. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think through this.

So, the question is asking about the flux ratio between two neutrino energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), if the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core 8.5 minutes ago. The options are A to D, with various ratios.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch is part of this chain. The proton-proton chain has a few steps, but the main one I remember is the fusion of protons into deuterium, then tritium, and finally helium. The pp-III branch involves higher mass states, maybe something with boron or something, but I'm not too clear on the specifics.

Wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos. Oh right, the dominant neutrino production in the Sun comes from the pp-I branch, which produces two protons and a positron, releasing a neutrino. But the pp-III branch is another part of the chain that also emits neutrinos. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would stop.

So, the flux of neutrinos we detect on Earth is a mix from different sources. The main source is the pp-I process, which produces a lot of neutrinos, and the pp-III process contributes less. But wait, the question says that the pp-III branch stopped. So neutrinos from pp-III wouldn't be coming anymore.

Wait, no. Hold on. The problem says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. Oh, but I thought the pp-III is a branch of the main pp chain. So without the pp-III, maybe the main chain is affected? Or maybe the pp-III is a minor contributor, so stopping it would reduce neutrino flux from that part.

But the question is about the ratio between two specific energy bands. So the neutrinos from the pp-III process have specific energies. I think the pp-I process produces lower energy neutrinos, around a few hundred keV, while the pp-III produces higher energy ones. Wait,
