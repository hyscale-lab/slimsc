Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y, releasing gas W, and forming a precipitate G which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which is close to 0 degrees Celsius, right? Because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 is about 4°C. Hmm, so B must be a substance that melts just above freezing. I'm thinking maybe something like water, but wait, water's melting point is 273 K exactly. So maybe B is ice? No, because ice is solid below 273 K. Wait, maybe B is something else. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound. Wait, another thought: maybe B is something like sodium hydroxide? No, that's a solid. Wait, another approach: let's think about the possible substances whose melting points are around 277 K.

Wait, 277 K is approximately 4 degrees Celsius. So what substances melt around there? Well, maybe something like ammonium chloride? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, I remember that solid CO2 (dry ice) sublimates at lower temperatures, but that's not relevant here. Wait, maybe B is another compound. Or perhaps B is a metal. Wait, no, metals usually have higher melting points. Hmm.

Let me try to look at the other parts of the question. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. So the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That means that the molecular formula of W must have a total (protons + neutrons) such that each atom contributes equally. Wait, but wait, each molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, for example, if W is H2O, each molecule would have (number of protons: 2 H's = 2, O has 8. So total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: H has 1 each, so 2, O has 8, so 10. Wait, same as protons. Oh wait, wait a second: H2O would have (each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons unless it's deuterium, but the question says W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So H2O has 2 H's (protons: 2, neutrons: 0 each) and O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 2+8=10, total neutrons: 0*2 +8=8. Not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, then maybe W is something like CO2. Let's see. CO2 has one C (protons:6, neutrons:6?), wait, carbon can have different isotopes. Wait, but the question says the molecule's
