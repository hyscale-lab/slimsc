Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework that allows us to describe physics beyond the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, like dimension 6, 7, etc., depending on the energy scale we're considering.

The question is about which symmetries these operators must respect. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Let me start by recalling each symmetry:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is the symmetry of spacetime that includes rotations and boosts. It's fundamental in relativity. All physical laws should respect this symmetry. Operators in a field theory like SMEFT would need to be Lorentz-invariant, right? Because otherwise, the theory wouldn't make sense in different inertial frames.

2. **Poincare Symmetry**: This includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting space and time). Poincare group is the combination of Lorentz transformations and translations. If a theory has Poincare symmetry, it implies it has both. So if SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, does that mean it automatically respects Poincare? Hmm, maybe not directly. Wait, the Poincare symmetry is more about the overall spacetime symmetries, including momentum and energy conservation. But wait, SMEFT is built as an effective theory, which includes all possible interactions compatible with the Standard Model symmetries. So I think SMEFT does respect Poincare symmetry because the Standard Model does. But I'm not 100% sure if all operators must respect it. I'll have to think more.

3. **CP Symmetry**: This is the combination of Charge conjugation (C) and Parity (P). Charge conjugation swaps particles with their antiparticles, and Parity inverts spatial coordinates. CP symmetry is often violated in the Standard Model, especially in processes like certain meson decays. So operators in SMEFT can violate CP, meaning they don't have to respect it. But wait, the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators. So if some operators violate CP, then CP symmetry isn't necessarily a must. So maybe the answer doesn't include CP symmetry.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: This is the combination of Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. I remember that in quantum field theory, CPT is a fundamental symmetry. It states that every interaction is invariant under the combined transformation of C, P, and T. So any theory that respects quantum mechanics should respect CPT. Therefore, all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry.

Now, putting this together.

- Do all SMEFT operators respect Lorentz Symmetry? Yes, because without it, the theory isn't Lorentz invariant, and that's a requirement for a relativistic theory. So 1 is correct.

- Poincare Symmetry: Well, Poincare includes Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a field theory on Minkowski spacetime, it must respect Poincare. So 2 would also be correct. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Wait, Poin
