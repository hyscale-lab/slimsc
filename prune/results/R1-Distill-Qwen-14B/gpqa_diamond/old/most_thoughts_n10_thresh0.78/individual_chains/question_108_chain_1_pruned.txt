Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about paramagnetic coupling and the hydrogen atom's transition energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh wait, and m is small, so maybe m has a value close to zero? Not entirely sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

The problem compares the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen. The given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is the Balmer series or something like that. Oh wait, 0.486 micrometers is the wavelength for the Lyman-alpha emission, I think. Wait no, Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm, so 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer-alpha line, the H-alpha line. Right, that transition is from n=3 to n=2, or wait, n=2 to n=1? Wait no, Balmer series is transitions down to n=2. So H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, I think. So the energy difference ΔE is the energy of that photon. Let me calculate that.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, speed of light c is about 3e8 m/s. The wavelength given is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1e-9 meters. So plugging in, E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9).

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.09e-19 J. Wait, but wait, that's the energy of the photon. But ΔE here is the energy difference, so that's about 4.09e-19 J.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ is the expectation value of the perturbing Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For an electron, the magnetic moment is μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. For orbital magnetic moment, it's μ = m * μ_B
