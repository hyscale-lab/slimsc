Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question is about isomers—specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main points are about tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm. Let me break down each part.

First part of the question: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism. I need to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, resulting in different structures. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move. Like in keto-enol tautomerism.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, right? It has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring. So its structure is O=C6H4=C=O. I think quinones are aromatic, with conjugated double bonds. Do they have any hydrogens that can tautomerize? Wait, in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are conjugated, but each O is double-bonded to the ring. So each O is part of a ketone group. Are there any H's adjacent that could shift? Hmm. Wait, the structure is O=C6H4=O, so no, the carbonyls are directly attached to the benzene. There are no alpha hydrogens because the carbonyl groups are attached to the aromatic ring, which doesn't have H's on the adjacent carbons. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Its structure is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at the 1,3,5 positions. So each of those is a carbonyl group. Now, looking at each carbonyl, the adjacent carbons (like in a cyclohexane ring) have two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, no. The ring is six-membered. So each carbonyl is at a position, and the adjacent carbons are each connected to two other carbons. So for each keto group (like at position 1), the adjacent carbons (position 2 and 6) are CH2 groups. So each of those positions has H's attached. So cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have alpha hydrogens. That means it can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So it does show tautomerism.

So the first part, part A: the compound that doesn't show tautomerism is benzoquinone. So A would be benzoquinone, and the other is cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Second part, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when there's a chiral center—so a carbon with four different substituents.

Let's look at methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate means the acid is propanoic acid. The ester would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate: the propanoate is CH3CH(O-)COOCH3. Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but that's not right. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me draw the structure.

Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But when it's 2-hydroxypropanoate, the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, no, more accurately, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or maybe CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait
