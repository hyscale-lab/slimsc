Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

The problem says Compound A shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting patterns can tell us about neighboring protons. A triplet (which is a doublet of doublets or two neighboring groups each splitting the peak) and a quartet (which is a triplet of triplets or maybe one neighboring group with three H's) usually indicates some sort of splitting due to adjacent CH2 groups.

Looking at the integration: 6H and 4H. 6H as a triplet probably comes from two equivalent -CH2CH3 groups. Because each CH2CH3 group has 3 H's in the CH3, so two of them would account for 6H. The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4Hâ€”wait, 4H is like two sets of CH2 groups. So maybe it's something like a central CH2 connected to two other CH2 groups. Wait, but wait, what's a quartet in splitting? It usually comes from being next to a CH2 group with two H's. Because a quartet is (n+1) where n=3, but wait, no, wait: for splitting, the number of neighboring H's determines the split. So triplet is adjacent to two H's (like CH2), quartet is adjacent to three H's (maybe a CH3). Wait, wait, that might not be right. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The splitting (multiplicity) is determined by the neighboring protons. So a triplet occurs when a proton is next to a CH2 group (two protons). Each of those two protons splits the peak into a triplet. Similarly, a quartet would be if the proton is next to a CH3 group (three H's), so n=3, so the peak becomes a quartet (n+1=4). Wait, but in this case, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H. So each of those 4 H's is split into a quartet due to neighboring something.

Wait, so the quartet (4H) is split by something that has three H's. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe a structure where there's a -CH2-CH2-CH2- group, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the two CH2CH3 groups are on either side of a central CH2 group. So the structure might be something like CH2CH2(CH2CH3)2. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopropane or something else, but that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: the NMR of A has 6H as a triplet (CH2CH3 groups) and 4H as a quartet. So perhaps it's a diethyl ether structure. Wait, diethyl ether is CH3CH2OCH2CH3. The CH3 groups in diethyl ether would each be split by the adjacent CH2. So each CH3 in diethyl ether would be a quartet because they're adjacent to a CH2O group which has two H's. Wait, but the first triplet is 6H, which would be two CH3 groups, each split into a quartet. But the given NMR shows a triplet for 6H and a quartet for 4H. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, think about a 1,2-dimethylcyclopropane or something else. But wait, maybe it
