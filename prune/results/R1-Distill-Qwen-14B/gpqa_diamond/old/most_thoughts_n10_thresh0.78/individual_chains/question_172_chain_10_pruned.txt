Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in stars, it's all about the Boltzmann equation and the concept of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). 

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. So, I think the key here is the Boltzmann distribution, which relates the population of different energy levels to temperature.

The Boltzmann factor is something like the ratio of the population of two energy levels. The formula is (n2)/(n1) = exp( -(E2-E1)/(kT) ). Since the energy difference ΔE is given, let's say E2 is higher than E1 by ΔE. So, the ratio would be (n2)/(n1) = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ).

In this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms in a higher energy level. So, n2 (excited) for star_1 is 2 times n2 for star_2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, if the higher energy level is the excited state, then n_high_1 / n_high_2 = 2. Or perhaps the ratio is 2:1.

Wait, another approach: let's denote for each star, the number in the excited state and the ground state. But perhaps the question is comparing the same energy levels in each star. So, for star 1, the excitation level is twice that of star 2. So, the ratio is n1_excited / n1_ground = 2 * (n2_excited / n2_ground).

Wait, no, wait. The first part says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So perhaps the number of excited atoms in star_1's photosphere is twice that of star_2's. So star_1 has higher excitation.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me restate: the excitation level is a measure of the population in a higher energy state. So, if star_1's iron is twice as excited, that means the ratio of the number of atoms in the excited state to the ground state is higher in star_1 compared to star_2.

So, for each star, the ratio of excited to ground state is given by the Boltzmann factor. Let me write the ratios for each star.

For star_1: (n_high)_1 / (n_low)_1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
For star_2: (n_high)_2 / (n_low)_2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the question says that the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Wait, no, wait. The question says the excitation is twice, but perhaps it's the ratio of excited to ground that is twice? Or is it the ratio of the excited states between the two stars?

Wait, the exact wording is "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level is twice, which would mean (n_high)_1/(n_low)_1 = 2 * [(n_high)_2/(n_low)_2] ?

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the ratio (n_high)/(n_low) depends on the temperature. So the idea is that the excitation is higher in star_1, meaning that star_1 has a higher temperature. Because higher temperatures mean more excitation, as per the Boltzmann factor.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the populations (excited to ground) is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for each star, we have:

n1_high / n1_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
n2_high / n2_low = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But the problem says that the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Wait, perhaps the ratio (n_high)/(n_low) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So,

(n1_high)/(n1_low) = 2 * (n2_high)/(n2_low).

But wait, the actual statement is that the excitation is twice as much, which could be interpreted as the ratio in star_1 being twice the ratio in star_2. So,

(n1_high)/(n1_low) = 2 * (n2_high)/(n2_low).

But I think I should approach this more precisely. Let's denote the ratio for star 1 as R1 and for star 2 as R2.

So,

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

But according to the problem, R1 = 2 R2.

So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Take the natural logarithm on both sides:

ln( R1 ) = ln( 2 ) + ln( R2 )

Which gives:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) - ΔE/(k T2 )

Wait, that's because R1 =
