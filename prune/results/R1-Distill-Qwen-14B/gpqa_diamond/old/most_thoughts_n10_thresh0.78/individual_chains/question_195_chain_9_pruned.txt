Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again. Alright, we've got two planets. The first one has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have such that both transit and occultation events occur. They share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm. So, I remember that transit and occultation events depend on the alignment of the planets as they orbit the star. For a transit, the planet needs to pass directly in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we stop seeing its reflected light, which might cause a slight dimming as well, but I think the main point is that the planet is hidden behind the star.

Wait, but for both events to happen, the two planets must be aligned in such a way that their orbits cross each other in the same plane, right? So their orbital periods must be such that they can both transit and occult each other.

Wait, let me think again. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the problem says both transit and occultation events. Wait, does that mean the second planet transits the star and the first planet transits the second planet, or does it mean that the second planet transits and is occulted by the star?

Wait, no. Ah, wait, no. Wait, when a planet transits, it's in front of the star. When it's occulted, it's behind the star, so we don't see it. So for both events to occur, the two planets need to be in positions where one can transit the star (block its light) and the other can occult (be behind) the star. But wait, the question says the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, that would mean that the second planet is transiting (so it's in front of the star), and the first planet is behind the star (so it's occulting the first planet).

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem states:
