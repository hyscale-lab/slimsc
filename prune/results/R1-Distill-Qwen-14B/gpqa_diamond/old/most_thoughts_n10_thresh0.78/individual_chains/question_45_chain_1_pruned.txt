Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that each particle in such a well has energy levels given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And they've given me a simplified form where E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. That makes things a bit easier.

The question is asking about the ground state, first excited, and second excited states of the system. Since the particles are identical fermions, their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric due to the Pauli exclusion principle. So I need to construct the correct total wavefunction for each state.

Wait, but wait, the particles are spin-1/2, so each has spin up or down. But since we're dealing with four particles, how does the spin part factor in? Oh right, the overall wavefunction is a product of the spatial part and the spin part. For identical fermions, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of any two particles. So the spatial part and the spin part together must satisfy this.

In the case of four particles, the spin state can be symmetric or antisymmetric. But for the ground state, which is the lowest energy, I think the particles will fill the lowest available spatial orbitals, each possibly paired with opposite spins.

Wait, but how does the spin part contribute to the symmetry? The spin part could be either symmetric or antisymmetric. For four particles, the spin state would have a symmetry that, when combined with the spatial wavefunction's symmetry, gives an overall antisymmetric function.

But maybe a better approach is to determine the spatial wavefunction first, considering that each particle must occupy a unique quantum state. Because each particle has spin-1/2, each spatial orbital can hold up to two particles with opposite spins.

So the ground state would have the four particles in the lowest possible spatial orbitals, each filled with two particles (since each n can hold up to two with spin up and down). So for four particles, the first two orbitals (n=1 and n=2) would each hold two particles.

Wait, but that can't be right because four particles would require two orbitals with two each, but that would mean n=1 and n=2 each have two particles. But wait, n=1 can hold two (spin up and down
