Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of these stars meet the S/N ratio condition. Let me think about what I know about ESPRESSO and how it works.

ESPRESSO is an instrument on the VLT, right? It's a spectrograph, so it's used to take spectra of stars. The important thing here is the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel. The question says that a star is detectable if the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

First, I should probably recall what factors affect the S/N ratio. I remember that S/N is influenced by the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency. Also, the distance of the star matters because a star that's farther away appears dimmer, which reduces the S/N.

The stars given in the options have different distances and absolute magnitudes. Wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude a star would have at 10 parsecs. So, the apparent magnitude (m) depends on the absolute magnitude (M) and distance (d) in parsecs. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10) = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

So for each star, I can calculate their apparent magnitude. But wait, how does apparent magnitude relate to S/N ratio? I think brighter stars (lower magnitudes) will have higher S/N ratios because they emit more light. So lower m means easier to detect.

ESPRESSO's capability probably has a limit on the faintest star it can detect, i.e., a minimum S/N. So I need to find out which of these stars, when observed with ESPRESSO, will give an S/N >=10.

But wait, do I remember the typical S/N capabilities of ESPRESSO? I think ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph, but I'm not exactly sure about its sensitivity. Let's think about the parameters.

ESPRESSO can reach a certain S/N per pixel for a given exposure time, depending on the star's brightness. There's probably a formula or some relation between the star's flux, exposure time, and the S/N achieved.

I remember that the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time. Since all these stars are observed for 1 hour, that's fixed. So the main variables are the star's brightness (apparent magnitude) and the instrument's sensitivity.

Another factor is the telescope's collecting area. The VLT has 8m mirrors, so a large collecting area means more light is gathered, leading to higher S/N.

Wait, but how does the apparent magnitude translate into flux, and then into S/N? Let me think. The flux received from a star decreases with the square of the distance. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), where m is the apparent magnitude. Because lower m means more flux.

So, for each star, I'll compute their apparent V magnitude m. Then, using that, I can find the flux. The S/N depends on the flux. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact formula, but I think the S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux multiplied by the square root of the exposure time. Or maybe S/N ∝ sqrt(flux * time * efficiency).

Wait, another approach: I've read somewhere that for a given instrument, the S/N can be approximated as S/N = k * (F)^0.5 * sqrt(t), where F is the flux (in photons per second), t is the exposure time, and k is a constant that includes the instrument's efficiency.

But without knowing the exact values, maybe I can make a relative comparison. Let's think about the stars and their distances.

Let me outline the steps:

1. For each star, calculate the apparent magnitude m.

2. Brighter stars (lower m) will have higher S/N.

3. Determine which of these stars would give S/N >=10 when observed with ESPRESSO for 1 hour.

But I need to know what's the faintest magnitude ESPRESSO can handle to get S/N=10. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the absolute magnitude limit for which a certain m corresponds to S/N=10.

Wait, perhaps I can look for some reference or example. I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph can achieve an S/N ratio of about 10 for stars with V magnitudes around 20 or so, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula or equation that relates the S/N ratio to the magnitude. Let's think about the relation between S/N and magnitude.

The formula I think is S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)) ), where m0 is some reference magnitude. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the relation might be more complex, considering exposure time, telescope area, etc.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The VLT's collecting area is 8m, so the area is π*(4m)^2=approx 100 m². The flux received from a star is F = L / (4π d²), but since L is the luminosity, which for a star is related to its absolute magnitude.

But maybe I can compare the flux from each star relative to a standard star that ESPRESSO can handle.

Let me think about the standard star scenario. Suppose ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for a V=10 mag star in one hour. Then, for each star, I can compute how much fainter it is and see if the S/N is still ≥10.

Wait, but I don't know the exact S/N for a given magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula:

S/N ∝ sqrt( (F * t) ) ), where F is flux.

Flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m), where m is the apparent magnitude.

So, for a star at apparent magnitude m, the flux is F = F0 *10^(-0.4 m), where F0 is the flux for m=0.

Then, S/N is proportional to sqrt(F * t) = sqrt(F0 *10^(-0.4 m) * t).

Assuming F0 and t are fixed (same for all stars), then S/N is proportional to sqrt(10^(-0.4 m)).

So S/N = k * 10^(-0.2 m), where k is a proportionality constant.

We need S/N >=10.

So, 10^(-0.2 m) >= 10 / k.

But without knowing k, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the maximum m where S/N is 10.

But maybe I can think in terms of when the star's magnitude is brighter than some value, then it's detectable.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for photon flux and calculate the number of photons detected, then relate that to S/N.

The number of photons received per second is N_ph = N0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where N0 is the number of photons per second from a zero-magnitude star (which is a standard value).

The exposure time is t=1 hour = 3600 seconds.

The total number of photons is N_ph_total =
