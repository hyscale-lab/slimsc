Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Let me try to unpack it step by step. Hmm, the question is about analyzing a small peptide compound that's been synthesized. The NMR and LC-MS data are giving some confusing results, and I need to figure out why.

Alright, let's start with the NMR part. The 1H NMR spectrum is mostly as expected, except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So, each peak is about half of the expected integral. Wait, but they integrate to 1H together, which is what we'd expect. So why are they split into two?

The question says that based on the coupling pattern, spin-spin coupling is ruled out. Because if it were coupling, like a doublet of doublets or something, the splitting would be more complex. So it's not due to neighboring protons. Hmm. That leaves other possibilities. Oh, maybe it's something related to the structure of the molecule. Like, perhaps there's some kind of diastereotopicity or maybe some symmetry causing the protons to split into two?

Wait, diastereotopic protons are equivalent in some symmetry but not others. But wait, in an NMR, if two protons are diastereotopic, they might have slightly different chemical shifts, showing up as separate peaks. But in this case, their shifts are similar, so maybe it's not that. Or perhaps it's a case where the molecule has some kind of dynamic process that's causing the protons to appear as two separate signals.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a mixture of isomers. Like, if it's a diastereomer, that would cause different environments for the same proton. But in that case, maybe the shifts would be more different. Or perhaps the molecule has some kind of conformational change that's happening on the NMR timescale, causing the protons to average or split.

Wait, but the LC-MS data shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the molecular weight is the same. So it's not a case of different masses, like a degradation product or a fragment. So it must be a form of isomerism that doesn't change the molecular weight. So, either enantiomers or diastereomers.

Enantiomers have the same molecular weight but are mirror images. In chiral chromatography, they would separate, but if the LC isn't chiral, they might not. But the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks, so the mobile phase must have separated them. Wait, but the problem says "elevated temperature" in LC-MS. Maybe the column is chiral, or maybe the separation is due to diastereomerism, not
