Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectral data (IR and NMR), and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, red phosphorus and HI usually mean some kind of substitution reaction, maybe a hydrolysis or something else. Wait, no, wait. Red phosphorus is often used in substitution reactions, especially with chlorides, maybe for elimination... Or wait, I think red phosphorus and HI together are used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides to form alcohols, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is. The IR and NMR data will help me determine its structure.

Let's look at the IR data: peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which suggests either an O-H stretch (like in a carboxylic acid or alcohol) or maybe an N-H, but since there's no NMR info that suggests amines, I'll think O-H. Also, there's a peak at 1720 cm-1. That peak is in the range for a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is a bit high for a ketone. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. Alternatively, an ester or maybe an acid derivative. Wait, but another peak is at 1610 cm-1. That could be an aromatic ring (C=C stretching). The 1450 cm-1 might be another aromatic ring mode or perhaps another functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm. That's a strong indicator of an acidic proton. Carboxylic acids typically show a broad peak around there. So, this could be a carboxylic acid proton. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10, but it's usually a triplet or something else
