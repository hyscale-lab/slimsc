Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B. Each was treated with a different reducing agent. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. Wait, no, actually looking again: reaction A uses LiBH4 and H+ to give the R product, and reaction B uses BH3 and H+ to give the S product. So we're looking for the starting materials A and B.

The options are four possibilities, all involving A and B being different or same configurations of a certain compound: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, either R or S.

Hmm. I remember that when you reduce a ketone, the stereochemistry of the product depends on the reducing agent and the starting material's configuration. Wait, but in this case, the products are ketonesâ€”wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Wait, no, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ketone. Wait, pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. 2H-pyran-2-one would have a ketone at position 2 and a hydrogen at position 2? Hmm, perhaps it's a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Wait, actually, maybe it's a cyclic hemiacetal from a diol and a ketone or aldehyde. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone and it's undergoing some kind of ring-forming reaction during reduction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro pyran-2-one. So pyran is a six-membered ring with five carbons and an oxygen.
