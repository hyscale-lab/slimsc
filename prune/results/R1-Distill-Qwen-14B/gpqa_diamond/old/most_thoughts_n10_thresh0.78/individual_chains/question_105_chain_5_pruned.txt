Okay, so I have this astronomy problem in front of me. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. Alright, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and some dark spots on it, and how that affects the observed brightness. Then, they're asking what size planet would cause the same brightness variation if it were the planet instead of the spots.

So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. The Sun's radius is about 7e5 km, but maybe I don't need the exact number right now. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K. Now, one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots. Wait, wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So 20% of the hemisphere is spots.

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. I'm not sure if that's the difference from the star's temperature or from each other. Oh, the question says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. So I think that the spots are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K? Or is it 1000 K cooler than the star, so 5000 K?

Wait, the wording says "temperature difference of 1000K." So if the star's Teff is 6000 K, the spots are 5000 K, right. Because 6000 - 5000 = 1000 K difference.

The star is being observed, and as it's rotating, the spots come into and out of view, causing periodic changes in brightness. The question says that this situation can resemble an exoplanet. So, the spot-induced brightness variations are being mistaken for a planet.

But the question is, to produce the same amplitude in the light curve, what planet radius relative to the star would cause that? So, we're comparing the brightness dip caused by the planet transiting the star versus the dip caused by the spots.

Wait, but wait
