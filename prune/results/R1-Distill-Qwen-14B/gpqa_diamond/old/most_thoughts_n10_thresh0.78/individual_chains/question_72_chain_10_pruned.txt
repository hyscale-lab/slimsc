Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to understand what's going on.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down.

First, I think I need to figure out what each step does. Let's start with the first reaction. The initial compound is a bicyclo structure with a tert-butoxy group. The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, and they're using 2 equivalents, along with sodium iodide at elevated temperatures.

Wait a second, sodium iodide is often a good nucleophile, especially in the context of elimination or coupling reactions. The dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexadiene probably are leaving groups.

So, when I see a diene reacting with something that has leaving groups, maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps it's a coupling reaction where the dienes are undergoing some cycloaddition.

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo compound. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene derivatives are known for Diels-Alder reactions because the bridgehead can act as a diene or a dienophile.

Wait, no, in this case, the other molecule is a cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So maybe it's a diene as well. So perhaps a [4+4] cycloaddition? Or maybe something else.

Wait, but the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So, maybe during the first reaction, the diene part of the bicyclo compound reacts with the cyclohexadiene, and the leaving groups (Br) depart, with iodide replacing them.

Wait, but sodium iodide is present. So perhaps this is a nucleophilic substitution. But the two equivalents suggest that each of the dibromomethyl groups may be undergoing substitution.

Wait, but the starting molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)c
