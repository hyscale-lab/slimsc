Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of enthalpy calculations. But let's see what I can do. The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation for a specific organic compound. The compound's formula is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure.

From the formula, I can tell it's an alkene since there are double bonds. Each double bond is between carbon atoms. The molecule seems to have two double bonds. Wait, let me count the double bonds. Looking at the formula, I see two instances of "CH=C". So, that makes two double bonds. Okay, so the molecule has two double bonds, which probably affects the number of pi bonds and hence the bond energies.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon as 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and form atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy needed to break a C-C bond. But wait, no, actually I think I might be mixing this up. Oh wait, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to convert an element into its gaseous atoms. So for carbon, that's when a solid or liquid turns into gaseous atoms. But in this problem, the enthalpy of atomization is given as 1000 kJ/mol, which I think corresponds to the bond dissociation energy of C-C bonds. Because when you break a C-C bond, you're effectively atomizing the carbon in a molecule. So for example, in a carbon molecule like graphite, the bond energy is about 1000 kJ/mol. Wait, no, I think I'm off here. The bond energies are given for C-C, C=C, etc., so maybe the enthalpy of atomization is given for a different purpose.

Wait, maybe the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in one mole of a substance to produce gaseous atoms. For example, if I have a molecule like CH4, the enthalpy of atomization would be the energy needed to break all the bonds (C-H and C-C if any) to get C and H atoms. But in this question, the enthalpy of atomization is given only for carbon. So maybe that's the energy to break a C-C bond, turning a solid into gaseous atoms. Hmm, perhaps I should think about this as the energy per mole to break one mole of C-C bonds into gaseous atoms. So each C-C bond requires 200 kJ/mol to break. Wait, but the given says bond energy of C-C is 200 kJ/mol. So,
