Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about stars and their distribution in terms of parallax. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, but when we talk about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, how does that change with the parallax value itself?

I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, the formula is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is in parsecs. So as the parallax increases, the distance decreases. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. Since the stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, I think that means they're spread out uniformly in space as well, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, uniform distribution in the sky doesn't necessarily mean uniform in space, but maybe in this question, it's assuming that the number density of stars is uniform in space.

So, let's assume the number density of stars (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's say n is the number per unit volume. Then, the number of stars within a certain distance would depend on the volume.

If I consider a thin spherical shell at a distance d with thickness dr, the volume of that shell is 4πd² dr. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dr.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Let's substitute that into the volume. So when plx changes by a small amount, say from plx to plx + dplx, the corresponding distance change is from d to d - dd, where dd = 1/(plx + dplx) - 1/plx. Wait, maybe that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, since plx is inversely proportional to d, maybe I can express everything in terms of plx.

Let me try expressing d in terms of plx. So d = 1/plx. The volume element in terms of plx would require considering how d changes with plx. The volume of a shell at distance d with thickness dr is 4πd² dr. But dr is related to dplx. Because
