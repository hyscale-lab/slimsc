Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence and finding the probability of getting specific outcomes.

First, the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but quantum states are usually represented as vectors with unit length, right? Let me check: the vector is (-1, 2, 1). Let's compute the magnitude. The square of each component is 1, 4, and 1, so sum is 6. So the magnitude is sqrt(6). Hmm, so I think the state vector must be normalized. Oh wait, because in quantum mechanics, the state vector is a unit vector. So perhaps the given state is not normalized? Or maybe I should normalize it before proceeding.

Wait, but the problem states it as the state at time t, so maybe it's already normalized. Let me calculate the sum of squares: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) multiplied by (-1, 2, 1). Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors have to be normalized. So I think the initial vector is actually ( [-1, 2, 1]^T ) / sqrt(6).

Wait, but the problem says the state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, maybe they just wrote the components, and in reality, the state is normalized. So I'll proceed under the assumption that it's normalized, but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I should normalize it when necessary.

Next, the operators for P and Q are given. Let me look at P first. The matrix for P has elements:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Hmm, I can write this as a matrix:

P = [
