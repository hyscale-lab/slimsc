Okay, so I've got this astronomy question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is asking which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory. Both are high-resolution spectrographs, but they have different brightness limits for the stars they can observe. 

From the question, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. Oh, wait, because lower magnitude means brighter. So ESPRESSO can detect stars down to V=17, which are brighter than that. Wait, no, wait. Wait, magnitude is a bit counterintuitive. The lower the number, the brighter the object. So if a star's apparent magnitude is less than 17, it's brighter than 17. So ESPRESSO can observe stars as faint as 17 mag? Or brighter than 17? Hmm, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So I think that means that ESPRESSO can see stars with V magnitude up to 17, so stars brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait no, wait, if the magnitude is 17, that's brighter than a magnitude of 20, for example. So if a star is brighter than V=17, that's a magnitude less than 17, meaning it's visible. So for ESPRESSO, the apparent V magnitude must be ≤17, right? Because the brighter the star, the lower the magnitude. So if a star is magnitude 16, it's brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, stars with V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO.

HIRES, on the other hand, can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So their apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. Because brighter than 16 means magnitude less than 16.

So the stars that can be detected by both would have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 because HIRES can't go beyond that. Wait, but ESPRESSO goes up to 17. So for a star to be detectable by both, its apparent V magnitude must be ≤16. Because HIRES can't go beyond 16, so anything above 16 can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

So the stars that both can see must have apparent V magnitude ≤16.

But wait, some of the stars given have absolute magnitudes, not apparent. Oh, right, so I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for those stars.

Let's look at each star:

Star1: Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance is 10 pc.

Apparent magnitude (m) is calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10)
