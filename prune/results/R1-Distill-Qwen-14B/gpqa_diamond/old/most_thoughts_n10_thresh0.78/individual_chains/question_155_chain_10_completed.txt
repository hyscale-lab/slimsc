Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the uncertainty in P_z given a certain state. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z. They've given the matrix forms for each of these operators. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So I'm working in the eigenbasis of P_z, which probably means that the matrix for P_z is diagonal, right? Looking at the given P_z matrix, yeah, it's diagonal with entries ℏ, 0, -ℏ. That makes sense; the eigenvalues are ℏ, 0, -ℏ for the three basis states.

The system is found in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ℏ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of the measurement of P_z in this state. The formula for uncertainty is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ), right?

First, I should calculate the expectation value <P_z> and <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Wait, but let's make sure. The expectation value <P_z> is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, each component of ψ is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So, let me write down the components. The state vector is:
ψ = [ a, b, c ]^T where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

The diagonal elements of P_z are:
- First entry: ℏ,
- Second: 0,
- Third: -ℏ.

So <P_z> = a*(ℏ) + b*(0) + c*(-ℏ) = (-1/2)*ℏ + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(-ℏ).

Let me compute that:

= (-1/2)ℏ + 0 + (1/2)ℏ.
Wait, that adds up to zero? Because (-1/2 + 1/2) = 0. So <P_z> = 0.

Hmm, okay, but what about <P_z²>? Since P_z squared would have elements [ ℏ², 0, ℏ² ] on the diagonal because (0)^2 is 0, and the others are (ℏ)^2 and (-ℏ)^2 which is the same as ℏ^2.

So <P_z²> = a²*(ℏ²) + b²*(0) + c²*(ℏ²).

Plugging in a = -1/2: a² = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

c is also -1/2, so c² is same as a², 1/4.

b is 1/sqrt(2), so b² is (1/2).

So,

= (1/4) * ℏ² + (1/2) * 0 + (1/4) * ℏ²
= (1/4 + 1/4) ℏ²
= (1/2) ℏ².

So <P_z²> is (1/2) ℏ².

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( (1/2) ℏ² ) = (ℏ / sqrt(2)) ).

Wait, that's option B. But let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: maybe I should verify the state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x. So perhaps I should express it in the P_z basis, but no, the basis is already the eigenbasis of P_z, so the state is represented as it is.

Wait, let me confirm if the state is correctly normalized. The state is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]. The norm is (-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 +1/4)= 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the calculation seems correct. So the uncertainty is ℏ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix for $P_z$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar, 0, -\hbar)$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(\hbar) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)(-\hbar).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = -\frac{\hbar}{2} + 0 + \frac{\hbar}{2} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is diagonal with entries $(\hbar^2, 0, \hbar^2)$ on the diagonal. The expectation value $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$ is computed as:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \psi^\dagger P_z^2 \psi = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 (0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (\hbar^2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + 0 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Uncertainty $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, this simplifies to:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
