Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR spectrum of the final product. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with acetic acid. Let's go through each step carefully.

First reaction: Acetic acid is treated with bromine (Br2), pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. I remember that when acetic acid reacts with Br2 in the presence of pyridine, which acts as a base, it undergoes bromination. Wait, but also, acetic anhydride is present. Oh right, acetic anhydride can act as a catalyst or maybe it's part of the reaction conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the formation of an acyl bromide. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's the formation of bromoacetic acid. Or wait, acetic acid with bromine might lead to substitution. Wait, no, wait, acetic acid has an -OH group. So when you brominate acetic acid, I think it's more about the substitution of the hydroxyl group.

Wait, another approach: Br2 in pyridine is a reagent for the substitution of -OH groups. So acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacting with Br2 and pyridine would substitute the hydroxyl oxygen with Br. So product 1 would be bromoacetic acid, CH2BrCOOH? Wait, no, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. So the OH is on the carboxylic acid. Substituting that would give CH3COBr, but wait, isn't that acetyl bromide? Wait, no, that's when you have an acyl chloride. Wait, but wait, when you have acetic acid reacting with Br2, under what conditions? Oh, maybe it's a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by Br. So, OH becomes Br, giving CH2BrCOOH? Or wait, no, wait. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. If the hydroxyl is replaced by Br, it becomes CH3C(O)Br, which is acetyl bromide. But wait, that's an acyl bromide. But wait, how?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. If it's treated with Br2 in pyridine, which is a base, perhaps it's an acid bromide formation. Wait, when acetic acid is treated with PBr3, it forms acetyl bromide. But here, pyridine is used. Oh, perhaps it's a similar reaction. So product 1 is acetyl bromide, CH3COBr.

Wait, but sometimes, when you have Br2 and pyridine, it's used for substitution reactions. For example, in the substitution of alcohols with bromine. So maybe in this case, the -OH in acetic acid is replaced by Br. So that would make
