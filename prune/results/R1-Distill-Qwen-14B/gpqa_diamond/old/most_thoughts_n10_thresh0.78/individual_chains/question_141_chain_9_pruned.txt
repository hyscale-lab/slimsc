Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question again.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A) 4, B) 1, C) 2, D) 3.

Hmm. Wait, I need to make sure I understand the structure of the starting material. 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh wait, that's probably a typo or a misnomer. Benzene with two substituents? Let me think. 1-bromo would be in one position, and another substituent in the 2 position. So, the structure is bromobenzene with another group attached in the ortho position. But wait, what's the substituent? Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichlorobenzene? Wait, the name isn't exactly clear. Wait, no. Wait, the way it's written is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, perhaps the "-2-d" is a typo and should be something else. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not certain. Wait, maybe "d" stands for something else, like a deuterium or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dichloro, but I'm not sure. Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but that's toluene with bromine. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is bromobenzene with another substituent at the ortho
