Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question says: We have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. We need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options.

Hmm, di-substituted aromatic ringâ€”so the benzene ring has two substituents. The total carbon count is 8. Let me think about that. A benzene ring is six carbons. So the substituents must add two more carbons because 6 + 2 =8. So each substituent would have one carbon each if there are two substituents. Alternatively, maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other is a single carbon?

Wait, but let's think about the functional groups. The IR has a carbonyl (C=O), which suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or something. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so one of the substituents is a halide, like Cl, Br, etc.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on the aromatic ring could be a halogen and a carbonyl-containing group. But wait, if the substituents are both on the ring, maybe one is a halogen, and the other is a carbonyl group. Or perhaps one substituent is a halogen, and another is something else that brings in a carbonyl.

Wait, but the ring is di-substituted, so two groups attached. Let me think about possible structures.

If the carbonyl is part of a substituent, like an acetyl group, then perhaps one substituent is a halogen (like Cl) and the other is an acetyl (COCH3?), but wait, how many carbons would that add?

Wait, the benzene has six carbons. So substituents add two more. Let's see:

If one substituent is a halogen, like Cl, that's just one atom, no carbons. The other substituent would have to add two carbons. Oh wait, but the total is 8 carbons. So 6 (benzene) + substituents = 8. So substituents must have 2 carbons in total. So maybe one substituent is a Cl (0 carbons) and the other is a group with two carbons.

Wait, that can't be right because Cl is a substituent but doesn't add any carbons. So the substituents would be Cl and another group with two carbons. So the two substituents add two carbons in total.

Wait, but substituents like Cl are just substituents, they don't add any carbons. So the substituents would each have to contribute some carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. If the substituent is, say, a methoxy group (OCH3), that would add one carbon (the methyl). But that's not a carbonyl. Alternatively, an acetyl group would be a substituent with two carbons (like COCH3). So if the substituents are Cl and COCH3, then the carbons from substituents are 2. So 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (COCH3) = 8. Yeah, that adds up.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 substituents. Or maybe another group, but let me think about that.

Alternatively, the substituents could be a carbonyl group and a halogen. Wait, but an acetyl group is a carbonyl-containing group. So benzene with Cl and COCH3 substituents. Or maybe the substituents are Cl and a ketone that's attached, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group like a ketone (like benzophenone derivatives), but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the compound has a carbonyl group, so perhaps the substituent is an acyl group. For example, meta-chlorobenzaldehyde would have an aldehyde group, but that's an aldehyde. Alternatively, a ketone like acetophenone (but that's mono-substituted unless there's another substituent).

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl). So the benzene ring has two substituents: one is Cl and the other is an acetyl group (COCH3). So that would give a total of 6 + 1
