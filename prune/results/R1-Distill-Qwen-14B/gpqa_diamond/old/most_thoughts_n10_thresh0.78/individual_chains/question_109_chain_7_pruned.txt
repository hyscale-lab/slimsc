Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state emitting a particle X. The particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. I remember that parity is a quantum number, and when particles are emitted, their parities affect the overall parity of the system.

The Pauli statistics part says that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused. T is isospin, S is spin, L is orbital angular momentum. Oh, right, the isospin part. The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to figure out what that implies about the other quantum numbers.

The question is asking which partial wave isn't permitted. The options involve different angular momentum states for X, denoted by the lowercase letters. I think each option shows the initial state (1S0) changing to a different state plus the emitted particle.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. So S is the total spin of the nucleon pair. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). For 1S0: 2S+1 is 1, so S=0. The orbital angular momentum L is denoted as 'S' in the spectroscopic notation. Wait, wait, no— spectroscopic notation for orbital angular momentum is S, P, D, F... which correspond to L=0,1,2,3... So 1S0 means L=0 (since S is the symbol for L=0), and the spin state is S=0. The J is 0, because J = L + S, and L=0, S=0 gives J=0.

So the initial state is S=0, L=0, J=0. When two nucleons are in this state and emit a particle X, the final state is another state of the NN system plus the particle X.

The problem says that particle X has intrinsic parity -1. I remember that the parity of a system is the product of the intrinsic parity of the particles and the orbital angular momentum factor. The parity of the initial state is calculated as (-1)^L, because for two nucleons, their intrinsic parity is considered. Wait, no— wait. The parity of a system is the product of the parity of each particle and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. But in the case of identical particles like nucleons, their intrinsic parity is the same, so for two particles, it's [parity]^2*(-1)^L. Since parity is either +1 or -1, [parity]^2 is +1. So the initial state's parity is (-1)^L. For 1S0, L=0, so parity is 1.

When a particle X is emitted, the parity of the final state should be considered. But wait, the process is emission, so the total parity before and after should be
