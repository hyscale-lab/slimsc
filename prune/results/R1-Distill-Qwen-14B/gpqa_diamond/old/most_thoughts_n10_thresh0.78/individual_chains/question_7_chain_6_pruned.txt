Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The process given is γγ → e⁺e⁻. We're supposed to find the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10⁻³ eV.

Hmm. Right, so I remember that high-energy particles like gamma-rays can interact with the CMB photons. Since the CMB is everywhere, these interactions can limit how long such particles can exist, or their lifetime. If their lifetime is too short, they won't travel very far, so this affects how they are observed in the universe.

I think the process here is called photon-photon annihilation. So when a high-energy gamma-ray photon interacts with a low-energy CMB photon, they annihilate each other and produce an electron-positron pair. This interaction is significant enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime.

Wait, how does the energy relate here? The gamma-ray has high energy, and the CMB photon has low energy, about 1e-3 eV. So I guess the cross-section for this process depends on the energies of both photons.

I remember something about the cross-section for photon-photon interactions. The cross-section σ for γγ → e⁺e⁻ depends on the product of the photon energies. So maybe σ is proportional to (E1 * E2), where E1 and E2 are the energies of each photon. But I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I think the cross-section has a threshold. The process can only happen if the combined energy is enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy for each is 0.511 MeV, so together it's 1.022 MeV. So the combined energy of the two photons must be at least this.

Wait, but in this case, the gamma-ray photon is much higher energy than the CMB photon. The CMB photon is about 1e-3 eV, which is way lower than 1 MeV. So the gamma-ray photon must have enough energy such that when combined with the CMB photon, their energies sum to at least 1.022 MeV.

Wait, that's right. The energy of each photon is E1 and E2. The sum E1 + E2 must be at least 2*m_e*c², which is about 1.022 MeV. So for the process to occur, E1 + E2 ≥ 1.022 MeV. Since E2 is the CMB photon's energy, which is about 1e-3 eV, which is way smaller than 1 MeV. So the gamma-ray photon must have energy E1 ≥ 1.022 MeV - E2. But since E2 is negligible compared to 1 MeV, E1 must be at least about 1 MeV, but that's way lower than the options given, which are in
