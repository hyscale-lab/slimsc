Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. Hmm. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also called the degree of unsaturation) is a way to determine the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond counts as one, and each triple bond counts as two. So I need to figure out what the product looks like after the reaction.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize that structure. Cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. So, position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? Wait no, vinyl is CH₂=CH- but attached where? Oh, wait, 5-vinyl would mean the substituent is on the fifth carbon of the cyclohexene ring. Wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with the double bond in position 3. So the numbering would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4? Or maybe 2 and 3? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Wait, cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would have the double bond starting at carbon 3. So the ring has double bond between C3 and C4, and the carboxylic acid group is at C2? Because it's 2-formyl... Oh, wait no, 2-formyl-5-vinyl. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring where at position 2 is a formyl (CHO) group, and at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂, but wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH-). So the substituents are a formyl at C2 and a vinyl at C5.

Wait, no, the structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The substituents are: at position
