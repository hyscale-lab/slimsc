Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I need to figure out what color it absorbs. Let me think. I remember that when a compound emits light, it's because it absorbed certain wavelengths and then re-emits others. But wait, the question says the dye emits light with a specific energy. So does that mean it's the energy of the emitted photon, and I need to find the absorbed energy?

Wait, no. Wait, in fluorescence or phosphorescence, the molecule absorbs higher energy and emits lower energy light. So the emitted light's energy is lower than what was absorbed. So the energy given off is less than the absorbed. So the absorbed energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

But the question is, what color is absorbed? Because the absorbed light would be the complementary color of the emitted one, right? Or wait, no. Let me think again. When a substance emits light of a certain color, that's because it absorbed another color. The absorbed color is the one that causes the electron excitation.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let's break it down. The energy of the emitted light is given as 2.339
