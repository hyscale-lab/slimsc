Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

So, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. TTV stands for transit timing variation, if I remember correctly. But the key point here is that there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance, which means their orbital periods are in a specific ratio. The ratio given is 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for planets 1 through 5. 

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of these planets, specifically comparing Planet_4 and Planet_2. It says all planets have the same albedo, which probably simplifies the calculation because albedo affects how much light is reflected, and if it's the same, it won't complicate the temperature ratio.

So, equilibrium temperature. I remember the formula for the equilibrium temperature of a planet is based on the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is T = T_star * ( ( L / (16πσ D^2) )^0.25 ), but wait, maybe a more simplified version applies here. Oh right, another way to write it is T = T_eff * ( (1 - a) / (2) )^0.5 * ( L / (16πσ D²) )^0.25, but perhaps more relevant is the inverse square law for flux. 

Wait, perhaps the formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) ), where R_star is the star's radius and D is the planet's orbital distance. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - a) / 2 )^0.5 * ( ( L ) / (16πσ D²) )^0.25. But since all planets have the same albedo (a), that term will be the same for all, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, but L is the luminosity of the star. Oh wait, but the star's luminosity is the same for all planets, because all are orbiting the same star. So L is the same for each planet. So the only variable here is the distance D from the star.

So the formula simplifies to T proportional to (1/D)^0.5. Because T scales as (1/D^0.5) when other factors are constant.

Wait, but the formula I remember is that the equilibrium temperature is given by T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) ) * ( (1 - a) / 2 )^0.5. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the formula can be written as:

T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - a) / 2 )^0.5 * ( (L) / (16πσ D^2) )^0.25.

But since L is the same for all planets, and a is the same (given), and σ is a constant, the ratio of temperatures between two planets will depend on the
