Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let's see what I've got to go on.

The compound is C9H11NO2. Hmm, the molecular formula might give me some clues about the structure. Let me think. The molecular formula can be broken down into possible functional groups. For C9H11NO2, the degrees of unsaturation might help. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2, so plugging in the numbers: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond or a ring, and maybe an amide or ester group.

Looking at the IR data: strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Since the intensity is strong, maybe an amide or amine. Wait, amides typically have a broad N-H stretch because of hydrogen bonding, whereas amines can be more intense. The presence of these might suggest an amide group. Also, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Ester groups or amides have that. For esters, the carbonyl is usually around 1720-1740. Amides have lower wavenumbers, around 1680-1650. Wait, but 1720 is more like an ester or maybe a ketone. Hmm, but amides could have that if they're not conjugated? Or maybe it's an aromatic amide, which might have a higher wavenumber? I'm a bit confused here.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) - that's probably a CH2CH3 group, maybe an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) - broad singlet, two protons. Maybe an OCH2 group, like an ethoxy or something. But the broadness could be due to exchange or perhaps an NH group, but wait, the 4.0 is too downfield for an amine. Alternatively, maybe an OCH2 adjacent to something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) - quartet, two protons. The quartet suggests it's next to a CH2 group with two protons. So maybe this is a CH2 connected to something else, like an ester group. Wait, for example, in an ester, like R-O-CO-..., the CH2 adjacent to the ester oxygen (like the OCH2CO
