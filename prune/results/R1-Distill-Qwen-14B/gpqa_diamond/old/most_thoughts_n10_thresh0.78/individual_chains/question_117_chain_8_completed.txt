Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, which means they can rotate plane-polarized light in different directions. This usually happens when a molecule has a chiral center or some sort of stereogenic element.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls are two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents here are nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions on each ring, and carboxylate groups at 2 and 2' positions. Now, biphenyl compounds can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image. This is especially true if the substituents are in positions that prevent free rotation—like when there are bulky groups on each ring that would make rotation difficult. In this case, the substituents are at positions that are para to each other. Wait, but how does that affect the possibility of optical isomerism? Oh, wait, biphenyls can have what's called "dihedral isomerism." If the two substituents on each ring are arranged such that the molecule can't be rotated to match its mirror image, then it's chiral. So, the substituents are on the same carbon? No, wait, the biphenyl has two rings connected by a single bond. If the substituents are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical around that single bond, then it can have stereoisomerism. So, in this case, the substituents on each ring—maybe at 2 and 6—could create a situation where the mirror image isn't superimposable. So this compound probably has optical isomerism.

2. The second compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break that down. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2COOH where the hydroxyl is on the second carbon. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, actually, propanoate is CH3CH2COO- but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO- with a methyl ester, so the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, so 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propionic acid. So the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Alternatively, maybe I should draw it: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but with a hydroxyl on the middle CH2. So the structure is HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait, the ester is methyl, so the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. The ester would replace the -OH of the acid with OCH3. So it would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. Actually, 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH, and the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Now, looking for chiral centers. The middle carbon (the second carbon) has four different groups: OH, CH2COOCH3, CH3, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, wait. Let me see: the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, maybe it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2, which is connected to OH, COOCH3, and two CH2 groups. Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Let me imagine the structure. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So the 2 position is the middle CH2. So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl on that middle CH2. So the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is CH2 with OH, CH2COOCH3, and two more CH2 groups. Wait, but that would give the central carbon as CH2. No, wait, I think I'm mixing up the positions. Wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the positions are 1, 2, 3. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Then the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon (position 2) would have OH, two CH2 groups, and the COOCH3 group. Wait, that's four different groups? Let me count:

- The central carbon (C2) is attached to:
   1. OH group.
   2. CH2COOCH3 (which is a propionoate group? No, wait, it's the same carbon as the C2. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The molecule is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So C2 is the middle CH2. So C2 is connected to:

   - C1: which is CH2OH.
   - C3: which is CH2COOCH3.
   - Two H's?
Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, each carbon in a CH2 group has two Hs. But for the central carbon (C2) in CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, it's connected to C1 (CH2OH), C3 (CH2COOCH3), and two H's. Oh wait, then the central carbon is CH2, which would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the central carbon is actually CH2, not a stereogenic center because it's attached to two H's. No, wait, wait. If C2 is CH2, then it's CH2 in the middle. So each CH2 has two Hs. So that can't have a chiral center because a chiral center needs four different groups attached. So in this case, C2 is attached to two Hs, so no, it can't be a chiral center. So this molecule doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but I might be wrong. Alternatively, maybe I'm looking at the structure wrong. Let me think again. Alternatively, the structure might be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. That would be 2-hydroxypropanoate, where the middle carbon is CH(OH). So in that case, the middle carbon would have:

- CH3, 
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2? No, wait, I'm getting confused. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH), connected to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH? No, I think I'm mixing up the positions again. Alternatively, maybe the structure is such that 2-hydroxypropanoate is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which is (HOCH2CH2)COOCH3. So the C2 is CH2, with two Hs, making it impossible to be a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here. Hmm, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should think about whether there's another source of chirality, like a planar group. I don't think so, so perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait. If the molecule has an ester group and a hydroxyl group on adjacent carbons, could there be another possibility? Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group. Wait, that would be different. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the hydroxyl is on C2. Then, the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the C2 is CH2, which can't have four different substituents. Therefore, no chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different. Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, which would have a CH(OH) in the middle. Then, the central carbon would be attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 or another group. Wait, no, in that case, the central carbon is attached to:

   - CH3,
   - COOCH3,
   - OH,
   - and a CH2 from the next carbon? No, perhaps not. I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back to this.

3. The third compound is benzophenone. Benzophenone is a ketone where two benzene rings are connected by a ketone group, so it's (Ph)C(O)(Ph). So the structure is two benzene rings connected by a carbonyl group. Now, can this molecule have optical isomerism? Optical isomerism requires the presence of a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element. Benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen (in the carbonyl group), so it's not a stereogenic center. The molecule is symmetric because the two benzene rings are the same. So, no, benzophenone doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. The fourth compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. The structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, it's O=C-OCH3 connected to CH2=CH-COOCH3. No, wait, no. The structure of fumarate is trans in the double bond. So, the structure is (Z) or (E)? Wait, fumarate is the (E) isomer. So the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So, the structure is CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3, and each end has a COOCH3 group. Wait, no, fumarate is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, no, no, no. Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Fumaric acid is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So the structure is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and when esterified, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So, the two ester groups are on either end of the double bond, trans to each other. Now, can this compound show optical isomerism? Well, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on each carbon. If the substituents are different on each side, it can exhibit geometric isomerism, but optical isomerism comes from chiral centers or other stereogenic elements. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate has two ester groups on either end of a double bond. Let me think about the structure. The double bond is between C2 and C3. Each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH3 groups? No, wait, each carbon has two COOCH3 groups? Wait, no, each is connected to one COOCH3 group and two H's? Wait, no, maybe. Let me correct this: fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait, no. Fumaric acid is actually HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, no, wait, the correct structure is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So, the structure is a dihydroxy acid with a double bond between the middle two carbons. The dimethyl ester would replace the -OH groups with OCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, no. The correct structure is O=C-OCH3 on both ends of the double bond. So each end is a COOCH3 group attached to the double bond. So it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Wait, no, wait. Let me get this right. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, no, no, it's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So the structure is a four-carbon chain with a double bond between C2 and C3, and the two ends are both carboxylic acid groups. When esterified with methanol, each -OH becomes OCH3. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, no. Wait, no, in fumaric acid, the structure is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H. So the ester would be O=C-OCH3 on each end. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Alternatively, it's O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of the double bond. So it's CH2=CH with each CH connected to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? Wait, no, each double bond carbon is connected to one COOCH3. So the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, wait, each double bond carbon can only have two substituents. So the correct structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that can't be right because each double bond carbon can only have two substituents. Wait, the correct structure should be O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of the double bond. So the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Z) or (E). But wait, dimethyl fumarate is an ester of fumaric acid, which is the (E) isomer. So the substituents on each end of the double bond are on opposite sides. Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let me look at the molecule. Each of the carbons in the double bond (C2 and C3) is attached to two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, each C in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 group, a CH2 group, and a hydrogen? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is:

O
||
CH2-CO-OCH3
   |
   C
   ||
   CH2-CO-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

COOCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
   |
   CH2-CH2
   ||
Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the structure. Fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified, each -OH becomes OCH3. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of the double bond. So the structure would be CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. But wait, each double bond carbon can only have two substituents. So each of the double bond carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to a COOCH3 group and a CH3 group? No, wait, no, because fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, so when esterified, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, maybe not. I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the actual structure. Fumarate is the (E) isomer of dihydroxydibasic acid. So when the ester is formed, each -COOH becomes -COOCH3. So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
   |
   CH2-CH2
   ||
Wait, I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of a chiral center. But in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical groups (like COOCH3 and two CH2 groups). Wait, no, perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH2 group. But then, are they identical? Let me imagine: each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So, are the groups on each carbon the same? Let's say the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2? No, that can't be because each double bond carbon can only have two substituents. Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's easier to think about whether dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the molecule is asymmetrical, it might have a chiral center. Wait, but dimethyl fumarate has a central double bond with two COOCH3 groups on each end, but in the trans configuration. Wait, no, the (E) isomer has the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, no, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So in dimethyl fumarate, the molecule is symmetrical, so it can't have optical isomerism. Wait, but wait— no, wait, I think I'm wrong. Because fumarate's structure is (E), which makes the molecule asymmetrical. Wait, no, (E) doesn't necessarily mean asymmetrical. Oh, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, but perhaps it has a different form of stereoisomerism, like geometric isomerism. But optical isomerism specifically refers to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. So if the molecule is symmetrical, it can't have enantiomers. So if dimethyl fumarate is symmetrical, then it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think again. Another approach: which of these compounds have a chiral center or another form of stereogenicity.

1. Biphenyl compound: Maybe, because of the substituents on each ring, creating a situation where the mirror image isn't superimposable. So, yes, it can have optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Earlier I thought no chiral center, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me re-examine. Structure: if it's CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Then, the central CH2 can't have four different groups. But wait, perhaps the structure is different. Wait, if the hydroxyl is on the same carbon as the ester group, then that carbon would have four different groups. For example, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the middle carbon (CH) would have:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2? Wait, no, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, in that case, the middle carbon (number 2) would be attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and a CH2 group from the adjacent carbon? No, that can't be right because each carbon is connected to four bonds. Let me count: for carbon 2, in CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3 connected to carbon 2.

Carbon 2: connected to carbon 1 (CH3), carbon 3 (COOCH3), OH, and another CH group? No, wait, carbon 2 is CH, connected to:

- Carbon 1: CH3,
- Carbon 3: COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH from where? Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So, the hydroxyl is on the middle carbon, which is CH2. Then, the central carbon is CH2, which can't be a chiral center. So no optical isomerism here.

3. Benzophenone: no chiral centers, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: If the structure is symmetric, no optical isomerism. Otherwise, maybe. Let me think: If the molecule is (E), is it symmetric? The (E) configuration would have the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think again. No, because the structure is symmetrical. So, no.

So, which of the four compounds have optical isomerism?

1. Yes.

2. No.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake with number 4. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E), which has the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides. So the molecule is not symmetrical; wait, no, because each end is the same. Wait, no, in the (E) configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides, but the molecule itself is symmetrical with a plane of symmetry along the double bond. So, the (E) isomer is symmetrical, so it's not chiral. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. If a molecule has a double bond with substituents that are identical on each carbon, but arranged in a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical, could that create a chiral center? No, because the double bond doesn't create a chiral center unless there's a tetrahedral geometry with four different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, looking back at the four compounds:

1: Yes.

2: No.

3: No.

4: No.

Wait, but none of the options match that. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, but according to this, only 1 would have optical isomerism. But looking at the options, no option has only 1. Wait, that can't be right because the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the first compound. Let me re-examine.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So, it's a biphenyl with substituents at 6 and 6' (nitro groups) and 2 and 2' (carboxylate groups). The biphenyl has a single bond between the two benzene rings, allowing for rotation. But if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule chiral, then it can have optical isomerism.

Biphenyls can exhibit what's called "dihedral isomerism" when the substituents are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical and prevent free rotation. So, for example, if the substituents on each ring are such that the molecule can't be rotated to match its mirror image, then it's chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2' and 6 and 6'. Let me visualize the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at the 6 position and a carboxylate group at the 2 position. Wait, but benzene rings are numbered such that the points are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 in order. So if the biphenyl is 1,1', meaning the two benzene rings are connected at the 1 position of each. Then, substituents at 2 and 6 would be on adjacent positions. So the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. So on each benzene, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are opposite each other (since in a benzene ring, 1 is connected to 2 and 6; 2 is opposite 5, 3 opposite 6, etc.) Wait, no, I think I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 are arranged clockwise. So position 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Position 6 is adjacent to 1 and 5. So substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring would be on adjacent positions. So, the two rings are connected at position 1, and on each ring, at positions 2 and 6 are substituents (nitro and carboxylate). Now, would this arrangement create a chiral molecule?

In biphenyls, when the substituents on each ring are in such positions that the molecule can't rotate to match its mirror image, then it's chiral. For instance, if the substituents are at positions that are not symmetrical around the central bond, then the molecule can have stereoisomerism.

In this case, each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, on each ring, the substituents are at positions that are adjacent to the point of connection (position 1). So the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So, considering the entire molecule, would this arrangement lead to a chiral center? Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically across the central bond, then the molecule would be achiral. But if they are arranged asymmetrically, it would be chiral.

In this case, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6, which are meta to each other on each ring. So, on each ring, substituents are at meta positions. But when the two rings are connected, the overall arrangement might be such that the substituents are not symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps the substituents on each ring are arranged in such a way that the molecule isn't symmetrical. So, for example, each ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate group, but their positions relative to the other ring create a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But I'm not sure. It depends on the exact arrangement.

Wait, another approach: if the substituents are such that the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. But if not, then it's chiral.

In this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Let's imagine the molecule: each ring has at position 2 a carboxylate and at position 6 a nitro group. So, considering the biphenyl structure, the arrangement might be such that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral. So, the first compound would exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, looking back at the four compounds, which ones have optical isomerism:

1: Yes.

2: Earlier thought it doesn't, but perhaps I was wrong. Let me think again.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. The central carbon is CH2, which can't have a chiral center. So no optical isomerism.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the hydroxyl and ester are on the same carbon, making it a chiral center. Let me imagine the structure again. If the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the middle carbon (CH) would have:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group (from the adjacent carbon)? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, which doesn't have a chiral center.

So, no optical isomerism in compound 2.

So, only compound 1 has optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them list only 1. The options are:

A) 1,2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Hmm, this is confusing. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let me think again about compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

Fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of maleate. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
O=C-OCH3
   |
   CH2-CH2
   ||
Wait, no, that's not right. Another way: the structure is CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group. Wait, no, because fumarate is the ester of fumaric acid, which is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified, it becomes CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. So each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 on both ends of the double bond. So the molecule is O=C-OCH3-CH2-CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to each end of the double bond. So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)2. No, that can't be, because each double bond carbon can only have two substituents. So, each double bond carbon is connected to one COOCH3 group and another group. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH(COOCH3)2, but that's not possible. Alternatively, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group, making the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. Now, in this case, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH3 group. So, each carbon is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and CH3?), but I'm not sure.

Wait, in any case, does this structure have a chiral center? No, because each double bond carbon isn't a chiral center. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck because according to my analysis, only compound 1 has optical isomerism, but the options don't include that. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2. Let me think again. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Structure: the ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure should be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the middle carbon (CH) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group (from the adjacent carbon). Wait, no, each carbon is connected to four groups. So, the middle carbon is attached to:

   - CH3,
   - COOCH3,
   - OH,
   - and another CH2? No, wait, let me count the groups attached to the middle carbon. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon (C2) is attached to:

   - C1: CH3,
   - C3: COOCH3,
   - OH,
   - and another CH group from the adjacent. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of substituents. The middle carbon is attached to:

   - two CH groups (from C1 and C3),
   - an OH,
   - and a COOCH3 group.

Wait, that can't be, because each carbon can only have four bonds. So if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the middle carbon is attached to CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another CH2? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the middle carbon has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

Let me think: the middle carbon has a CH3 group, a COOCH3 group, an OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, that wouldn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps it has CH3, COOCH3, OH, and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2. But that can't have four different substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH, connected to:

   - CH3,
   - COOCH3,
   - OH,
   - and another CH group from the adjacent carbon. No, that can't be because that would make it CH2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH, attached to:

   - CH3,
   - COOCH3,
   - OH,
   - and another CH2 group? No, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the middle carbon is attached to:

   - CH3,
   - COOCH3,
   - OH,
   - and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would give four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H. So that would make the middle carbon a chiral center. Oh! So if that's the case, the compound has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism.

Ah, I see where I went wrong earlier. I thought the middle carbon was CH2, but if it's actually CH with four different groups, then it's a chiral center. So compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, correcting my earlier analysis:

1: Yes.

2: Yes.

3: No.

4: No.

So, which compounds have optical isomerism? 1 and 2.

Looking at the options, option D is 1 and 2.

So the correct answer should be option D.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center or another form of stereogenicity.

### 1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
This compound consists of a biphenyl structure with nitro groups at the 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate groups at the 2 and 2' positions. Biphenyl compounds can exhibit optical isomerism if the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, preventing the molecule from being superimposed on its mirror image. In this case, the substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring create an asymmetrical arrangement, making the molecule chiral.  
**Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### 2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The middle carbon (C2) is attached to four different groups: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, allowing the molecule to exist as non-superimposable mirror images.  
**Conclusion:** This compound exhibits optical isomerism.

### 3. **Benzophenone**  
Benzophenone is a symmetrical molecule with two identical benzene rings connected by a carbonyl group. Since there are no chiral centers or other stereogenic elements, the molecule is not chiral and does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
**Conclusion:** This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### 4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
Dimethyl fumarate is the (E)-isomer of dihydroxydibasic acid, with the structure CH2=CH(COOCH3)2. The molecule is symmetrical due to the trans configuration of the double bond and identical substituents on each carbon. Symmetry prevents the molecule from being chiral, and thus it does not exhibit optical isomerism.  
**Conclusion:** This compound does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Final Answer  
The compounds that exhibit optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.  
**Answer: D**
