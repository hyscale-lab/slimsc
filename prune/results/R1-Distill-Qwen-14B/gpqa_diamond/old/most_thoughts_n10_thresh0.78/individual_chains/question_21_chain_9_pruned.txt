Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice chemistry question in front of me. Let me read it carefully and try to figure it out. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and also about tautomerism and optical isomerism.

The question is divided into two parts, A and B. Part A is asking which compound among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does not show tautomerism. Part B is asking which of the two given compounds between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate will show optical isomerism.

I need to determine the correct options for both A and B and then match them with the options provided, which are A, B, C, D.

Let's start with part A.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism?

Tautomerism is the phenomenon where a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two adjacent atoms, leading to the formation of a different structure. These are usually found in compounds with conjugated systems that allow such shifts, like in ketones and their enol forms or in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups.

First, let's look at the two compounds given for part A.

1. Benzoquinone: I think benzoquinone is a cyclic compound. Wait, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound with two ketone groups. Specifically, it can be either para-benzoquinone or ortho. Oh wait, no, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone (O) groups. So, the structure would be O=C6H4=O, in para positions.

2. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, it's like three ketone groups equally spaced around the ring. So the structure is (O)C6H3(O)C(O). Wait,
