Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure out the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field. Hmm, let me think. The vector field f(r) has a magnitude of 1/r² and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. So, the field is radial and its magnitude decreases with the square of the distance from the origin.

Wait, the question is asking about the integral of the divergence of this field over a sphere of radius R. Oh right, the divergence theorem might come into play here. Because the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So, the integral over the volume is equal to the flux through the surface.

But wait, what's the divergence of this field in the first place? Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. For a vector field that only has a radial component, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² A_r), where A_r is the radial component. In this case, A_r is 1/r².

So, substituting that in, the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)]. Let me compute that. The expression inside the derivative is r² * (1/r²) = 1. So, the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, the divergence ∇.f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin?

Wait, wait. Because if r is zero, the field is undefined. So, the divergence is zero except possibly at r=0. But in that case, when calculating the integral over a
