Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to find the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu, and the pion is stationary. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Hmm, right, the neutrino is also a product, but I remember neutrinos have very little mass, almost negligible. So I guess we can treat it as massless for this calculation.

Wait, wait, so the pion is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal and opposite. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since the pion is at rest, the total energy is just its rest energy.

So the initial energy is the rest mass of the pion: E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV. But wait, since the pion is at rest, its kinetic energy is zero, so all the energy comes from its rest mass.

Now, when it decays into the muon and neutrino, the total energy must be conserved. So E_initial = E_mu + E_nu. And momentum must be conserved as well, so the momenta must cancel each other.

Let me think about the energy of each product. The muon's energy will be its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. And E_nu = K_nu.

So the energy conservation equation is: m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.

But momentum is conserved. So the magnitude of the muon's momentum equals that of the neutrino's. Let's denote p as the magnitude. Then, for the muon, E_mu² = (p c)² + (m_mu c²)². Similarly, the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p c, since m_nu is zero.

So let's write down the equations:

1. m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu.
2. E_mu² = (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2.
3. E_nu = p c.

Hmm, but substituting E_nu into equation 1, I get:

m_pi c² = m_mu c² + K_mu + (p c).

But from equation 2, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ), which is m_mu c² + K_mu. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu.

Wait, but equation 1 is m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu. So substituting
