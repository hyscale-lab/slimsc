Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with buffer solutions and all the phosphate ion stuff. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says there's a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution at 25°C. The given Ka values for H3PO4 are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-, right? And the solution here has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, so I think this is a buffer solution. Buffer solutions are usually made with a weak acid and its conjugate base. But wait, phosphate has multiple dissociation steps, so I need to figure out which species are present.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(H2PO4), which I think dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- in solution. H2PO4^- can act as an acid, donating a proton to become HPO4^2- or accepting a proton to become H3PO4. But in this case, since the solution also contains Na2HPO4·2H2O, which is sodium phosphate dihydrate. Na2HPO4 would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

Wait, so the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That makes sense because they can form a buffer. So the buffer is between H2PO4^- (the acid) and HPO4^2- (the conjugate base). The pKa for this system would be the second one, Ka2, because H2PO4^- loses a proton to become HPO4^2-.

Right, because the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1), the second is H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2), and the third is HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3). But since we're dealing with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the relevant Ka is Ka2.

So the buffer equation would be using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. I think the equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). But wait, the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form of HPO4^2-. So maybe I need to consider the third dissociation as well? Or is the concentration of PO4^3- negligible compared to HPO4^2-?

Well, looking at the Ka3 value, it's 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than Ka2 (6.2e-8). So HPO4^2- is a much weaker acid than H2PO4^-. That means that in a solution with HPO4^2-, most of it won't dissociate into PO4^3- because it's a weak acid. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be very low compared to HPO4^2- and H2PO4^-.

Wait, but the problem is asking for orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So I need to find the concentration of that. Hmm, but how?

Wait, maybe I should think about the system. The solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So when they dissolve, the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But
