Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's reacting with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to get product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to give the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but I'll break it down. I think I need to figure out the structure at each step to determine the final product.

First, looking at the initial reagents. The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene is a norbornene structure. So, the 7 position would be one of the bridgeheads, I think. The substituent there is a tert-butoxy group, O-t-Bu. So, the starting molecule is a norbornene derivative with a bulky oxygen substituent.

Next, the reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile source, and in such conditions, I'm thinking elimination or substitution is happening. The diene has two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So, cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two substituents on adjacent carbons.

Wait, when you have vicinal dibromides (like Br-CH2-CH2-Br), in the presence of a nucleophile like iodide, it might undergo a substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 1,2-dibromide undergoing elimination? Or maybe it's a ring-opening reaction.

Wait, actually, the starting structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexadiene has two methyl groups, each bearing two bromines, at positions 5 and 6. So, the structure would be something like CH2Br2 at C5 and C6 of the cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two CH2Br2 substituents on adjacent carbons (C5 and C6).

When this reacts with sodium iodide, which is a source of I- ions, perhaps a substitution reaction occurs. Wait, but I- is a better nucleophile than Br-? Hmm, but in SN2 reactions, iodide is a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing elimination. Or maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, but the initial molecule is a diene. So maybe it's undergoing some cycloaddition or conjugate addition. Alternatively, the presence of the diene and another diene in the starting material (the norbornene) might be leading to a Diels-Alder reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the starting bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene (norbornene) has a strained double bond, which can act as a dienophile. So, perhaps the norbornene is reacting with the other diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the other molecule is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the dienophile would be the norbornene, and the diene would be the cyclohexadiene.

Alternatively, the other molecule could be the diene for a Diels-Alder reaction. Wait, but the norbornene is a dienophile, so the diene here is the cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but the cyclohexadiene has substituents on C5 and C6. So, if the norbornene is the dienophile, perhaps each equivalent would add across each of the substituents. But the starting material is using two equivalents, so perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions happen.

Wait, but the norbornene only has one double bond, so maybe each molecule of norbornene can react with two equivalents of the diene? Or perhaps each equivalent of diene reacts with one equivalent of norbornene.

Alternatively, maybe the norbornene is not the dienophile. Another possibility is that the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile in some other way.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again. The starting material is a norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene) with a tert-butoxy group. So, it's a diene (the norbornene has two double bonds?), wait no, norbornene has one double bond. Wait, the structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, so two double bonds? Or is it a monoene? Wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene would have two double bonds? Or is it a diene with two double bonds?

Wait, no, norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, which has one double bond. So, the starting material is a norbornene with a double bond at position 2, and a substituent (tert-butoxy) at position 7.

So, perhaps the norbornene is the dienophile, and reacts with the cyclohexadiene. So, Diels-Alder reaction: the cyclohexadiene would be the diene, the norbornene is the dienophile.

But wait, the diene in Diels-Alder is conjugated, which the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is. So, the diene is 1,3-diene (positions 1 and 3), and the substituents are on 5 and 6, which would be the endo positions perhaps.

So, when the Diels-Alder reaction occurs, the diene (cyclohexadiene) attacks the dienophile (norbornene) in a [4+2] cycloaddition. Each equivalent of the diene would add to the dienophile.

But wait, the starting material uses two equivalents of the diene. So, perhaps each norbornene molecule reacts with two diene molecules, or is it each diene reacts with one norbornene?

Wait, norbornene has only one double bond, so each norbornene molecule can undergo one Diels-Alder reaction. So, if there are two equivalents of the diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur, but that would require two dienophiles. Hmm, maybe it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, the diene could be undergoing some elimination or substitution with the norbornene.

Wait, the diene has two CH2Br2 groups. So, perhaps each of those groups can undergo a substitution reaction with a nucleophile. The starting material is combined with NaI, which provides iodide ions.

Wait, substitution reaction: CH2Br2 is a primary bromide. So, perhaps SN2 substitution, where iodide replaces bromide. But since there are two Br atoms on each CH2, maybe two substitutions happen for each CH2Br2 group, turning them into CH2I2.

But wait, that might not make sense because CH2Br2 is a symmetrical molecule. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2Br2 group is undergoing a substitution with iodide, replacing one Br with I. But that would give CH2BrI, but that's not a very stable structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling reaction, like a Grignard or similar, but I don't think that's the case here because NaI is present, not a metal.

Wait, another possibility: the presence of NaI and heat could lead to an elimination reaction. For example, the vicinal dibromide (CH2Br2) could eliminate HBr and form a double bond. But wait, the starting molecule is already a diene, so adding more double bonds?

Wait, but wait, the diene is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, the positions 5 and 6 each have a CH2Br2 group. So, each CH2Br2 is adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. For example, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene ring could be undergoing an addition with the norbornene. Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing some kind of coupling with the norbornene.

Wait, perhaps the norbornene is acting as an electron-deficient dienophile, and the cyclohexadiene is the diene in a Diels-Alder reaction.

So, the Diels-Alder reaction would form a bicyclic structure. Each equivalent of the diene would react with one equivalent of the dienophile (norbornene).

Since the starting material uses two equivalents of the diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions happen per norbornene molecule. But norbornene only has one double bond, so it can only undergo one Diels-Alder reaction. So maybe two dienophiles are used? Wait, no, the starting material is the norbornene derivative, so each of its molecules would react with the diene.

Wait, perhaps each norbornene molecule reacts with two equivalents of diene. But that seems unlikely; each Diels-Alder reaction would use one diene per dienophile.

Alternatively, perhaps each diene molecule reacts with two equivalents of norbornene. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the diene is reacting in a different way. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The reaction is at elevated temperature with NaI. So, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are undergoing substitution with iodide, but with two equivalents, perhaps each CH2Br2 is replaced by CH2I.

Wait, but in that case, each diene would have two CH2I groups. So, 5,6-bis(CH2I) cyclohexa-1,3-diene.

But I'm not sure how that would lead to product 1. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is part of a coupling reaction. Wait, maybe it's a SN2 displacement where the iodide attacks the CH2Br2, but since there are two Br's, each CH2Br2 would lose two Br's and gain two I's, making CH2I2. But CH2I2 is a thing, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing some kind of elimination. But wait, if the diene has CH2Br2 groups, maybe when heated with a base, it could eliminate HBr, but then that would form a new double bond. But the diene already has two double bonds (positions 1,3). Wait, no, the starting diene is cyclohexa-1,3-diene; positions 5 and 6 have substituents. So, perhaps the substituents are adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. Norbornene is a strained molecule, so under certain conditions, it can open. But with a diene and NaI, maybe it's undergoing some addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene is undergoing a pinacol-type coupling. Wait, I'm not sure.

This part is a bit confusing. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe the product after the first reaction has the norbornene reacting with the diene via an addition, perhaps via a conjugate addition.

Wait, another thought: the diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) has two substituents (CH2Br2) on adjacent carbons (5 and 6). So, the structure is:

CH2Br2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br? No, wait, no, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a six-membered ring with double bonds at 1,2 and 3,4 positions. Wait, no, 1,3-diene would have double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4? No, wait, 1,3-diene in a six-membered ring would actually be 1-2 double bond and 3-4 double bond, which would be conjugated. So, the structure would be a cyclohexene with two double bonds, positions 1-2 and 3-4. The substituents are at positions 5 and 6, which are adjacent (since in a six-membered ring, positions 5 and 6 are next to each other, as 5 is next to 6 and 4, and 6 is next to 5 and 1).

So, positions 5 and 6 each have CH2Br2 groups.

So, when this reacts with norbornene and NaI, perhaps the bromides are being replaced by iodides, but that might not directly connect the two molecules.

Wait, another possibility: the norbornene is acting as a base, deprotonating the diene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the diene's CH2Br2 groups is undergoing a substitution with the norbornene's oxygen group. Wait, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. The tert-butoxy group is a good leaving group? Or maybe the oxygen is a nucleophile.

Alternatively, perhaps the norbornene's oxygen is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the CH2Br2 group. So, an SN2 substitution where the oxygen (from the norbornene) replaces Br in the CH2Br2.

But that would require the tert-butoxy group to have a good leaving group, but it's an ether, so O-t-Bu is not a good leaving group. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, but in the presence of a base, maybe the tert-butoxy group can leave as t-BuO- (but that's a poor leaving group). Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution where iodide is the nucleophile attacking the CH2Br2.

Wait, let's think: CH2Br2 is a vicinal dibromide. In the presence of NaI, maybe it undergoes a substitution where each Br is replaced by I. But that would lead to CH2I2, which is a possibility.

But then, how does that connect to the norbornene? Maybe the diene becomes a diiodomethyl compound. But I'm not sure how that would lead to product 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing a coupling reaction. The presence of NaI and heat might facilitate some kind of elimination, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing a ring-opening via a conjugate addition. The norbornene's double bond could add to the diene.

Wait, but norbornene is more likely a dienophile. So, the diene (cyclohexa-1,3-diene) would attack the norbornene in a Diels-Alder reaction.

Each equivalent of diene would add to an equivalent of dienophile. So, since there are two equivalents of diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur per norbornene molecule. But norbornene only has one double bond, so each norbornene molecule would react once, but with two dienes? Or perhaps the diene has two sites for addition.

Wait, maybe each diene can react with two dienophiles, but that seems unusual.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is acting as a dienophile, but I don't think so because it's a conjugated diene.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another angle. Let's think about the next steps. After product 1 is formed, it's treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated to give product 4.

The final question is about the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Perhaps the reactions are leading to the formation of a more complex structure, maybe a tricyclic or polycyclic compound, which upon treatment, loses certain functional groups, leading to a structure with symmetry.

Wait, let's think about the possible reactions. After Diels-Alder, product 1 would be a bicyclic structure with substituents. Then, treatment with H2SO4 (aqueous) might protonate certain groups or cause ring-opening via acid-catalyzed reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder adduct is then acid-catalyzed to form a bridge or a ring.

Then, treating with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO. That sounds like a sulfonation reaction. SO3 is used for sulfonation, typically under certain conditions. Pyridine is often a base, and DMSO is a polar aprotic solvent. So, maybe product 2 is being sulfonated to form a sulfonic acid group, which would require removing a leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sulfonation of a phenol or aromatic ring.

Wait, but after the Diels-Alder reaction, the product would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps with oxygen substituents. Then, treatment with H2SO4 could protonate an ether, leading to a better leaving group. But that might lead to ring-opening.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder forms an adduct with an ester or another group that can be modified in subsequent steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility that the initial reaction is a coupling of the norbornene with the diene in a way that forms a new ring. For example, each diene molecule could add to the norbornene, leading to a bridged structure.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a [2+4] cycloaddition, forming a six-membered ring fused to the norbornene.

But I'm not entirely clear on product 1. Maybe I should move forward and see what the subsequent steps might entail.

After product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid (H2SO4), it becomes product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, heating product 3 gives product 4.

If product 2 is a diol or some oxygen-containing compound, then treatment with SO3 could sulfonate it. Alternatively, if product 2 has an alcohol group, then treating with SO3 would form a sulfate ester or a sulfonic acid.

Wait, SO3 in DMSO with pyridine is often used in the sulfonation of aromatic rings. For example, in the presence of a directing group, SO3H (from SO3) can add as a sulfonic acid group. So, perhaps product 2 has a benzene ring that gets sulfonated in product 3.

Alternatively, if product 2 is an alcohol, perhaps it is converted to a tosylate or a sulfate.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me try to imagine the structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder reaction forms a bridge structure, and then acid treatment opens a ring, leading to a diol or something similar.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction forms a bridge, like adding the diene across the norbornene's double bond. Then, upon acid treatment, a ring opens, leading to a diol.

But I'm not seeing the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial Diels-Alder forms a bicyclo compound with two substituents (from the diene's CH2Br2 groups). Then, treatment with H2SO4 might protonate the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, elimination could occur, forming a new double bond or ring structure.

Wait, thinking about the second step: product 1 is treated with aqueous H2SO4 to get product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to get product 3.

If product 2 has an alcohol group, then treating with SO3 would sulfonate it. For example, if product 2 is a diol, treating with SO3 could form a disulfonic acid. Then, heating would perhaps eliminate the sulfonic acid group, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe product 2 is a dihydroxy compound, which upon sulfonation becomes a sulfonated diol. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to think about the overall process. Each step is building up or modifying the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction is a ring-opening of the norbornene. The norbornene has a double bond that could open under certain conditions. For example, in the presence of a diene, perhaps a [3+2] cycloaddition occurs, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a tandem process. The norbornene, with its substituent, is reacting with the diene in a way that forms a new ring, perhaps through a conjugate addition or similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene's CH2Br2 groups are undergoing substitution, and then the norbornene is adding across the resulting double bond.

Wait, here's another approach: let's think about the possible products at each step.

1. Initial reaction: norbornene + 2 equivalents of diene â product 1. Maybe product 1 is a norbornene derivative with two new substituents from the diene. Perhaps each diene adds a group to the norbornene.

Wait, but norbornene is a bicyclic structure. If two dienes add across it, perhaps they form a larger ring.

Alternatively, maybe the diene is adding across the norbornene's bridge, leading to a ring expansion.

Wait, perhaps each diene adds across the norbornene's double bond, leading to a new bridge.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should focus on the fact that the diene has two substituents, each with two bromines. So, each diene molecule has two CH2Br2 groups.

When treated with NaI, perhaps each of those CH2Br2 groups undergoes substitution to become CH2I2. But how would that connect to the norbornene?

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution is a coupling reaction, where the iodide forms a bridge between the norbornene and the diene.

Wait, maybe the diene's CH2Br2 groups are undergoing a substitution to form CH2I, and then those iodides are attaching to the norbornene's structure.

But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is undergoing a ring-opening via an elimination, forming a longer chain, which then reacts with the norbornene. But I'm not certain.

This is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for another approach, such as considering the possible symmetry of the final product, which affects the number of chemically distinct hydrogens.

The options are 4, 7, 8, or 10. These numbers suggest a molecule with several equivalent protons, perhaps due to symmetry.

If the final product is a highly symmetrical molecule, like a cubane or similar, the number of distinct hydrogens might be low. Alternatively, if it's a norbornene derivative with substituents in symmetric positions, the number could be lower.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting norbornene is undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction with the diene, leading to a new bicyclic structure. Then, the subsequent steps modify this structure, perhaps adding functional groups or rings.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me try to think about the options. The answer choices are 4,7,8,10. So, which of these is a common number for a highly symmetrical molecule?

For example, adamantane has several equivalent protons. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the final product might have a structure with multiple equivalent environments, leading to a lower number of distinct hydrogens.

Wait, another angle: the final step is heating at 150Â°C. That suggests some kind of elimination or rearrangement. Perhaps the sulfonate group is eliminated, leading to a double bond or ring formation.

Wait, if product 3 is a sulfonated compound, heating may cause it to lose the sulfonic acid group, forming a double bond or ring. For example, if product 3 is a sulfonated diol, heating could eliminate water and form an alkene.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is in a position where upon heating, it eliminates to form a new ring.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. Let me think about each step's possible outcomes.

1. Reaction of norbornene with diene and NaI: likely a Diels-Alder reaction, forming a bridged bicyclic structure. Each diene adds to the norbornene's double bond, but with two dienes per norbornene, perhaps forming a more complex structure.

Wait, no, each Diels-Alder uses one diene and one dienophile. So, perhaps each norbornene reacts with two dienes, but I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene has two sites for Diels-Alder reaction. For example, each diene could act as a diene in two separate Diels-Alder reactions with two dienophiles, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, where the diene's substituents (CH2Br2) are replaced by the norbornene's structure.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible number of hydrogen atoms.

If the final product is a highly symmetric structure, like a cube or a symmetrical polycyclic compound, it would have fewer distinct hydrogen atoms.

For instance, if the molecule has several equivalent positions, the number of distinct hydrogens would drop.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is cubane, which has all hydrogens equivalent, but that's just one possibility.

Wait, cubane has eight hydrogens, all equivalent. So, that would give a count of 1, but that's not an option here.

Alternatively, the molecule might have multiple planes or centers of symmetry.

Another possibility is that the final product is a tricyclic compound with several equivalent protons.

But I'm not sure. Let me try to think about each step again.

Step 1: Diels-Alder reaction between norbornene and diene.

Step 2: Acid treatment, perhaps ring-opening or functional group transformation.

Step 3: Sulfonation with SO3, possibly adding a sulfonic acid group.

Step 4: Heating, which could eliminate or rearrange.

If the final product is a norbornene derivative with a sulfonic acid group and some substituents in symmetric positions, the number of distinct hydrogens could be lower.

Alternatively, perhaps the final structure is a fully symmetrical molecule, like adamantane derivatives, which have multiple equivalent hydrogens.

Wait, adamantane has 12 hydrogens, but with symmetry, they might have fewer distinct environments. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a norbornane (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) derivative with substituents in symmetric positions.

If the norbornane has substituents at equivalent positions, the number of distinct hydrogens would be limited.

But I'm not exactly sure. Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: Diels-Alder forms a six-membered ring fused to the norbornene. So, the resulting structure would have a bicyclo system plus a new ring from the diels-alder addition.

But with two equivalents of diene, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions happen, leading to a more complex structure.

After that, step 2: treatment with H2SO4. Maybe this leads to ring-opening, forming an alcohol or another functional group.

Step 3: sulfonation. Perhaps introduces a sulfonic acid group which could be in a position that upon heating, it is eliminated.

Step 4: heating at 150C, perhaps eliminating the sulfonic acid group and forming a new double bond or ring.

Wait, if the sulfonic acid group is eliminated as SO2 and water, perhaps the structure forms a new double bond or a new ring, leading to a more fused system.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonate group is in a bridgehead position, and upon elimination, a new bridge is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation, the molecule undergoes some kind of cyclization upon heating, leading to a more fused ring system.

But this is all speculative.

In the end, without knowing the exact structures, it's challenging, but perhaps the final product has several equivalent protons due to symmetry. For example, four equivalent positions, leading to a lower number of distinct hydrogens.

Wait, the options are 4,7,8,10. Which is more likely?

If the final structure is a norbornane derivative with substituents in symmetric positions, maybe the number of distinct hydrogens is 7. Alternatively, if it's a more symmetric structure, maybe 4.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a compound like adamantane, which has 12 hydrogens, but with symmetry, they could be fewer.

Wait, but adamantane has several equivalent hydrogens. The number of distinct hydrogens in adamantane is actually 3: the top, middle, and bottom layer. Wait, no, I think it's more. Let me think: adamantane has a cubic structure, so each corner has a CH group, but they are all equivalent. No, wait, each CH is in a different environment. Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the final product is cubane, which has 8 equivalent hydrogens, but cubane has all hydrogens equivalent, so only 1 distinct type. But that's not among the options. The option A is 8, but that would be 8 equivalent H's, not 8 distinct. So that's not matching.

Wait, the question is about chemically distinct hydrogen atoms, i.e., the number of unique proton environments.

If the product is a highly symmetrical molecule, like a cube, all eight H's would be equivalent, giving 1. But that's not an option. Alternatively, if the structure has multiple planes of symmetry, the number of distinct H's would be low.

Wait, perhaps the final product is a norbornane derivative with several substituents that are symmetrically placed. For example, if there are four equivalent protons, that would give option B)4.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a molecule with 7 distinct hydrogens.

Wait, perhaps the structure after all the reactions is a tricyclic compound with several equivalent positions, leading to 7 distinct H's.

But without the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the first reaction (Diels-Alder) adds two rings, leading to a triphenylene structure or similar, which upon sulfonation and heating forms a structure with certain symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a fully hydrogenated structure, like a norbornane with substituents, leading to a certain number of unique hydrogens.

But I'm stuck. Based on the options, perhaps the answer is D)7. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of distinct hydrogens in the final product is the same as the number of unique positions in a molecule. If the molecule has a certain symmetry, the number drops.

Given that the options are 4,7,8,10, and considering the possible reactions, perhaps the final product is a norbornane derivative with substituents leading to 7 distinct H's.

But I'm not confident. Another possibility is that the final product is a cubane derivative, but that's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is C)10, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, perhaps after the Diels-Alder, the molecule has several rings, and after the subsequent reactions, it becomes a compound with 10 distinct hydrogens. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the final product is a compound like decalin, which has 8 distinct hydrogens, but that's not matching the options.

Hmm. I think I need to make an educated guess. Based on the steps, the most likely number of distinct hydrogens is 7. So, the answer is D)7.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which reacts with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. This is followed by treatment with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2, then with SOâ and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3, and finally heating at 150Â°C to yield the final product 4. The question asks for the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial Reaction (Product 1):**  
   The starting material, 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, likely undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction with the diene, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. The norbornene acts as a dienophile, and the cyclohexadiene acts as a diene. Given the use of two equivalents of the diene, it is possible that two Diels-Alder reactions occur, forming a more complex bicyclic or polycyclic structure.

2. **Treatment with HâSOâ (Product 2):**  
   Acid treatment likely modifies the structure of product 1. This could involve protonation, ring-opening, or functional group transformations, potentially leading to an alcohol or other oxygen-containing intermediate.

3. **Sulfonation with SOâ and Pyridine in DMSO (Product 3):**  
   The treatment with SOâ and pyridine in DMSO suggests sulfonation. If product 2 contains an aromatic ring or alcohol groups, sulfonation could introduce sulfonic acid groups, modifying the structure further.

4. **Heating at 150Â°C (Product 4):**  
   Heating product 3 likely leads to elimination or rearrangement, potentially forming a new double bond or ring system. This step could simplify the structure or create additional symmetry.

5. **Symmetry and Distinct Hydrogens:**  
   The final product's symmetry plays a critical role in determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms. A highly symmetrical structure would reduce the number of unique proton environments. Based on the options provided (4, 7, 8, 10), the most plausible number of distinct hydrogens is **7**, considering the likely formation of a polycyclic structure with some symmetry.
