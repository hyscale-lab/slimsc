Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, it's about the Lagrangian and renormalizability. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that γ matrices are the Dirac matrices, which are dimensionless, right?

Wait, so the problem is asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The options are A to D, each giving a dimension and a yes or no on renormalizability.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I think I should look at the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Since the Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in four spacetime dimensions (because when you integrate it over spacetime, the action is dimensionless), each term in the Lagrangian must also be dimensionless.

So, each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because in 4D spacetime, the integral is ∫ d^4x L, so L must have dimension [Mass]^4, making the whole action dimensionless.

So, let's break down the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each field has a certain mass dimension. I remember that in four dimensions:
- The Dirac field ψ has dimension 3/2. Because for a fermion, each ψ is [Mass]^{3/2}.
- The electromagnetic field F_{μν} (which is the field strength tensor) has dimension 2. Because F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, and A has dimension 1 (since it's a gauge field, like a vector potential). So F would be [∂][A], which is [Mass][Mass]^1 = [Mass]^2.

Wait, let me double-check that. The gauge field A has dimension 1 in four dimensions. Because in the term A·∂ψ, A must have the same dimension as ∂ψ. Since ∂ has dimension 1 (as it's a derivative, so [∂] = [Mass]), and ψ is [Mass]^{3/2}, then (∂ψ) has dimension 3/2 +1 = 5/2. So A·∂ψ must be dimensionless? No, wait, no. The term is in the Lagrangian, which is dimensionless. So the term is like Aμ ∂μ ψ. Aμ has to match so that Aμ times ∂μ ψ has dimension 4. Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently.

Alternatively, the standard way is to recall the dimensions of the fields. For a scalar field, in 4D, it's [φ] = 1. For a vector field (like Aμ), it's [A] = 1. For a spinor (ψ), it's [ψ] = 3/2. For F_{μν} which is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, each term is [∂][A] = [Mass][Mass]^1 = [Mass]^2. So F_{μν} has dimension 2.

Now, the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let me figure out the dimension of each part.

First, ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ. Since σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (gamma matrices are treated as matrices without mass dimension), the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, right? Because σ is just a product of gammas, which are dimensionless.

Wait, no. σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices, but as you said, it's dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ. And ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, same as ψ. So ψ̄ ψ would be 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ has dimension 3.

Then multiply that by F^{μν}, which has dimension 2. So the whole term without κ is (3) + (2) = dimension 5. Because each factor's dimension adds when multiplied. Wait, no, no
