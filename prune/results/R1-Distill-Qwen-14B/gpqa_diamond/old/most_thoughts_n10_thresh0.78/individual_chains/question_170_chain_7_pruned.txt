Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let's see... The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state.

Hmm, the spin state given is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component vector, right? So the state vector is [3i, 4] transposed. I've heard that in quantum mechanics, the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the state vector and the operator matrix.

The operator for S_y is given as sigma_y, which is a 2x2 matrix. Let me recall the Pauli matrices. Oh right, sigma_y is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

But wait, S_y is the spin operator, and in quantum mechanics, the spin operators are (hbar/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. That's important because I need to include that factor.

To find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute the expectation value of the operator S_y in the given state. The formula is <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Wait, the state is a column vector (3i, 4). So the conjugate transpose (bra vector) would be [ -4, -3i ].

So the steps are: first, represent the state and the operator correctly. Then compute the product of the conjugate transpose of the state, the operator, and the state itself.

Let me write this out. The state vector |
