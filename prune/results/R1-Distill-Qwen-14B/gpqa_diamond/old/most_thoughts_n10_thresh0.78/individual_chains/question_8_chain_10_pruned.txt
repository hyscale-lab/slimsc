Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about gene interactions and resistance to a fungal disease in white lupine. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

So, the setup is that we're looking for genes contributing to anthracnose resistance. They found three candidates: G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants for each, and also double mutants. The idea is that at least one of these is a transcription factor upstream of others. 

The experiment involved testing these mutants for resistance. The results are given as the percentage of control resistance. The higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is. The control is 100%, so if a mutant has 75%, it's less resistant.

Looking at the results:

- g1: 75% resistance. So, less than control but still some resistance. Maybe G1 is involved, but it's not the only gene.
- g2: 0% resistance. That's a big drop. So, without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. It seems G2 is crucial.
- g3: 50% resistance. So, without G3, resistance is halved. Maybe G3 works with others?
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% resistance. That's way lower than either g1 or g3 alone. So maybe together they have a more severe effect.
  - g2g3: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. Hmm, interesting.
  - g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 alone. So when both g1 and g2 are knocked out, it's the same as just without g2.

Wait, so what can I infer from this? Let me think about gene interactions. If knocking out two genes leads to the same phenotype as knocking out one, it suggests that the other gene might be downstream or redundant.

So, for the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10%: worse than either alone, but not as bad as 0%. So maybe G1 and G3 function in parallel pathways, and when both are knocked out, the resistance is even lower.

g2g3 is 0%: same as without G2. So when both G2 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is the same as without G2. That suggests that G3 is epistatic to G2, or maybe G3 is downstream of G2. Wait, not sure. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene.

Let me think about epistasis. If a mutation in gene B masks the effect of gene A, then B is epistatic to A. So, in the case of g2g3: since g2 alone is 0%, adding g3 doesn't make it worse. Maybe G3 is downstream of G2. So, without G2, you can't activate G3, so knocking out G3 in the g2 mutant doesn't change anything.

Similarly, in g1g2, which is 0%, same as g2 alone. So without G2, G1's effect is irrelevant. So G2 is epistatic towards G1. Meaning, G2 acts upstream of G1. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. Because when you have a mutation in G2 (g2), G1 isn't expressed, so knocking out G1 doesn't matter because G1 isn't active anyway. So the double mutant g1g2 is the same as g2.

Which suggests that G2 is upstream of G1. So G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1. Because the question said that at least one is a transcription factor upstream of others.

Now looking at the other double mutants.

g1g3 has 10% resistance. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either alone. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, each contributing to resistance. Without both, the resistance plummets.

So, what's the role of each gene?

G2 seems to be the key. Without G2, resistance is nil. So G2 is probably the transcription factor because it's upstream. G1's effect is only when G2 is present. Because in g2, G1 doesn't matter. So G2 is a TF that activates G1.

G3: when G2 is working, G3 provides some level of resistance. But when G2 is not working (g2), G3's status doesn't change the resistance (as in g2g3, same as g2). So G3's function depends on G2 being active. So G3 is downstream of G2.

But wait, when G2 is working (wild type), knocking out G3 reduces resistance from 100% to 50%. That
