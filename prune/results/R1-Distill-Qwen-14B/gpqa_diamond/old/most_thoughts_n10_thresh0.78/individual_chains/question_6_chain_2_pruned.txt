Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions, and the potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I'm supposed to find the energy spectrum, and there are four options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, when dealing with potentials in two dimensions, especially in polar coordinates, it's helpful to separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. But wait, in this case, the potential seems to depend on both r and θ. So I need to see if the potential can be broken down in a way that allows for separation of variables.

Looking at the potential: V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ. I can factor out the kr² term. So, V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Wait, that's the same as kr² [ (1 + 3 cos²θ ) / 2 ].

Hmm, but how does that help me? I'm trying to think about what kind of potential this is. The first term, (1/2) kr², is like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. Because, in radial terms, V(r) = (1/2) kr² is similar to the potential for a quantum harmonic oscillator, which has equally spaced energy levels.

The second term is (3/2) kr² cos²θ. That depends on the angle θ, which complicates things because it introduces angular dependence. But wait, maybe this can be expressed in terms of some effective potential or a perturbation?

Alternatively, perhaps the entire potential can be rewritten in a way that makes the problem separable. Let me think: cos²θ can be expressed using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Substituting that into the potential, V(r,θ) becomes:

(1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ]

Wait, let's compute that. So:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2)*(kr²)(1/2)(1 + cos2θ)
= (1/2) kr² + (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ)
= [ (1/2) + 3/4 ] kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ
= (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ

Hmm, maybe that's not the most helpful approach. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed as a sum of terms that are functions of r and θ separately. Let me see:

V(r,θ) = (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ]

But I'm not sure if that helps with separation. Alternatively, maybe I can write it as V(r) + V'(r,θ), where V(r) is the first term and V'(r,θ) is the second. But I'm not sure if that's useful for solving.

Wait, another thought: in two dimensions, the Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is separable when the potential depends only on r, or when certain angular terms can be factored out. But in this case, the potential depends on θ, so perhaps the angular part can be handled with some kind of perturbation or by introducing angular momentum.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) ) - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (d²ψ/dθ²) ) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ

Hmm, with V(r,θ) as given. Let me see if I can separate variables. Let's assume that the wavefunction ψ(r,θ) can be written as a product of radial and angular parts: ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ).

Substituting into the Schrödinger equation, we get:

[- (ℏ²/(2m)) ( (1/r) d/dr (r dR/dr) ) / R ) - (ℏ²/(2m r²) ) ( Θ'' ) / Θ ) ] + [ (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ ] = E.

Wait, but I rearranged terms. Let me see if I can group the terms by their dependence on r and θ.

Wait, the equation would look like:

[ - (ℏ²/(2m r)) (d/dr)(r dR/dr) + (1/2) kr² R ] / R + 
[ - (ℏ²/(2m r²)) (Θ'' ) + (3/2) kr² cos²θ Θ ] / Θ = E.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to separate neatly because the cos²θ term is multiplied by Θ and kr² R. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the separation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the potential as a sum of terms that can be expressed in terms of angular momentum operators. Let me think: the cosθ term can be related to the angular momentum operator, which involves L_z = -iℏ (d/dθ). But wait, cosθ is part of the potential, so maybe the angular part can be diagonalized in terms of L_z eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be rewritten in terms of L², which is related to the angular momentum. Wait, what's L²? L² = ℏ² (d²/dθ² + cotθ d/dθ ). But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the potential as being a sum of terms. Let me write V(r,θ) = V1(r) + V2(r,θ), where V1(r) = (1/2) kr², and V2(r,θ) = (3/2) kr² cos²θ.

So, V2(r,θ) = (3/2) kr² cos²θ = (3/2) kr² ( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) = (3/4) kr² (1 + cos2θ).

Hmm, so V2 can be written as (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, that's interesting because now the potential is a sum of terms
