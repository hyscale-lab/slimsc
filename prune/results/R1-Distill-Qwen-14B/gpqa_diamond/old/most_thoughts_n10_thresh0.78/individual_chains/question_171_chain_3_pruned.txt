Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The problem involves six substances, each undergoing an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. Only one monobromo derivative is formed for each. The task is to arrange these substances in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer's yield.

Hmm, okay. Electrophilic substitution reactions on aromatic compounds typically involve the attack of an electrophile (in this case, bromine) on the aromatic ring. The position where the substitution occurs depends on the directing groups present on the ring. 

Each of the six compounds has a substituent attached to the benzene ring. Let's list them:

1) C6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The substituent is a methyl group.
2) C6H5-COOC2H5: This looks like phenyl acetate. The substituent is an ester group (OOCR).
3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorobenzene. The substituent is chlorine.
4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. Substituent is nitro group.
5) C6H5-C2H5: Ethylbenzene. Substituent is ethyl group.
6) C6H5-COOH: Benzoic acid. Substituent is carboxylic acid group.

Now, I need to determine the activating or deactivating nature of each substituent and their directing effects. That will tell me the major product(s) when bromine is added in excess.

Let me recall:

- Activating groups (electron-donating) direct incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. They increase the rate of substitution reactions.
- Deactivating groups (electron-withdrawing) direct the electrophiles to the meta positions. They slow down the reaction.

Additionally, some substituents are strong directors. For example, nitro groups are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Halogens are slightly deactivating (due to inductive effect) but ortho/para-directing because of their resonance effects.

Let's go through each substituent:

1) Methyl group (CH3): It's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine is added, the major products would be ortho and para bromotoluene. But wait, the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. That's a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps in some cases, one position is favored over others? Or maybe the reaction conditions lead to a single product. Hmm, but for toluene, I know that under certain conditions, para is the major product, but I'm not entirely sure how the position is determined. Wait, no, actually, the methyl group is an activating group, so the substitution can occur at ortho, meta, or para. Wait, no, wait. No, methyl is ortho/para directing. So substitution occurs more at ortho and para positions than meta. But if the reaction favors only one isomer, that would be the case when the substituent is strongly activating. Wait, but in reality, toluene would typically form a mixture of ortho and para bromo derivatives, with para being major because of less steric hindrance. But the question says only one monobromo is formed. Hmm, maybe for each substance, the substituent directs the bromine to a specific position, perhaps due to steric factors or reaction conditions (like excess Br2 leading to complete substitution at a single position? Not sure. I'll proceed under the assumption that each substituent directs the bromine to certain positions, and the question is about the para-isomer's yield.

Wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, so each substituent directs the bromine to only one position? Or perhaps the reaction is such that only one position is possible? That seems unlikely. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents
