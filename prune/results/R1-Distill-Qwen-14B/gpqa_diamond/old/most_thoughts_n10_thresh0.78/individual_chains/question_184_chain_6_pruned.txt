Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I'll try to visualize the structure. So, benzene ring with three substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, actually, let me think. In benzene, the numbering starts with the substituents in the order of priority. Wait, what's the priority order for substituents? Oh right, the order is: nitro (NO2) has higher priority than ethoxy (OCH2CH3), which in turn is higher than tert-butyl (a bulky alkyl group). But wait, no, I think functional groups like nitro are higher than ether groups. So nitro is first, then ethoxy, then the alkyl.

Wait, but the positions are given as 1, 2, 3. Let me sketch the benzene ring. Let's number the positions. Position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3. But I'm a bit confused about the numbering. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the substituents in the order of their functional groups' priority when determining their positions.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the synthesis steps. We need to introduce these substituents in the correct order because each step affects where the next substituent will attach.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro). So positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent in a way. Let me imagine the benzene ring: if I have substitu
