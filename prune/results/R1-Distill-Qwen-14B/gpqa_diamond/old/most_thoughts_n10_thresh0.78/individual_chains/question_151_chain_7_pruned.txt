Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but I remember that quantum states are supposed to be normalized, right? So the vector should have a length squared equal to 1. Let me check that. The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the square of the magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so it's not normalized. That might complicate things. But wait, maybe I need to normalize it before proceeding. Or perhaps the problem assumes it's already normalized, but I think I should normalize it because in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by unit vectors.

Wait, but the problem is about measuring an observable. The observable is given by the matrix P. Let me write down P. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). The second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). The third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm. So matrix P is a 3x3 matrix. I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0.

Wait, wait. Observables in quantum mechanics are Hermitian operators because their eigenvalues (which correspond to possible measurement outcomes
