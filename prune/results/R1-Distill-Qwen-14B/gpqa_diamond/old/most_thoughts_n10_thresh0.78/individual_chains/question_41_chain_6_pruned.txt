Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab frame.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. The light is inside the glass, moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity.

I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, we have to consider special relativity. But wait, the speed of light in a medium like glass is lower than c. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is 1/n, since c is given as 1 here.

But the glass is moving. So how does the observer in the lab perceive the speed of the light? I think this involves a frame transformation. Because the glass is moving, the speed of the light as seen by the lab frame isn't just simply 1/n. It needs to account for the motion of the medium.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: in the glass's rest frame, the light
