Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

Alright, the question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the relationship is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the formula for parallax is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). Wait, no, wait. Parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

So, if plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. But the question deals with how N changes with distance. So we need to express N in terms of d.

The given relation is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx with 1/d, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let's calculate that. 1 over (1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Wait, but wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance. So it's the rate of change, like the gradient or derivative.

Oh, right! Because the number of stars varies with distance, we need to think about the differential change. So, if N is proportional to d^5, then the change in N with respect to d is dN/dd. Let me compute that.

dN/dd = d/dd (k d^5) = 5k d^4. So the number of stars per unit distance increases as d^4. But wait, I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this correctly. The question says "the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)".

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many stars are there per unit distance. So perhaps the number density as a function of distance. Hmm, but the question is phrased a bit ambiguously. Let me read it again
