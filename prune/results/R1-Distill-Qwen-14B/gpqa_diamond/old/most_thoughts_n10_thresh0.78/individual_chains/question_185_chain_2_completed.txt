Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I remember that the Hamiltonian represents the energy of a system, and its eigenvalues give the possible energy levels. 

The given Hamiltonian is H = εσ·n, where σ is the Pauli vector (each component is a Pauli spin matrix) and n is a unit vector. Oh wait, I think the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So σ·n would be the dot product, which is σx nx + σy ny + σz nz, right?

Since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1. So the Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix because it's made from Pauli matrices, which are 2x2. 

I remember that the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σi are ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, that's when the Pauli matrix is multiplied by a scalar. Let me think. If I have a term like aσ·n, what's its eigenvalue?

Wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix like (σ·n) should be ±1 because σ·n is a traceless Hermitian matrix of the same form as each Pauli matrix. Because each Pauli matrix has trace zero and eigenvalues ±1. So generally, aσ·n would have eigenvalues ±a. 

In this case, a is ε. So the eigenvalues should be ±ε. Let me double-check. 

Alternatively, the general form of the eigenvalues for a spin-½ system in a magnetic field in the direction n would have energies proportional to the magnetic moment times the field. So if the system is H=εσ·n, then the eigenvalues should be ±ε. 

Looking at the options, option B is ±ε. Option C would be if there was a factor of ħ/2, but I don't see any in the given H. So option B is the correct answer.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. The Pauli matrices are traceless, Hermitian matrices with eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is also a traceless, Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). 

When multiplied by the constant \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian become \(\pm \varepsilon\). This result is consistent with the fact that the eigenvalues of a spin-½ system in a magnetic field are proportional to the magnetic moment and the field strength. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\), not 1.
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because there is no \(\hbar/2\) factor in the given Hamiltonian.
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Answer: B
