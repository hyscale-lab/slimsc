Okay, let me try to work through this problem. Hmm, it's a bit involved, but I'll take it step by step.

So the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember adamantane has a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have two bromine atoms on adjacent cage positions, maybe opposite each other. 

First step: heating with excess KOH at 240°C. I think KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are heated with a base, it's usually an elimination reaction. So, the bromides would leave as Br⁻, and we'd form a double bond. Since it's a vicinal dihalide (1,3-dibromo), elimination would form an alkene. But wait, adamantane is a polycyclic structure. Eliminating two bromides would form a double bond. So product 1 is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or something similar. But wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Wait, what's a typical product when you dehydrohalogenate a dibromide? It's probably a diene, but considering the structure, maybe it's a bridged diene.

Looking at the NMR data for product 1: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). Hmm, the peak at 4.79 is probably an -OH group or an -O- group, but wait, KOH is a base. Oh wait, when you eliminate Br, you might get an epoxide? No, wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm thinking of an E2 elimination. So from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, eliminating two HBr molecules would give a diene. So the structure after elimination would have two double bonds? Or maybe one double bond. Wait, no: 1,3-dibromo would, upon elimination, form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, or 2 and 3? Let me think about the structure. Adamantane is a diamond-like structure, so 1 and 3 would be on adjacent carbons if they're on a chair-like structure. So eliminating two HBr would form a double bond between 1 and 2 and another between 3 and 4? No, wait, perhaps it would form a single double bond. Maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the IR spectrum shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. So product 1 has a carbonyl group. Hmm, so maybe it's not an elimination to form a double bond. Wait, another possibility: if KOH is in excess, perhaps it's a substitution. But with 2 bromines, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But for a dihalide, substitution would require two steps. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, so more likely elimination. Wait, but if the IR shows a carbonyl group, that suggests maybe a ketone. But how would that form from a dihalide?

Another thought: could the elimination form an epoxide? No, because that usually requires an alcohol or some other condition. Wait, maybe it's an oxidation. No, KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm, perhaps when two adjacent bromines are present, and they eliminate, the structure becomes conjugated. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone. How? Suppose KOH is causing a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that's not likely because with excess base, it's more about elimination.

Wait, perhaps it's a Dieckmann elimination or some kind of ring-opening, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a dihalide, and upon treatment with a strong base, it forms a cyclic ether. Wait, but that would require a 4-membered ring or something, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base is causing a coupling reaction. Hmm, maybe it's a double elimination, but I'm not getting it.

Wait, the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak. That's a good indicator for a carbonyl. So product 1 might be a diketone? But how? Let me think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Could each Br be replaced by OH groups, leading to 1,3-diol? But then why the IR peak? Alternatively, maybe each OH is deprotonated, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Oh, wait, maybe the base is causing an elimination to form a carbonyl group. So perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- which then loses a proton to form a carbonyl. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's an oxidation, but I don't think KOH is an oxidizing agent.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR. The product has a peak at 4.79 (2H). That could be a CH₂ group next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, -OCH₂-. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) suggests a lot of CH₂ groups in a more shielded environment, perhaps adamantane's bridgehead carbons. The 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂ group, maybe near the oxygen.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. Suppose that the structure of product 1 is 1,3-adamantanedione. Because then, there would be two ketone groups. But how would that form from a dibromide? Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an O- group, but then they lose HBr? No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diol. But then why the IR at 1720? Unless the diol is further oxidized, but that would require another condition. But the question says it's product 1 after heating with KOH. So maybe it's an epoxide? No, but then the IR peak wouldn't be at 1720.

Wait, another approach: the 1H NMR shows a peak at 4.79 ppm (2H). That's a region where protons on an oxygen-bearing group show up. For example, in an ether or an epoxide. Wait, but for epoxide, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Maybe a ketone adjacent to an ether? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with an exocyclic double bond. Or maybe it's a bridge structure with an oxygen.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction forms an epoxide. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules to form an epoxide. But how would that structure look?

Wait, but if two adjacent bromines are present and eliminated, the product would have an epoxide. But wait, an epoxide is an ether with a three-membered ring. So perhaps the structure becomes an epoxide. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So I'm confused.

Wait, maybe it's an elimination to form a carbonyl. For instance, each Br could be replaced by a carbonyl group. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would become 1,3-diketone. But how would that happen with KOH?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, and upon elimination of HBr, forms a conjugated diene. But then the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl peak. So I'm not getting it. 

Wait, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but the IR peak is from something else. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe in the presence of KOH, the dihalide undergoes an elimination to form a carbonyl. For example, in some cases, vicinal dihalides can eliminate to form ketones through a double elimination. So each Br leaves, and two hydroxyl groups form, but then lose H2O to form a carbonyl. Wait, that would require two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr and form a diketone. That would make sense. So product 1 would be 1,3-adamantanedione.

Then, the IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ would correspond to the C=O stretch of the ketones. The NMR would then show the carbonyl adjacent protons, perhaps. Let's see. The NMR data for product 1: 4.79 (2H) could be the protons adjacent to the carbonyl groups. In adamantane, the structure is rigid. So in 1,3-diketone, each ketone is at positions 1 and 3. The adjacent carbons (say, 2 and 4) would each have two CH₂ groups. So perhaps the 4.79 ppm is the CH₂ groups next to the carbonyls. But in adamantane, the bridgehead CH₂ groups are usually more deshielded. Wait, but in the NMR of product 1, there's a peak at 4.79 (2H). Hmm, maybe those are the protons on the carbonyl-adjacent carbons, which are more deshielded and appear downfield.

Wait, in the NMR, the 4.79 (2H) could be two equivalent protons on a CH₂ next to a carbonyl. Then, the 2.41-2.23 (10H) could be the bridgehead CH₂ groups, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another CH₂ in a different environment.

But let's move on. Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. Hmm, aluminum isopropoxide is Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid catalyst. What reactions are catalyzed by aluminum isopropoxide? Maybe it's used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation, but product 1 is a diketone. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in some kind of cyclization or ring formation. Or maybe it's a Claisen or Aldol condensation? Wait, but product 1 is a diketone, so maybe it undergoes a ring-forming reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the diketone could undergo a Dieckmann cyclization, which is an intramolecular ester condensation. But product 1 is a diketone, not an ester. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid facilitates some kind of enolate formation, leading to a ring formation. Or maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction, but for ketones, which aren't typically activated for that.

Wait, product 1 is a diketone. Heated with Al(OiPr)3. Hmm, perhaps it's undergoing a cyclocondensation. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone undergoing some kind of elimination. Wait, but how?

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is used in the formation of enol ethers. Alternatively, perhaps it's involved in the formation of a hemiacetal or acetal. But product 1 is 1,3-diketone, which is more likely to form enolates.

Wait, another thought. When a diketone is treated with a Lewis acid, it can form a cyclic enol ether. For example, if two ketone groups are in positions that allow the formation of a five or six-membered ring upon enolization and cyclization. So, perhaps product 1 (the diketone) is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which acts as a Lewis acid catalyst, facilitating the formation of an enol ether.

So, the diketone would lose two water molecules to form a cyclic enol ether. That would form a ring. Let's say it forms a five-membered ring. So product 2 would be a cyclic enol ether, maybe a tetrahydrofuran-like structure but part of the adamantane framework. Hmm, but I'm not exactly sure about the structure.

Alternatively, maybe the diketone undergoes a cyclization to form a ring. For example, the two ketone groups could lose two H2O molecules to form a six-membered ring, resulting in an enol ether structure. That would likely form a more stable ring, maybe five or six-membered.

Then, product 2 is this cyclic enol ether. Now, moving on to the next step: ozonolysis of product 2. Ozonolysis is typically used to cleave double bonds into carbonyl groups. But wait, product 2 is a cyclic enol ether. Ozonolysis is done on alkenes. Wait, so perhaps product 2 has a double bond. Let me think: if product 2 is a cyclic enol ether, that would have a double bond in the ring. Because enol ethers have the structure R-O-C-C-O-R, but no, actually, enol ethers are R-O-C=C-O-R, but maybe in a ring.

Wait, no, cyclic enol ethers are like oxolanes or oxetanes with an adjacent double bond. For example, 3-membered rings are strained, but 5 or 6-membered rings are more common.

Wait, but the ozonolysis is done on product 2, which has a double bond, leading to product 3. So, product 2 must have a double bond. So if product 2 is a cyclic enol ether, it would have a double bond as part of the enol structure.

When ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, it's a standard ozonolysis work-up. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So, each end of the double bond would form a carbonyl group.

Product 3 would then have two carbonyl groups where the double bond was. But let me think about the structure. Suppose product 2 is a cyclic enol ether with a double bond between carbons a and b. Ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl groups, resulting in two ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substituents.

Wait, but product 3 is the result of ozonolysis, so it's probably a di-ketone or something similar. But I'm not entirely certain. 

Now, the question is about the NMR spectrum of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen atom, excluding those that exchange with deuterated solvent.

Let me think about what the most deshielded proton would be. Deshielded protons are usually in more electron-deficient areas, like near electronegative atoms or in conjugated systems. So, in product 3, which is after ozonolysis, the most deshielded protons would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl groups.

But wait, ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyls. So if the original product 2 had a double bond, product 3 would have carbonyl groups at the cleavage points. For example, if product 2 was a cyclopentene ring, ozonolysis would break it into a straight chain with ketones or aldehydes at each end.

But in this case, product 2 is derived from a diketone, so after ozonolysis, product 3 would have additional carbonyl groups. Maybe it would form a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Let me backtrack. If product 1 is a diketone, and product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Wait, but product 2 is then ozonized, which requires a double bond.

Wait, let's try this again. The initial structure is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Reaction with KOH gives a product with a carbonyl group. So perhaps product 1 is an epoxide? No, because an epoxide wouldn't have a carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a ketone. Let me think of another approach. Perhaps the initial reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by OH, forming a diol. Then, the diol is dehydrated to form a diene. But the IR would show a peak at around 1680 for a diene's C=C, but the given IR is 1720, which is higher, suggesting a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a double elimination, forming two carbonyl groups. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → 1,3-diketone (product 1). Then, product 1 is heated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a catalyst for enol ether formation. The diketone would form an enol ether, creating a ring. For example, in a five-membered ring, the enol ether would have a double bond.

So product 2 is a cyclic enol ether, which has a double bond. Then, ozonolysis of product 2 would cleave that double bond.

Wait, so ozonolysis of a cyclic enol ether would break the ring and form two carbonyl groups. Let me imagine the structure. Suppose product 2 is a cyclopentenone-type structure. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridge bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the bridge, creating carbonyl groups. But I'm getting stuck on the exact structure.

Let me try to think about the NMR of product 3. The most deshielded proton would likely be adjacent to a carbonyl group. If product 3 has a carbonyl group, the adjacent protons would show up downfield. 

Assuming product 3 has a structure where a proton is adjacent to a ketone group and perhaps coupled to two other sets of protons, the coupling pattern would be a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, let's think about the possible splitting. If a proton is next to a carbonyl group and is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with their own coupling constants, it would result in a more complex splitting pattern.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about each step again.

Step 1: 1,3-dibromoadamantane + KOH → product 1 (diketone, 1,3-adamantanedione). IR shows C=O at 1720.

Step 2: product 1 + Al(OiPr)3 → product 2 (cyclic enol ether). So, Al(OiPr)3 is a Lewis acid, promotes formation of enol ethers. The diketone forms an enol ether, which would have a ring structure with a double bond.

Step 3: product 2 undergoes ozonolysis → product 3. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, so product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

Now, let's imagine product 2 is a five-membered ring enol ether, like a cyclopentenone. Ozonolysis would break the double bond, so product 3 would have two ketone groups. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond.

But regardless, the key point is that product 3 has new carbonyl groups, and the most deshielded proton is near a carbonyl.

In product 3, the most deshielded proton would be adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say it's part of a CH₂ group next to a ketone. If that proton is split by two neighboring groups, each with a certain coupling, the pattern would be a triplet of triplets or perhaps a doublet of triplets.

Wait, another approach: think about the structure of product 3. Suppose after ozonolysis, product 3 has a structure with two carbonyl groups. The most deshielded proton would be on a CH₂ adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's say that CH₂ is between two different groups. For example, one coupling to one proton and another coupling to a different number of protons.

Wait, but without knowing the exact structure, it's a bit tricky.

Alternatively, remember that in ozonolysis, each end of the double bond becomes a carbonyl group. So if product 2 had a structure where the double bond was between carbons A and B, and each had substituents, then product 3 would have carbonyls at A and B.

So, suppose product 2 is a cyclic enol ether where the double bond is between two CH₂ groups. Then, product 3 would have two new carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH₂ group.

The protons on those CH₂ groups would be next to the carbonyl and might be split by neighboring protons.

Alternatively, if the structure after ozonolysis leads to a diketone, the adjacent protons would be on the same carbon as the carbonyl, which would be a CH group. Wait, no, because ketones are RCOR', so the adjacent carbon would be a CH₂.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Another angle: the most deshielded proton in product 3's NMR. That would likely be a proton that's adjacent to an electronegative group, like oxygen, or part of an aromatic ring. But in this case, after ozonolysis, it's more likely to be near a carbonyl.

Let's say that the structure after ozonolysis is a diketone, and the adjacent CH₂ groups have protons that are split due to coupling with neighboring groups.

For example, if a CH₂ group is next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂ group, each of those protons could couple with each other. If each proton on the CH₂ is coupling with two different sets of protons, the splitting pattern could be a triplet of triplets or another complex pattern.

But wait, in the case where each proton on the CH₂ is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons, each with a different J value, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets. Because each proton would have two neighboring groups, each causing splitting.

Alternatively, if each proton is coupled to two equivalent protons on another group, maybe it would be a doublet of triplets or a triplet of doublets.

Wait, another way to think: if the most deshielded proton is part of a CH group next to a carbonyl, and that CH is adjacent to two sets of protons, each with n and m coupling partners, then the splitting would be a doublet of doublets or similar.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure more carefully.

Assume that product 3 is a diketone, and each ketone is at the end of a chain. The structure might look something like O=C-R-R-C=O. The R groups could have protons that are adjacent to the carbonyl.

For example, if R is a CH₂ group, then the protons on that CH₂ would be adjacent to the carbonyl. Each of these protons would be split by neighboring groups.

But without knowing the exact structure, it's challenging. However, based on the options given, the coupling pattern is likely a triplet of triplets or a doublet of triplets.

Another approach: consider the number of neighboring protons. Suppose the most deshielded proton is a methylene (CH₂) group adjacent to a carbonyl. Each of those protons would couple with any neighboring protons. If each proton on the CH₂ is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with their own J values, then the splitting could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if each proton is coupled to two equivalent protons, it could be a triplet.

Wait, but the question is about the most deshielded hydrogen. If the structure after ozonolysis leads to a structure where a CH₂ group is between two carbonyl groups, then each proton on that CH₂ would be adjacent to two carbonyls. Wait, no, that's not possible because carbonyls are at the ends.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that a CH group is between two carbonyls, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis breaks a ring, creating two carbonyl groups and leaving a chain with a CH₂ group adjacent to both.

For example, imagine product 2 was a cyclohexene derivative, and ozonolysis breaks it into a 1,6-diketone. The protons on the carbon adjacent to both ketones (the 2 and 5 positions) would be deshielded and split by neighboring groups.

In such a case, the CH₂ groups at positions 2 and 5 would each have protons that are adjacent to two different environments. Each proton would be coupled to the next set of protons, which could have multiple coupling partners.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of a specific example. Suppose product 3 is a molecule where a CH₂ group is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Wait, that's not possible because each carbonyl is at the end. Alternatively, maybe it's a structure where a CH₂ is next to one carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂ group.

For example, O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CO. Then, the central CH₂ groups would each have protons that are adjacent to the carbonyl and each other.

In that case, each proton on the central CH₂ would couple with the adjacent CH₂ group on both sides. Each would have two neighboring protons (from the next CH₂ group), leading to a triplet for each. But wait, each CH₂ would have two neighboring protons on one side and two on the other? Or perhaps each proton on the central CH₂ is next to two protons from the same group and two from another.

Wait, perhaps each CH₂ is between two CH₂ groups. For example:

O=C-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CO.

In this case, the central CH₂ (the second one) would have neighboring groups on both sides. The protons on that CH₂ would be next to two CH₂ groups. Each proton would couple with the two protons on the left and the two on the right. So each would have two coupling partners, each with a J value. This would result in a triplet of triplets because each proton is split by two different J values.

Alternatively, if the coupling is with two equivalent protons on adjacent carbons, it could be a triplet.

Wait, but in the scenario where a proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with the same or different J values, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets if each coupling is with two protons. But if the couplings are with two sets of two protons, each with the same J, would it be a triplet of triplets?

Hmm. Let's think of a simple example. A proton A is adjacent to two sets of two equivalent protons, each on either side, and each with the same coupling constant. Then, the splitting would be (n+1)(m+1), where n and m are the number of protons in each set. So for n=2 and m=2, it would be (3)(3) = 9 peaks, which is a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the two neighboring groups have different J values, the pattern would still be a triplet of triplets but with different spacings.

Given that, the most deshielded proton in product 3 would likely be part of a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl group and coupled to two different sets of two protons each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but looking at the options, B is triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is a doublet of triplets. Hmm. Another possibility is that the proton is coupled to two different protons, each with a different coupling, resulting in a doublet of doublets, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are A) triplet, B) triplet of triplets, C) doublet of triplets, D) pentet.

If the coupling is with two sets, each with two protons, the pattern would be a triplet of triplets (option B). But if it's coupled with one set of two protons and another set of three, it would be a triplet of quartets, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the most deshielded proton is a methine (CH) group adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. Then, each proton on the CH would couple with each of the neighboring groups. For example, if the CH is next to two CH₂ groups, each with two protons, that's two different couplings, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another point to consider: the initial product 1 is 1,3-diketone, product 2 is a cyclic enol ether, and product 3 is after ozonolysis. So, product 3 might have a structure that includes a bridge or a chain with carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps in product 3, the most deshielded proton is on a CH₂ group that's adjacent to two carbonyl groups. Or maybe it's on a carbon next to a carbonyl and adjacent to another CH₂ group.

Alternatively, let me think of the actual splitting. Suppose the structure is such that each proton is adjacent to two different CH₂ groups. For example, if a proton is next to two different sets of two protons each, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the splitting comes from two different coupling partners, each with a different coupling constant. That would also lead to a triplet of triplets.

But in the options, option B is triplet of triplets, which would fit this scenario.

Alternatively, maybe the splitting is a doublet of triplets if coupled with one group of two and another of four, but that's not matching the options.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck, but given the options and the reasoning that the most deshielded proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with two protons, the most likely answer is a triplet of triplets (option B).


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Step 1: Reaction with KOH**  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH at 240°C likely results in a double elimination reaction, forming a diketone (1,3-adamantanedione). This is supported by the IR spectrum showing a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of protons adjacent to carbonyl groups and other CH₂ groups in the adamantane framework.

2. **Step 2: Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**  
   Heating the diketone with aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)₃), a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the formation of a cyclic enol ether. This involves the diketone undergoing cyclization to form a ring structure with a double bond, as Al(OiPr)₃ promotes enol ether formation.

3. **Step 3: Ozonolysis**  
   Ozonolysis of the cyclic enol ether cleaves the double bond, forming two carbonyl groups. The resulting product (product 3) is likely a diketone or a compound with carbonyl groups at the sites of the former double bond.

4. **NMR Analysis of Product 3**  
   The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. This proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons, each with distinct coupling constants. This coupling pattern results in a **triplet of triplets**, as the proton is split by two different J values.

Given the reasoning and the coupling pattern described, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
