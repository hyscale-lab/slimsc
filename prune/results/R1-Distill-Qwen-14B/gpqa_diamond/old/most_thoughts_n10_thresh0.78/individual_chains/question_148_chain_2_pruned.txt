Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again and try to break it down.

The question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So, Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. Binary means each compound has two elements, so Y and F in different ratios.

The substances mentioned are A1 through A5. Let's parse each piece of information.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing usually means it's a strong oxidizing agent. Xenon is a noble gas, so maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing fluorine compound.

Next, A2 has an oF (I think that's the oxidation state of F) of 31.96%. Wait, oxidation states are percentages? Maybe that's the average oxidation state. So F has an oxidation state of + something. Wait, 31.96%... Let me think. Fluorine's common oxidation states are -1, +1, +3, etc. But 31.96% might indicate a fractional charge. Wait, maybe it's the average oxidation state in A2. So if F's oxidation state is, say, +5, then 5 divided by the number of F atoms times 100? Or perhaps it's the overall formula.

Wait, let me think about a compound where F has an average oxidation state of +3. Because 3 times (number of F atoms) would be 31.96% of the total. No, not quite sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in the compound. Wait, but the question says 'ɷF=31,96%'—maybe the molar percentage? Or the mass percentage? Hmm, not sure. Or maybe it's the oxidation state, like, each F is +3 on average. Let me think. If each F is +3, and the compound is YF₃, then Y would have a charge of -3. But that's just a guess.

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me go back.

A1 oxidizes xenon, so A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. What fluorine compounds are strong oxidizing agents? Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent itself, but in compounds like F₂, but A1 is a compound, so maybe something like F₂O, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a peroxide, but I'm not certain. Wait, more likely, a compound like ClF3 is a strong oxidizing agent, but Y is another element. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A1 is YF₅, which is a strong oxid
