Okay, so I've got this question about planet transits and which one is more likely to transit. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

So the question is about two planets, both Earth-like, detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods and host star properties. I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting.

Wait, so the key factors for transit probability are the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit. Oh right, but there's another thing—the orbital distance. Because the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. The closer the planet is, the higher the chance of transiting since the area it can block is a larger fraction of the star's disk.

Wait, no, actually I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall the formula. The probability P is roughly (R_star / a) * (something else?), or maybe it's the other way around. I think the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a) multiplied by (1 / (something)). Or perhaps it's (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is right, which is 1/(something else).

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the formula. The transit probability, for a circular orbit, is given by the product of two terms: the geometric probability and the Doppler beaming effect, but wait, that's for the RV method. No, for transit probability, the geometric probability is the main factor. So the geometric probability (which is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is edge-on enough for the transit to occur) is approximately (R_star / a) * ( (R_planet + R_star) / R_star )^2. But wait, since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, that term is negligible. So the main factor is (R_star / a).

Wait, no, I think the geometric probability is actually (R_star / a) multiplied by (something else), perhaps the (R_planet + R_star)^2 term, but that's probably negligible, so maybe it's just R_star / a. Or is it (R_star / a) multiplied by 1/(something else)?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again. The formula I remember is that the transit probability is P = (R_star / a) * ( (R_planet + R_star) / R_star )^2. But for Earth-like planets and stars, R_planet is much smaller than R_star, so that term is about (R_earth << R_star), so (R_star + R_earth)/R_star ≈ 1. So the transit probability reduces to P ≈ (R_star / a) * 1^2 = R_star / a.

So the probability is proportional to R_star divided by the orbital distance a. So if a planet is closer (smaller a), the transit probability is higher because R_star/a is larger. So that's one factor.

But wait, another thing comes into play: the star's mass and radius. Because the orbital distance a is determined by Kepler's third law. Oh, right! The orbital period and the star's mass determine the semi-major axis a.

Given that both planets have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Wait, but Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to a^3 divided by the star's mass. So the formula is P^2 = (4π²/G M_star) * a^3. So a = [ (G M_star P²)/(4π²) ]^(1/3).

Wait, but both planets have the same mass. So for each planet, a is proportional to (M_star * P^2)^(1/3). Wait, but the host of Planet_1 has twice the mass of Planet_2's host. Let me see: Planet_1's host has mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of Planet_2's host. And the period of Planet_1 is P1 = (1/3) P2.

So a1 is proportional to (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2² / 9))^(1/3) = [ (2/9) M2 P2² ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3).

Similarly, a2 is proportional to (M2 * P2^2 )^(1/3).

So a1 is (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

What's 2/9? Approximately 0.222. The cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6, since 0.6^3 is about 0.216. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, but wait: a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P1^2) ]^(1/3).

P1 = P2 / 3, so P1^2 = P2² / 9.

So a1 = [ (2 M2) * (P2² /9) ]^(1/3) = [ (2/9) * M2 P2² ]^(1/3).

And a2 is [ M2 P2² ]^(1/3).

So a1 = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2 ≈ 0.6 * a2.

So Planet_1 is closer to its star, at about 0.6 times the orbital distance of Planet_2.

Now, both stars have the same radius, R_star1 = R_star2 = R.

So for each planet, transit probability is approx (R / a).

So for Planet_1, P1 = R / a1 = R / (0.6 a2) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2) ≈ 1.6667 * (R/a2).

For Planet_2, P2 = R/a2.

So the ratio of probabilities is P1/P2 = (R/a1)/(R/a2) )= a2/a1 = (a2)/(0.6 a2) )= 1 / 0.6 ≈ 1.6667.

So Planet_1 has about 1.6667 times higher probability of transiting than Planet_2.

Wait, but the options are options A-D. Let me look:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher probability.

Option D says ~2.7 times, which is higher. So 1.66 is about 1.65, so option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

a1 = (M1 * P1²)^(1/3) = (2 M2 * (P2/3)^2 )^(1/3) = (2 M2 * P2² /9 )^(1/3) = [ (2/9) M2 P2² ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) * (M2 P2²)^(1/3) ) = (2/9)^(1/3) * a2.

(2/9) is 0.2222. Cube root of 0.2222 is about 0.6, as before. So a1 = 0.6 a2.

Thus, R/a1 = R/(0.6 a2 ) = (1/0.6) * (R/a2 ) ≈ 1.6667 * (R/a2).

So P1 is 1.6667 times P2.

So Planet_1 has higher transit probability. So the researchers would choose Planet_1.

Looking at options, option C says Planet 1 is preferred, with ~1.65 times higher probability. That's close to 1.6667, so option C.

Wait, but wait, another factor comes into play. The Doppler method (RV) detects planets based on their mass and orbital period. But the transit probability also depends on the inclination of the orbit. But since both have been detected by RV, which gives the minimum mass (since RV can't see edge-on orbits, but gives sin(i), where i is the inclination), but the question says they have circular orbits, but I think the RV method doesn't depend on the inclination as much as transit does.

Wait, but since the RV method has already detected both, that implies that their orbits are at a certain inclination. Wait, no, the RV method gives the minimum mass because it depends on sin(i), but the actual mass is M sin(i). So for the RV method, i could be anything, but for transiting, i must be close to 90 degrees.

But the question states that both planets have circular orbits, but doesn't specify their inclinations. So when considering the transit probability, it's (R_star/a) multiplied by the probability that the inclination is such that the planet transits. But wait, for a randomly oriented orbit, the probability that the inclination is right (i.e., that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough) is (R_star/a) / (1), but I think that's the geometric probability.

Wait, another way to think about it: the probability that a randomly oriented orbit causes a transit is (R_star / a) * ( (R_planet + R_star) / R_star )^2. But again, R_planet is negligible, so it's approximately (R_star/a) * (something else?).

Wait, perhaps it's better to go back. The transit probability is the geometric probability, which is (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability that the planet's orbit is edge-on. But I think the geometric probability is the product of the star's radius over the orbital distance and the solid angle factor. Or is it simply (R_star / a) ?

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability (geometric probability) is (R_star + R_planet)^2 / (a^2 + (R_star + R_planet)^2 ). But this is an approximation when R_planet << R_star.

Wait, no, I'm getting this confused. Let me check: the transit probability is the probability that the planet's orbital plane is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. For a random orientation, the probability is (R_star / a), provided that the orbit is nearly circular. Wait, no, perhaps it's (R_star / (a * sqrt(1 - e²))) ), but since both orbits are circular (e=0), it's R_star/(a).

Wait, I think the correct formula is the probability is (R_star / (a)) multiplied by (1 + (R_planet / R_star))^2. But since R_planet << R_star, that's approximately R_star / a.

So transit probability is proportional to R_star / a.

So for each planet, P ∝ R_star / a.

Given that both R_star are the same, R = R1 = R2.

So P1 ∝ 1/a1, P2 ∝ 1/a2.

Earlier, we found a1 is 0.6 times a2. So P1 = (1 / 0.6 a2 ) * R, and P2 = (1/a2) * R.

So P1 = (1/0.6) * P2 = 1.666... * P2.

So P1 is about 1.666 times P2.

So the probability for Planet_1 is higher. Thus, Planet_1 is preferred.

Looking at options, option C says Planet_1 is preferred with ~1.65 times higher probability. Which matches with our calculation of about 1.667, which is approximately 1.65.

So the correct answer is C.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula. The transit probability is proportional to the ratio of the star's radius \( R_{\text{star}} \) to the planet's orbital distance \( a \), i.e., \( P \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a} \). Since both planets orbit stars of the same radius \( R_{\text{star}} \), the key factor is the orbital distance \( a \).

Using Kepler's third law, the semi-major axis \( a \) is proportional to \( (M_{\text{star}} \cdot P^2)^{1/3} \), where \( M_{\text{star}} \) is the mass of the host star and \( P \) is the orbital period. For Planet_1, the host star has twice the mass of Planet_2's host star (\( M_1 = 2M_2 \)), and the orbital period of Planet_1 is one-third that of Planet_2 (\( P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2 \)).

Substituting these values:
\[
a_1 \propto (M_1 \cdot P_1^2)^{1/3} = \left(2M_2 \cdot \left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}M_2P_2^2\right)^{1/3}.
\]
\[
a_2 \propto (M_2 \cdot P_2^2)^{1/3}.
\]

The ratio of the orbital distances is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.6.
\]

Thus, \( a_1 \approx 0.6a_2 \). Since the transit probability is inversely proportional to \( a \), the probability for Planet_1 is:
\[
P_1 \propto \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_1} = \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{0.6a_2} = \frac{1}{0.6} \cdot \frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a_2} \approx 1.67 \cdot P_2.
\]

This means Planet_1 has approximately 1.67 times the transit probability of Planet_2. Among the options, the closest match is **C**, which states that Planet_1 is preferred due to its ~1.65 times higher probability to transit.
