Okay, so I need to find the energy of the RHIC collider when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that means it's lithium-6 because Li has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6.

First, I remember that the energy of a particle in a collider is given by relativistic equations. Since the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light, I definitely can't use classical mechanics. I should use the relativistic energy formula.

The total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy (mc²). Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh right, v is 0.96c, so I can plug that in.

But wait, I need the mass of the lithium nucleus. The nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons. Lithium-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Each proton has a mass of approximately 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is about the same, around 939 MeV/c². Wait, but I should probably get the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I can use the average or a more precise approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass number.

Alternatively, I remember that the mass of a nucleus can be approximated by the sum of the masses of its nucleons. So for Li-6, 6 nucleons. Each is about 938 MeV/c², so 6 * 938 = 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV.

Wait, but wait. The actual mass of a nucleus is a bit less than the sum because of binding energy, but for this problem, maybe they just want me to use the rest mass of a proton or neutron as 938 MeV. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes the nucleus is much heavier, so the gamma factor is the dominant part.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate the rest mass energy of the nucleus. Let me think: the rest mass of a lithium nucleus is approximately the same as 6 times the mass of a nucleon. So each nucleon is about 938 MeV, so
