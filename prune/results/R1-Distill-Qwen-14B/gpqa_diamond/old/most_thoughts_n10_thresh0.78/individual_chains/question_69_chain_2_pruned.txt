Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I need to figure out the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem states that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. I need to find the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the detection resolution or the ability to distinguish particles, so that at least 30% of the decays are observed.

Wait, so the proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. When the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, its lifetime as observed in the lab frame will be longer due to time dilation. The gamma factor, γ, comes into play here. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is given by gamma = total energy divided by rest mass energy. Oh right, because E = gamma * m c², so gamma = E / (m c²). Since E is given in GeV and the mass is also in GeV/c², maybe the c² terms will cancel out when calculating gamma.

So let's compute gamma. The energy E is 27 GeV, and the rest mass m is 3.41 GeV. So gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41... Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 times 7.9 is approximately 27? Let me calculate 3.41 * 7.9: 3*7.9=23.7, 0.41*7.9≈3.24, so total around 26.94. Close enough. So gamma is approximately 7.9.

Gamma is the time dilation factor, so the lifetime in the lab frame τ is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = gamma * τ₀. So τ = 7.9 * 8e-16 seconds. Let's compute that. 7.9 * 8 is about 63.2; so 63.2e-16 seconds.

Wait, but what's the significance of this? The lifetime is longer, so the particle can travel a longer distance before decaying. The mean path length (average distance traveled) would be c multiplied by τ. The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So the mean path L is c * τ.

Putting the numbers in: L = 3e8 m/s * 63.2e-16 s. Let's compute that. 3e8 * 63.2e-16 = 3 * 63.2 * 1e8 * 1e-16. So 3*63.2 is 189.6, and 1e8 * 1e-16 is 1e-8. So 189.6e-8 meters. 1e-8 meters is 10 nanometers, but wait, 189.6e-8 meters is 1.896e-6 meters, which is 1.896 micrometers.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. So I think the question is related to the detection of the decay products. The resolution of the detector determines how accurately it can measure the position of the decay vertex. If the resolution is too poor, the detector can't distinguish the decay point accurately, leading to fewer observed decays because the tracks appear closer together than they actually are.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing concepts. Another approach: the number of decays observed depends on how well the detector can measure the decay length. If the decay length is smaller than the detector's resolution, the decay might not be detected because the tracks from the decay products can't be resolved from each other or from the primary track.

Wait, but to observe a decay, the detector must see the two particles Y and Z coming from the same point. If the decay occurs over a length longer than the detector's resolution, then the tracks of Y and Z might be seen as separate, making it harder to recognize that they came from a common decay point. So the proper resolution must be such that the decay length is detectable with sufficient precision.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of decays that can be observed given the available time. Wait, no, I think it's about the length over which the decay occurs. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the decay length and how many decays are detected. The decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The detector's resolution determines the smallest decay length that can be observed. So if the decay length is very small, it's hard to detect because the decay products are too close together.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. So perhaps the resolution must be good enough to detect 30% of the possible decays, meaning that the decay length has to be at least a certain minimum to be detected.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of possible decay positions along the path. The total number of possible decay points is the total decay length divided by the detector's resolution. If the resolution is too poor, the number of distinguishable decay points is low, so the probability that the decay is observed is lower.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the probability of observing the decay. The probability of detecting a decay is related to the ratio of the detector's resolution to the decay length. But I'm not exactly sure about the formula here.

I've heard that the probability P of detecting a decay is approximately 1 - e^{-L/(βγ c τ₀ / (Δ))}, where Δ is the resolution. Wait, maybe another approach. The decay probability is such that after a mean path L, the number of decays is related to the decay constant. Alternatively, perhaps the number of decays observed is given by the product of the decay probability and the number of possible events.

Wait another idea: the decay length is L = βγ c τ₀. The β is v/c. Since gamma is 7.9, and the mass is 3.41 GeV, the velocity can be found from beta = v/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Wait, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Let me compute that. Gamma is approximately 7.9, so 1/gamma² is about 1/(62.41) ≈ 0.016. So 1 - 0.016 is 0.984, sqrt of that is around 0.992. So beta is approximately 0.992. So the decay length L = beta gamma c tau_0.

Wait I think I can plug in the numbers. Let's see: beta is 0.992, gamma is 7.9, c is 3e8 m/s, tau_0 is 8e-16 s.

So L = (0.992) * (7.9) * (3e8 m/s) * (8e-16 s). Let me compute each part.

First, 0.992 * 7.9 ≈ 7.85. Then 3e8 * 8e-16 is 24e-8. So 24e-8 * 7.85 = 24 *7.85e-8 = approximately 188.4e-8 meters. Which is 1.884e-6 meters, or 1.884 micrometers. So L ≈ 1.884e-6 meters.

Wait, but how does this relate to the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays? I'm a bit stuck here.

I think the key is that the detector must be able to resolve the decay point, meaning that the resolution (delta) must be such that the decay length is at least a certain multiple of the resolution. Alternatively, the probability of detecting the decay is related to the ratio L/(delta).

Wait, perhaps when the decay length is much larger than the detector's resolution, the decay is easier to observe. So perhaps the probability is proportional to the decay length over the detector's resolution.

Wait, I've also heard of the formula for the detection efficiency, which might be something like the efficiency (η)
