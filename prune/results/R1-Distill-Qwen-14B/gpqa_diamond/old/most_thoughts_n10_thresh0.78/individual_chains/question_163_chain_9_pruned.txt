Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we want to find out the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed for this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, alright. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, so it's a base. To dissolve it, I probably need to use an acid. The acid is monobasic and strong, so it should completely dissociate. Monobasic means it donates one proton per molecule. So, like HCl, HNO3, or something similar.

First, I think I need to calculate how much Fe(OH)3 is present. The mass is 0.1 grams. Let me find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen (O) is 16, and Hydrogen (H) is 1. So, for Fe(OH)3, it's 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. So, the moles of Fe(OH)3 are mass divided by molar mass: 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009358, yes.

Now, Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with an acid, it should produce water and the corresponding salt. The reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O. Wait, right. Because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so each will react with a H+.

So the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Fe(OH)3 reacting with 3 moles of H+.

So, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. Let's compute that: 0.000936 mol *3 = 0.002808 mol of H+.

The acid provided is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles divided by concentration. So volume (in liters) is 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait—hold on. The total volume of the solution is 100 cm³. Does that affect anything?

Hmm, because when you add the acid, it's being added to the solution, so the total volume might change a little, but the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps we have to take into account that the acid volume plus the solution volume equals 100 cm³? Or is the solution volume 100 cm³ after adding the acid? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3 is 100 cm³. So the acid we add is part of that 100 cm³. So the volume of acid (V_acid) plus the volume of the solution (which I assume is 100 cm³ - V_acid) would be 100 cm³. No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the initial solution's volume is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, you're adding it to that 100 cm³. But wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the total volume, so the acid's volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution volume equals 100 cm³. But I think the main point is that the total volume is 100 cm³ after adding the acid. So the H+ comes from the acid, which is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely.

Wait, but in that case, I think the initial approach is correct: calculate how much H+ is needed, then find the volume of 0.1 M acid needed to provide that H+.

So, earlier calculation was 28.08 cm³. Let me check the options. The options are:

A) 32.14 cm3, pH 3.16

B)30.09, pH 2.69

C)28.05, pH 2.04

D) 20.40, pH 4.94

So my initial calculation is about 28.08 cm³, which is option C's volume. So the volume needed would be approximately 28 cm³, matching option C. But wait, let's think again.

Wait, but what if the Fe(OH)3 doesn't completely dissolve? Because sometimes, in reality, not all of the solid may dissolve, but the question specifies 'dissolve', so perhaps we can assume it all dissolves. Or maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: The reaction is Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 H2O. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, you need 3 moles of H+.

So with 0.1 g Fe(OH)3, as before, that's 0.000936 mol. So H+ needed: 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so moles = M * V → V = moles /
