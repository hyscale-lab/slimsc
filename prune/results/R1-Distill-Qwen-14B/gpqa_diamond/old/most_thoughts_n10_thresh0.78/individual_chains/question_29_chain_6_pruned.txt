Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations in barley. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that's bad for food because it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a chemical that causes point mutations, usually by altering bases. The question is about which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So the intact gene sequence is provided, and four mutants. Looking at the sequences, I need to find which mutation would disrupt the gene's function, likely by causing a premature stop codon or a change that alters the protein enough to disrupt the compound's synthesis.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Wait, I should compare each mutant to the intact gene to see the differences.

Starting with the first few codons since all changes are in the first exon.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Looking at Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGG... Wait, let me break it down.

Wait, maybe I should write out the sequences:

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGG...
So the third codon in the intact is CTC (Leucine), in Mutant 1, it's CTA (Leucine still), fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in Mutant1 it's CGC (Arginine?) Wait, no: wait, the fourth codon is at positions 4-6 in the third triplet.

Wait, perhaps I should number the nucleotides. Let me see:

Intact: positions 1-60 (assuming)
Mutant 1: starts with ATG TTT CTA CGC...

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compare each mutant's changes.
