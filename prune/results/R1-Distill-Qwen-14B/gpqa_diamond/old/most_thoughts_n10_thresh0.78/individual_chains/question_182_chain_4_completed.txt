Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity conditions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember the Mott-Gurney equation is used in semiconductors, specifically in the context of space-charge-limited current (SCLC). SCLC is when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the charge builds up in the device and affects the electric field. This usually happens in things like tunnel diodes or light-emitting diodes under certain conditions.

The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). So J is the current density, ε is the dielectric constant, μ is carrier mobility, V is voltage, and L is the length of the device. I think the equation shows that the current is proportional to the square of the voltage. That makes me think of I-V curves where the current increases with the square of voltage, which is typical in SCLC regions.

Now, the question is about the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. The options are A, B, C, D. Let's go through each.

Option A says it's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate the current by causing carrier trapping, which isn't accounted for in the equation. Single-carrier means either electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact implies that the injection is efficient without any barrier, so that's probably right. But wait, the Mott-Gurney case is for when the current is limited by space charge, which occurs when the electric field is reduced due to the built-up charge. Ohmic contacts allow for easier injection, but the equation is for when the current is limited by space charge, not by injection. Also, negligible drift current—drift is the main current here, so if drift is negligible, maybe the equation wouldn't apply. Hmm, maybe I'm not sure about this.

Option B says it's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean Ohmic contacts, so that's similar to A. But it says negligible diffusion current. SCLC is usually when the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. So if diffusion is negligible, that makes sense because in SCLC the drift is the main factor. So this could be a good option.

Option C mentions a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. Schottky contacts have barriers, so they are non-ohmic. But Mott-Gurney equation is for when the current is limited by space charge, which occurs when the electric field is reduced because of the charge build-up. If there's a Schottky barrier, maybe the injection is limited, but for the SCLC region, the current is more about the space charge rather than the injection. So I'm not sure. Also, Schottky contacts imply that the device is in a regime where the current might be limited by the barrier, not the space charge. So maybe this option is not correct.

Option D is about a two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Two-carrier devices usually have both electrons and holes contributing. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier cases because if both carriers are present, the physics changes, maybe leading to a different current dependence. So D is probably incorrect.

So, the key points are: single-carrier, trap-free, and the type of contacts. Also, the current is dominated by drift, not diffusion. Looking at the options:

Option A says negligible drift current. No, because in SCLC, drift is the main current. So that statement doesn't make sense. So A is probably wrong.

Option B says no carrier injection barriers, which implies Ohmic contacts, and negligible diffusion current. Since SCLC assumes drift dominates, diffusion is negligible, so that fits. So B is a good candidate.

Wait, but the Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption of single-carrier, no traps, and space-charge limited. The space-charge limit implies that the current is due to the space charge, which is about the electric field being modified by the charge. So it should be a single-carrier device, with no traps, and perhaps in a region where the injection is complete, meaning no injection barriers (so Ohmic contact). Also, the derivation assumes that the current is mainly drift, not diffusion, so diffusion current should be negligible.

So putting it together, option B says trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier (so Ohmic, so no barrier), and negligible diffusion current. That sounds correct.

Wait, option A says "with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current." But if drift is negligible, then the equation wouldn't apply because the current is due to drift. So A is probably not correct.

Another point: Mott-Gurney equation is for space-charge-limited current, where the current is limited by the space charge. That would require that the device is such that the charge can accumulate, which usually occurs in single-carrier devices. In Ohmic contacts, the carriers can be injected without much barrier, so the device would more quickly reach the SCLC condition as the voltage increases.

So in conclusion, the correct option is B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime in semiconductor devices, where the current is proportional to the square of the voltage. The equation is valid under specific conditions: the device must be single-carrier (either electrons or holes), trap-free (to avoid complications from carrier trapping), and the current must be dominated by drift rather than diffusion. Additionally, the device should have no carrier injection barriers, which implies Ohmic contacts.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This option states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation specifically applies to the SCLC regime, where drift current is the dominant mechanism. If drift current were negligible, the equation would not apply. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This option describes a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. Since SCLC assumes drift dominates and diffusion is negligible, this option aligns with the conditions under which the Mott-Gurney equation is valid. This is the correct choice.

- **Option C**: This option mentions a Schottky contact, which introduces a barrier to carrier injection. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to the SCLC regime, which typically occurs in devices with efficient injection (Ohmic contacts). Schottky contacts would complicate the current due to injection barriers, making this option incorrect.

- **Option D**: This option refers to a two-carrier device, which is not consistent with the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation is derived for single-carrier devices, where both electrons and holes do not contribute simultaneously. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barriers (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current, as described in **Option B**.
