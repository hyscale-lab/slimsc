Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. 

So, the given data: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass is 1.5 times larger. Wait, but mass might not directly affect luminosity here, unless it's about something else like temperature. I remember that luminosity of a star is tied to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Luminosity L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power, right? So L = 4πσR²T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So the important factors are radius and temperature.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. The formula is λ_max * T = constant, specifically, it's Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (about 2.898×10^-3 m·K). 

So if both stars have the same λ_max, that would mean they have the same temperature. Wait, but that can't be right because the problem then says something about radial velocities. Oh, wait, the radial velocities are given as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the measured λ_max might be different due to their velocities, but the actual emission is based on their rest frames.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem says that the measured wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, the observed λ_max is the same for both. But the actual λ_max in their rest frames would differ because of their velocities. So I need to account for that.

So, for each star, the observed λ_max is same. Let me denote the rest frame λ as λ0. So for Star_1, if it's moving towards us or away, its observed λ would change. But Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed λ_max is the same as its rest λ_max. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity could be either approach or recession. But the problem just says 700 km/s, I think we have to assume it's moving towards us (blue shift) or away (red shift). Hmm, but wait, the formula for Doppler shift in wavelength is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds, but since v is 700 km/s, which is about 0.23% the speed of light (as c is about 3x10^5 km/s). So maybe a non-relativistic approximation would work, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift formula for small velocities is
