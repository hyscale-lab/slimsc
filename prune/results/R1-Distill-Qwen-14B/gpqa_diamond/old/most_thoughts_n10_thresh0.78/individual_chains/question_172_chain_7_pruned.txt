Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their photospheres. I'm a bit rusty on my stellar astrophysics, but let's try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as about 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I remember means that each small part of the photosphere is in equilibrium with a blackbody at a certain temperature.

So, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor tells us the relative populations of energy levels in a system. The formula is something like the ratio of populations (n_upper / n_lower) equals exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but in this problem, the excitation level is twice as high in star_1. So for star_1, the population of the excited state compared to the lower state is twice that of star_2.

Let me denote the ratio for star_1 as n1_upper / n1_lower = 2 * (n2_upper / n2_lower).

But according to the Boltzmann equation, each ratio is exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). So for star_1:

n1_upper / n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))

And for star_2:

n2_upper / n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

So substituting, we have:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Hmm, wait, no. Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, the excitation in star_1 is twice that of star_2. So perhaps the population ratio is higher in star_1. So the ratio n_upper/n_lower for star_1 is 2 times that of star_2.

So let me write:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The population ratio is n_upper/n_lower. Let me think again. The ratio for star_1 is n1_upper/n1_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)). Similarly, for star_2, it's n2_upper/n2_lower = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)). 

The problem states that the excitation is twice as high in star_1. So does that mean that n1_upper is twice n2_upper, or that the ratio n_upper/n_lower is twice as much? Hmm. It says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". Wait, does that mean that the number of excited atoms is twice that in star_2? Or twice the excitation relative to another level?

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So perhaps the ratio n_upper/n_lower in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Let me assume that's correct.

So:

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

Let me divide both sides by exp(-ΔE/(k T2)):

exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = 2

Which can be written as exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2.

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, because:

ln( exp( x ) ) = x. So,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = ln(2)

Alternatively, rearranging:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ( ln(2) * k ) / ΔE

But wait, let's compute that. Let me think about the given ΔE. Wait, the problem says the energy difference is 1.38e-23 J. Wait, 1.38 is about the value of Boltzmann's constant, which is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait a second, k = 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, perhaps? Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, the given ΔE is 1.38e-23 J, which is exactly k (since k=1.38e-23 J/K). So, ΔE = k.

So substituting ΔE = k,

(1/T2 - 1/T1) * (k)/(k) = ln(2)

Which simplifies to 1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2)

Wait, but that would be:

(1/T2 - 1/T1) = ln(2)

Wait, that's:

1/T2 -1/T1 = ln(2)

Which can be rewritten as:

( T1 - T2 ) / (T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Because:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2)

So,

(T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) ) = ln(2)

Looking back at the options:

Option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2), which matches.

Option A: ln(2) = T2/T1 → Doesn't fit.

Option B: ln(2) = (T1+T2)/(T1 T
