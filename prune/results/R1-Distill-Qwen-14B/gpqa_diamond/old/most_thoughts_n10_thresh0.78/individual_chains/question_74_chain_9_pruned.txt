Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the next 150 minutes from now? Or is it the next 150 minutes after the initial 100? Let me read the question again.

Oh, no, the initial setup says 100 minutes for the decay probability. So, the atom hasn't decayed in 50 minutes. Now, from this point, what's the chance it decays in the next 150? Or wait, is it the next 150 minutes after the initial 100? Or is it the remaining time? Wait, no, I think the 150 is the time from now, not the initial 100.

Wait, the question says "the next 150 minutes." So, after the 50 minutes have passed, we're looking at the next 150 minutes. So the total time since the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

But wait, maybe I should model this using the decay probabilities. Radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? The probability of decay depends on time.

So the decay probability in a certain time can be modeled by P = 1 - e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant and t is time.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm thinking about it wrong. Because the given probability is 32% for 100 minutes. So first, I should find the decay constant 位.

Given that P(100) = 0.32.

So P(t) = 1 - e^(-位 t).

Wait, but wait, P(t) is the probability that the atom has decayed by time t. So after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. So, 32% of the atoms decay by 100 minutes, meaning the survival probability is 68% at
