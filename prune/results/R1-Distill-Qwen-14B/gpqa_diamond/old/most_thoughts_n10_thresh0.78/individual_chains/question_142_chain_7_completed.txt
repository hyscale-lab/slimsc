Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think I've heard that this is the maximally mixed state, which is like the completely mixed state for a qubit. Oh right, because a maximally mixed state is the classical mixture of the basis states, so it's as random as possible.

Now, I remember that the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state should be at the center of the Bloch sphere because it's the most mixed possible. So the center is at (0,0,0). But wait, how does that translate into the vector representation?

Let me think. The density matrix for a general qubit can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The formula is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (the Bloch vector) with components (x,y,z). Each component corresponds to the expectation value in the respective direction.

So if the density matrix is (I)/2, because |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1| is the identity matrix (since |0⟩ and |1⟩ are orthonormal and form a basis), then ρ = I/2. That would mean r·σ is zero, right? So r must be zero. So the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), which matches the center of the Bloch sphere. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, just to make sure I'm not mixing things up. The density matrix ρ = I/2 is the maximally mixed state, so yes, that's definitely the center of the Bloch sphere. So no other options make sense here. A is (1,1,0), which is some point on the equator, B is (0,0,1) which would be the north pole, and D is (1,1,1) which is somewhere else. No, the center is the only one that makes sense.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state of a qubit, which corresponds to the center of the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of qubit states, where pure states lie on the surface and mixed states lie inside. For the maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector \( r \) is at the origin, i.e., \( r = (0,0,0) \), because the density matrix does not have any directional preference in the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \( r = (1,1,0) \):** This represents a point on the equator of the Bloch sphere, not the center.
- **B) \( r = (0,0,1) \):** This represents the north pole of the Bloch sphere, not the center.
- **C) \( r = (0,0,0) \):** This correctly represents the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.
- **D) \( r = (1,1,1) \):** This represents a point inside the Bloch sphere but not at the center.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the given density matrix in the qubit space is \( r = (0,0,0) \).

Answer: C
