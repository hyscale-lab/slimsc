Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about stars with dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. I remember that when stars have spots, their overall brightness and temperature can change, which in turn affects the spectral lines we observe.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, Teff is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the effective temperature drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2) when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which it changes.

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the ratio without spots (R_no_spots) is higher than when spots are present (R_spots). The factor would be R_no_spots / R_spots.

The problem says that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. I think that's in the ultraviolet or maybe the near UV. Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, which is in the vacuum UV range. But since the photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), we can use the Boltzmann equation for the population ratio.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) and E is the energy difference. So the ratio is proportional to exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), assuming g2/g1 is the same in both cases, which I think it is here because we're considering the same element and transitions.

Wait, but when the star has spots, what's the temperature? The effective temperature (Teff) is given as 5500 K. But wait, the spots themselves are cooler. Are the spots at a different temperature, or does the overall Teff just go down? Hmm, the problem states that when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the overall photosphere's average temperature is lower, but I'm not sure about the temperature of the spots themselves. Oh, wait, maybe the spots are at a lower temperature, but the rest of the surface is at higher? But the problem doesn't give the spot temperature directly. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the question says that when 40% of the surface is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K when spots are present. Or maybe the spot regions are cooler (like 5000 K) and the rest is at 6000 K. But the problem states that the effective temperature of the
