Okay, so I have this question about high-energy gamma rays and their annihilation with the CMB photons. Hmm, I remember that gamma rays can interact with the CMB through pair production, creating electron-positron pairs. The question is about finding the energy at which the lifetime of these gamma rays is limited by this process.

Wait, the process is γγ → e+ e-. So, a high-energy gamma-ray photon collides with a CMB photon to produce an electron and a positron. This interaction would limit the gamma-ray's lifetime because the gamma is being annihilated. So the gamma's lifetime is determined by how often it interacts with CMB photons.

I think this is related to the concept of photon-photon cross-section and the density of the CMB. The lifetime should depend on the interaction rate. The interaction rate would be the product of the cross-section, the flux of CMB photons, and the gamma-ray's speed.

So the general idea is that the mean free time (tau) for the gamma-ray to annihilate is inversely proportional to the product of the cross-section (σ) and the photon density (n_γ). So tau = 1/(σ * n_γ * v), where v is the velocity, but since gamma rays are relativistic, v≈c, so v is a constant factor.

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. I think the mean free time τ is given by τ ≈ 1/(σ γ n_γ), where γ is the Lorentz factor. Or maybe that's the proper way to include the gamma's energy. Alternatively, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation might depend on the gamma's energy.

Wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is a function of the center-of-mass energy. The threshold energy for this process is when the invariant mass is equal to twice the electron mass, because you need at least 2m_e c² to produce the pair.

The invariant mass s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. For photons, since they're massless, E = pc. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2 )= 4 E1 E2. So the threshold is when sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c², so 4 E1 E2 = (2 m_e c²)^2 → E1 E2 = (m_e c²)^2.

But in our case, the CMB photons have energy E2 ≈ 1e-3 eV, as given. So E1 would be the gamma-ray's energy, E. So E * (1e-3 eV) = (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, m_e c² is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So (0.511e6 eV)^2 = (E * 1e-3 eV) → E = (0.511e6)^2 eV / (1e-3 eV) → E = (0.511e6)^2 / 1e-3 eV.

Calculating that: 0.511e6 is 5.11e5 eV. Squared, that's (5.11e5)^2 = about 2.61e11 eV². Divide by 1e-3 eV, gives E≈2.61e14 eV. Wait, but that's way higher than the options given. Hmm, did I do something wrong here?

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Because the problem is about the energy where the gamma's lifetime is limited by annihilation with CMB photons. So it's about the energy where the mean free time equals the age of the universe. Or maybe when the interaction rate is significant enough to limit the lifetime.

Wait, another approach: The optical depth τ is the product of the cross-section, the number density, and the path length. For the process to be significant, τ should be order 1. So τ ≈ σ * n_γ * t, where t is the age of the universe.

But wait, no, the mean free time is τ = 1/(σ * n_γ * v), so when τ is the age of the universe, T, then the probability of interaction is about 1, so the lifetime is limited.

Wait, no, the probability of interaction is P = 1 - e^{-τ}, and when τ is a few, the probability is high. So when τ ~ 1, the interaction is efficient.

So the condition would be σ * n_γ * T ≈ 1, I think. Or perhaps the mean free time τ is T ≈ 1/(σ * n_γ * v) → so when E is such that σ * n_γ * v ≈ 1/T. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, let me think about the cross-section for pair production. For γγ → e+ e-, the cross-section at high energies (E >> m_e c²) can be approximated using the 'point-like' formula. The cross-section σ ≈ (8 π α²)/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2.

Wait, but for head-on collisions, s ≈ 4 E1 E2, as I thought earlier. So σ ≈ (8 π α²) / (4 E1 E2) )= (2 π α²)/(E1 E2).

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact form. Another source I've read says that for γγ → e+ e- when E1 and E2 are much larger than m_e c², the cross-section is approximately σ ≈ (8 π α²)/(s), where s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. For two photons moving in opposite directions, s ≈ 4 E1 E2. So σ ≈ (8 π α²)/(4 E1 E2) )= (2 π α²)/( E1 E2).

But I think it's more precise to use the formula σ ≈ (8 π α²)/(s) )= (8 π α²)/(4 E1 E2) )= (2 π α²)/(E1 E2).

But I'm not entirely confident about this. Let's proceed with this approximation.

The number density of CMB photons is n_γ = (energy density)/ (average photon energy). The energy density of the CMB is about u ≈ 4e-13 erg/cm^3. Wait, another way: the CMB photon density is about n_γ ≈ 411 photons per cubic cm. Wait, that's a number I remember. But sometimes it's expressed as a critical density or using the radiation density formula.

Alternatively, the CMB's energy density is u = 4σ Stefan-Boltzmann law, but perhaps I should just use n_γ ≈ 411 cm^-3 or 411 per cubic centimeter. But wait, converting that into proper units is important.

Wait, the CMB blackbody spectrum has a temperature T ≈ 2.7 K. The number density of
