Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide. After some time, using TLC, they found that the reactant spot had diminished, and two new spots appeared. I need to determine which of the given options could be the products.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material to visualize what's going on.

The compound is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene. Let me parse that name. The main part is benzene with an oxygen attached (oxy), and the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is a butenyl group. Let me write that.

Butenyl is four carbons, but with a double bond. The numbering is such that the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait noâ€”wait, but-3-en-1-yl. So the substituent is at position 1, and the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. The butenyl group is four carbons in total, right? The substituent is at position 1, so the structure is O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me make it more accurate.

Wait, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the chain is four carbons long, starting from the point of attachment (the oxygen is attached to C1). So:

O

C1 - C2 - C3=C4

But wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3? Wait, the numbering would be such that the substituent (the oxygen is attached to C1), then C2 is next, then C3, and C4. So the double bond is between C3 and C4? But wait, but that would make it but
