Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Hmm, let me think through it. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) pion at rest decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. I remember from my studies that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, conservation laws are key. So, I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

Wait, the pion is at rest, which means the total momentum before decay is zero. That should mean that the total momentum after decay is also zero. So the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. But neutrinos are super light, right? Or wait, actually, the neutrino's mass is usually considered negligible in these kinds of problems. So maybe I can approximate its mass as zero. That would simplify things.

So, let's think about the energies. The rest mass of the pion is 139.6 MeV, and the muon is 105.7 MeV. So the total rest mass is more than the muon's, which makes sense because the pion is heavier and decays into the muon plus another particle (the neutrino, which is almost massless).

The decay equation is π+ → μ+ + ν. Since the pion is at rest, the total energy in the system before decay is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. But because the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum.

Let me denote the energies as E_mu and E_nu. But since the neutrino is massless, its energy is just the magnitude of its momentum times c squared. But since we're dealing in MeV and particles, perhaps the c factors are already accounted for, so I can think in terms of units where c=1. So E_nu = |p_nu| * c^2, but maybe I can ignore c for now.

Wait, the muon has rest mass, so its energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. So E_mu = m_mu c² + K_mu. Similarly, the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is negligible.

So, the total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu, which should equal the pion's rest energy: 139.6 MeV.

Also, the total momentum after decay is zero, so the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

But for the muon, the energy is related to its momentum and mass via E_mu² = (p_mu c)² + (m_mu c²)². Since I'm using units where c=1, this simplifies to E_mu² = p_mu² + m_mu².

Since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = p_nu. But p_nu = p_mu, because their momenta are equal in magnitude. So E_nu = p_mu.

So, let's write down the equations:

1. E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV (conservation of energy)
2. E_mu² = p_mu² + (105.7 MeV)^2 (energy-momentum relation for muon)
3. E_nu = p_mu (since neutrino is massless)

From equation 3, substitute E_nu into equation 1: E_mu + p_mu = 139.6.

And from equation 2, we have p_mu² = E_mu² - (105.7)^2.

Let me substitute p_mu from equation 3 into equation 2. Wait, no, from equation 3, p_mu = E_nu. Hmm, maybe substituting equation 3 into equation 1.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 => E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu.

But E_nu = p_mu, and from equation 2, E_mu² = p_mu² + (105.7)^2.

Substituting p_mu = E_nu and E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu into equation 2:

(139.6 - E_nu)^2 = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Let's expand the left side:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*E_nu + (E_nu)^2 = (E_nu)^2 + (105.7)^2.

Subtract (E_nu)^2 from both sides:

(139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*E_nu = (105.7)^2.

Compute 139.6^2 and 105.7^2:

139.6 squared: let's compute that. 139.6 * 139.6. Hmm, 140^2 is 19600. But since it's 139.6, it's (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16. Wait, but wait, 139.6 is 1396 * 0.1, no, wait, 139.6 is 139.6. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it as (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19600-112=19488, plus 0.16 is 19488.16.

105.7 squared: 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross terms 2 * 105 * 0.7 = 147. So 105.7^2 = (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105² + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7² = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So plugging back into the equation:

19488.16 - (2 * 139.6 * E_nu) = 11172.49.

Subtract 11172.49 from both sides:

19488.16 - 11172.49 - 279.2 E_nu = 0.

Wait, wait, no, actually:

19488.16 - 279.2 E_nu = 11172.49.

So, moving 11172.49 to the left:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = 279.2 E_nu.

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's compute step by step.

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

Subtracting 11,172 from 19,488 is 8,316. Then 0.16 - 0.49 is -0.33, so 8,316 - 0.33? Wait, perhaps better to compute as 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Alternatively, 19488.16
-11172.49
= (19488 -11172) + (0.16 - 0.49)
= 8316 + (-0.33)
= 8315.67.

So 8315.67 = 279.2 * E_nu.

So E_nu = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 29.8 = approximately 8315. (Because 279 *30 = 8370, which is a bit higher. So perhaps 29.8 would give 279.2 * 30 is 8376, subtract 0.2 *279.2 = 55.84, so 8376 - 55.84=8320.16. Hmm, but 8320.16 is a bit higher than 8315.67. So maybe around 29.8 is a bit high. Let's compute 279.2 * x=8315.67.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

Let me compute 279 *29 = 8091, 279 *0.8=223.2 → 8091 + 223.2=8314.2. Then 0.2 *29.8=5.96, so 279.2 *29.8 = 8314.2 + 5.96 = 8320.16. Hmm, but 8320.16 is higher than 8315.67 by about 4.49. So perhaps x is a little less than 29.8.

Let me compute 279.2 * (29.8 - delta) =8315.67.

We have 279.2 *29.8 =8320.16. So, 8320.16 - 279.2 *delta =8315.67 → 279.2 delta=8320.16 -8315.67=4.49 → delta=4.49/279.2 ≈0.016.

So E_nu ≈29.8 -0.016=29.784 MeV. Around 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait, that's the neutrino's energy. But the options for the neutrino's KE are in the options. Let me look back at the options.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Hmm, so the neutrino's energy is 29.8 MeV, which would imply its kinetic energy is 29.8 MeV (since its rest mass is zero). But wait, the neutrino's energy is all kinetic plus its rest mass, which is zero. So yes, E_nu is K_nu.

So the neutrino's KE is about 29.8 MeV, which matches option D.

Now, what about the muon's KE?

The muon's total energy is E_mu = 139.6 - E_nu = 139.6 -29.8=109.8 MeV.

The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. So the kinetic energy K_mu is E_mu - m_mu c² = 109.8 -105.7=4.1 MeV. So about 4.1 MeV.

Looking at the options, option D has 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. So that's a match.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me re-derive:

From earlier, after substitution, we have:

(139.6 - E_nu)^2 = E_nu^2 + (105.7)^2.

Expanding the left side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*E_nu + E_nu^2 = E_nu^2 + 105.7².

Subtract E_nu² from both sides: 139.6² - 2*139.6*E_nu =105.7^2.

So, as before, 139.6^2 is 19488.16, 105.7^2 is 11172.49.

Subtract: 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

So, 8315.67 = 2*139.6 * E_nu → 279.2 * E_nu=8315.67 → E_nu=8315.67/279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Hmm, 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8 → 29 *279.2=8096.8.

279.2 * 29.8= (29 *279.2) + (0.8 *279.2)=8096.8 + 223.36=8320.16.

But we're getting 8315.67.

So the difference between 8320.16 and 8315.67 is 4.49.

So, 279.2 * x =8315.67 → x=29.8 - (4.49/279.2) → 4.49/279.2≈0.016.

So x≈29.784 MeV.

So E_nu≈29.78 MeV, which is about 29.8 MeV as in option D.

Then E_mu =139.6 -29.78=109.82 MeV.

The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so K_mu=109.82 -105.7=4.12 MeV.

Yes, that matches option D exactly: 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in the decay of a stationary π⁺ pion into a μ⁺ muon and a neutrino (ν), we apply conservation of energy and momentum. The rest mass of the π⁺ is 139.6 MeV, and the rest mass of the μ⁺ is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino is assumed to be massless.

### Key Equations:
1. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the π⁺:  
   \[
   E_{\text{total}} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the μ⁺ and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Energy-Momentum Relation for the Muon**:  
   The energy of the μ⁺ is related to its momentum \(p_{\mu}\) and rest mass \(m_{\mu}\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu}^2 = p_{\mu}^2 + (105.7)^2.
   \]

3. **Neutrino Energy**:  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

4. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The total momentum before decay is zero, so the momenta of the μ⁺ and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]

### Solving for \(E_{\nu}\) and \(E_{\mu}\):
From momentum conservation, \(p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}\), so \(E_{\nu} = p_{\mu}\). Substituting this into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = 139.6 \implies E_{\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\nu}.
\]

Substituting \(E_{\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\nu}\) into the energy-momentum relation for the muon:  
\[
(139.6 - E_{\nu})^2 = E_{\nu}^2 + (105.7)^2.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot E_{\nu} = 105.7^2.
\]

Computing the squares:  
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49.
\]

Substituting these values:  
\[
19488.16 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot E_{\nu} = 11172.49.
\]

Rearranging:  
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot E_{\nu} = 19488.16 - 11172.49 \implies 279.2 \cdot E_{\nu} = 8315.67.
\]

Solving for \(E_{\nu}\):  
\[
E_{\nu} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The neutrino's energy is entirely kinetic since its rest mass is negligible:  
\[
K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = 29.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The total energy of the μ⁺ is:  
\[
E_{\mu} = 139.6 - E_{\nu} = 139.6 - 29.8 = 109.8 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:  
\[
K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.8 - 105.7 = 4.12 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and neutrino are **4.12 MeV** and **29.8 MeV**, respectively. This matches **Option D**.

**Answer: D**
