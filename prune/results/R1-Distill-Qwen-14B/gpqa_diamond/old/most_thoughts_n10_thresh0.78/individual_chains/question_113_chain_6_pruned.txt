Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using different spectroscopic techniques. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 is probably due to O-H stretching, which is common in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, a broad peak could also be from an alcohol, right? Because in carboxylic acids, the O-H stretch is even broader, but maybe it depends. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Hmm, the 1700 is a strong peak which makes me think of a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester. The 1650 peak is a bit lower, could that be another carbonyl group or an aromatic ring with conjugation? Or maybe an amide? Wait, but the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not amide. Alternatively, maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl, which would have lower wavenumbers.

Then looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It mentions peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like CH2=CH-. So the structure must have a double bond. That makes me think maybe an alkene is present. So combining that with the carbonyl groups, perhaps it's an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment at m/z=45. Hmm, what fragments give 45? Let's think about common fragments. For example, the CH3CO+ fragment is 45 (molecular weight of 45), which would be from an acetic acid or an ester. Another possibility is the (CH2)2O+ fragment, but that's 46. Wait, maybe it's a methyl group attached to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl group losing something. Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of a molecule like (CH3)2CO, which is 58? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. The molecular ion at 45 could be something like C3H7O, but I'm not sure. Another possibility is that the fragment could be a CH2=CH-O-R group, but I'm not certain.

Now, the options given are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O. Let me think about each one.

Option A: C6H12O2. That could be a diol, but more likely an ester or a ketone with an ether or another carbonyl. If it's an ester, like R-O-CO-R', the molecular formula would fit. For example, ethyl propionate is C5H10O2, but maybe a larger ester. Wait, C6H12O2 has a molecular formula that fits with, say, an ester where the acid part is maybe a three-carbon and the alcohol part is another three. Wait, but esters typically have one oxygen in the ester linkage. So, option A has two oxygen atoms, so maybe it's an ester plus another oxygen somewhere else, like an ether? Or perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but then it might be a lactone.

Option B: C6H10O. That's a molecular formula that would have one oxygen. Maybe a ketone with an alkene. Or perhaps an alcohol with a double bond. But the FTIR shows a broad peak, so maybe an alcohol. But wait, if it's an alcohol, the O-H would be broad, but then the carbonyl peak in FTIR could be a ketone. But the options are about the overall formula, so maybe it's something like cyclohexanol with a ketone. No, wait, cyclohexanol is C6H12O. But option B is C6H10O, which is two hydrogens less, so perhaps a double bond is present.

Option C: C6H10O2. That's two oxygen atoms. Could be an ester. For example, methyl pentanoate is C6H12O2, but wait, that's H12. So maybe option C is a different structure. Alternatively, if there's a ring, like a cyclic ester, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen. Maybe an alcohol with a ring or a ketone. But the FTIR has a broad peak which could suggest an alcohol. But then the presence of a carbonyl would have to be in the structure as well, so maybe a ketone and an alcohol.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. There are vinyl hydrogens, which are in a double bond. So the structure must have a double bond. So perhaps an allylic alcohol or an enol ether, but the options don't have enough oxygen for that.

Let me try to piece it together. The FTIR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 (probably O-H), and strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. The 1700 could be an ester (carbonyl) and the 1650 could be an aromatic ring (C=C) or conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but 1650 is a bit lower than a typical C=O stretch. Maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds. Alternatively, maybe an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So if there's a carbonyl and a double bond adjacent, the carbonyl peak would be around 1700, but the conjugated double bond (C=C) might absorb around 1650. Or perhaps the 1650 is a carbonyl group but in a different environment.

The NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond, so maybe the structure is something like an ester with an adjacent double bond. For example, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

Looking at the mass spectrum, the fragment at m/z=45. Let me think, 45 is a common fragment. It could be the loss of a CH3CO group (43) plus 2? No, wait, molecular weight of CH3CO+ is 43 (CH3CO would be 43? Let me calculate: C=12, H=1, O=16. So 12*2 + 1*3 + 16 = 24 +3 +16=43. So perhaps the fragment is 43, but the given is 45. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2
