Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Let's see what the question says.

So, two stars have the same mass, similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with mass like Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The detection is done using the RV (radial velocity) method.

The question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. I need to find how many times longer Planet #2's period is compared to Planet #1's.

Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet orbits. The shift tells us about the star's velocity towards or away from us. The formula that connects the velocity with the orbital period... Oh wait, the formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is given by K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1 / (2π)) ) * ( (P) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The RV method relies on the Doppler effect. The semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) ) but since the orbits are circular, e=0, so sqrt term is 1. Also, since M_p is much less than M_*, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*.

So, K is approximately proportional to (M_p / M_*^(2/3)) ) * (1/sqrt(1 - e²)) but since e=0, it's just K ~ M_p / M_*^(2/3) * (something) but wait, I'm mixing up the exact formula. Let me think.

The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) * sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1 / (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe I should recall the standard formula: K = ( (G * P )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (2π * (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, perhaps a simpler approach. Since both stars have the same mass (M) and both planets have the same mass (m), and the same sin i (since the problem doesn't say otherwise), the ratio of their velocities (K) would be inversely proportional to the cube root of their periods, because K is proportional to (P)^(-1/3).

Wait, let me think again. From the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) * sqrt(1 - e²) ) ] * (1/(2π * c)) * (1 / ( (M_* + M_p) )^(1/3) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let me look for a better way.

The formula for the semi-amplitude of RV is:

K = [ ( (G * (M_p) ) / (2π) )^(1/3) ] * [ (1) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) ) ] * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²)) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M
