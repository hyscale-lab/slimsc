Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I need to find the mass dimension of a coupling constant κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, and σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, so σ_{μν} is an antisymmetric combination of gamma matrices. 

I think the first thing I need to do is figure out the mass dimensions of each field involved. I recall that in four-dimensional spacetime, fields have specific mass dimensions based on their type. Let me try to remember:

- The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because ψ is a fermion and in four dimensions, spinor fields have [ψ] = 3/2.
- The electromagnetic field strength tensor F_{μν} has a mass dimension of 2. Because F is like the field tensor, which is a derivative of the vector potential, so each derivative brings a dimension of 1, and F is made from derivatives of A, which is dimensionless (since A is a gauge field). So, F would be [∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ] → dimension 1 each, so F has dimension 2.
Wait, wait, no, actually, A is a vector potential, which has mass dimension 1 in four dimensions. Because the action is dimensionless, and the term is like ∫ A ∂μ terms. So A must have dimension 1. Then F, which is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, each term is ∂ (dim 1) times A (dim 1), so F has dimension 2. That makes sense.

Now, what about σ_{μν}? It's a combination of gamma matrices. Each γ matrix is dimensionless (they are just matrices, not fields). So σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices and derivatives? Wait, no, no, σ_{μν} itself is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is a tensor of gamma matrices. So σ_{μν} doesn't involve derivatives; it's just a product of gamma matrices. So each γ is dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So the dimension of σ_{μν} is 0.

Wait, but wait. The term in the Lagrangian is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let me see: each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ would be (3/2)+(3/2) plus the dimension of σ, which is 0. So 3.

F^{μν} has dimension 2. So the whole term is 3 * 2 =5? Wait, no, wait. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 in four spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral has dimension 4 (since d^4x has dimension -4 in mass dimension terms). So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Wait, no, let me think again. The Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 because when you integrate over four dimensions, the action (integral of L) is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

Each field's dimension: ψ̄ and ψ are each 3/2. F is 2. σ is 0. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F
