Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum operators are related to spin matrices. The operator A_y is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is a 2x2 matrix. The S matrix has the first row (0 -i) and the second row (i 0). 

Wait, so A_y = c * S. And I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. Oh, right, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are fundamental in quantum mechanics because they represent possible measurable values and their corresponding states.

First, maybe I should write down the matrix for Ay. Let's see, c is h/(4π), so substituting S into Ay, the matrix becomes c times each element of S. So S is:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Multiplying each element by c, so:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, the matrix is:

[ [0, -i * h/(4π)],
  [i * h/(4π), 0] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(Ay - λI) = 0. 

The matrix Ay - λI would be:

[ [-λ, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ) ] 

Wait, calculating that, (i * -i) is ... i times -i is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term is (h/(4π))^2 * (i * -i) = (h²/(16 π²)) * (1) = h²/(16 π²). 

So the determinant equation is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

Wait, because determinant is λ² - (h²/(16 π²)) =0. So λ² = h²/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, no, wait. Let's compute it again.

Wait, no, the determinant is [(-λ)(-λ)] - [ ( -i h/(4π) ) * (i h/(4π) ) ] 

Which is λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

So (-i)(i) is -(i²) → -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - ( (h/(4π))^2 * 1 ) = 0 → λ² = (h/(4π))² → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, (h/(4π)) squared is (h²)/(16 π²). So sqrt of that is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are λ = ± h/(4π) * (i?) No, wait, no, the equation is λ² = (h²)/(16 π²), so λ = ± (h/(4π)) * (1/2) ? Wait, no, that's not right. No, wait: sqrt( (h/(4π))² ) is h/(4π). So λ is ± h/(4π) * 1. So the eigenvalues are λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2)? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me re-calculate the determinant. The (1,1) element is -λ, (1,2) is -i h/(4π), (2,1) is i h/(4π), and (2,2) is -λ.

Determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - ( (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) )

Which is λ² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Compute (-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) =1. So determinant is λ² - [1*(h/(4π))^2] = λ² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → λ² = (h²)/(16 π²) → λ = ± h/(4π) * sqrt(1) → λ = ± h/(4π) * (1/2) ? Wait, no, no, because sqrt( (h/(4π))² ) is h/(4π). So λ = ± h/(4π). Wait, that can't be right because (h/(4π))² is h²/(16 π²), so sqrt is h/(4π), so λ=± h/(4π).

Wait, wait! Let me recheck the calculation. 

The matrix is:

[ [ -λ, -i c ],
  [ i c, -λ ] ]

Where c = h/(4π). So each element is multiplied by c.

So the determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - ( (-i c) (i c) )

= λ² - ( (-i)(i) c² )

= λ² - ( (i * i) * (-1) ) * c²? Wait, wait, (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So:

λ² - (1 * c²) = 0 → λ² = c² → λ = ± c.

Since c is h/(4π), λ
