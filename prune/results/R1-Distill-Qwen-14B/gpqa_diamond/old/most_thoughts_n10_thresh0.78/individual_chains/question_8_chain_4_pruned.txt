Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about gene interactions related to disease resistance in white lupine. Hmm, let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

So, the setup is that there are three genes: G1, G2, G3. They were knocked out (g1, g2, g3) and some double mutants (g1g2, etc.) were created. The experiment tests their resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. The higher the percentage, the more resistant the plant is. The wild-type is 100%, so the mutant resistances are given as percentages of that.

The results are:
- g1: 75%
- g2: 0%
- g3: 50%
- g1g3: 10%
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0%

And the question is about the interactions among these genes. The options are A to D, each suggesting different relationships.

I remember that in genetics, the idea of epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So, gene A is epistatic over gene B if the phenotype of gene B depends on gene A.

Also, pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Another term is redundancy, where two genes can compensate for each other.

So, looking at the data. Let's list each mutant's resistance:

Wild type: 100%
g1: 75% (so less resistant than wild type)
g2: 0% (completely susceptible)
g3: 50% (reduced resistance)
Double mutants:
g1g3: 10% (very low)
g1g2: 0% (even lower than g2 alone)
g2g3: 0% (also lower than g2 alone)

Wait, so when you have g2 alone, it's 0%. So when you combine g2 with either g1 or g3, the resistance is still 0%. That suggests that the presence of the g2 mutation is masking the effect of the other mutations. That sounds like epistasis where G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3.

Because in the double mutants, the resistance is same as g2 alone. So if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, that's a possible scenario. Let me think about the wild type and the single mutants.

In the wild type, all three genes are functional. But when you knock out G2, the resistance drops to 0%, which is the lowest. That suggests that G2 is crucial for resistance. Maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance. So, if G2 is knocked out, none of the downstream genes (like G1 or G3) can be expressed, leading to no resistance.

Looking at the single mutants, g1 has 75% resistance. So, without G1, the plant is less resistant but still has some. Similarly, g3 is at 50% resistance. So, G1 and G3 each contribute to resistance but aren't as critical as G2.

Now, when you have double mutants like g1g3 (which has 10% resistance), that's worse than either single mutant. Similarly, the double mutants involving g2 (g1g2 and g2g3) have 0% resistance, same as g2 alone. That suggests that when G2 is knocked out, the other genes don't contribute anything. So, the presence of G2 is necessary for any contribution from G1 or G3. So G2 is epistatic over G1 and G3.

Wait, but what about the g1g3 double mutant? It's 10% resistance. So without G1 and G3, the plant is very susceptible but not as much as when G2 is knocked out. So, the presence of G2 might be allowing the function of G1 and G3, but in some way
