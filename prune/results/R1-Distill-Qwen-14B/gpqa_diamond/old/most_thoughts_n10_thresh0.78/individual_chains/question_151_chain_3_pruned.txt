Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's read it again. The state of the system is a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, I should probably check if that's a normalized vector. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, right? So the state is a 3x1 column vector. Let me compute the norm: (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 equals 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector isn't normalized yet. Hmm, but wait, in quantum mechanics the state vectors are supposed to be unit vectors. So maybe I need to normalize it first? Or perhaps the question is assuming it's already normalized, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, no, perhaps I remember correctly that when you have a state vector, it's supposed to be a unit vector. So I think I need to normalize it. So the actual state vector would be ( -1, 2, 1 ) divided by sqrt(6). Because the norm squared is 6, so sqrt(6) is the normalization factor. So the state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ) each component.

But wait, the problem might not require normalization because sometimes the observable's eigenvalues are calculated without worrying about the state's normalization. Hmm, no, I think normalization is necessary because probabilities depend on the state's components squared.

So moving on to the observable P. P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), the second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Wait, let me write that down correctly. So P is:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Wait, wait. So P looks like this:

0       1/sqrt(2)   0
1/sqrt(2) 0        1/sqrt(2)
0       1/sqrt(2)   0

Hmm, I think
