Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The reactant given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is also called the degree of unsaturation. It's calculated using the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = [2C + 2 - H - X + N]/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. Oh wait, but in this case, the product comes from a reaction, so I need to find out what that product is first.

The reactant is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw its structure. The cyclohexene ring has a substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO) and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH–, right? So the substituents are CHO at 2 and CH2CH2? No, wait, cyclohexene ring: positions 2 and 5. So the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene), meaning the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4.

So, substituents: at carbon 2, a formyl group (CHO), and at carbon 5, a vinyl group (CH2=CH– attached). So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with a formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and a carboxylic acid group elsewhere?

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The numbering starts such that the carboxylic acid is in a specific position. Wait, cyclohex-3-ene means the double bond is between C3 and C4. The
