Okay, so I've got this question about calculating non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let me read the question again. The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi)*exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

The non-Gaussianity (nG) is calculated using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state and rho is the density matrix of our non-Gaussian state.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about what exactly constitutes a Gaussian state here. I remember that Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. For a single mode, coherent states |alpha> are Gaussian, and so are squeezed states. So, in this case, the reference Gaussian state tau would be something like a coherent state or perhaps a combination of them?

But wait, the non-Gaussian state here is a superposition of two coherent states. So the state |psi> is a cat state. The density matrix rho would be the outer product of |psi> with itself, right? So rho is |psi><psi|. 

But to compute del_b, I need to find the relative entropy between rho and tau, where tau is a Gaussian state. The relative entropy is also known as the Kullback-Leibler divergence, which measures how different rho is from tau.

Hmm, but calculating the relative entropy requires knowing both rho and tau's density matrices. Let me try to write down rho first.

The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, with coefficients cos(phi) and sin(phi), respectively. So |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. The normalization constant N is given, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)).

So first, let's compute N. Given phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

Sin(2phi) = sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1. So sin(2phi) is -1. Then, exp(-2 alpha²) is exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627. Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because 1 + (-1)*0.6065 is 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935, so N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

But let me think about this: when alpha is 0.5 and phi is -pi/4, does N make sense? Because sometimes you might have N squared as 1 + something else. Oh wait, the given N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). So that's correct.

Now, the state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Let's compute the coefficients. phi is -pi/4. So cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So the state becomes (0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5>)/0.627. So the coefficients are each approximately 0.7071/0.627 ≈ 1.127.

Wait, but that's interesting because the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. So it's a cat state, which is known to be highly non-Gaussian.

Now, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. So it's a pure state. The von Neumann entropy S(rho) would be zero since it's a pure state. But wait, in the formula for del_b, it's trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Since rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b would be - trace(tau ln tau).

Wait no, that can't be right. Because if rho is pure, then S(rho) is zero, and S(tau) is the entropy of the Gaussian state. So del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - S(tau) = -S(tau). But wait, the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho | tau), but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Wait, no. The relative entropy del_b is given as trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). But since rho is pure, trace(rho ln rho) is zero. So del_b would be 0 - trace(tau ln tau). But that would make del_b negative. But relative entropy is usually non-negative, so I must have misunderstood the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But the problem states that del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that would be S(rho) - S(tau). But if tau is a Gaussian state, which is mixed, then S(tau) is positive. So if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero, so del_b would be - S(tau), which is negative. But relative entropy is not supposed to be negative. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it differently. The formula presented is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that's S(rho) - S(tau), the difference between the entropy of rho and tau. But for rho being pure, S(rho) is zero. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). That would make del_b negative, which might not make
