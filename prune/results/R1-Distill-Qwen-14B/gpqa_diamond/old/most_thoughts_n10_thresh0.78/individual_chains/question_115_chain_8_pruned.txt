Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating into two photons. Hmm, I remember that when matter and antimatter particles annihilate, they produce photons. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact details.

Alright, let's read the problem again. An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors. Lorentz factor gamma is the factor by which time, length, and mass change for an object in motion relative to an observer. Gamma is greater than or equal to 1. So, the electron has gamma_e =4 and the positron gamma_p=2.

I think the key here is conservation laws. Since the system is closed (electron and positron), their total momentum and energy should be conserved. But wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, when the electron and positron annihilate, they produce two photons. These photons must carry away energy and momentum. Since the two photons have the same energy, that suggests that their momenta might be symmetrical in some way.

Let me outline what I remember about annihilation. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. But when they annihilate, the total energy should be the sum of their relativistic energies. Wait, but Lorentz factors are given, so I need to calculate the total energy and momentum before annihilation to use conservation.

So, first, let's compute the energies and momenta of the electron and positron before collision.

Each particle's energy is gamma * m*cÂ². The mass m is the same for both, the electron and
