Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about the decay of a boson X. The Lagrangian interaction term is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV. The question is asking which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Hmm, I remember that when a particle decays, the energy involved must be sufficient to produce the decay products. So, the mass of the boson X must be at least twice the mass of the lightest possible particles it can decay into. Because particles like fermions come in pairs (like matter and antimatter), so each decay would produce a pair.

Wait, the Lagrangian is L = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh, wait, maybe I misread that. Let's look again. Oh, I think it's written as: -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps it's more like L = - λ f [ ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y) ]? Or maybe it's L = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y) multiplied by something else? Hmm, perhaps the λ is a coupling constant, and the term is something like Yukawa coupling, which couples a scalar (X) to fermions.

In any case, the important thing is that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Because in the interaction term, X is interacting with fermions, so X can decay into any fermion pair that's allowed by the process.

But wait, X is a boson, so when it decays, it's going to produce two particles, right? Because in the interaction, X is coupled to two fermions. So each decay would be X → f f̄, where f is a fermion.

So the decay products are a fermion and its antiparticle. Now, for each possible fermion, the X must have enough mass to create that pair.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the sum of the masses of the decay products must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Since each fermion and antifermion pair take 2m_f, where m_f is the mass of the fermion.

Wait, but for fermions, their masses are much lower compared to 6 GeV. Let's think about the masses of various fermions.

Electron mass: about 0.0005 GeV. So 2m_e is negligible. Similarly, muon is around 0.1 GeV, tau around 1.78 GeV. Then the quarks: up and down are around 2-5 MeV, so their masses are negligible. Strange quark is around 95-100 MeV, so 2m_s is about 0.19 GeV. Then the charm quark is about 1.2-1.5 GeV, so 2m_c is about 2.4-3 GeV. Bottom quark is about 4.1-4.7 GeV, so 2m_b is about 8.2-9.4 GeV. That's higher than 6 GeV.

Wait, so let's calculate 2m for each possible fermion:
