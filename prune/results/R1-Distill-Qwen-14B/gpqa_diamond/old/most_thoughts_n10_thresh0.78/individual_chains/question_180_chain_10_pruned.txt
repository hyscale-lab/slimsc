Okay, so I have this physics problem in front of me about electric potential energy in an isolated system. Hmm, let me try to unpack what it's asking.

Alright, the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, which is twice the elementary charge. The masses are negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that for the particles.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other twelve are each 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system, correct to three decimals. Oh wait, I remember that the potential energy of a system of charges depends on their configuration. Since we're talking about an isolated system, the total energy would be the electric potential energy.

Wait, but what's the formula again for the potential energy between point charges? Oh right, the formula for the electric potential energy U between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But when you have multiple charges, you consider all pairs.

So, the system has 13 charges: one at P and twelve at 2m from P. But wait, each of the twelve is 2m away from P, the point where the 13th charge is. So, each of the twelve is a distance 2m from P, but what about the distance between the twelve charges themselves? The problem says the twelve are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but their arrangement relative to each other isn't specified. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Wait, maybe they're all at the same point 2m away from P, but that would mean they're all on the surface of a sphere around P with radius 2m. But if they're all at the same distance from P, then each of them is a distance of 2m from P, but their distances from each other would vary depending on how they're arranged. I'm not sure how that affects the potential energy.

Wait, but the problem says that the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 1
