Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, let's see. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Wait, rhombohedral... I think it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are the same length but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. Oh right, and in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

So the given data is interatomic distance of 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance... Oh, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. In a crystal, the interatomic distance refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So like, for a cubic system, it's the edge length a. But rhombohedral is more general. So I think the interatomic distance here is the lattice parameter 'a' for this crystal. So a = 10 Angstrom.

Now, the formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of (h² + k² + l²) times the lattice parameters, but adjusted for the angles. Oh right, it's the general formula for any crystal system.

The formula is:

1/(d_hkl)^2 = (h^2 (1/a^2) (cos^2 beta - cos alpha cos gamma)/sin^2 alpha) ) + ... wait, maybe it's getting complicated. Alternatively, I remember that for a rhombohedral system, since all angles are the same (alpha = beta = gamma), the formula simplifies.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) )

But wait, no, I think that's for a general hexagonal system. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral crystal can be written using the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, perhaps I should start by recalling that the interplanar distance formula is derived from the structure factor, but maybe that's too detailed. Alternatively, I remember that the
