Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions like gold nuclei, but in this case, the nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So lithium-6 maybe, since it has 3 neutrons (since Li has atomic number 3, so 3 protons, and 3 neutrons gives Li-6). 

So, the nucleus is moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. I need to find the energy of the collider. I think this is a relativistic energy problem. Right, because when speeds are a significant fraction of c, you can't just use classical mechanics; you need relativity.

The energy in relativity is given by the total energy formula, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. So E = gamma * m0 * c². But wait, what's the rest mass energy here? It's the rest mass of the nucleus X, which is lithium-6. So I'll need the mass of Li-6.

But wait, how do I find the mass of Li-6? I think the mass number A is 6. The atomic mass unit (u) is about 1.66e-27 kg. So the rest mass energy is m0c² = A u c², but wait, no. Actually, the rest mass of the nucleus is approximately A times the mass of a nucleon. Each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So maybe I should calculate the mass of Li-6 in terms of MeV/c².

Wait, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So 6 nucleons in total. Each has about 938 MeV, so total rest mass energy is 6 * 938 MeV = let's see, 6 * 900 is 5400, 6 *38 is 228, so 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. Hmm, but wait, I think that's an approximation.
