Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about naming a benzene ring with several substituents. I'm a bit rusty on IUPAC nomenclature, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. Also, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. Additionally, both the methoxy and the hydroxyl are ortho to the nitrile group. Hmm, that's a lot to unpack.

First, I need to draw this structure to visualize it better. Let's imagine the benzene ring. The carboxylic acid (let's call it COOH) is at a certain position. All three substituents (COOH, formyl, cyano) are meta to each other. So they are at positions that are separated by one carbon each. Wait, in benzene, meta positions are two carbons apart. Like 1,3,5 positions are all meta to each other? No, wait, wait, that's for three substituents. So if the main group is COOH, the formyl and cyano would be at meta positions relative to each other as well.

Wait, let me clarify. For a benzene ring, substituents that are meta to each other are separated by two carbons, meaning they are 1,3 positions. But here, all three substituents (COOH, formyl, cyano) are meta to one another. So, perhaps the carboxylic acid is in position 1, the formyl in 3, and cyano in 5? Or another arrangement.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the substituents are all meta to each other. So each substituent is meta to the others. Wait, that's not possible for three substituents on a benzene ring. Because each substituent can't be meta to two others unless the ring
