Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, transit probability, right? I remember that the transit method relies on a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. But the probability of that happening depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orbital distance.

Wait, the question says both planets have the same mass. So their masses are equal. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a period three times shorter than Planet_2. Oh, but orbital period relates to the distance. I think Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula is P² ∝ (a³)/(M_star), where M_star is the mass of the star.

Wait, but for the transit probability, I think the formula is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance (a) to the sum of the star's radius and the planet's radius, all squared. So the probability is (R_star + R_planet)² / (a² (1 + (M_planet/M_star)^{1/3}) ) or something like that. No, wait, maybe more accurately, the probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2. Because the transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to us. The probability is higher if the planet is closer to the star and the star is larger, because then the area the planet covers from our view is larger relative to the star.

Wait, but the probability of transit for a randomly oriented orbit is given by the formula:

P = (R_star + R_planet)/(a) * (something else). Oh wait, maybe it's P = (R_star / a)² multiplied by some factor based on the inclination. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The probability that the planet transits is approximately the ratio of the size of the star plus planet (but planet is small, so R_star) divided by the distance, but squared. Because the area is π(R_star)^2, and the area of the sky where the planet would block the star is a circle of radius a, so the area is π a². So the probability is (R_star)/(a) squared, times some factor? Or is it just (R_star)/(a) squared because it's the ratio of areas? Or is it (R_star + R_planet) over a. Since the planet is much smaller than the star, R_planet is negligible, so it's R_star / a.

Wait, no, another way: the transit probability is proportional to (R_star / a)^2 multiplied by (1/(1 + (M_planet/M_star)^(1/3)) )? No, wait, that's for the Doppler method maybe.

Alternatively, the transit probability formula is P = (R_star + R_p) / (a) * (something else). Or maybe it's (R_star + R_p) / a, but considering the star's size and the planet's orbital distance. But wait, I'm not getting this right. Let me look it up in my notes. Oh no, wait, I can't look it up; I have to think.

Wait, from what I remember, the transit probability is highest when the planet is closer to the star because the chance of the orbit being edge-on increases. But wait, the actual formula for the probability of a transit is (R_star + R_planet)/(a), but considering the inclination. Wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The probability is actually calculated based on the likelihood that the
