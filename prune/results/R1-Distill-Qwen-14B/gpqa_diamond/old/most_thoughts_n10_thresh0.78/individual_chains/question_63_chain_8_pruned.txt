Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, let me read the question again. The molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, which I remember combines both rotational and vibrational energy states. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So when a photon is absorbed, the molecule goes to the next higher state.

The question asks for the momentum of the absorbed photon. Photons have energy, E = hf, where f is the frequency. But momentum p is related to energy and frequency too because p = E/c, where c is the speed of light.

So the steps probably involve finding the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state, then using that to find the photon's momentum.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is the state with the lowest energy, which is the ground state. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state. So I think that's the first step: determine what the energy levels are for this model.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are quantized. But the non-rigid rotor (vibration included) probably has energy levels that combine both vibrational and rotational contributions. Oh right, the rotation-vibration coupling can lead to more complex energy levels.

But wait, for a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are given by the combination of vibrational and rotational energies. The fundamental vibrational state is the ground state, n=0. But when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either increase its vibrational state (n increases) or its rotational state (l increases). But the question is about the lowest possible energy increase. So the next state would be the state with the lowest energy, which might be a change in either rotation or vibration.

Wait, but the fundamental state in the rotation-vibration model is the state with the lowest possible energy, which is n=0 (vibrational ground state) and l=0 (rotational ground state). The next state with the lowest energy would be the next available state, which could be either the first vibrational excited state (n=1) or the first rotational excited state (l
