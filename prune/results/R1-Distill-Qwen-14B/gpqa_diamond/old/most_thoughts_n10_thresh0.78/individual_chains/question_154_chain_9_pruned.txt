Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the unknown compound is based on the spectral data provided. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100% that peak. There's also a peak at 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, that might suggest a possible isotope or maybe some kind of fragment. But wait, the molecular weight is 156, so I can calculate the possible formula. Let's see, 156 divided by 12 (for carbon) is about 13, so maybe it's something like C9HClO2 or something similar. Wait, let me think: 156 g/mol. Let me check possible formulas. If the molecular formula is C9HClO2, then the molar mass would be (12*9) + (1* H) + (35.5 for Cl) + (16*2) = 108 + 1 +35.5 +32 = 176.5. Wait, that's higher than 156. Maybe I got the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's C8HClO3? Let's calculate: 12*8 =96, 1=1, 35.5, 16*3=48. 96+1+35.5=132.5, plus 48 is 180.5. No, that's too high. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2? Let me calculate that. 7*12=84, 5*1=5, 35.5, 2*16=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Close enough, considering possible rounding. So the formula is C7H5ClO2? Or maybe another arrangement.

Next, the IR data. There's a broad peak between 3500 and 2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretch. But wait, if it's broad and strong, it might be a carboxylic acid, because their O-H stretches are usually broad and strong. Alternatively, an alcohol's O-H would also be broad, but maybe less strong? Or maybe another group. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is typical for a carbonyl group in a carboxylic acid, maybe around 1700-1720. Or esters or ketones? Wait, esters are usually a bit higher, like 1730-1750. Carboxylic acids are lower, like 1700-1725. So that fits.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H) that's probably an -OH proton, but for a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. Wait, but in the NMR, it's a singlet, which might suggest it's not exchanging quickly, or maybe it's not a broad peak because of fast exchange? Or perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen? No, that's the OH. So maybe that's the acidic proton.

Then, 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). These are probably aromatic protons. So the two doublets suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, you have two sets of doublets, each integrating for two protons, with coupling between the two sets. So the aromatic ring has two substituents in the para positions.

Wait, but the molecular formula I calculated is C7H5ClO2. Let me see: 7 carbons. One of them is the aromatic ring; so substituents on the ring would account for some of the carbons. Let me think about the possible structures.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6ClO2? Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's 4-chloro, then the formula becomes C7H5ClO2, which matches our calculated formula.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. That
