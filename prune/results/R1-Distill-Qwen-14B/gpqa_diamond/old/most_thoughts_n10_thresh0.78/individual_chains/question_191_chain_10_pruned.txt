Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The starting compound is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, let me visualize that. So the cyclohexanone ring has a ketone group at position 1. Then, at position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (that's a CH2OH, right?), and at position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond? Wait no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2- attached through the second carbon, so it's an isopropenyl group. Oh wait, no, wait. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, so it's CH2=CHCH2- but attached at the second carbon. Wait, maybe I should draw it. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. The hydroxymethyl is at 3, and the prop-1-en-2-yl is at 5. So structure-wise, the cyclohexanone has these substituents.

Then, the first reaction is treatment with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base, often used for deprotonating things. Benzyl bromide is an alkylating agent. So I think this is an alkylation reaction. Where would the deprotonation happen?

Looking at the starting molecule, there's a hydroxymethyl group at position 3. The OH there is acidic because it's next to a ketone (the cyclohexanone). So maybe the NaH abstracts that proton, turning the OH into an O- which is a good nucleophile. Then, benzyl bromide (which is an alkyl halide) would attack. So the O- would attack the benzyl bromide, substituting the bromide. That would form a benzyl ether. So the OH group becomes O-benzyl.

Wait, but how does that substitution work? The O- attacks the benzyl bromide, which is an SN2 reaction. So the product after this step (product 1) would have a benzyl group attached where the OH was. So the hydroxymethyl (CH2OH) becomes CH2O-Bn (where Bn is the benzyl group). So the structure now has a benzyl ether at position 3.

Let me think, the starting material: 3-(CH2OH) and 5-(CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2? No, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the cyclohexane at position 5. So that substituent is an allyl group. I'm not sure if that's relevant in the first step, but in the first step, we're just substituting the OH.

So product 1 is 3-(benzyloxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Or wait, more accurately, the hydroxymethyl becomes O-benzyl. So it's CH2-O-Bn at position 3. So the structure is 3-CH2-O-Bn, 5-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond.

Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 1 and 2. So actually, it's CH2=CHCH2- attached to the ring at carbon 5? Or is the substituent
