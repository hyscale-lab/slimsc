Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond with the movement of pi bonds. Cope and Claisen are examples, right? And these reactions usually happen under thermal conditions, making them thermodynamically controlled.

The question has three parts: reactions leading to products A, B, and C. I need to figure out each of them and match with the options given.

Let's start with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Wait, H+ and heat usually mean acid catalysis and maybe some kind of rearrangement. But the starting materials are ethanamine and an allylic alcohol. Hmm, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like N,N-dimethoxyethanamine? So structure is CH2(OCH3)2-NH2? Wait no, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? No, wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe (CH2OCH3)2NH? Wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's N,N-dimethyl-ethanamine with methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. Hmm, perhaps that's the structure.

But when it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol, which is CH2CH2C(OH)CH2? Or wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. But-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C2 and C3. So structure is CH2CH2(OH)CH2CH3. Wait, no. Let me draw it correctly. But-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3
