Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's temperature and the planet's distance. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

So, the star's properties are given: mass 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, and radii 1.7 and 1.3 Earth radii respectively. They both have the same albedo, which is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect, but since it's the same for both, maybe it cancels out in the ratio.

The problem mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. The transit method measures the dip in the star's brightness when a planet passes in front. The RV method looks for Doppler shifts in the star's spectrum due to the planet's gravitational pull. But wait, the question is about equilibrium temperature, so maybe the RV data isn't directly relevant beyond giving us the mass of the planets. Or does it help us find the orbital periods or distances?

Wait, the question says that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å, and Planet2 causes a 0.04 Å shift. Oh, right, the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV method measures the star's velocity change, which is related to the planet's mass and the size of the orbit (distance from the star). But how do I get the distance from the RV shift?

The formula for the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity (K) is something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^0.5 * (1 - e²)^0.5) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) ), but wait, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a formula that relates the Doppler shift to the velocity, which is K = λ * (v / c), where λ is the wavelength,
