Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars are detectable. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of the listed stars meet the S/N ratio requirement of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I should probably remember what ESPRESSO is capable of. I think it's a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which is at the Paranal Observatory. Oh right, ESPRESSO can achieve a very high signal-to-noise ratio, but I'm not exactly sure about the specifics.

The question lists six stars (a to f), and I need to determine which ones are detectable based on their properties. Let's go through each option.

Star a) Canopus. I recall that Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky. It's a very nearby star too, isn't it? Wait, Canopus has an apparent magnitude around -0.7, so it's quite bright. Since it's bright, I think the S/N would be way higher than 10. So this star should definitely be detectable.

Star b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, also quite bright. Its apparent magnitude is about 1.97. That's a bit dimmer than Canopus but still quite bright. Again, I think the S/N would be more than 10. So Polaris is detectable.

Star c) Absolute V magnitude 15 mag, located at 10 pc. Wait, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude here. The formula I remember is m = M + 5 + 5 log d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So for d=10 pc, log(10) is 1. So m = 15 + 5 + 5*1 = 15 + 10 = 25? Oh wait, wait. Wait, that formula is m = M + 5 log d - 5, right? No, wait no, the correct formula is m = M + 5*(log10(d) ) -5. So for d=10, log10(10) is 1. So m = 15 +5*1 -5 = 15 +5-5=15. So m=15. But that's pretty faint. Can ESPRESSO detect a star that's magnitude 15 in one hour?

Wait, what's the typical S/N for ESPRESSO? I think that ESPRESSO is designed to reach high S/N for bright stars, but for very faint stars, maybe it doesn't. I remember that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N ratios of about 100 or more per hour for bright stars, but for fainter ones, it's lower. So a star at m=15, how does that translate?

I think that the S/N per pixel depends on the star's brightness and the exposure time. The formula I vaguely remember is something like S/N ≈ sqrt(N) * (flux), where N is the number of photons detected. Alternatively, there's an equation that relates the S/N to the magnitude. I think the formula is S/N ≈ 5.6 * sqrt(N) * 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) ), where m0 is a reference magnitude. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The exposure time is fixed at 1 hour. The signal is the number of photons received. The noise is sqrt(signal). So S/N is sqrt(signal). So to have S/N >=10, signal should be >=100 photons.

But wait, that's per binned pixel. Hmm. I think each pixel in ESPRESSO is something like 1.2Å wide, but when binned, maybe they sum up more pixels to increase the S/N. Oh wait, the question says "per binned pixel". So each binned pixel is a certain area on the detector.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO. From what I recall, ESPRESSO can reach down to about V=20 or so, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, maybe that's for certain exposure times. Let me think.

Wait, another approach. Let's find the S/N per exposure for each star and see if it's >=10. The key is to know the S/N as a function of magnitude. I think for ESPRESSO, the S/N per 1 hour exposure for a star of magnitude m is approximately S/N = 5.6 * 10^(-0.4*(m - m0)), where m0 is a certain base magnitude. But wait, I think m0 is around 10 for ESPRESSO, as that's the typical magnitude where S/N is 10 per pixel.

Wait, maybe I remember that at m=15,
