Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reaction mechanisms always make me a little shaky. But I'm determined to figure this out step by step.

Alright, let's start by looking at the problem. The question involves several compounds: A, B, C, and D. The goal is to identify compound D from the options given.

First, let's parse what's happening in each step.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of peaks and their integration can tell us a lot about the structure. 

A triplet for 6H at 0.9 ppm suggests that these protons are probably in a CH2CH3 group, maybe adjacent to another CH2 group. Wait, wait, because a triplet arises from coupling with two neighboring protons. So if it's 6H, that might be two CH3 groups attached to a CH2. Because each CH3 has 3H, so two CH3 would be 6H. And the splitting would come from the adjacent CH2, which has two protons. So each CH3 is next to a CH2, which is next to another CH3. So like a (CH2CH3)2CH2 structure? Or perhaps a diethyl group? Wait, wait, diethyl would be two CH2CH3 groups attached to something else.

Wait, but the other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet means each proton is split into four, which typically comes from coupling with three neighboring protons. So that suggests maybe a CH2 group next to a CH3 group. Because each H in a CH2 next to a CH3 (which has three H) would give a quartet. And 4H would be two CH2 groups, each with two H. So maybe the structure is something like CH2CH2CH3, but wait, that's not possible. Maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to two CH3 groups? Or perhaps it's a central CH2 connected to two other CH2 groups. 

Putting this together, let's think about the possible structure for compound A. The two signals indicate two different types of protons. The quartet (4H) suggests maybe a CH2 connected to another CH2 and a CH3. Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 group adjacent to a CH(CH3)2 or something like that. 

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H) could be two isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups have (CH3)2CH, but then the protons on the CH3 would be split into a septet if adjacent to a CH2, but wait, in our case, the triplet suggests each CH3 is next to a CH2 with two protons. Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ether? No, but that's an ether, and the structure would be CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The ethyl groups would each have their own triplet. But wait, in that case, the splitting might be different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is a 3-p
