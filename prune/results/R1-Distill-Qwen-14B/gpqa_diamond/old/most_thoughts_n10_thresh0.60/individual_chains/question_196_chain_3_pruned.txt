Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed when the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is relativistic, so things are a bit different.

The problem says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, so that's Hooke's law. We need the maximum speed v_max. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one.

Wait, in the classical case, the maximum speed is when all the potential energy is converted to kinetic. The potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA². Kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². So solving for v, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But that's the non-relativistic case.

But this question is relativistic. So I need to consider relativistic effects. In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy is gamma times mc². The total energy should be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but in this case, the oscillator's energy comes from the spring, so maybe the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic?

Wait, actually, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but when the particle moves at high speeds, the kinetic energy isn't just (gamma - 1)mc². Wait, but for a spring, maximum potential is
