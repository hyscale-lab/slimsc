Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question says.

The compound given is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, wait, maybe I should write that structure out. Oh, wait, benzene rings... 1-bromo would be on one carbon, and another substituent on the adjacent carbon. Wait, wait, the "-d" partâ€”wait, is that a typo? Because benzene-2-d doesn't make sense. Oh wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-diethylbenzene? Or wait, maybe the "d" stands for deuterium? Or is it a typo for something else, like diethyl or dimethyl?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, but wait, the question says 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Hmm, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene? That would mean one hydrogen replaced by deuterium on the adjacent carbon. But then, how does that affect the reaction?

Wait, the reaction conditions are NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. It's commonly used for elimination or as a base in aromatic substitution reactions, like in the formation of aromatic rings via elimination or in elimination to form alkenes.

Wait, but in aromatic substitution reactions, like when you have a benzene ring with a
