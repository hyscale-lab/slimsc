Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases was formed. These gases were passed through several tubes.

The first tube, number 1, is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight of this tube increased by 3.60 grams. The second tube, number 2, contains Ca(OH)2 solution, and its weight didn't change. The third tube has red-hot copper, and its weight increased by 0.80 grams, forming CuO. After that, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let's try to break this down.

First, let's think about the setup. When the salts are heated, they decompose into gases. The gases pass through the tubes, which react with certain components. 

The first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong dehydrating agent and can react with water vapor. So, if the gases have any water vapor, it will be absorbed here. The increase in weight (3.60g) suggests that Mg(ClO4)2 absorbed some water. But wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous and reacts with water. So maybe the gas mixture had water vapor. Mg(ClO4)2 would react with water: Mg(ClO4)2 + H2O → Mg(ClO4)2·H2O or something like that. But the exact reaction might not be necessary right now.

The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. If the incoming gas had CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But the weight of this tube didn't change. So that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gases, or that any CO2 was not absorbed. Wait, but Ca(OH)2 solution would definitely absorb CO2. So if the weight didn't change, perhaps there was no CO2 in the gas mixture. Alternatively, maybe all the CO2 was already captured in the first tube? Hmm, but I don't think Mg(ClO4)2 would react with CO2. Alternatively, maybe the CO2 came after the tube, but the problem says the gas passed successively through the first tube, then the second, etc. So if the second tube didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas that passed through it. So perhaps the gas mixture didn't contain CO2.

Then, the third tube is red-hot copper. The gas passes through here, and the weight increases by 0.80g, forming CuO. So what reacts with copper upon heating? Well, water vapor could do that, but wait, when water vapor
