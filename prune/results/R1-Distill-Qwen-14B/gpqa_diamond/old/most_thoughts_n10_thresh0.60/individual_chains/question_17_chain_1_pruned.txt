Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, the question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my EDTA chemistry. I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? It binds metal ions. So when you have a Ca-EDTA complex, it's like a 1:1 ratio, because Ca²+ is a divalent metal and EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so the formula is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA.

Stoichiometric here means that the concentration is such that all the Ca²+ is bound by EDTA, right? So the solution is 0.02 M of the CaY²− complex.

But wait, the question is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions. Oh right, because in solution, some of the CaY²− might dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA.

But wait, if the solution is at stoichiometric ratio, does that mean all the Ca²+ is complexed? Or maybe that the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA are in a 1:1 ratio? Hmm. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the formation constant will come into play here.

Formation constant, K, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So
