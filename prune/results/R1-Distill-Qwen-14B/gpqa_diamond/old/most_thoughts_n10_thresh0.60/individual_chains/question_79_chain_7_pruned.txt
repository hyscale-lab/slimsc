Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction product's NMR spectra. The compound X has the formula C11H12O. The reaction conditions involve 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in epoxide ring-opening reactions, maybe under certain conditions. But wait, sometimes it's used for other purposes, like in some elimination reactions... Or wait, no, maybe it's more about epoxide ring opening via acid catalysis. Wait, but 403 K is quite a high temperature, so perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Wait, but I think that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a base, so maybe it's acting as a base in an elimination reaction? Or perhaps it's used in some other way. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide. Or maybe it's a different type of reaction.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. So perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide. Because if that's the case, the product would have certain features. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide under basic conditions, but I'm not exactly sure.

But the main task is to look at the NMR data of the product and figure out what the starting compound X was, given the options.

Let me look at the product's NMR data.

First, the 1H NMR:

Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

So there are two singlets for 3H each. Maybe these are methyl groups attached to something that's not splitting, like adjacent to an electronegative group or in a symmetric environment. For example, maybe
