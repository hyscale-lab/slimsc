Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 0.01 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. I need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato would mean the complex has two SCN- ligands, right? So that would be Co(SCN)_2^2+ maybe. But I'm not exactly sure about the charge, but I think the key is the number of ligands.

So the question is about the distribution of different Co complexes in solution. The stability constants tell us about the tendency of Co to form complexes with SCN-. Higher β means more stable complex.

The complexes would be: Co^2+ (uncomplexed), Co(SCN)^+, Co(SCN)_2^0 (maybe?), Co(SCN)_3^- something, and Co(SCN)_4^2- perhaps. Wait, but I'm not sure about the charges. But I think the general idea is that each β represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- ligands.

The stability constants are given as β1, β2, β3, β4. So β1 is for the first complex (monosubstituted?), β2 for the second, etc. Wait, no, more accurately, the stability constant βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

Wait, the formation of each successive complex can be thought of as adding another SCN- to the previous complex. So the overall formation would be stepwise. But for the purpose of calculating the distribution, I think we might need to model the fraction of each species.

But wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formation constants to find the fraction of each complex, considering all possible complexes. Since the solution has a lot of SCN- (0.1 M) compared to Co (0.01 M), but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

The problem is to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think
