Okay, I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it carefully and think it through step by step.

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells, and they're looking at their developmental fate using a bicistronic vector. The experiment involves creating a transgenic mouse model and then using Cre recombinase to see expression.

First, the setup: The vector is bicistronic, which means it has two ORFs (open reading frames) in one transcript. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element. Between the ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.

Wait, what does that mean? So, the vector is designed so that each gene (ligand and receptor) can be conditionally expressed. The stop cassettes prevent expression unless Cre is present to excise them. I think loxP and lox2272 are different recombinase recognition sites. Oh right, Cre recognizes loxP sites, but lox2272 is a variant that is only recognized by Cre when in a certain configuration. Wait, no, actually, I think lox2272 is a mutant version that Cre can only recombine with loxP in a specific way. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, the ligand is first, followed by a stop cassette with loxP, then the receptor with IRES, and another stop cassette with lox2272, and then eGFP. Or wait, the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry, but with a stop in a loxP cassette. So without Cre, the ligand ORF is blocked because of the stop, but when Cre is present, it will excise the stop, allowing ligand expression. Similarly, for the receptor, the stop is in lox2272 cassette, so Cre would need to act on that as well.

Wait, but the question says the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, I think the idea is that Cre will excise certain lox sites to allow expression of each ORF. So, in the absence of Cre, both ligand and receptor are under stop cassettes. When Cre is introduced, it will excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but in the question, they use SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably expressed in neural crest derivatives, like in the cells of interest here.

But the result is that when they look under the confocal, there's no green signal. eG
