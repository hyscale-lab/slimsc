Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is asking me to determine the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given as A to D, and I need to pick the right one. 

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider whether they neutralize each other. Acids donate H+ ions, and bases donate OH- ions. The reaction between them produces water and possibly some salt. But wait, in this case, there are multiple acids and a base. So maybe I should first figure out the moles of each acid and base, see if they neutralize each other, and then find out what's left in the solution. That leftover will determine the pH.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each component. Moles are calculated as Molarity × Volume (in liters).

1. For CH3COOH (which is acetic acid, a weak acid): 
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL. Convert mL to liters by dividing by 1000. So 500 mL is 0.5 liters. 
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. For HCl (a strong acid):
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume 400 mL → 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

3. For Ba(OH)2 (a strong base, since Ba and OH are ions):
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL → 0.3 L.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH^-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 are 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the total H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, contributing 0.08 moles of H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't fully dissociate, but for the purpose of neutralization, I can consider the moles of H+ it can provide. So together, H+ is 0.05 (from CH3COOH) + 0.08 (from HCl) = 0.13 moles. Wait, no, wait. Actually, CH3COOH
