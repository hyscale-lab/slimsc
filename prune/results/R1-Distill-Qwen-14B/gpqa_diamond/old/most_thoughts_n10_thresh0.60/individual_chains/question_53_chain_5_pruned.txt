Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem states that we've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester group absorption, which makes me think there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups have a carbonyl (C=O) which typically shows up around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ in IR. So that's confirmed.

Looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substitution pattern could be ortho, meta, or para. But wait, the ring is 6-membered, so likely a benzene ring with two substituents. Di-substituted benzene usually has certain splitting patterns.

   For a para-substituted benzene, the two aromatic Hs would be equivalent, giving a singlet or maybe a doublet, but in a di-substituted, it depends on substituents. Wait, but the question says two signals. So maybe the substituents are causing different environments. Hmm, perhaps the substituents are such that the ring isn't symmetrical. Like one substituent is an ester and the other is something else. Or maybe the substituents are in the para positions but different groups, leading to different Hs. Wait, but if it's di-substituted with two identical groups, the aromatic protons would be equivalent. Oh, but if it's two different groups, then the aromatic Hs would be in different environments. So the two aromatic signals could be from two different types of aromatic Hs. Alternatively, maybe it's not a benzene ring? No, wait, the question says a 6-membered aromatic ring, which is probably benzene.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and another is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically in alkenes. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets implies coupling with two sets of neighboring protons. Maybe the vinyl group is part of an ester group? Or perhaps it's a substituent attached to the ring.

3. Two signals for –CH3 groups. Since there are two signals, but same type (methyl), why two signals? Perhaps they're in different environments. So maybe there are two different methyl groups attached somewhere.

Wait, the question says there are no signals for –CH2 groups. That's important because if any CH2 groups were present, their signals would appear. So the structure must not have any methylene groups (CH2) but has methyl (CH3) groups.

So putting this together, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring with an ester group. Let's think about possible structures.

Ester groups are usually of the form R-O-CO-R'. So if the benzene ring is attached to an ester, perhaps one substituent is an ester group (like O-CO-O-R or something) but probably more accurately, like an ester as O-CO-OR', attached to the ring.

Wait, but benzene rings with ester substituents would have the ester
