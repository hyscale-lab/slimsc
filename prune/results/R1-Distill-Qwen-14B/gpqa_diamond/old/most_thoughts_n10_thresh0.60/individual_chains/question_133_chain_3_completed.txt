Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters), containing 1.00 g each of KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molar masses are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol, respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we're given the three Ka values for H₃PO₄: 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12. The question is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is PO₄^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is HPO₄^2- or PO₄^3-? Hmm, I remember that orthophosphate is PO₄^3-. So the solution is about finding [PO₄^3-].

So, the solution has both KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into.

KH₂PO₄ is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H₂PO₄^- ions. So, K+ and H₂PO₄^-.

Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When dissolved, it should release Na+ and HPO₄^2- ions. So, the Na is a spectator ion, and we have HPO₄^2- in solution.

Wait, but HPO₄^2- is actually the bis(hydrogen phosphate) ion. Because H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. So the species in solution are H₂PO₄^- (from KH2PO4) and HPO4^2- (from Na2HPO4).

I think the next step is to calculate the moles of each salt, then find their concentrations, and then see how they affect the phosphate species.

So, first, let's compute the moles of each.

Moles of KH₂PO₄ = mass / molar mass. That's 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007345 mol. Let me see, 136.09 times 0.007 is 0.95263, which is less than 1. So 1/136.09 is about 0.00734 moles.

Similarly, moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O is 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. 1/177.99 is about 0.005613 moles.

Wait, but hold on. Na₂HPO4·2H2O has a molar mass of 177.99, so yes, 1g is 0.005613 mol.

So, the solution is 0.2 liters. So concentrations are moles divided by 0.2 L.

Concentration of KH₂PO₄ is 0.00734 mol / 0.2 L = 0.0367 M (since 0.00734 / 0.2 is about 0.0367).

Similarly, concentration of Na₂HPO4 is 0.005613 / 0.2 = 0.02807 M.

But wait, in solution, each of these dissociates into their respective ions. So, for KH2PO4, each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O, each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, [H₂PO4^-] = 0.0367 M and [HPO4^2-] = 0.02807 M.

But the problem is about orthophosphate, PO4^3-, which is the deprotonated form. So, I think we're looking at the concentration of PO4^3- in solution.

Wait, but how does that happen? Because HPO4^2- can deprotonate to form PO4^3-. So, in solution, we have HPO4^2- and H2PO4^- which can interconvert based on the pH.

Wait, but the solution is a buffer solution because it contains both a weak acid and its conjugate base. Since the phosphate system is involved, the pH will affect the distribution of the phosphate species.

So, perhaps we can model this using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation or by considering the equilibria.

Alternatively, maybe it's a buffer solution where the pH is determined by the pKa values, but perhaps the relevant species for PO4^3- is from the deprotonation of HPO4^2-.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The phosphate species are:

H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^-
H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2-
HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-

So, PO4^3- is the third deprotonation product.

So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But wait, the solution is of a mixture of a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-). So, the solution is a buffer.

Wait, no. Wait, H2PO4^- is the acid, and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base, right? Because H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-.

So, the situation is that we have a buffer solution of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait a second, but in a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, the PO4^3- concentration would be very, very low because the third deprotonation is much less likely. Because the third Ka is 1.8e-12, which is much smaller than the second Ka (6.2e-8).

So, HPO4^2- can donate a proton to become PO4^3-:

HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-

The Ka for this reaction is 6.2e-8, but wait, no, wait: The third Ka is for HPO4^2- losing a proton to become PO4^3-.

Wait, the given Ka values are:

Ka1: 7.5e-3 (H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-)
Ka2: 6.2e-8 (H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-)
Ka3: 1.8e-12 (HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-)

So, the third dissociation is much less likely, as expected.

So, in our solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But we want to find the concentration of PO4^3-, which is the product of HPO4^2- losing a proton.

But given that the solution is buffered with H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, I think the PO4^3- concentration will be very small, but perhaps we can calculate it using the third Ka.

Wait, so the solution is a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

So, the pH of the solution can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation (since that's where the buffer comes from).

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation: pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA])

Here, A- is HPO4^2- and HA is H2PO4^-.

So, [A-] is the concentration of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4, which is 0.02807 M.

[HA] is the concentration of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4, which is 0.0367 M.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([0.02807]/[0.0367])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) which is about 7.208.

Calculating the ratio: 0.02807 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765.

Log of 0.765 ≈ -0.114.

So, pH ≈ 7.208 - 0.114 ≈ 7.094.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate that more accurately.

pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) → let's compute it.

Log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8)= 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076.

Wait, no: wait, pKa is -log(Ka). So, for Ka2=6.2e-8 → pKa2=7.2076.

So, pH = pKa2 + log([A-]/[HA]).

[A-] is 0.02807, [HA] is 0.0367.

Ratio is 0.02807 / 0.0367 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is log(7.65×10^-1) → log(7.65)=0.884, so 0.884 -1 = -0.116.

So pH ≈ 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈ 7.0916.

So pH is about 7.09.

Now, knowing the pH, can we find the concentration of PO4^3-?

Because PO4^3- comes from the third dissociation step.

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka for this is 1.8e-12.

So, the expression for Ka3 is [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We can solve for [PO4^3-].

We know [H+] is 10^{-pH} → pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.12e-8 M.

Wait, wait, let me compute that accurately. pH is 7.09, so [H+] = 10^(-7.09).

10^(-7) is 1e-7. 10^(-0.09) is approximately 0.812.

So, 8.12e-8 M.

So, plugging into Ka3:

(8.12e-8) * [PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

We have [HPO4^2-] as 0.02807 M.

So, rearranging for [PO4^3-]:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02807) / (8.12e-8).

Let me compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02807 ≈ 5.0526e-14.

Denominator: 8.12e-8.

So, 5.0526e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0526 / 8.12) * 1e-6.

5.0526 / 8.12 ≈ 0.622.

So, 0.622e-6 → 6.22e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate more precisely.

Compute 1.8e-12 * 0.02807:

0.02807 is approximately 2.807e-2.

Multiply by 1.8e-12: 2.807e-2 * 1.8e-12 = (2.807 * 1.8) * 1e-14.

2.807 * 1.8 = approx 5.0526. So, 5.0526e-14.

Denominator is 8.12e-8 → 8.12e-8 is 8.12 * 1e-8.

So, 5.0526e-14 / 8.12e-8 = (5.0526 / 8.12) * 1e-6.

5.0526 / 8.12 ≈ 0.622.

So, 0.622e-6 → 6.22e-7 M.

Hmm, but looking at the options:

Option A: 6.24e-7 M

Option B:5.48e-7

Option C:2.81e-7

Option D:3.97e-7.

So, 6.22e-7 is very close to option A, 6.24e-7.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the pH or elsewhere.

Wait, let me go back and check the steps.

First, moles of each salt:

KH2PO4: 1g / 136.09 g/mol.

136.09 is approximately 136.1.

1 / 136.1 ≈ 0.007337 mol → 0.007337.

Same for Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1g / 177.99 → approx 0.005613 mol.

Concentration in 0.2 L: 0.007337 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036685 M (H2PO4^-).

0.005613 / 0.2 → 0.028065 M (HPO4^2-).

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which is pKa2 + log(0.028065 / 0.036685) → 0.028065 / 0.036685 ≈ 0.765.

Log(0.765) is approximately -0.114.

pKa2 is 7.2076 → 7.2076 - 0.114 → 7.0936.

[H+] = 10^(-7.0936) → Let's compute that precisely.

10^(-7.0936) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0936).

10^(-7) is 1e-7.

10^(-0.0936) → let's compute log(0.81) is about -0.0915, so 0.81 is 10^(-0.0915). So 10^(-0.0936) is approximately 0.81 (but a bit less).

Wait, let me compute 10^(-0.0936):

Using natural logarithm approximation: ln(x) = -0.0936 * ln(10) ≈ -0.0936 * 2.3026 ≈ -0.215.

e^(-0.215) ≈ 0.807. So, 10^(-0.0936) ≈ 0.807.

So, [H+] ≈ 1e-7 * 0.807 → 8.07e-8 M.

Now, for the third dissociation:

Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-] = 1.8e-12.

So, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

Plugging in the numbers:

Ka3 =1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] =0.028065 M.

[H+] =8.07e-8 M.

So,

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028065) / 8.07e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028065 ≈ 5.0517e-14.

Denominator:8.07e-8.

So,

5.0517e-14 / 8.07e-8 = (5.0517 / 8.07) * 1e-6.

5.0517 / 8.07 ≈ 0.6263.

So, 0.6263e-6 → 6.263e-7 M.

Hmm, that's approximately 6.26e-7, which is very close to option A, which is 6.24e-7.

So, the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, let me check if there's another approach. Because sometimes, when dealing with such small Ka values, perhaps the concentration of H+ isn't just determined by the buffer, but also by the water autoionization. But given that the buffer's pH is around 7, which is close to neutral, and considering that the third dissociation is so small, I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the H+ from both the buffer and the water, but in this case, the buffer's contribution dominates, so it's fine.

So, I think the answer is option A: 6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of the given salts and use the equilibrium constant for the third dissociation of phosphoric acid ($\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$). The solution contains 1.00 g each of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$ (molar mass = 136.09 g/mol) and $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$ (molar mass = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L).

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each salt
- Moles of $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$:
  \[
  \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00734 \, \text{mol}
  \]
- Moles of $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$:
  \[
  \frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.00561 \, \text{mol}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations in solution
- Concentration of $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ from $\text{KH}_2\text{PO}_4$:
  \[
  \frac{0.00734 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0367 \, \text{M}
  \]
- Concentration of $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$ from $\text{Na}_2\text{HPO}_4 \cdot 2\text{H}_2\text{O}$:
  \[
  \frac{0.00561 \, \text{mol}}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02807 \, \text{M}
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the pH of the buffer
The solution is a buffer containing $\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-$ (acid) and $\text{HPO}_4^{2-}$ (conjugate base). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the second dissociation of $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$:
\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]}\right)
\]
- $\text{p}K_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208$
- Ratio:
  \[
  \frac{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^-]} = \frac{0.02807}{0.0367} \approx 0.765
  \]
- $\log(0.765) \approx -0.114$
- $\text{pH} = 7.208 - 0.114 \approx 7.094$

### Step 4: Calculate $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$ using the third dissociation
The third dissociation of $\text{H}_3\text{PO}_4$ is:
\[
\text{HPO}_4^{2-} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{PO}_4^{3-}
\]
The equilibrium constant is:
\[
K_a3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO}_4^{3-}]}{[\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}
\]
Rearranging for $[\text{PO}_4^{3-}]$:
\[
[\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [\text{HPO}_4^{2-}]}{[\text{H}^+]}
\]
- $[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.094} \approx 8.12 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}$
- Substituting values:
  \[
  [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02807)}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}}
  \]
  \[
  [\text{PO}_4^{3-}] \approx \frac{5.0526 \times 10^{-14}}{8.12 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.22 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
  \]

### Final Answer:
The concentration of orthophosphate ions ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) is approximately $6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
