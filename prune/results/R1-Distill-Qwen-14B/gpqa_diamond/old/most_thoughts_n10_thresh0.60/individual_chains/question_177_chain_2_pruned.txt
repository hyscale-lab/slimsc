Okay, so I need to figure out the luminosity ratio between two stars based on the given information. Let's start by going through the problem step by step.

The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. They found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s respectively. 

Wait, but the question is about luminosity. Hmm, I remember that luminosity of a star can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius and T is the effective temperature. Oh right, because blackbody radiation—so each star is approximated as a blackbody here.

But wait, the problem also mentions that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh, the peak wavelength, right? The wavelength where the star emits the most light. I think that's related to Wien's Law, which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be the same because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, does that mean both stars have the same temperature? So T1 = T2. Because their λ_max are the same. So, if T is the same for both, then the luminosity ratio depends on their radii.

But wait, the problem mentions
