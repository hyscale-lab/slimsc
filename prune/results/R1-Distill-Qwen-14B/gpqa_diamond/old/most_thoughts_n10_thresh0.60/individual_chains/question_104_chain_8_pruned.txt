Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the planet's mass and orbit.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets have circular orbits. The key data points are the periodic shifts in their spectral lines. Planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 has a shift of 7 milliangstroms. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, right? The formula I'm vaguely remembering is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 AU)^(1/3) )) ) * (P/(2π)) )^(-2/3). Oh wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the more simplified version.

Alternatively, the formula that relates the velocity semi-amplitude K to the orbital period P is given by:

K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (a * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, I think there's a simplified expression when M_p is much smaller than M_star (which it is, since M_p is Neptune-like and M_star is Sun-like). So, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. 

So, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_star) )^(1/3) * (1 / (a * (2π/P)^(1/3) )) )?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Let me think about the Doppler formula. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) =
