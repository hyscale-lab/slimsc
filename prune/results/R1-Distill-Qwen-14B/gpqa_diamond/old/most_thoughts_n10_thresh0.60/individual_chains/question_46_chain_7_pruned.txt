Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst and determining how many possible products there are, excluding ethene. The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, usually used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, first, what's the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene? Let me draw it out. Pentene means five carbons. 1-ene means the double bond starts at carbon 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. But wait, that can't be right. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but 3-methyl would mean a methyl branch on carbon 3. Let's count the carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4,5.

So carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), then carbons 4 and 5 as CH2 and CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons, but wait, 1 to 5: 1 is double bond, 2 is CH, 3 is CH(CH3), 4 is CH2, 5 is CH3. So the molecule is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that's 1,2,3,4,5. Maybe not, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)CH2CH3? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I should draw it correctly. Let me count the carbons again: pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So the main chain is five carbons, with a double bond
