Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. 

Alright, the setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Oh wait, rest-mass energy is mc², right? So M must be 300 GeV/c². But I guess I don't need to worry about the units too much right now.

Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The more massive one is twice as heavy as the other in terms of rest-mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. Oh, so if the original mass was M, the two fragments together have a combined rest mass of 0.99M. But wait, the initial nucleus was at rest, so the system's momentum must be zero after the fission because momentum is conserved. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

Let me get the masses right. Let the rest mass of the lighter fragment be m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum is m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M. So m = 0.33M. Wait, wait: 3m=0.99M → m=0.33M. So the masses are m = 0.33M and 2m = 0.66M. Okay, that makes sense.

But wait, the initial rest mass
