Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my pericyclic reactions, but let me think this through.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. I need to figure out what product forms when it undergoes a Cope rearrangement.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the starting material. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene... That's a norbornene structure, right? So, norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two rings. The numbering is a bit tricky. So, the bridgehead positions are 1 and 4, I think. Wait, norbornene has seven atoms in totalâ€”so the bicyclo is [2.2.1], meaning two bridges of two carbons each and one bridge of one carbon.

Looking at the substituents: 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo. Wait, the 2-azabicyclo part means there's a nitrogen atom at position 2. So, in the norbornene structure, position 2 is where the nitrogen is. And there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2) attached at the same position as the nitrogen?

Wait, no. Wait, 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptene means the bicyclo is such that position 2 is nitrogen. So, the structure is a norbornene where one of the bridgehead carbons is replaced by a nitrogen. So, the molecule is a 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. And there's a vinyl group attached at carbon 2 as a substituent? Because it's 2-vinyl. So, at the same position as the nitrogen, there's a vinyl substituent.

Wait, no. Wait, the compound is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo... So, the same carbon (carbon 2) has both the nitrogen and the vinyl group. Oh wait, no. Because azabicyclo means that the nitrogen is at the bridge position, which is carbon 2 here. So, the structure is a norbornene with a nitrogen at bridgehead position 2, and a vinyl group attached to that same position. So, the structure has a bridge with a nitrogen, and a vinyl
