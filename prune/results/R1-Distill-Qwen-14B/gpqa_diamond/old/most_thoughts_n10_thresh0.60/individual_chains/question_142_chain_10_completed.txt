Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where this density matrix ρ is located in the qubit space. Hmm, let me think. I remember that density matrices describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. But wait, this matrix looks a bit familiar.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Oh right, that's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. So, it's a completely mixed state, meaning it's like a classical mixture of the |0> and |1> states, each with equal probability.

Now, I'm trying to recall how these density matrices are represented geometrically. I think in the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector r describes the point in 3D space where each coordinate corresponds to the components of the density matrix.

The general form of a single-qubit density matrix is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector in three-dimensional space. The components of r are related to the off-diagonal elements and the diagonal elements beyond the identity.

Let me write down ρ in matrix form. The |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], and multiplying by 1/2 gives [[1/2, 0], [0, 1/2]]. So ρ is a diagonal matrix with both diagonal elements equal to 1/2.

Now, using the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. Let's expand that. I is the identity matrix [[1,0],[0,1]], and r·σ is r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, r·σ would be [[r_z, r_x - i r_y], [r_x + i r_y, -r_z]]. Adding I and multiplying by 1/2:

( I + r·σ ) /2 = [ [ (1 + r_z)/2, (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
                   [ (r_x + i r_y)/2, (1 - r_z)/2 ] ]

Comparing this to our ρ matrix, which is diag(1/2, 1/2), I can set up equations.

Looking at the diagonal elements:

(1 + r_z)/2 = 1/2 → 1 + r_z = 1 → r_z = 0.

(1 - r_z)/2 = 1/2 → same result, so r_z = 0.

Now the off-diagonal elements of ρ are zero. So (r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0, which implies r_x = 0 and r_y = 0.

Putting it all together, r = (0, 0, 0). So the state is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense for a completely mixed state. Pure states are on the surface (like r=(1,0,0) for |0>), but a maximally mixed state would be at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer must be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, where the system is an equal mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states are located on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a vector in three-dimensional space that determines the position of the state geometrically.

The matrix form of \(\rho\) is:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Expanding \(\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2}\), we have:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 + r_z & r_x - i r_y \\ r_x + i r_y & 1 - r_z \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal elements must be zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). The diagonal elements yield \(r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the center of the Bloch sphere. This is consistent with the maximally mixed state being at the origin.

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\).**

Answer: C
