Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, it's about operators and uncertainties. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

So the problem says that there's an operator P with components Px, Py, Pz. The matrices for each are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state vector is given as a column with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔPz.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for ΔPz, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩² and take the square root.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So the state is an eigenstate of Px, which might not be an eigenstate of Pz. That means that the expectation value of Pz in this state could be tricky. Let's get into it.

First, maybe I should write down the given matrices. Let's see:

Px matrix:
Row 1: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Row 2: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Row 3: 0, ħ/√2, 0

Py matrix:
Row 1: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Row 2: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Row 3: 0, iħ/√2, 0

Pz matrix:
Row 1: ħ, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -ħ

The basis vectors are eigenvectors of Pz, which makes sense because Pz is diagonal in its eigenbasis. So the state given is in the Pz basis.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Let me check if that's a normalized vector. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each component.

(-1/2)^2 is 1/4. (1/√2)^2 is 1/2. (-1/2)^2 is 1/4. So total is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 = 4/4 =1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ΔPz, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩ and ⟨Pz⟩.

Wait, but since Pz is diagonal in this basis, maybe it's easier. Because in the Pz basis, each diagonal element is the eigenvalue for that state. So the state is a linear combination of the eigenstates of Pz.

The state vector is |ψ> = c1 |e1> + c2 |e2> + c3 |e3>, where |e1>, |e2>, |e3> are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, -ħ, right?

So |e1> corresponds to eigenvalue ħ, |e2> to 0, and |e3> to -ħ.

So our state is ψ = (-1/2) |e1> + (1/√2) |e2> + (-1/2) |e3>.

Wait, that's because the components are in the order of |e1>, |e2>, |e3>. So the first component is coefficient for |e1>, second for |e2>, third for |e3>.

So ψ is a combination of e1, e2, e3.

So to find ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value of P
