Okay, so I have this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r squared. So the magnitude is f(r)=1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. Oh wait, and both ∇ and f are vectors, so we're dealing with the divergence of f.

Wait, divergence is a scalar, right? So the integral of the divergence over the volume would give me a scalar value. The options are all scalar values, so that makes sense.

I remember from my electromagnetism classes that divergence of a radial vector field can be found using a specific formula. Let me think. For a vector field that depends only on the radial distance r, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f(r)).

In this case, f(r) is given as 1/r². So let's compute the divergence. 

First, let's write down the formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates when the field is radial. So the divergence ∇·f would be (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * f(r)).

Substituting f(r) = 1/r² into that expression: 

∇·f = (1/r²) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Simplify the inside: r²*(1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. Therefore, ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, does that mean the integral over the volume is zero? But wait, what's the divergence theorem about? The divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence over a volume is equal to the flux through the surface. If the divergence is zero except perhaps at a point (like the origin), then the flux would be related to any sources or sinks there.

Hold on, maybe I should think about this in another way. Let's compute the volume integral ∫ (∇·f) dV over the sphere of radius R. Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, the integral should be zero? But wait, that's not necessarily true because the divergence might have a delta function at the origin
