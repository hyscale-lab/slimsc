Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

The problem says the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a vector, let's call it |ψ⟩, which is a 3x1 matrix. The observable is represented by the matrix P, which has specific elements in each row.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator, and the probability is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, but wait—P is the observable. So to find the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue, say 0, I need to find the eigenvectors of P that correspond to eigenvalue 0, and then compute the inner product of the state vector with those eigenvectors. The square of the absolute value of that inner product gives the probability.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value of the operator, but wait, that's not directly the probability. Hmm, maybe I should think about diagonalizing P first to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

But maybe there's a simpler way. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, perhaps I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down matrix P:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

I think this matrix has a particular structure. Let me see: the first and third rows are similar, with non-zero elements only in the middle position. The second row has non-zero elements in the first and third positions.

Wait, perhaps P is a symmetric matrix, which would make sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is symmetric. The element at (1,2) is 1/√2, and at (2,1) it's 1/√2. Similarly, (2,3) is 1/√2, and (3,2) is the same. And (1,3) and (3,1) are both 0. So yes, P is symmetric, so it's Hermitian, which means real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

The eigenvalues of P are the possible outcomes when measuring the observable. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P.

Let me write the matrix P again:

0   1/√2   0
1/√2 0   1/√2
0   1/√2   0

To find the eigenvalues, compute the determinant of (P - λI) = 0.

So the matrix P - λI is:

-λ   1/√2    0
1/√2  -λ    1/√2
0    1/√2   -λ

Calculating the determinant:

-λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding along the first row would be easier.

The determinant is:

-λ * det(minor at 1,1) - 1/√2 * det(minor at 1,2) + 0 * det(...)

Minor at 1,1 is the 2x2 matrix:
[-λ   1/√2 ]
[1/√2 -λ ]

So determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) = λ² - (1/2)

Then, the first term: -λ * (λ² - 1/2 )

Minor at 1,2 is the 2x2 matrix:
[1/√2   1/√2 ]
[0      -λ ]
