Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another structure. Let me think. Oh right, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically converts a 1,5-diene into a different diene, right? So the structure must have conjugated double bonds in a 1,5 arrangement.

Wait, the compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to draw the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is like norbornane. The 2-azabicyclo would mean there's a nitrogen in one of the bridge positions. So in norbornane, the positions are numbered such that the bridgehead carbons are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, no. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two bridges: one with two carbons and another with two and one. Let me visualize this. The main ring is a bridge between carbons 1 and 4 perhaps. So the structure would have a ring system with three bridges.

Wait, the formula is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. The bicyclo part is [2.2.1], so the two bridges are of two and two and one
