Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Let me read it again.

The question says there's a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember that divergence relates to how a vector field spreads out or converges. Since the field is radial and depends only on r, maybe there's a formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates that I can use.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field that has only a radial component (like this one) would be different from a Cartesian setup. Oh right, the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) + (other terms for angular components), but since our field only has F_r and F_θ and F_φ are zero, those other terms vanish. So in this case, ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

Since f(r) is given as 1/r² and it's along the radial direction, f_r = 1/r², and the other components are zero. So plugging into the divergence formula:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) 

Let me compute that. r²*(1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = 0 in all points except maybe at the origin?

Wait, but wait. There's a catch here. The field f(r) is 1/r², which is similar to the electric field of a point charge, but wait, no. The electric field of a point charge is usually proportional to 1/r², but for a charge at the origin, the divergence would be non-zero only at r=0. Because the electric field for a point charge has a divergence given by Gauss's law as (1/ε₀) δ³(r), but I think in this case, the field is given as 1/r², so perhaps it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute the divergence directly from the formula. Let me go back.

f(r) = (1/r²) in the radial direction. So F_r = 1/r², F_θ = F_φ = 0.

So compute ∇·F = (1/r²)d/dr(r² F_r). Substitute F_r:

(1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] = (1/r²) d/dr [1] = (1/r²)*0 = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0?

Wait, but if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, then the integral over the volume (which is a sphere of radius R) would be zero except possibly at the origin. But in reality, the divergence is undefined at r=0 because f(r) would be 1/0^2 which is infinity. So perhaps the divergence is a delta function at the origin.

Wait, but in the given problem, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r². So let me think again. If the field is f(r) = 1/r² in the radial direction, its divergence would be zero except at r=0.

Wait, but another approach is to compute the divergence as we did, and it's zero. So the integral of the divergence over the volume would be zero.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about this using Gauss's Law as an analogy. The divergence theorem states that the integral of ∇·f over a volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of that volume.

So if I compute the flux of f(r) through the surface of a sphere of radius R, that should be equal to the volume integral of ∇·f over that sphere.

But f(r) is radial and has magnitude 1/r². The flux through a sphere of radius R would be the integral of f(r) * dA, where dA is the area element. Since f is radial, the dot product is just f(r) times the area.

So flux Φ = ∫ f(r) * dA = ∫ (1/R²) * R² sinθ dθ dφ, because dA = R² sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, integrating over θ from 0 to pi and phi from 0 to 2pi.

So Φ = (1/R²) * ∫∫ R² sinθ dθ dφ. The R² cancels. So ∫0 to 2π dφ is 2π. ∫0 to pi sinθ dθ is 2. So Φ = (1/R²)* (2π * 2) ) → 4π/R² * R² = 4π. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, f(r) is 1/r², which at radius R is 1/R². Because f is radial, the flux is the integral of f(R) * dA over the surface. So:

Φ = ∫ (1/R²) * dA = (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

So according to Gauss's law, the flux is 4π. But this is supposed to equal the integral of ∇·f over the volume. So ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π.

Wait, but earlier I calculated ∇·f as zero. Now according to divergence theorem, the integral should be 4π. So that suggests that ∇·f is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0, where it contributes a delta function.

Ah, so the divergence is zero except at r=0. So the volume integral is 4π. But wait, in the problem statement, the field f(r) is given as 1/r², which is a static situation. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a Dirac delta function. So the integral over the volume would be 4π times the charge enclosed, which in this scenario is like a point charge.

Wait, but in this problem, f(r) is given as 1/r², and the field is only radial. So perhaps the divergence is zero except at r=0, where the divergence is a delta function scaled somehow.

Wait, but in our calculation, the divergence of f(r) is zero except at r=0, but according to the divergence theorem, the flux is 4π. So the integral of the divergence would be 4π. But wait, earlier when I calculated ∇·f, I thought it was zero. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing the divergence.

Wait, no, let's recheck the divergence formula. The formula is ∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) + ... other terms. So F_r is 1/r². So:

(1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So ∇·f = 0.

But according to the flux calculation, the integral is 4π. So this would imply that the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the integral over the entire space would be 4π, which would come from the origin.

Wait, but the problem says to evaluate the integral inside a sphere of radius R. But wait, the origin is included within that sphere. So perhaps the divergence at r=0 is a delta function, leading the integral to be 4π.

Wait, but in our calculation, ∇·f is zero except at r=0. So in the volume integral, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, leading the integral to be a delta function's value, which would give 4π.

Hmm, so the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R would be 4π. But wait, let me think again. Let me compute using both methods.

If I compute ∇·f, I get zero everywhere except at r=0, so the integral over any volume that includes the origin would be a delta function. So the integral would be the value of the divergence at the origin multiplied by the volume, but that's not the case. Wait, no. The divergence theorem says that the integral of ∇·f over a volume V is equal to the flux through the surface of V. So in our case, the flux is 4π, so the integral of ∇·f dV is 4π.

But wait in our calculation, ∇·f is zero except at the origin, which is a point. So the integral would be zero plus a term from the origin. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about this as a delta function. Let me compute ∇·f correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the divergence. Let me recompute.

F_r = 1/r². So:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) 

= (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) )

= (1/r²) d/dr (1)

= 0.

So ∇·f is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0 where the function isn't defined smoothly.

Wait, but then how does the flux come out as 4π? Because according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the volume is the flux, which is 4π.

But if ∇·f is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral would be the integral of the delta function at the origin multiplied by the volume. So perhaps ∇·f is 4π δ³(r), so the integral over any volume containing the origin would be 4π.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about this. If ∇·f is 4π δ³(r), then integrating it over all space would give 4π. So in our case, the sphere of radius R includes r=0, so the integral would be 4π.

But earlier, when computing ∇·f using the formula, I got zero. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So which one is correct?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think of another way. Let me compute the volume integral of ∇·f in two different ways.

Wait, using the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R is equal to the flux through the surface of the sphere.

The flux through the surface is ∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the unit normal vector (radial direction). So f · n is 1/R².

The surface area is 4π R², so the flux is (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral is 4π.

But wait, according to our earlier calculation, ∇·f is zero everywhere except at the origin, which would imply the integral is 4π because ∇·f is a delta function at origin.

So in this problem, the integral is 4π. So looking at the options, option A is 4π.

But wait, the question gives the options as A)4π, B)1, etc. So the correct answer would be A) 4π.

Wait, but earlier I thought that ∇·f is zero, but that's not correct when considering the origin. So the integral is 4π.

Wait, but wait another moment. The problem states that the field f(r) falls off as 1/r², which is similar to the electric field of a point charge. The divergence of such a field (like E = k/r² r hat) is zero except at r=0. So the integral over the volume would be 4π times the enclosed "charge", which in this case is 4π times the factor, but in the problem, the field is f(r) = 1/r².

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is zero. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, and the problem is to integrate within a sphere of radius R, which includes the origin. So the integral would be 4π times the delta function's value at the origin. So perhaps the integral is 4π.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the integral is 4π, so the answer is A.


To solve the problem, we evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) within a sphere of radius \( R \) centered at the origin. The vector field is radial, with magnitude \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), and it has no angular components in spherical coordinates.

### Step 1: Divergence in Spherical Coordinates
The divergence of a vector field \( \mathbf{F} \) in spherical coordinates, when only the radial component \( F_r \) is non-zero, is given by:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F_r \right).
\]
For the given field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \), the radial component is \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \). Substituting this into the divergence formula:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right).
\]
Simplifying \( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = 1 \), the derivative \( \frac{d}{dr}(1) = 0 \), so:
\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 0 \quad \text{for all } r \neq 0.
\]
At \( r = 0 \), the field is singular, and the divergence is proportional to a Dirac delta function \( \delta^3(r) \), representing the origin.

### Step 2: Volume Integral of the Divergence
The volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over a sphere of radius \( R \) is:
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV.
\]
Since \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 0 \) everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), the integral reduces to the contribution from the origin. Using the divergence theorem, the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) is equal to the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through the surface of the sphere:
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
\]
where \( \mathbf{n} \) is the outward unit normal vector on the surface.

### Step 3: Flux Through the Surface
The flux is computed as:
\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \int_S f(r) \, dA,
\]
where \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \) at \( r = R \), and \( dA = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \) in spherical coordinates. Substituting:
\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]
The \( R^2 \) terms cancel, leaving:
\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta.
\]
Evaluating the integrals:
\[
\int_0^{2\pi} d\phi = 2\pi, \quad \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2.
\]
Thus:
\[
\int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA = 2\pi \cdot 2 = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 4: Final Result
The volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux, so:
\[
\int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **A) \( 4\pi \):** Correct, as shown by the divergence theorem and flux calculation.
- **B) \( 1 \):** Incorrect, as the integral evaluates to \( 4\pi \), not \( 1 \).
- **C) \( \frac{4}{3}\pi R \):** Incorrect, as the result is independent of \( R \).
