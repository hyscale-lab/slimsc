Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my spectroscopy, but I'll give it a shot.

The question gives me the molecular ion peak at m/z 156, which is 100%, and another peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is at 156. So that's the molecular weight of the compound. The fact that there's a peak at 158 suggests maybe a molecular ion plus something else, perhaps a chlorine isotope? Because chlorine has isotopes with a significant abundance. Wait, chlorine's main isotopes are Cl-35 and Cl-37. So, if the molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion would have a certain abundance based on the isotopic composition.

But wait, the molecular ion is 156, and the next peak is at 158, which is 2 mass units higher. So that's a difference of 2. So perhaps the molecular formula includes Cl. Because Cl has an atomic weight of about 35, but 35Cl is about 75% abundant, and 37Cl is about 25%. So in the molecular ion, the Cl would have isotopic peaks. Let me think: if the molecular weight is 156, and the molecule has one Cl atom, then the molecular ion would have a peak at 156 and 158. The ratio would depend on the natural abundance. So if the main peak is 156 (100%), the next is 158 at 32%. Let me calculate what that would imply. 

The abundance of Cl-35 is about 75%, Cl-37 is about 25%. So for a molecule with one Cl, the ratio of 156 to 158 would be 75% : 25%, which is 3:1. So the molecular ion is 100% at 156, and 32% at 158. Wait, 32% is roughly a third of 100%. Hmm, that seems off. Because 25% is a quarter. Maybe I should think about the possible molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is M+2
