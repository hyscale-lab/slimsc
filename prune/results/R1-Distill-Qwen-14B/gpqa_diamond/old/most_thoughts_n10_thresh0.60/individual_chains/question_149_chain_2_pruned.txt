Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So, the question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The NMR and LC-MS data are showing some anomalies, and I need to figure out why.

Alright, let me read the question again carefully. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, so why would there be two peaks for the same proton?

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum matching the expected molecule. So, the same mass but two different peaks. Maybe they're isomers or something?

Let's think about possible reasons for the NMR anomalies. The fact that the integrals add up to 1H suggests that it's the same proton splitting into two. But wait, in NMR, if a proton is split into multiple peaks, the integral adds up to the number of equivalent protons. So, if it's the same alpha proton giving two peaks, maybe it's because it's exchanging or something, or perhaps there's more than one environment.

Wait, but the same alpha proton... Another possibility is that the proton is in a diastereomeric environment. Like if the compound exists as a mixture of diastereomers, each with a slightly different environment for that proton, causing different shifts. But wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR peaks would split into multiple peaks. But in this case, the integrals add up to 1H. Wait, but if it's a 50:50 mix of two diastereomers, each with one of the alpha protons, then each would show as a doublet but maybe they overlap or... Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of epimerization. But that's more about dynamic processes. Oh, wait, but the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, the splitting isn't due to neighboring protons. So if it's not coupling, then perhaps the peaks are due to different environments, like in diastereomers.

Wait, what about the LC-MS part. If the MS shows two peaks of the same mass, it suggests that
