Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of isomers and tautomerism. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two parts, A and B. Let me break them down.

Part A: Which compound doesn't show tautomerism between benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

First, I need to remember what tautomerism is. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures. The most common example is between keto and enol forms. For this to happen, the compound must have adjacent carbonyl groups or have a hydrogen that can move. 

Benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is where a benzene ring has two ketone oxygens attached. So it's like o-quinone, I think. Those two carbonyl groups are para to each other. In benzoquinone, there are two carbonyl groups adjacent? No, wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups on the benzene ring, but they are on adjacent carbons? Or maybe in a 1,4 position? Wait, I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, benzoquinone could be either 1,2-diketone or 1,4-diketone. Like in para-benzoquinone, the two ketone groups are opposite each other on the benzene ring. So the structure would have two oxygen double bonds at positions 1 and 4. Does that allow for tautomerism?

Tautomerism usually requires a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group because the hydrogen can shift. For example, in cyclohexane-1,3-dione, the H on C2 is adjacent to both carbonyls, allowing for enol tautomerism. But in benzoquinone, each ketone is on the benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons are part of the ring. So, would the hydrogens on the ring be adjacent to two carbonyl groups?

Wait, in benzoquinone, the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups at positions 1 and 2 (ortho) or 1 and 4 (para). So for example, in para-benzoquinone, the carbonyls are opposite each other on the ring.

But wait, the benzene ring is all connected, so each carbon is part of the ring. The carbonyl groups are at positions 1 and 4. So each of the carbonyl carbons is connected to the benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to each carbonyl are ring carbons, which don't have hydrogens attached because all ring carbons are spÂ² hybridized and have only one H (but wait, in benzene, each carbon has one H if it's a mono-substituted ring, but in quinone, which is a di-substituted benzene, each substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, actually, in benzene, each carbon is connected to one substituent (like in toluene),
