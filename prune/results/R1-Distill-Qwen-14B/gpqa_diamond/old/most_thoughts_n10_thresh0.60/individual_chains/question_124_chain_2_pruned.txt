Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a detector. I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. Right now, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius is 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds reach the walls instead.

Hmm. I think I remember that the Lorentz factor affects how far a particle travels before decaying. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame, and the observed lifetime is gamma times that. So the distance the particle travels before decaying depends on its speed and lifetime.

Wait, the key here is probably the relation between the particles' speed, their lifetime, and the size of the detector. Because if they're moving faster, they can travel a longer distance before decaying, which would mean more of them reach the detector walls.

So the setup is that when the Lorentz factor is gamma, one third reach the walls. We need to find a new gamma where two thirds do.

Let me think about the math. The distance a particle travels before decaying is L = gamma * v * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime. But since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v is approximately the speed of light c. So L â‰ˆ gamma * c * tau.

But wait, the distance the particle needs to travel to reach the detector wall is R = 30 meters. So for a particle to reach the wall, L must be at least R. But actually, since the decay is random, the probability that a particle's lifetime allows it to travel the distance R depends on the ratio of L to something else.

Wait, maybe it's about the decay length. The average distance a particle travels before decaying is L_avg = gamma * c * tau. So the probability that a particle reaches the detector wall is the ratio of R to L_avg. Or wait, no, that's not exactly right.

Wait, perhaps the probability is the ratio of the detector's radius to the average decay length. Because if the average decay length is longer than the radius, more particles will reach the wall. So the probability P is R/(L_avg
