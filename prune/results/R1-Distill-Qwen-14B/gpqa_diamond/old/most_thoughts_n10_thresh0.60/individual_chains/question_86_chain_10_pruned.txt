Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves two reactions where a chemist uses two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. I need to figure out what the starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, so the reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but I remember that they have different selectivities. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for reducing esters, ketones, etc., while BH3 is usually used for the hydroboration-oxidation reactions, which are more about adding to double bonds in a way that depends on the structure and the reagent.

Wait, but wait, maybe I got that mixed up. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, like for esters, maybe even amides. BH3, on the other hand, is used for the hydroboration reaction, which is a way to add boron (and then replace it with hydrogen) across a double bond with anti-Markovnikov addition. Also, BH3 is more selective for less substituted alkenes because of the size of the boron.

But in this problem, the product is a ketone. Wait, so what's the starting material here? Let me think. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ketone. So pyran is a six-membered ring with one oxygen. The 2H indicates that the ring is partially hydrogenated—like a tetrahydrofuran but with a pyran (six-membered) ring. The 2-one means the ketone is at position 2.

So the product is a cyclic ketone. How do we get to that from a starting material? If the product is a ketone, the starting material could be a cyclic ester, like a lactone, because LiBH4 can open esters. Alternatively, maybe it's from a ketone that is being reduced, but wait, LiBH4 is a reducing agent, so if the product is a ketone, maybe the starting material is something else.

Wait, no. Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols, but that doesn't make sense here because the product is a ketone. Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when LiBH4 is used, it reduces the ester group.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Maybe the starting material is a ketone, and the reducing agent does something else. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic esters (lactones) or something that can form a cyclic structure upon reduction. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe the starting material is a ketone with an adjacent protecting group, and the reducing agent is removing that group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides. No, LiBH4 isn't typically used for that.

Wait, another approach: the product is a cyclic ketone. Let's think about how LiBH4 and BH3 could lead to that. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are something like epoxides, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, perhaps the product is formed via a Claisen or Aldol condensation? Or maybe via a reduction of some sort.

Wait, let me think about the reagents again. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, which typically reduces esters to alcohols. For example, an ester R-O-CO-R' would get reduced to R-O-CH2-O-R' when using LiBH4. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no, when LiBH4 reduces an ester, it typically converts the ester into an alcohol. So, for example, an ester RCOOR' would be reduced to RCH2OH and R'OH. Wait, but that's for simple esters. For cyclic esters, like a lactone, the situation is a bit different.

Wait, so if the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), then LiBH4 would open it. But wait, the product is a cyclic ketone. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe the starting material isn't a lactone but another type of compound.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone with another functional group that can be reduced. But then, why
