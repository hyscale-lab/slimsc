Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about black holes and entropy. Hmm, I remember that black holes have something called entropy, which relates to the area of their event horizon. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact formulas. Let me think.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. The options are A to D with exponents ranging from 59 to 66.

First, I think I should find the radius of the event horizon. Oh right, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ diameter / distance, but since θ is small, we can approximate the diameter as 2r, but wait, actually, the formula is θ (in radians) ≈ (size) / distance. So the size here would be the diameter of the event horizon. 

Wait, the event horizon radius is R = 2GM/c², right? But maybe I don't need to get into that because I can get the radius from the angular size. Let's see.

So, θ is given in degrees. I need to convert that to radians because the formula uses radians. Oh yeah, because 180 degrees is π radians. So θ in radians would be θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). 

Given θ=1e-17 degrees, so θ_rad ≈ (1e-17) * π / 180. Let me calculate that. 1e-17 * π is about 3.14e-17, divided by 180 is roughly 1.74e-19 radians.

The formula for angular size is θ ≈ size / distance. So size is θ * distance. So the diameter of the event horizon, D = θ_rad * d. Wait, but wait, d is given in parsecs. I think I need to convert that to meters because the standard units for entropy calculation are in meters, kilograms, seconds.

So 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 meters. Let me calculate that: 1e10 * 3
