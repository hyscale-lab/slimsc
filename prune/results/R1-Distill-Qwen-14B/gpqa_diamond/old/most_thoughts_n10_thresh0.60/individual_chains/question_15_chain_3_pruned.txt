Okay, so I've got this problem about exoplanet transits and which planet is more likely to transit from our point of view. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves the planet passing in front of its star, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the alignment of the planet's orbit with our line of sight.

The question gives two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Oh, and both orbits are circular.

The host stars have different masses but the same radius. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. Wait, but if the stars have the same radius, that's interesting because more massive stars are usually larger, but maybe Planet_2's host is a slightly evolved star that's expanded but not as much, keeping the radius same as Planet_1's host.

Transit probability is tricky. I think the probability depends on the size of the planet and the star, as well as the inclination of the orbit. The formula I remember is something like P = (R_planet / R_star)² / (something with orbital parameters). Or wait, maybe it's (R_p / a) where a is the semi-major axis? Or actually, the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2)), but since both orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So it's just (R_p / R_s)^2, but wait, no, that's the depth of the transit. The probability is more about how likely the orbital plane is aligned edge-on enough for the transit to occur.

Wait, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits) is given by the formula P = (R_star / a) * (something else?), but maybe I'm mixing it up. Another approach: the probability depends on the ratio of the star's radius to the distance of the planet from the star. Hmm, more accurately, the probability is roughly (R_star / a) multiplied by the probability based on the orbital inclination.

Wait, I think the formula for the probability of transit is:

P = (R* / a) * (1 / (1 - e²))^(1/2)

But since e=0 for both, it simplifies to P = R* / a.

Wait, no, actually, the probability is (R*/a) * (sin i), but since we're considering the maximum probability, which occurs when the orbit is edge-on (i=90 degrees), sin i is 1. Wait, but for RV method, we already have some constraints. Oh wait, because the RV method detects planets with a certain minimum mass, which depends on the inclination. So the RV method gives a lower limit on the mass, and the actual mass could be higher if the inclination is higher. But in this case, since both planets have the same minimum mass and same orbital period, but the host stars have different masses, perhaps their actual masses are same, but their RV signal depends on their mass and the star's parameters.

Wait, but the question is about transit probability, which is independent of the detection method, but depends on the orbital geometry.

So, transit probability (P) can be calculated using the formula:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 / (1 - (R_p / R_s)^2 )^(1/2)

Wait, no, that's the depth. No, wait, the probability that a randomly oriented orbit would cause a transit is the ratio of the area of the star's disk to the area of the sphere that the planet's orbital plane presents to us. Or perhaps it's the ratio of the star's radius to the planet's orbital distance, but considering the orbital distance in a certain way.

Wait, I think the probability is proportional to (R*/a) where R* is the star's radius and a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Because the planet's orbital plane is inclined relative to us, and only a fraction of the possible inclinations will result in a transit.

Another source I recall says that the probability of a transit is approximately (R
