Okay, let's try to work through this problem. Hmm, so we have two planets orbiting the same star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii, and we need to find its maximum orbital period such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, transit and occultation... Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, and we can't see its light, so the total brightness might dip again, but I think this is when the planet is behind the star. Or maybe the other way around? Wait, no, occultation is when the planet is hidden by the star. So, the planet needs to pass both in front and behind the star.

But how does that affect the orbital periods? Oh, I remember something about the orbital periods and the timing of events. For both transit and occultation to happen, the orbital periods must be such that the two planets are in a configuration that allows this. Maybe it's about their orbital periods and whether one is a multiple of the other?

Wait, another approach. For a planet to transit, the orbital plane needs to be aligned such that the planet passes in front of the star. The impact parameter is given as 0.2 for the first planet. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and the planet is Earth-sized.

But the second planet is 2.5 Earth radii. So perhaps the size of the planet affects the transit depth, but not directly the orbital period condition. Hmm.

Wait, the maximum orbital period for the second planet would relate to the orbital period of the first. Because if the second planet's period is too long, the two planets might not align in a way that allows both transit and occultation events.

I think the key here is that for the second planet to both transit and be occulted, their orbital periods must be in a ratio where their orbital periods are synchronized in a way that the alignment necessary for both events happens.

Wait, when a planet transits, it's in front of the star. For it to be occulted, the planet must be behind the star relative to us. So maybe the two planets need to be in such a configuration that their orbital periods allow them to be in the right positions at the right times.

Alternatively, perhaps the condition is that the orbital period of the second planet
