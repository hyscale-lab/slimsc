Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct IUPAC name for a benzene ring with a bunch of substituents. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. So, they're positioned in a way where each is separated by one carbon. That would mean if one is at position 1, the others are at 3 and 5, right?

Wait, no, meta is when they are separated by two carbons. So, the positions would be 1, 3, and 5. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case here. Maybe I should sketch a benzene ring to visualize this better.

Let me imagine the ring. Let's say the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then the other two groups (cyano and aldehyde) should be at positions 3 and 5. But wait, the problem says they're all meta to one another. So each is meta to the others. So, if the carboxylic acid is position 1, then the next meta group would be position 3. Then the third should be position 5 because that's meta to position 3 as well. Yeah, that makes sense.

Wait, but wait. In a benzene ring, substituents can't all be meta to each other because of the ring structure. Let me think
