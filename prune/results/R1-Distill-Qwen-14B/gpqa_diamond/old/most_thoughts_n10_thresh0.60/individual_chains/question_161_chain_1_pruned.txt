Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So the scenario is that Mike is using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's created an ultra-high vacuum, less than 10^-9 Torr, which is really good because that means there aren't many gas molecules around. But still, some gas particles are present, as detected by a mass spectrometer.

Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the size of the molecules. The formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*p), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and p is pressure. But wait, there's another way to express it using the ideal gas law. Oh right, λ = ( (k*T) / (p) ) * (1/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2)) ), but I might be mixing up the exact form.

Now, when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes to λ2. Why would that happen? Well, the electron beam is interacting with the gas molecules. I remember that electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize or excite, which might change their behavior.

Wait, but the question says the temperature remained the same, so that shouldn't affect λ. So what else could change the mean free path? Oh! The pressure— but wait, the pressure was already under ultra-high vacuum. Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam affects the gas in a different way.

Another thought: when the electron beam is on, the electrons can collide with the gas molecules more frequently. Because the electrons have a certain energy, they might cause the gas molecules to scatter more. So the effective cross-section for scattering could increase, which would decrease the mean free path. Because mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density, but wait, the number density is based on pressure. Wait, but the pressure hasn't changed because the pumps are still running or are at the same setting. So pressure is the same, so why would λ change?

Wait no, maybe when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being
