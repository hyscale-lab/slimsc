Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying an organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are all some form of propenyl or butenyl acetates with cis or trans configurations.

First, I'll try to recall what these compounds look like. Acetates are esters derived from acetic acid. So, the general structure would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, acetate esters are R-O-COCH3, right? Because the ester is formed from acetic acid (CH3COOH) and an alcohol. So, for example, if R is a propenyl or butenyl group, then the structure would be R-O-COCH3.

Wait, but the options are things like Cis-propenyl acetate, which would have the propenyl group attached. Let me draw that out. Propenyl has three carbons with a double bond. So, propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2- but wait, wait. Wait, propenyl groups can be CH2CH2CH2- but that's all single bonds. No, wait, in propenyl, there's a double bond, so it's CH2=CHCH2- attached to the oxygen in the ester. Or maybe it's CH2CH2CH2 but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let's think of propenyl as CH2=CHCH2-O-COCH3. No, wait, that's for propenyl acetate. But wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH2O-COCH3. No, wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Acetate ester is R-O-COCH3. So the R group is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So, for propenyl acetate, R is CH2CHCH2, but wait, where's the double bond? Oh, wait, propenyl can be either allyl (CH2=CHCH2-) or perhaps another structure. Wait, no, wait. The substituent is propenyl, which would be CH2=CH2CH2.... Wait, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-O... Hmm, but wait, the double bond position affects the structure
