Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about optical isomerism in organic chemistry. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually happens due to chirality, which requires a chiral center. Oh wait, but sometimes it can be due to other factors like axial chirality, but I think in most cases for these questions, it's about chiral centers.

The question lists four organic compounds, and I have to determine which show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes exhibit axial chirality. If the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged in a way that makes them non-superimposable mirror images, then yes. So if the groups on each ring are different and arranged around the central bond, there could be enantiomers. I think in this case, the substituents are at positions 6 and 2. Wait, 6 and 6' are nitro groups, and 2 and 2' are carboxylate esters. So each benzene ring has two substituents, but wait, biphenyl with two substituents on each ring. Oh wait, but if both rings have the same substituents (like both have a nitro and a carboxylate), maybe they could be symmetrical. Wait, wait, no. The structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So, the nitro groups are at 6 and 6' positions, which are para to the connecting point. The carboxylates are at 2 and 2'—which are ortho to the connecting point. So each ring has two substituents: one nitro at para and one ester at ortho. So, for each ring, the substituents are in such a way that the overall structure is not symmetrical. So, the biphenyl axis might have axial chirality. So this would have optical isomers. So option 1 shows optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me think. That's the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, so the structure is CH3-C(OH)O-CH3. Wait, no—wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be: the acid is CH2CH(OH)COOH? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. But wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2COO- methyl ester. So structure is CH3-O-CO-CH2-OH? No, wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, no, wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So it's CH3CH(OH)COOH. The ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the structure is
