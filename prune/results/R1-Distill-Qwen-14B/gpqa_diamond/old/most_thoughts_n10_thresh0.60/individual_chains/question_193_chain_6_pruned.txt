Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, like, N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (d) in parsecs is inversely proportional to parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So d = 1/plx. Or wait, wait, yes, that's right. So plx = 1/d.

So if parallax is inversely proportional to distance, then higher parallax means closer star, and lower parallax means farther away. So plx is 1/d, so d is 1/plx.

Now the question says N varies as 1/(plx)^5. Let's write that as N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since d = 1/plx, then plx = 1/d. So plx^5 would be (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx)^5 would be d^5. Because 1/(1/d^5) is d^5. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, N ∝ 1/(plx^5) → substituting plx = 1/d, plx^5 is (1/d)^5 = 1/d^5. So 1/(plx^5) is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question is how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. Oh, wait, r is the distance, I think. So per unit of r, which is distance. So the change in N with r is the derivative dN/dr, I suppose.

Wait, no, maybe the question is phrased a bit differently. It says 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. Oh, perhaps it's asking for the dependence on r, or how N varies with r.

So N ∝ d^5, so how does N change as r (distance) increases?

Wait, but if N is
