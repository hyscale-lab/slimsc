Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let's visualize the target molecule. It's a phenyl group substituted with a bromine and a nitro group, and attached to an ethan-1-one group. So, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the structure would be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Wait, no, wait. The substituents are on the phenyl group attached to the ketone. Oh wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the phenyl group is connected to the ketone's carbon. So the benzene ring has substituents in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone attachment. So the ketone is at position 1, then the bromo is at 3 and nitro at 5.

Wait, no, the numbering for the substituents would be on the benzene ring. Let me think. The parent chain is ethan-1-one, so the carbonyl is at the end. So the benzene is connected to the carbonyl group. So the benzene ring has the ketone group attached to one carbon, and then the other substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to that point. So the ring would have the ketone at position 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5.

So the substituents are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the point where the benzene is attached to the ketone. So for substitution, we need to have the directing groups in the right order.

In aromatic substitution reactions, the order of adding groups matters because each substituent directs incoming groups to specific positions. Nitro groups are meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para, but wait, no, when it's a substituent on the ring, the bromine would be ortho/para directing. Wait, but wait, the substituent in the ring attached to the ketoneâ€”so the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, which is meta-directing.

Wait, but wait, the ketone is a carbonyl group attached to
