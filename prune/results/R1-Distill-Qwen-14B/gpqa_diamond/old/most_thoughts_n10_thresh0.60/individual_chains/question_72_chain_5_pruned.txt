Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to give the final product 4. The question asks how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on product 4, with options A to D given.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down reaction by reaction.

First Reaction: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene + 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and NaI, heat.

I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. The starting diene is a bicyclic compound. The other reagent is a dienophile. Wait, the molecule 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two substituents (dibromomethyl groups) on carbons 5 and 6. Each dibromomethyl is CH2Br2, right? So that's like two Br atoms on each CH2 group.

Wait, but when you have two equivalents of the dienophile, that suggests that the diene (the bicyclo compound) is reacting twice. So maybe each of the dienophile molecules is adding to the diene in a Diels-Alder fashion.

But wait, the diene in the bicyclo structure is conjugated, so maybe each end can react as a diene? Or perhaps it's a conjugated diene that can react twice. Alternatively, maybe it's a different kind of cycloaddition.

Wait, the dienophile is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is the conjugated diene, and each of the 5 and 6 positions have a CH2Br2 group. Wait, no, CH2Br2 would have two Brs on a CH2. So each end of the dienophile has a CH2Br2 group.

Wait, but the dienophile in a Diels-Alder is typically a molecule with a dienophilic double bond, like a ketene, a carbonyl, or a triple bond. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene, which is a diene, not a dienophile. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, no, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. The diene is the conjugated four-pi-electron system, and the dienophile is a two-pi-electron system
