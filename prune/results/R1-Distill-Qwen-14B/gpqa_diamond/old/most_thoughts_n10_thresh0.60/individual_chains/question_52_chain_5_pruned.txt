Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars and their effective temperatures, and how spots on the star affect the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Oh right, LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, so that simplifies things a bit.

Alright, let's break down the problem. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. When it's not covered by spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, but how does that work? I remember that starspots are cooler regions, right? So when a star has spots, it's like having a part of its surface at a lower temperature, which affects the overall emission.

Wait, but the total effective temperature is given as 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But how does the presence of spots affect the photosphere's temperature? Oh, wait, the problem says the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases. So the photosphere as a whole is cooler when spots are present.

But then the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes without spots compared to with spots.

So, the ratio is n1/n2, where n1 is the number in level 1 and n2 in level 2. The ratio is given by the Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but E2 is higher than E1, so the exponent is negative. So when temperature decreases, the exponential term becomes smaller, because T is in the denominator. So the ratio n1/n2 would decrease as T decreases if the energy difference is fixed.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, it's higher, and with spots, it's lower.

Wait, but the problem states that in the photosphere, when they look at the ratio, it's lower when the star has spots. So the ratio is lower when Teff is lower. That
