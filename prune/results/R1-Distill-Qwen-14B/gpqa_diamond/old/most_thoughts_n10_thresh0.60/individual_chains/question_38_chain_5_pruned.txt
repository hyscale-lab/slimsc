Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are formed from secondary amines and carbonyl compounds. The question here is about a reaction sequence leading to product B, and I need to find the right sequence of reagents for part A.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. I think that's an iminium ion or something similar. Enamine reactions usually involve two steps: first, forming the enamine, then using it to attack something else. Oh wait, but wait! Wait, enamine reactions typically involve alkylation. So, the process is: deprotonate the enamine, then alkylate it.

Wait, but let me think. The general process is that the enamine acts as a nucleophile. So, in the presence of a base, you deprotonate the enamine to form a stronger base, which then attacks an electrophilic reagent. But in this case, the starting material is already an iminium species. Maybe it's an iminium ion that's going to react.

Wait, the starting material is an iminium, which is like an enamine's conjugate acid. So perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the iminium to form the enamine. Deprotonation would require a strong base. LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, so that's probably the
