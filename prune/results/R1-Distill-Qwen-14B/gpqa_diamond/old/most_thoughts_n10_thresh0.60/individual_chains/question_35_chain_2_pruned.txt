Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Let me read the problem again.

So, Ay is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. The task is to figure out which statement is correct about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay.

Wait, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the eigenvalues are related to the spin. Since this is a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, the spin matrices S would correspond to the Pauli matrices scaled by some factor. Let me think about the structure of the matrix S.

The matrix S given is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Wait a second, the Pauli matrices are usually σx, σy, σz. Let me write them down:

σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
σy = [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

Oh, so the matrix S here is σy, the Pauli Y matrix. So S is σy. And c is h/(4π). So Ay = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but what's the usual
