Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait—hold on. In quantum mechanics, state vectors are typically represented as column vectors with complex numbers, right? But here we have real numbers. Hmm, maybe that's okay. But wait, the elements of the state vector usually need to be normalized, meaning the sum of the squares of their absolute values should be 1. Let me check that. So the state is [-1, 2, 1]. The sum would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, that's 6. So the state isn't normalized. Oh, right, I should normalize it first. So the actual state vector is (1/sqrt(6)) times the given vector. So the state is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Next, there are two observables, P and Q. Their operators are given as matrices. The matrix for P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0],
[1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)],
[0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
]

And the matrix for Q is:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but quantum mechanics usually requires the operators to be Hermitian because observables correspond to Hermitian operators. Let me check if P is Hermitian. For a matrix to be Hermitian, it must equal its conjugate transpose. Since all elements are real here, it's the same as the transpose.

So the transpose of P would swap elements (1,2) and (2,1), (2,3) and (3,2), etc. Looking at P:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Transposing would make column 1 become [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], which is same as row 1. Column 2 becomes [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], which is same as row 2. Column 3 is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], same as row 3. So P is symmetric, so it's equal to its transpose, hence Hermitian. So yes, P is a valid observable.

Q is diagonal, so it's obviously Hermitian because all diagonal elements are real and the off-diagonal are zero. So that's fine.

Now, the process is: measure P, then measure Q. We need the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1.

But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the system collapses into the corresponding eigenstate. So measuring P first would collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, then measuring Q would be in that state.

But wait, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe we can compute the probabilities by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q, and see how the initial state projects onto the eigenstates.

But wait, another approach is to note that measuring P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, in that state, we measure Q. So the probability of getting 0 for P is the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the initial state. Then, given that P is 0, the state is in the corresponding eigenvector, and so the probability of getting -1 for Q is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector of Q in that state.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the joint probability by considering the tensor product of the eigenstates? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps we can approach this by finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P and Q.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Because when we measure P, the system will collapse into one of the eigenstates of P.

So, let me find the eigenvalues of P. The matrix P is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So, to find the eigenvalues, solve det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix P - λI:

[-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0

1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)

0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant.

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [...] 

Wait, maybe it's easier to set up the equation:

The determinant is:

| -λ    a       0 |

| a     -λ     a |

| 0     a     -λ |

where a = 1/sqrt(2).

Expanding the determinant:

-λ * [ ( (-
