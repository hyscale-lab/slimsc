Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I need to figure out at what energy a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by the process γγ → e+ e-. 

Wait, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, their mean free path determines how far they can travel before annihilating. If the mean free path is shorter than the size of the universe, their density would decrease, affecting their lifetime.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. So, the CMB photon is low energy. The gamma-ray is high energy, so when they collide, they can produce an electron-positron pair.

I think the cross-section for this process peaks when the center-of-mass energy is around twice the electron mass, because that's the threshold for producing the pair. The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) needs to be at least 1.022 MeV.

But wait, the gamma-ray and the CMB photon are colliding, so their energies will determine the center-of-mass energy. Let me think about that. The center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2, but since both photons are moving in opposite directions (because they're in the CMB, isotropic), their momenta are opposite, so their 3-momenta vectors cancel. So the expression simplifies.

Wait, no. Wait, in the case of two photons colliding, the energy in the center-of-mass frame is given by sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c - p2c)^2 ), but if they're moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So p1 = |p1| in one direction, p2 = |p2| in the opposite. So when adding their 3-momenta, it's p1 - p2 (or p2 - p1, depending on direction). But in the case where they are moving head-on, the momentum vectors would be in opposite directions. So the total momentum in the center-of-mass frame would be (p1 - p2), but I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the
