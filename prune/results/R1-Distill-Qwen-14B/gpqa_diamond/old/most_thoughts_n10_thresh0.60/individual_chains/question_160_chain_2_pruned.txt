Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diffraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question is about an aperture shaped like a N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field. The question asks for the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh wait, and they say N is infinitely large, so maybe the shape becomes a circle? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle.

Wait, but the apothems are the same length a. Apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side in a polygon. So if all apothems are the same length, the polygon is regular, right? So each side is equidistant from the center.

But when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem a. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing apothem with the radius. Let me think. In a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side, which is also the radius of the inscribed circle. So, for a polygon, the apothem a is related to the radius R of the circumscribed circle. For a regular polygon, R is a / cos(π/N), approximately, for small angles. But when N is large, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a.

Wait,
