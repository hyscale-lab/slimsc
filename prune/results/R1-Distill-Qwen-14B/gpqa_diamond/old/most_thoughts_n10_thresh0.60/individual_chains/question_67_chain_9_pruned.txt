Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1. The problem is about the coupled angular momentum state of the two-electron system. The state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, okay. So l₁ and l₂ are the individual orbital angular momenta for each electron, and l is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number. The m here is the magnetic quantum number for the total angular momentum.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z as -ħ. So, each L_z component (for each electron) would be measured, and we need the probability that both are -ħ.

Wait, but wait. The electrons are in a state that's a coupled angular momentum state. So their individual angular momenta are combined. I think that when dealing with coupled states, the total angular momentum is a good quantum number, but the individual components (like L₁z and L₂z) are not necessarily diagonal in this basis. So measuring these might require some transformation.

But the problem says to ignore the spin angular momentum. Oh, right, because the question is only about the orbital angular momentum. So we don't have to worry about the spin part here.

So, the state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me recall that the total orbital angular momentum L is the vector sum of L₁ and L₂. The possible total l values when adding two l=1 states can be l=2, 1, or 0. Because adding l1=1 and l2=1, the possible L can be 2, 1, 0. So the state here is for l=2, m=-1.

Now, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a specific coupled state. To find the probabilities of individual L₁z and L₂z, I think I need to express this state in terms of the product basis states of individual L₁z and L₂z. Because the product basis states are |l₁ m₁> |l₂ m₂>. So, the state we have is a combination of these.

Wait, but how is the coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m> related to the product states? I remember that the coupled states can be expressed as a linear combination of the product states. So, the |1,1,2,-1> state is a combination of different |m₁, m₂> states, where m₁ is the z-component of L₁ and m₂ of L₂.

But the state |l₁, l₂, l, m> is an eigenstate of the total L² and L_z. So L_z |l₁,l₂,l,m> = mħ |l₁,l₂,l,m>. So the total m is m= -1 in this case.

Wait, the total m is m = m₁ + m₂. So m₁ + m₂ = -1. So, the total m is -
