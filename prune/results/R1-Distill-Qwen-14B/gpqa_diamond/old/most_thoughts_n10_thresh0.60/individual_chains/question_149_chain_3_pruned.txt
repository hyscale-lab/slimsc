Okay, so I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it again carefully.

So, the scenario is that I've synthesized a small peptidic compound. The 1H NMR of the crude shows peaks that are mostly as expected except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass, same intensity. Both match the expected molecule.

Hmm, so what's going on here.

Let me think about the possible answers.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a lower mass than the product. But in the LC-MS, both have the same mass. So maybe A is not it. Unless the precursor is a part of the same molecule. Wait, but the question says "expected molecule", so two peaks with same mass as expected? Then A might not explain it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers would have the same mass, same NMR shifts? Wait, no. Enantiomers have identical physical properties except for their interaction with chiral environments. So in NMR, if the instrument is not chiral, like in a regular NMR tube, then the peaks would overlap. But if the sample isn't pure, but a racemic mixture, the NMR would show same peaks for each enantiomer. But wait, in the NMR, the alpha-proton is showing two peaks. If it's a racemic mixture, the alpha protons would couple with adjacent protons, but the NMR would average because of the identical environments. So I'm not sure. However, the peaks have the same chemical shifts, so maybe it's something else. Also, the problem says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, but in enantiomers, the coupling should be same, perhaps. Hmm.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide formation. Not sure what this means. Double coupling could refer to a situation where there's more than one coupling partner. For example, maybe the alpha proton is coupling with two different protons, but that would usually split into a triplet or more. But the question says the coupling pattern rules this out. Oh, but the question says they aren't due to coupling, so it's not splitting but perhaps something else.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties. Their NMR would show distinct peaks because the environments are different. So in the 1H NMR, the same alpha proton in diastereomers would split into two peaks because they're now in different environments. So that's consistent with two peaks with similar shifts (maybe diastereotopic protons) and integrating to 1H. Also, for the LC-MS, if there are two diastereomers, they might have the same mass but different retention times, hence two peaks. But wait, diastereomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties. So both would have same mass, but might not have same retention time. Hmm, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of same intensity and same mass. But diastereomers would have the same mass but different retention times, so two peaks. So the LC-MS result
