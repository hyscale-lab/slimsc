Okay, so I have this physics question in front of me, and I need to figure out which theory doesn't require regularization at high energies. Let's see what the options are.

The question is asking about physical theories and whether they need regularization when dealing with high energies. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergent integrals or infinities that come up in calculations. So, the theory that doesn't need regularization probably doesn't have these kinds of divergences, or maybe handles them in another way.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A is Superstring Theory. Hmm, string theory. I think string theory is a quantum theory of gravity and attempts to unify all the fundamental forces. Wait, strings are extended objects rather than point particles like in other quantum theories. I remember that in superstring theory, they talk about things like supersymmetry and higher dimensions. But does it require regularization? I'm not exactly sure. Maybe because it's a theory that incorporates gravity, it somehow avoids the divergences that other QFTs have? Or does it still need regularization because of the loop corrections? I'm a bit fuzzy on this point.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, dealing with quarks and gluons. I know that QCD calculations often involve things like renormalization, which is related to regularization. Wait, but renormalization is a process that deals with the infinities that come up in loop diagrams. So QCD definitely requires regularization because when you calculate loop integrals, you get divergences. But wait
