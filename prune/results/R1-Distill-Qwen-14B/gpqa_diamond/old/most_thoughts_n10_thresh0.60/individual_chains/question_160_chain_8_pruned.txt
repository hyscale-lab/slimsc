Okay, so I have this physics problem here about diffraction. Let me try to understand what's going on. The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining vertically onto this aperture, and we need to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. Oh wait, and we can approximate tanθ as θ because the angles are small.

Hmm, okay. I remember that when dealing with diffraction, the pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the minima occur at angles given by a sinθ = mλ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. But this isn't a single slit; it's an aperture shaped like a regular N-gon. Wait, but when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, the polygon approximates a circle. So in that case, the problem reduces to the case of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait a second. The apothem 'a' is the same for all sides. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius (the distance from the center to a vertex) of the circumscribed circle. For a regular N-gon, the apothem 'a' is equal to R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius of the circumscribed circle. So as
