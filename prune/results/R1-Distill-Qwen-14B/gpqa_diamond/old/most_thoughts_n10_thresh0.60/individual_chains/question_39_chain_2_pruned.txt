Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. 

Alright, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Wait, but wait a second. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalized. Normalization means the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must equal 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function over all space should be 1.

But wait, the question says that when they measured the particles, none were found outside x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside of that interval. Oh, but wait, the wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Because I thought the wave function usually has a real and imaginary part, but here it's written as a sum. 

Wait, perhaps I misread it. Oh, maybe the wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) multiplied by (1 - 0.5i), but that's not how it's written. Or maybe it's a real function minus an imaginary constant. That doesn't quite make sense for a wave function, because wave functions are complex, but the real and imaginary parts are functions of position, not constants. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the expression. Let's look again.

Wait, the wave function is written as (a / sqrt
