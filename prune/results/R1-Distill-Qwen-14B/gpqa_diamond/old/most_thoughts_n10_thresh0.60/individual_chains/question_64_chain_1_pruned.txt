Okay, let's try to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the problem says that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 g, was heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they produce a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through some tubes, and the results are given.

Let me break down the information:

1. The gases first go through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (Tube №1). The weight increased by 3.60 g. Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent, so I think it absorbs water. So maybe the gas here is water vapor, H2O.

2. Next, the gas moves to Ca(OH)2 solution (Tube №2). The weight didn't change. Wait, if the gas was H2O, wouldn't Ca(OH)2 react with it? H2O + Ca(OH)2 → CaO + 2H2O (or something like that). But if the weight didn't change, maybe the gas wasn't H2O. Or perhaps it's not reacting because the solution is saturated? Not sure yet.

3. Then, the gas goes through red-hot copper (Tube №3). The weight increased by 0.80 g, and CuO was formed. So, red-hot copper reacting with a gas to form CuO. What gas reacts with copper to form CuO? Maybe carbon monoxide (CO) or maybe hydrogen (H2). Wait, CO reacting with Cu would form CuO and what else? CO is oxidized to CO2. Wait, or maybe it's H2. If H2 passes over hot Cu, it wouldn't react, right? Because H2 is a reducing agent, but in presence of O2, maybe it burns. Oh wait, the setup is without air, so maybe the conditions are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's CO that's reacting. Let me think.

But wait, if the gas that reacted in tube 3 is CO, then when it passes over red-hot copper, it would be oxidized. But let me think about the reactions.

Another possibility is that the gas is a mixture. Let's see. First, the initial heating of salts A and B produces gases. The fact that the mixture is passed through Mg
