Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here about two stars and their luminosities. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. So, the question says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Interesting, so both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor.

Wait, but how does that tie into luminosity? Luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature, right? Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power. So I need to find the ratio of their luminosities, L1 over L2.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's law, which states that the peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature of the black body. The formula is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant.

Since the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because λ1_max = λ2_max implies T1 = T2. So both stars have the same temperature. Wait, that's a key point. So T1 = T2.

So now, since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio depends only on the radius ratio. Because L is proportional to R² when T is the same.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2.

So the luminosity ratio L1 / L2 would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Since T1 = T2, that simplifies to (R1² / R2²) = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So that would suggest that L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25.

But wait, wait a second. Let me read the problem again. It says the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So the options have A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, etc.

Wait, but where
