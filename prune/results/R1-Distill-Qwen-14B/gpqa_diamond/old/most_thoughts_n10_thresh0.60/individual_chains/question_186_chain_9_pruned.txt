Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about the Cope rearrangement, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I think I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another structure, often a cyclic compound. Oh wait, but wait, the Cope rearrangement typically applies to 1,5-dienes. So I need to look at the structure of this molecule to see if it fits.

Wait, the molecule is a bicyclo structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have two rings, right? Let me visualize that. So the bicyclo part has two bridgeheads. The substituents... Okay, the molecule is 2-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group (a double bond) attached to the bridge. The position is 2-azabicyclo, meaning there's a nitrogen at position 2 on the bicyclo system.

Wait, the structure of 2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo has a seven-membered ring with bridge lengths of 2, 2, and 1. The double bond is at position 5, and the nitrogen is at position 2. Oh, and there's a vinyl group at position
