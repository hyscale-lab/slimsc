Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiment with GFP-tagged proteins. Hmm, let's break it down. I remember that rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis, right? And it infects the small intestine. The question mentions tagging inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice orally.

Wait, the experiment involves imaging and seeing some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. Oh, right, stomach acid is really acidic, so maybe the GFP got broken down there. But some made it through and were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include places like Peyer's patches, right? So Peyer patches are in the small intestine and are part of the immune system.

They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the proliferating cells. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regionsâ€”what does that mean?

I think about the immune response. When a pathogen is encountered, B cells in the lymphoid tissues get activated. The variable regions of the antibodies they produce are diverse to recognize different antigens. But how does that diversity come about?

The options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination is part of the initial formation of the B cell receptor during development in the bone marrow. It's when the V, D, and J segments are joined. But that's during B cell maturation before they're even part of an immune response. So probably not D.

Somatic hypermutation happens after the B cell is activated. It introduces mutations in the variable region, increasing diversity. This allows for affinity maturation, making the antibodies more specific. So if they're seeing high variability in the variable heavy chains, that suggests this process is happening. So that would be A.

Complement activation is more about the classical pathway leading to lysis of pathogens, not directly about the variability in B cell receptors. So B is probably not it.

Class switching recombination changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase the variability in the variable regions. So C is less likely.

So putting it all together: rotavirus proteins are delivered, some reach the Peyer patches, B cells there take up the antigen, and then undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies. That's why the variable regions are so varied.

Answer: A


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the intestinal mucus and eventually the secondary lymphoid organs, including Peyer patches. Fluorescent Peyer patches are isolated, and the proliferating cell population is analyzed. Sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability, suggesting a process that generates diversity in the variable regions of antibodies.

- **Option A (somatic hypermutation):** This process occurs after B cell activation and introduces mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptor, increasing diversity and specificity. The observed high variability in the variable heavy chains aligns with this mechanism.
- **Option B (complement activation):** This process involves the classical pathway leading to pathogen lysis but does not explain the observed variability in the variable regions of the B cell receptors.
- **Option C (class switching recombination):** This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variability in the variable regions.
- **Option D (VDJ recombination):** This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are joined to form the initial B cell receptor. However, this process does not account for the observed variability in the variable heavy chains after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chains is best explained by somatic hypermutation, which occurs after antigen recognition and drives affinity maturation. 

Answer: A
