Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about six different substances undergoing an electrophilic substitution reaction with excess bromine. Only one monobromo derivative is formed, and I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different order.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituent on the benzene ring directs the incoming electrophile to certain positions. The substituents can be activating or deactivating, and meta or para directors.

Wait, but the problem says each substance forms only one monobromo derivative. Hmm. That makes me think that each reactant only yields a single product. So maybe each has a structure where substitution can only occur in one position, either ortho, meta, para, or perhaps the substituent is such that it's the only possible position. Or perhaps the substituent is so strong that it directs the substitution to a single position, leading to a single isomer.

Wait, but for monobromination, the presence of substituents can influence where the bromine adds. So if a substituent is a strong activating group, it might direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. But if it's a deactivating group, it might block some positions or direct elsewhere. Also, steric hindrance can affect where substitution occurs.

So each of the six substances is a benzene ring with a substituent. Let me list them:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent. So substitution can happen at ortho, para, or maybe meta, depending on steric factors. Wait, but in the case of toluene, the methyl group is bulky, so the para position is more favored because the ortho positions are hindered. So toluene tends to undergo para substitution more than ortho.

Wait, but some sources say that in toluene, the major product is the para isomer, but ortho is also formed. So for para substitution, the weight fraction would be higher than for ortho. But wait, the question is about the fraction of the para isomer. So in this case, substance 1 (toluene) would form a mixture with para and ortho
