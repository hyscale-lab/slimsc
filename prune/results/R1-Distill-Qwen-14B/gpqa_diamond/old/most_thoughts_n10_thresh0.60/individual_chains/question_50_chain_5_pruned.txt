Okay, so I have this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about figuring out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on the "size estimate" written next to it.

The size estimate given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram affects the order of the terms in perturbative expansions. Each loop usually adds factors like integrals or propagators, which contribute to the overall scaling of the amplitude.

Wait, but how does the scaling relate to the number of loops? I think each loop contributes a factor that's like 1/(16pi^2) or similar, depending on the spacetime dimensions. Since this is four-dimensional spacetime (as given in the question), each loop would contribute a 1/(16pi^2) factor. But wait, looking at the term, I see (4pi)^6 in the denominator. Let me compute that.

So 4pi is squared each time? Let's see: Each loop would bring in a factor of (4pi)^something. Wait, in four dimensions, the loop integrals typically give a factor like (4pi)^{d/2} where d is the dimension of the integral. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, when you compute a loop integral in 4D, you get a factor of (4
