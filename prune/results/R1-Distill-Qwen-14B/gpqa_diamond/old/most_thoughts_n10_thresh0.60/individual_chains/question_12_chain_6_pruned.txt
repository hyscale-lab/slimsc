Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

The problem says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino, I guess. The masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Wait, neutrinos are almost massless, right? I think their mass is negligible compared to the other particles here.

So the equation is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the mu and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. So their magnitudes of momentum should be the same, but opposite in direction.

Hmm, okay, so the key here is to use conservation of energy and momentum. Let me think about the energies and momenta.

The total initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, because it's stationary. So E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of energies of mu and neutrino. Since neutrino is massless, its energy is just its momentum times c. For the mu, its energy is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ), and the neutrino's energy is p c. But wait, wait, in units where c=1, which is common in particle physics, so I can probably ignore the c's for simplicity.

So, let me set c=1 to simplify. Then, the energy of the mu is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and the neutrino's energy is p.

The total energy after decay must equal the initial energy, so sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me write that equation:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Wait, but 105.7 is in MeV, as is m_pi. So solving for p, the momentum, I can rearrange this equation.

Let me let x = p. Then the equation becomes:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6

Hmm, let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + 105.7^2) = 139.6 - x

Now, square both sides:

x² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2

Expand the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x²

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x

Let me compute the squares.

105.7 squared: 105.7^2. Let me calculate that. 100² is 10,000, 5.7² is about 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140. So (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11,172.49? Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 105.7 is 100 +5.7. So (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So a=100, b=5.7.

a²=10,000
2ab=2*100*5.7=1140
b²=5.7^2=32.49
So total is 10,000 + 1,140 +32.49 = 11,172.49. So 105.7² ≈ 11,172.49 (MeV²).

139.6 squared: let me compute that. 140^2 is 19,600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140, so (140 -0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4²= 19,600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19,600 - 112 is 19,488, plus 0.16 is 19,488.16.

So equation now is:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 2*139.6 x

Wait, 2*139.6 is 279.2. So:

11,172.49 = 19,488.16 - 279.2 x

Let me rearrange:

279.2 x = 19,488.16 - 11,172.49

Compute 19,488.16 minus 11,172.49:

19,488.16
-11,172.49
= 8,315.67

So:

279.2 x = 8,315.67

So x = 8,315.67 / 2
