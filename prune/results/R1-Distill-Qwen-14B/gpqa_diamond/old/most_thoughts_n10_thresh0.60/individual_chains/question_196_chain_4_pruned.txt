Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has a maximum speed based on its amplitude and the spring constant. But this is relativistic, so I guess I need to consider how relativity affects things.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is given by Hooke's law, F = -kx. They're asking for the maximum speed v_max. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), right? Because the potential energy at amplitude A is (1/2)kA², which converts to kinetic energy (1/2)m v². So solving for v gives that. But since this is relativistic, I can't use that directly.

Relativistic dynamics... Oh right, in relativity, the total energy is given by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². But wait, the oscillator is moving, so maybe the energy comes into play there.

But wait, another thought. In the case of a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². So at maximum displacement x = A, all the energy is potential. But in relativity, maybe the energy expression is different. Or perhaps I should consider the relativistic equation of motion.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the virial theorem or something. Or maybe it's about the relation between momentum and position. Hmm.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². So v_max is sqrt(kA²/m). That's option C. But this is a relativistic problem, so option C can't be right because it's the non-relativistic case.

So I have to modify that approach. Maybe relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Oh right, relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So perhaps at maximum speed, all the potential energy is converted into relativistic kinetic energy. Wait, but wait a second. The total energy would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic
