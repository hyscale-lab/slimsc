Okay, so I've got this problem about partition functions for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me try to think it through. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

So, the system has three spins: S1, S2, S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). Right. So I need to figure out all possible states of the three spins and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-β E) for all those states.

Each spin has two possible states, so the total number of states is 2^3 =8. Let me list them all. Let's denote each state as (S1, S2, S3):

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

Now, for each state, I need to compute E. Let's calculate each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3.

Starting with state 1: all +1s.

S1S2 = 1*1 =1
S1S3=1
S2S3=1
So E = -J (1 +1 +1) = -3J.

State 2: S3 is -1.
S1S2=1*1=1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
E = -J (1 -1 -1) = -J (-1) = J.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck that calculation. Oh wait, 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Multiply by -J: E = -J*(-1) = J.

State 3: S2 is -1.

S1S2 = 1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*1=1
S2S3=(-1)*1=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1
E= -J*(-1) = J.

State4: S2 and S3 are -1.

S1S2=1*(-1)=-1
S1S3=1*(-1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)*(-1)=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E = -J*(-1) = J.

Similarly, state5: S1 = -1, others +1.

S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1
S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1
S2S3=1*1=1
Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1
E= -J*(-1) = J.

State6: S1 = -1 and S2 = +1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)*1 =-1
S1S3 = (-1)*(-1)=1
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1
E= J.

State7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1)=1
S1S3= (-1)(1)=-1
S2S3=(-1)(1)=-1
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1
E= J.

State8: all -1.

S1S2=1
S1S3=1
S2S3=1
Sum:3
E= -J*(3) = -3J.

Hmm, so looking at all eight states:

States 1 and 8 have E = -3J and +3J? Wait wait, wait a second. Let me recheck.

No, wait. The energy E is given by E = -J [sum]. So for state1, the sum is 3, so E is -3J.

For state8, all -1: S1S2 = (+1), same for all. Sum is 3, so E is -3J (same as state1). Wait, no, wait, no: in state8, S1=-1, S2=-1. So S1S2 is (-1)(-1)=1. Similarly for others. So sum is 3. So E= -J *3 = -3J.

Wait, but in state8, all are -1, which gives the same sum
