Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read it again carefully.

The question is about binary star systems and determining which one is more massive. There are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. Then, the radial velocity (RV) variations are sinusoidal, with specific amplitudes for each system.

System_1 has RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. The question is by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm... I remember that in binary star systems, the Doppler spectroscopy method is used to determine the masses. The radial velocity method gives the velocity of each star around the system's center of mass. The mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses.

Wait, the mass function formula is something like (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but I'm a bit hazy on this. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the velocities and their relation to mass.

Oh right! In a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, and the less massive one a larger orbit. So the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So if one star is more massive, it moves slower, and the other faster.

Wait, that makes sense. So for any binary system, M1 * V1 = M2 * V2. Because the system's center of mass requires M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. Since velocity is proportional to circumference over period, and period is same for both, so V is proportional to a. So M1 * V1 = M2 * V2.

That's the key point. So the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of the velocities.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 and 5. So which star is which? The more massive star has the smaller velocity. So in system_1, V1 is 10, V2 is 5. Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. Suppose the primary eclipse is when the dimmer star (maybe the less massive) passes in front, but I'm not sure. But in terms of velocities, the more massive star would have a lower velocity.

So if system_1 has velocities 10 and 5, the more massive star has the 5 km/s. Because 5 is smaller. So M1/M2 = V2/V1 = (5/10) = 0.5. So M1 is 0.5 times M2. So the mass ratio is 0.5.

Wait, but the total mass of the system is M1 + M2. So in system_1, let me denote the velocities as V1 and V2, and masses M1 and M2.

From M1 * V1 = M2 * V2 â†’ M1/M2 =
