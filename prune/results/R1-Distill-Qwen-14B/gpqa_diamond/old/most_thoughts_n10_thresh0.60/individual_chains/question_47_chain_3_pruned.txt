Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using some spectroscopic data. The options are A to D, each with different structures, so I need to match the data to one of them.

First, let's look at the IR data. The IR shows peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 with medium to strong intensity. These are usually indicative of N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has an amide group (as suggested by the formula with N and O2), I'm thinking these peaks could be from N-H bonds. Amides have two N-H stretches, which can appear around 3300-3500 cm-1, so that fits.

Then there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1. That's a key region for carbonyl groups (C=O). Amides typically have carbonyls around 1650-1700 cm-1, but sometimes they can be higher, especially if conjugated or in certain environments. Alternatively, esters also have strong C=O around 1720-1740. So this could be an amide or an ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR data:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely from a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, so probably a CH2 adjacent to another CH2.

- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating for 2H. A broad signal could indicate splitting from exchange with protons, like in an amide or maybe an -OCH2- group. Alternatively, maybe an NH group, but the integration is 2H, so not NH which is typically 1H. Or perhaps it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom like oxygen or nitrogen.

Wait, another possibility: -OCH2-. But if it's an ethyl group, like OCH2CH2..., no, the triplet at 1.20 is the CH2CH3. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is an oxygen-bearing group, like OCH2-, but as a singlet? Or perhaps a -CH2- connected to an electronegative group.

- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, which is a quartet integrating for 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a neighboring group with three protons, but wait, 2H as a quartet usually comes from a -CH2- next to another -CH2-. Like an ethyl group adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but 4.5 is quite upfield for that. Alternatively, maybe a -CH2- adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. For example, a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen.

Wait, in an ethyl ester, the structure is OCO-OCH2CH3. The OCH2 would be around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet, and the CH3 would be triplet at ~1.2. But in the NMR here, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. Hmm, that might not fit the typical ethyl ester pattern.

Wait, maybe it's a different group. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide: Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at the 3 position. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. The IR shows N-H, which would fit. The ethoxy group would have a triplet at ~1.2 and a quartet around 4.0-4.3.

But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5, not the usual 4.1. Also, the 4.0 is a broad singlet. That doesn't quite fit. Wait, maybe the ethoxy is attached to the benzene, so the OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet around 4.1. But in the data, the 4.5 is a quartet, and 4.0 is a singlet. That doesn't match.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide has a structure like RCONH2. Wait, formamide is HCONH2, but in this case, it's N-substituted. So the structure would be Ar-OCH2CH3 attached to the N of the formamide. So the formamide would have a CONH group attached to the phenyl.

Wait, the structure would be Ar-OCH2CH3, and the formamide is HCONR, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it
