Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about the minimum energy of a system of charges. Alright, let's read it again.

So, there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Oh wait, 2e means twice the elementary charge, which is about 2 * 1.6e-19 coulombs. But wait, the question is about energy, so I probably don't need to calculate the charge's exact value yet.

The setup is that 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So point P has one charge, and the other twelve are arranged on a sphere of radius 2 meters around P? Or maybe they're all fixed in some other configuration. Well, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P, so they form a spherical shell around the fixed charge.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So, I think this has to do with the electrostatic potential energy between these charges. Because electrostatic systems have potential energy based on their configuration. So to find the minimum energy, I need to calculate the potential energy between all these charges.

But wait, the fixed charge is at P, and the other twelve are at a fixed distance from P. So the energy would be from two parts: the potential between the fixed charge and each of the twelve, and the potential between each pair of the twelve themselves.

Wait, but wait.
