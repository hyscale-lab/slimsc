Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder, and for black holes, there's something called the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Right, the formula involves the area of the event horizon. 

Wait, the question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon as 10^-17 degrees and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I think I need to find the radius of the event horizon first, then calculate the area, and from there find the entropy.

So, angular size θ relates to the actual size of the object (like the radius of the event horizon) using the formula θ ≈ r / d, assuming small angles where we can approximate tanθ ≈ θ. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I should convert that to radians because the formula probably uses radians. Oh right, because when using small angles in calculus, radians are the way to go.

Let me calculate the radius r. So θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let's plug in θ_deg = 1e-17. So θ_rad is about (1e-17) * π / 180. That's approximately (1e-17) * 1.745e-2 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians.

Now, using θ_rad ≈ r / d, so solving for r: r ≈ θ_rad * d. The distance d is 1e10 parsecs. Wait, what's a parsec? Oh right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d in meters is 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

So r ≈ (1.745e-19 radians) * (3.086e26 m) = 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26. Let's compute that: 1.745 * 3.086 ≈ 5.38e7, and the exponents: 10^(-19+26) = 10^7. So r ≈ 5.38e7 * 1e7? Wait, no, wait: 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26 → 1.745*3.086 is approximately 5.38e0, and exponents: 1e7. So 5.38e7 meters? So about 5.38e7 meters is the radius of the event horizon.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check the calculation again. 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 m. So when I multiply θ_rad (1.745e-19) by d (3.086e26), 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26
