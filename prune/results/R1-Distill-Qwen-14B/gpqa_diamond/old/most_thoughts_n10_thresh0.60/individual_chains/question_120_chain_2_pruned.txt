Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, the question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are all different power laws, like 1 over plx squared or cubed, etc. Alright, let me think about this.

First, what do I remember about parallax? Oh right, parallax is a measure of how far away a star is. The formula I think is distance d = 1 / plx, where plx is the parallax in parsecs. So a larger parallax means the star is closer, and a smaller parallax means it's farther away. 

Wait, but the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So like, for each small change in parallax (like from 1 to 2 parsecs), how many stars are there in that range. But stars are uniformly distributed. Hmm, that must mean that their positions are spread out uniformly in space. So how does that relate to parallax?

If stars are uniformly distributed in space, their density is the same everywhere. So the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume. But wait, when considering parallax, since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, the same volume in terms of distance would translate into a different range of parallax.

Let me think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a spherical shell would be proportional to the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr, where dr is the thickness of the shell. So if we have a shell at distance r, thickness dr, the volume is proportional to r squared times dr.

But since parallax plx is 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting, r would be 1/plx. So the volume is 4π (1/plx)^2 dr. But wait, I'm trying to find how the number of stars per unit parallax range changes. So the number is proportional to the volume per unit parallax.

Wait, let me think again. The number per unit volume is uniform, so the number in a certain volume is proportional to the volume. But the volume in terms of parallax would be a bit tricky.

Alternatively, maybe change variables. Let's say I'm looking for the number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx. So I need to find the number of stars in that dplx range.

Since the stars are
