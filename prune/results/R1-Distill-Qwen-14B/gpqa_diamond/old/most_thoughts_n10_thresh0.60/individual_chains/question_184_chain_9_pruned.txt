Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to figure out. The question is about the synthesis of a specific aromatic compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. I remember that such synthesis problems involve a series of substitution reactions, typically electrophilic aromatic substitutions.

Let me break down the target molecule. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. Their positions are 2, 1, and 3 respectively, which I think means the numbering goes such that the substituents are in the 1, 2, 3 positions, but I need to visualize that. Wait, benzene rings are numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So 1-ethoxy, 2-t-Bu, and 3-nitro. So the substituents are in adjacent positions, but not all the same. Hmm.

So the substituents are:

- tert-butyl (a strong activating group, since it's an alkyl group) but wait, wait. No, wait. tert-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl substituent, making the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution. But nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. Ethoxy is an activating group, but wait, noâ€”ethoxy is an oxygen-containing group, so it's an activating group (since it's an electron donor through resonance), but it's an ortho/para director.

Wait, but what's the order of the substituents being added? Because the order can affect the positions where new substituents are added.

The synthesis involves several steps, and each step adds a group to the benzene ring. So the plan is to figure out the order in which the substituents are added, considering their directing effects.

First, let's list the substituents and their directing effects:

1. tert-butyl (t-Bu): It's an activating group, so it directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. But since it's a bulky group, steric hindrance might lead to more para substitution, maybe.

2. Ethoxy (OEt): Another activating group (since it's an ether, so it donates electrons through resonance). It's an ortho
