Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's go through it step by step.

The question says that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system.

Wait, potential energy in electrostatics... I remember that the potential energy of a charge in an electric field is given by U = q * V, where V is the potential at the point where the charge is placed. But since there are two charges here (the point charge q and the induced charges on the sphere), I think I need to consider the work done to bring them together.

But wait, the conducting sphere is grounded. Oh right, grounding means that the sphere is connected to the Earth, which is a large conductor at zero potential. So any induced charges on the sphere will adjust until the sphere's potential is zero.

When a charge q is placed outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges will be such that the sphere's potential remains zero. So, the sphere will have an induced charge opposite to q, but how?

Let me think. The point charge q will induce a charge -q' on the sphere, but since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the sum of the induced charge and the grounding will adjust to maintain zero potential. Wait, no, the sphere's potential is zero because it's grounded, so the induced charge must be such that the potential on the sphere's surface is zero.

Alternatively, the potential at the center of a conducting sphere is the same as its surface. So when another charge is placed outside, the potential at the center is due to both the external charge and the induced charges on the sphere.

Wait, but the sphere is conducting, so the induced charges will reside on the outer surface. The external charge q induces a charge -q on the sphere? No, wait. For a conducting sphere, the induced charge is such that the interior is shielded. So when an external charge q is placed outside, the sphere's inner surface won't have any induced charges because the conductor shields the interior. Oh wait, no, the conductor's inner surface isn't induced by external charges because the conductor's material moves freely. So the induced charges are on the outer surface.

Wait, but the conducting sphere is grounded, so any induced charges will be such that the sphere's potential is zero. Let me think about the method of images. For a conducting sphere, the induced charge can be
