Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question gives four matrices W, X, Y, Z and asks which statement among A to D is correct. I remember that in quantum mechanics, matrices often represent operators, and certain properties like being unitary or Hermitian are important.

Looking at the options:

Option A: There exists a vector to which if one multiplies e^X, the norm of the vector changes. Hmm, e^X would be the exponential of matrix X. For the norm to change, e^X must not be unitary, because unitary matrices preserve the norm (inner product). So, if e^X is not unitary, multiplying a vector by e^X would change its norm. But wait, what determines if e^X is unitary?

Matrix exponentials: e^A is unitary if A is skew-Hermitian. Skew-Hermitian matrices satisfy A† = -A. So I should check if X is skew-Hermitian.

Let me compute X†. X is given as:

X = 
[i   -1    2i]
[1    0    1]
[2i  -1   -i]

Compute the conjugate transpose (dagger) of X. The elements would be the conjugate of each element and then transposed.

So X† would be:
First row: [ -i, 1, -2i ]
Second row: [ -1, 0, -1 ]
Wait, wait. Let me compute each element carefully.

X's first row is (i, -1, 2i). So X†'s first column is the conjugate of each element in X's first row. So X† first column is ( -i, 1, -2i ). Because for the dagger, you take the conjugate of each element and then transpose.

Wait, X's first row is [i, -1, 2i], so X†'s first column is [i*, (-1)*, (2i)*], which is [-i, -1, -2i]?

Wait, wait. Wait, no. The dagger is the conjugate transpose. So for X, each element (i,j) becomes (j,i) in X†, and each element is complex conjugated.

So X:

Row 1: elements (1,1) = i, (1,2)=-1, (1,3)=2i

Row 2: (2,1)=1, (2,2)=0, (2,3)=1

Row3: (3,1)=2i, (3,2)=-1, (3,3)=-i

So X† would be:

First row: (1,1) is X(1,1)* = i* → -i

(1,2) is X(2,1)* → 1* →1

(1,3) is X(3,1)* → (2i)* → -2i

Second row:

(2,1) is X(1,2)* → (-1)* → -1 (since -1 is real, its conjugate is itself)

(2,2) is X(2,2)* → 0

(2,3) is X(3,2)* → (-1)* → -1

Third row:

(3,1) is X(1,3)* → (2i)* → -2i

(3,2) is X(2,3)* →1 →1

(3,3) is X(3,3)* → (-i)* → i

So X† is:

[ -i, 1, -2i ]

[ -1, 0, -1 ]

[ -2i, 1, i ]

Wait, wait, did I do that right? Let me make sure. So X is a 3x3 matrix. X† is the transpose conjugate.

Transposing X:

X has rows, when transposed, become columns. So the transpose of X is:

Row 1: [i, 1, 2i]

Row2: [-1, 0, -1]

Row3: [2i, 1, -i]

Then, take the complex conjugate of each element.

So X† is:

Row1: [ -i, 1, -2i ]

Row2: [1, 0, 1 ]

Row3: [ -2i, 1, i ]

Wait, no. Wait, the transpose of X's first row becomes the first column. Let me do it more carefully.

Original X:

Row 1: [i, -1, 2i]

Row 2: [1, 0,
