Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question has three parts, each involving different reactions that are sigma-tropic rearrangements. I remember that sigma-tropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a conjugated pi bond. Examples include Cope and Claisen rearrangements, which I think are [3,3] sigmatropic shifts. But wait, the question mentions that the terminal pi bond migrates into the sigma bond. Hmm, maybe I should think about whether each of these reactions is a Claisen or Cope rearrangement or something else like electrocyclic or another pericyclic reaction.

Let's break down each part.

**Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A**

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Its structure would be a molecule where the amine group (-NH-) is connected to two methoxy groups (OCH3) and another CH2 group, I think. Because it's 1,1-dimethoxy, the structure is like OCH3-N(CH2CH3)CH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3O)2NCH2CH2... No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2N-CH2CH3? Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would replace two H's on the amine with OCH3. So it becomes (CH3O)2NCH2CH3? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (CH3O)2N-CH2-CH3. That makes sense.

The other reagent is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure: CH2CH2C(OH)H2? Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait but-3-en
