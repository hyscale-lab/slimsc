Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? Like pions or something. Decay distance probably has to do with how far the particle travels before it decays.

The given data are: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. Oh wait, I think the width relates to the particle's lifetime. Remember, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle connects the width (which is like the uncertainty in energy) to the lifetime. So a wider width means a shorter lifetime, I think.

Wait, the mean decay distance would depend on the particle's velocity and lifetime. So the formula probably involves something like distance = velocity * lifetime. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact formula. Let me think. The mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ by the uncertainty principle. The relation is τ ≈ ħ / Γ, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Right, because Γ is the total decay width, which is inversely proportional to the lifetime.

So first, I need to calculate τ. Once I have τ, I can find how fast the meson is moving, and then multiply velocity by τ to get the distance.

Wait, velocity. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X, which is given as 8 GeV. Its rest mass is m_X = 1.2 GeV. So I can find the velocity using the relativistic energy formula.

The relativistic energy E is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E/(m c²). Let's compute that. Wait, but I need to be careful with units. GeV and GeV/c². Oh right, because E is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², so when you divide, the c² cancels out. So γ = E/(m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV/c² * c²) ) → wait, no, that's not right. Let me think about units. Wait, E is in GeV, and m is given as 1.2 GeV, but actually, m is m_X c² in GeV. Because E = mc², so m_X is 1
