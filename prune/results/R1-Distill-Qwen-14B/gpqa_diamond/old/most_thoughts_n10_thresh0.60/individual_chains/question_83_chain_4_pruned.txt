Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form acetate ions and water.

The problem states: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about finding the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and we have to choose the correct one.

Alright, first, I need to figure out what's happening at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's break it down.

Starting with the initial solution. We diluted 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. To find the new concentration after dilution, I can use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.02 L. M2 is what we're looking for, and V2 is 0.04 L.

M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.02) / 0.04 = (0.001) / 0.04 = 0.025 M.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. So 0.05 M times 0.02 L is 0.001 moles of acetic acid. Then, when we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume doubles to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so concentration becomes 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH, what's the equivalence point?

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So, moles NaOH = moles acetic acid = 0.001 mol.

Volume of NaOH needed: moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

So, the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added. But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence.

Wait, 25% titration refers to the percentage of the total volume needed to reach equivalence. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at that point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait no, no. Wait, when they say 25% titration, it's 25% of the volume required to reach equivalence. So if the equivalence point is 10 cm³, then 25% titration is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Alternatively, it could also be interpreted as 25% of the acid has been neutralized. But I think the first approach is correct.

So, at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

But wait, let's make sure. The initial solution is 40 cm³, and when you add 2.5 cm³
