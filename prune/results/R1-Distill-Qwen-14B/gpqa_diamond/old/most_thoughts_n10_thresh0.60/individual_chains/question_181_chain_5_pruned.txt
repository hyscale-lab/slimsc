Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and how their flux changes when a certain reaction stops. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. That time frame is interesting because I remember that light from the Sun's core takes about 8 minutes or so to reach Earth. So if the pp-III stopped, the effects would only be noticeable here on Earth after that delay. But how does that affect neutrinos?

Neutrinos are produced in various nuclear reactions in the Sun. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chains and the CNO cycle. The pp reactions have different branches. Oh right, pp-I and pp-II are lower temperature reactions, while pp-III is a higher temperature branch. I think pp-III produces more high-energy neutrinos compared to the others.

If pp-III stops, then the production of certain neutrinos would drop. The question is about the flux in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux1/flux2.

I remember that the pp-III branch produces neutrinos in higher energy ranges. So if pp-III stops, the higher energy bands would have less neutrinos. Let's think about what happens when pp-III stops. Without that source, the flux in higher energies (like band 2) would decrease more than in lower energies (band 1), assuming band 1 is lower than the typical pp-III output.

Wait, but neutrinos from the CNO cycle also contribute. The CNO cycle produces neutrinos in higher energies, I think. Oh wait, no, CNO is a higher mass process but the neutrinos from CNO are lower energy compared to the higher energy neutrinos from the main pp reactions? Or is it the other way around? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me recall. The primary pp reactions (like the main pp-I branch) produce lower-energy neutrinos, while the pp-III branch, which occurs at higher temperatures, emits higher-energy neutrinos. So the pp-III is responsible for a significant portion of the higher-energy neutrinos.

So, if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like those in band 2, 800-900 keV) would decrease. But the lower-energy bands (like band 1) would still get neutrinos from the other processes, like the main pp-I and maybe the CNO cycle.

Wait, but how much do the CNO neutrinos contribute to the lower bands? I think that the CNO cycle does contribute some lower-energy neutrinos, but I'm not sure about the exact distribution. Alternatively, the main pp reactions (other branches) might still emit lower-energy neutrinos.

So, when pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos (band 2) from that source go away. But the lower-energy neutrinos (band 1) are still being produced by other processes.

So the flux in band 1 (700-800) would be similar to before, but band 2 (800-900) would drop. Therefore, the ratio flux1/flux
