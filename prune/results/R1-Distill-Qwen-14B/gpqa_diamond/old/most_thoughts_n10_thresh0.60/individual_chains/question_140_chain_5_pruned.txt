Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it methodically. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. They react violently, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. B has a melting point close to 277 K. Then there's a part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce something with two oxygen atoms. Also, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm, I think I need to figure out what Substance X is. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the reaction between X and Y. Violent reactionâ€”could be something like a metal reacting with an acid, maybe? Or perhaps a strong base? Wait, the gas W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, H2 (but protons 2, neutrons 0), which doesn't fit. Maybe CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, 6 neutrons if it's C-12. CO2 has a molecule with 22 neutrons (each O has 8, so 2*8=16 plus C's 6 is 22? Wait, no, wait, the molecule as a whole? Or per atom? Oh wait, the molecule as a whole. So the total number of protons equals the total number of neutrons.

Wait, let me think. If W is CO2, carbon has 6 protons, each oxygen has 8. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: Carbon-12 has 6, each O-16 has 8 each. So 6 + (2*8) = 22. So protons 22, neutrons 22. That would fit. So W is CO2.

So gas W is carbon dioxide. So when X reacts with Y, CO2 is released.

Wait, but what reaction produces CO2? Maybe a carbonate reacting with an acid. Or a metal reacting with something to release CO2. Wait, if Y is acid, and X is a carbonate, but that might not be right.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is water, but that's less
