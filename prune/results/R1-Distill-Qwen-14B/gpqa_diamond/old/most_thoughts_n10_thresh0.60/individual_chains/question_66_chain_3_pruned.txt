Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in the SMEFT. The options given are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these.

Wait, first, what's SMEFT? From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model (SM) by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the fields they involve. It's used to systematically incorporate beyond the SM physics effects.

Now, symmetries in physics are really important because they dictate the form of the laws and the possible interactions. So the operators in SMEFT must respect certain symmetries, right?

Let me think about each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This is the symmetry of special relativity. It includes rotations and boosts. All physical laws should look the same in any inertial frame. So the SMEFT operators must respect this, otherwise, you'd have different physics depending on your frame of reference. I think SMEFT operators are constructed to be Lorentz invariant because, well, the SM is Lorentz invariant and SMEFT extends it. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must. So option 1 is correct.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like in space and time). So it's the full symmetry group of Minkowski spacetime. If Lorentz symmetry is required, does that mean Poincare is automatically included? Or are they separate? Wait, the SM respects Poincare symmetry. SMEFT operators are built from SM fields, which already obey Poincare. So the operators in SMEFT should also be Poincare invariant. So option 2 should also be correct.

Wait, but sometimes people talk about the Poincare group as including translations and Lorentz transformations. So if operators are local and built from SM fields, which carry Poincare indices, the operators themselves would automatically be Poincare invariant. So yes, I think Poincare symmetry is also a must.

3. CP Symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. Charge conjugation changes particles to antiparticles, and Parity inverts spatial coordinates. CP symmetry is not automatically respected in the SM. For example
