Okay, so I have this question about electron microscopy and mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that in electron microscopy, vacuum is important to prevent the electrons from interacting with gas molecules, which would cause scattering and reduce image quality.

The question says Mike created an ultra-high vacuum with a pressure less than 10^-9 Torr. But some gas particles are still there, detected by a mass spectrometer. He measures the mean free path as λ1. Then when he starts the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. And the temperature stayed the same.

Wait, mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. Right. The formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(n * π * d^2 / 2), where n is the number density and d is the effective diameter of the molecules. Alternatively, it's often written as λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T temperature, and P pressure. Or wait, maybe another formula. Oh right, another form is λ = (1) / (n * σ), where σ is the collision cross-section.

But wait, in electron microscopy, when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. The mean free path for the electrons would be different from the gas molecules' mean free path. But the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path, or the electrons'? Wait, no, the question says Mike observed that the
