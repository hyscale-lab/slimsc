Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that a supernova's ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, so that means the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at that same speed, right? Because if in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching, then in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is approaching at the same speed. That makes sense because in different frames, the relative speed is the same.

The problem asks how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm, so I think we need to use the concept of time dilation here. Because in different inertial frames, time passes at different rates due to relativity. So time in the ejecta's frame (let's call it t') is different from the time in the Galaxy's frame (t).

Wait, I remember the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But wait, wait, in this scenario, what's v? The relative speed between the two frames. Oh right, the speed is 60,000 km/s.

Wait, let me make sure. Wait, 60,000 km/s is the speed of the ejecta relative to the Galaxy. So v is 6e4 km/s. But wait, the speed of light is about 3e5 km/s, so 6e4 is 0.2 times c. So that's a significant fraction but not extremely close to c. So gamma won't be too large, but still, it's a consideration.

So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame. Because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta's clock is running slower. So when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, more time has passed in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no, wait. Time dilation: moving clocks run slower. So if I'm in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving, so the ejecta's clock is ticking slower. So when the
