Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement involves a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement of 1,5-dienes. The molecule must have two double bonds separated by three single bonds. The reaction typically forms a new six-membered ring, I think.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene means there are two bridges, right? So the structure is like norbornene. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Wait, 2-vinyl means there's a vinyl group attached at the 2 position. And it's a bicyclo system with two rings, so maybe a bridge between carbons 1 and 4, another between 2 and 5, or something like that.

Wait, the numbering: bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene. So the bridgeheads are at positions 1, 4, and 5? Or maybe 1, 2, and 5? I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The bicyclo system has three bridgehead carbons. For [2.2.1], the longest bridge is two carbons, I guess. So the structure is similar to norbornene, where there's a bridge between C1 and C5, another between C2 and C5, and a bridge between C2 and C1? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the structure has two bridges: one of two carbons and another of two, but one bridge is shorter. Hmm, maybe it's better to draw it mentally as having bridges between 1-4, 4-2, and 2-5? Or maybe I should just focus on the presence of the double bond.

The molecule has a double bond at position 5, so the structure is 5-ene. And there's a vinyl group at position 2. So, the structure would have a bicyclo framework, and the double bonds are in specific positions.

Wait, the vinyl group is at C2, so the structure around there has a double bond attached. So maybe the molecule looks like this: the bicyclo system has two bridges, and the 2-vinyl substituent is a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond between the
