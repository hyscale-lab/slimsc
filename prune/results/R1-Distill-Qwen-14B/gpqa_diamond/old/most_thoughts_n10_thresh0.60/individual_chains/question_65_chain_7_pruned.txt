Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the reactions and their products. Let me read through the problem again and see what I can come up with.

The problem has two reactions, each producing a product A and B. I need to choose the correct set of major products from the given options. The options are A through D, each giving different compounds for A and B.

Let's break down each reaction step by step.

Starting with Reaction 1:
The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reaction conditions are THF, KH, and H+. Hmm, I think THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride. Wait, but under what conditions? I remember that potassium hydride is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. But then there's H+ added, which might be protonation steps.

Wait, maybe this is a Claisen or Aldol condensation? Or perhaps a ring-forming reaction. Because the starting material is a spiro compound, which has a spiro ring junctionâ€”two rings connected by a single atom (the oxygen here, since it's an alcohol). The structure might be something like a cyclopropane ring attached to a larger ring with a vinyl group.

When you have spiro compounds reacting under basic conditions, I think sometimes they undergo ring-opening or ring-forming reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination reaction. But considering the presence of a vinyl group, perhaps a conjugate addition or some sort of enol formation.

Wait, another thought: the solvent is THF, which is aprotic and polar. KH is a strong base, but in THF, maybe it's used for deprotonating something to form an enolate. Oh wait, but the structure has an alcohol group. So in a basic condition, the OH could be deprotonated, forming an alkoxide.

But wait, the starting material is an alcohol with a spiro structure and a double bond. Maybe the reaction involves some kind of ring expansion or annulation. Oh, another possibility: the Wittig reaction? But no, Wittig usually involves aldehydes and ketones, and I'm not seeing that here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a conjugate addition. The starting material has a double bond, so if the base abstracts a proton, maybe it forms a conjug
