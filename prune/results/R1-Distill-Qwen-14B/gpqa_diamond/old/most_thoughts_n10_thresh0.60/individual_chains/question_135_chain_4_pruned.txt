Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the decay of a boson X, and the possible decay channels it can have. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs if certain conditions are met.

The problem gives me the Lagrangian interaction term: L = -λ f ψ_f† (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh wait, I think the term is something like -λ F * ψ F† (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_F(y). Wait, perhaps it's more accurately written as L = -λ f (y) [something with ψ and X]. But perhaps I'm getting the exact form wrong, but I think the key is that the interaction is between the boson X and fermions.

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find all the possible decay products of X into fermion pairs, considering their masses and the conservation laws.

So the first thing I think about is the mass of X. Since X is a boson, when it decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. For each fermion f, the rest mass must be less than half the mass of X. Because the minimum energy required to produce a fermion-antifermion pair is 2m_f. So X's mass should be >= 2m_f.

Wait, wait, because X can only decay into fermions if its mass is at least twice the mass of the fermion. So let me list the masses of all the known fermions.

The fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t), charged leptons (e, mu, tau), and neutrinos. But wait, neutrinos are very light, but since X is 6 GeV, maybe we can consider them, but perhaps in this problem, the interaction term doesn't involve neutrinos. Let me think about the interaction term given: the Lagrangian term is -λ f ψ_f† (y) (v + X) ψ_f(y). Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the notation. Alternatively,
