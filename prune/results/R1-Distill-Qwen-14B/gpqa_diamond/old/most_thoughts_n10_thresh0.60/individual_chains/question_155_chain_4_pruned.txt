Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read through it carefully. 

Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2).

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩ for this state.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So the expectation value of Pz might not be zero, but I need to compute it regardless. Let's think about how to proceed.

First, I need to find the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩. That's the state vector multiplied by Pz matrix, then multiplied by the conjugate transpose of the state vector. Alternatively, since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, the state can be expressed as a linear combination of these basis states. 

Wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. So the given state is expressed in that basis. So each component of the state vector corresponds to an eigenstate of Pz.

Let me think about the Pz matrix. Looking at it, the diagonal elements are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |+z⟩, |0z
