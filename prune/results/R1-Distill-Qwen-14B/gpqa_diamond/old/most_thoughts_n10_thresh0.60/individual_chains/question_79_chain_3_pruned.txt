Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of Compound X. Hmm. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem says that Compound X (C11H12O) was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the resulting product's NMR spectra are given. I need to identify Compound X from the options A to D.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a common reagent used in the Claisen or Dieckmann rearrangement, especially in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Oh wait, no, wait. Actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in the treatment of epoxides to form oxazabicycles, or perhaps in other ring-opening reactions. Alternatively, maybe it's involved in some kind of elimination or rearrangement? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong, non-nucleophilic base. It's often used in the epoxide-opening reactions, maybe for opening epoxides in a way that forms a ring. Alternatively, it's used in the formation of enol ethers or in certain ring-strain relief reactions.

But wait, in another context, the reaction of epoxides with this base might lead to a ring expansion. Oh, wait! The Cope rearrangement? No, that's for 1,5-dienes. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening via acid-catalyzed mechanism, but wait, the solvent is nonpolar and the temperature is high (403 K, which is around 230Â°C). So maybe it's an elimination reaction or a rearrangement that happens under heat.

Wait, but the product's NMR is given, so perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide, perhaps leading to some conjugated diene or another structure. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed ring-opening, but the reagent is a base. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is undergoing an electrocyclic ring-opening or some other process.

Wait, but another thought: the reaction conditions are
