Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it carefully.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the target gene in these mutants. The changes are in the first exon area, and they want to know which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The goal is to find which mutation disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough that the compound isn't made.

Looking at the options, the intact gene and each mutant are provided. Let's compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Intact gene sequence starts with:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, the first few codons are ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA TTG TCG C…TGA

Wait, let me write the codons:

Intact:
1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: GAT (Asp)
10: GAA (Glu)
11: CAA (Gln)
12: CAT (His)
13: ATT (Ile)
14: TTA (Leu)
15: TTG (Leu)
16: TCG (Ser)
... etc.

Mutant 1:
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTA (Leu) same as CTC? Wait, CTC is Leu, CTA is also Leu. Wait, no, CTC is Leu (Leu is CTT and CTC as well?), wait no: The genetic code is such that CTT is Leu, CTC is also Leu. So codon 3 is CTC in wild type. In mutant1, codon 3 is CTA? So that would still be Leu. Hmm.

Wait, wait, looking at the sequences line by line. Let me write the first part of each:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA TTG TCG C…TGA

Wait, let's break it down into codons, three letters each.

Intact:
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
7: TCT
8: GTG
9: GAT
10: GAA
11: CAA
12: CAT
13: ATT
14: TTA
15: TTG
16: TCG
... 

Mutant1:
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTA (Leu)
4: CGC (Arg)
5: GCT (Ala) Wait, no. Let me count the letters.

Wait, perhaps I should split each into triplets.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTG TCG T…TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ACA TAT TTA TTG TCG C…TGA

So for each position:

1: same (ATG)
2: same (TTT)
3: CTC (Leu) in intact becomes CTA (Leu) in mutant1? Wait wait wait, no. Let's look at the actual letters.

Wait, I think I should compare the actual sequences. Let me write the first 20 letters or so.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT
