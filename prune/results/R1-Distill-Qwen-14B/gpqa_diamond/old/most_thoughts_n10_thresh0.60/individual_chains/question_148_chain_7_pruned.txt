Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the molecular weight of a compound A4. Let's start by breaking down the information given.

The problem mentions five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. So Y is some element that forms five different compounds with F. Binary means each is Y and F in some combination, like YF, YF2, etc.

Looking at the compounds:

A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. When A1 decomposes, it produces A2 and F2. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Wait, oxidizing xenon usually involves fluorine because F is a strong oxidizing agent. So maybe A1 is a strong oxidizing agent itself.

A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So A3 is probably YF, but I'm not sure yet. A3 can also interact with xenon, so maybe it's a weaker oxidizer than A1.

Then, by adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless, concentrated solution of A4, you get A5. When A5 is in water, it decomposes into two substances. Hmm, this sounds like a typical hydrolysis reaction. For example, if A5 is something like YF3, adding Y might not change much, but maybe A4 is YF4? Or perhaps A4 is a different compound.

Wait, let's think about possible Y elements that form five binary fluorides. Common elements with multiple fluorides include oxygen (but it's a non-metal), sulfur (which forms SF2, SF4, SF6), chlorine (ClF, ClF2, etc.), but wait, the problem states Y is an element that forms five binary compounds with F. Let me think: what elements have five different fluorides?

Hmm, phosphorus forms PF3, PF5 (that's two), but maybe more? Alternatively, maybe it's sulfur. Sulfur forms SF2, SF4, SF6, but that's three. Wait, maybe I'm missing some. How about chlorine? Cl can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5? But I'm not sure if that's five. Alternatively, maybe it's another element.

Wait, another approach: think about the decomposition of A1. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So A1
