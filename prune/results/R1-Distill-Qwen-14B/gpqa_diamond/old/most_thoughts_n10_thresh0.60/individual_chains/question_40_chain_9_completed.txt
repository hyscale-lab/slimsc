Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that two chemists are talking after leaving a lab. The second chemist says, "Not well - my compounds are on top of each other." The question is asking what the second chemist is most likely referring to, with four options given.

Hmm, the phrase "on top of each other" makes me think of something where the compounds are sticking together or maybe not separating. So in a lab setting, if compounds are sticking together, that could relate to their physical properties.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: The compounds have similar polarities. Well, similar polarity might affect how they interact with each other. But I'm not sure how directly that leads to them being on top of each other. Maybe if they have similar polarities, they could dissolve better in each other, but I'm not certain.

Option B: The compounds are bonding through non-covalent or van der Waals interactions. Van der Waals forces are weak intermolecular forces, including things like hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces. If the compounds have these interactions, they might stick together more, forming a solid or maybe not separating in solution. So this could make sense. If the compounds are sticking because of these forces, they wouldn't be separate, hence "on top of each other."

Option C: Similar boiling points. Boiling points relate to the strength of intermolecular forces. If compounds have similar BP, they might not separate easily when distilled, but the question is about them being on top, like physically stuck. So, maybe this is about chromatography or something like that. If the BPs are similar, they might elute together. But the question doesn't mention separation techniques; it's about their state in the lab.

Option D: Similar optical rotations. That's about chirality and how they interact with plane-polarized light. Similar optical rotations don't directly relate to physical sticking together. So probably not D.

So, thinking again, when chemists say their compounds are sticking or not separating, it's usually about intermolecular forces. Van der Waals interactions would cause them to stick together, making it hard to isolate them. So in a lab, if you can't separate compounds because they're sticking, it's likely due to strong non-covalent forces.

So putting it all together, the second chemist is probably talking about non-covalent interactions causing their compounds to clump. So the correct answer is option B.


The phrase "my compounds are on top of each other" suggests that the compounds are sticking together or not separating, which points to an issue with their intermolecular forces. Among the options, non-covalent or van der Waals interactions (Option B) are the most plausible explanation. These weak forces, such as hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, or London dispersion forces, can cause compounds to clump together, making it difficult to isolate them. The other options, such as similar polarities (A), similar boiling points (C), or similar optical rotations (D), do not directly relate to the physical sticking of compounds. Therefore, the most likely explanation is that the compounds are bonding through non-covalent/van der Waals interactions.

Answer: B
