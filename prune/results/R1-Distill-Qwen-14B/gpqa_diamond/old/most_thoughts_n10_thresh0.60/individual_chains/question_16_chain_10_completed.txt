Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what each compound is and whether they can show optical activity.

First, I remember that for a compound to be optically active, it must have chirality. Chirality arises when a molecule has a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or when there's some kind of stereoisomerism like in allenes or other structures with specific symmetry.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is a double bond between C1 and C2. The groups on C1 are Cl, C2 (double bond), and two CH2 groups (maybe?), wait, no. Let me think. The structure is but-1-ene, so it's CH2=CHCH2CH3, but the substituents at C1 are Cl and two CH2 groups? Or maybe more accurately, the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, maybe not. Let me draw it out.

   Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would mean Cl on C1. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene is Cl-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon (CH2Cl). The 2-methyl would be a methyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that can't be right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. Wait, maybe I'm getting the substituents wrong.

   Alternatively, perhaps it's (Z)-configuration. But regardless, the key point is whether this molecule has a chiral center. Let me look for any tetrahedral carbons. The first carbon (C1) is double-bonded to C2, so it's spÂ² hybridized. The groups on C1 are Cl, two CH2 groups (from the chain?), and the double bond. Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Or is it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but that's but-1-ene.

   Wait, maybe it's more accurately written as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but since it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2: CH2Cl-C=CH-CH3, with a methyl on C2. So C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups (since it's CH2Cl and attached to the double bond), but wait, the double bond is C1-C2.

   Alternatively, maybe I should think about whether any carbon in this molecule has four different substituents. Let's see:

   C1: Cl, double bond to C2 (which is connected to CH(CH3) and CH2), and two CH2 groups? Or no. Hmm, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are part of a double bond, so they can't have four substituents. So no chirality here. And since it's a Z isomer, but that's about geometric isomerism, not optical activity. So this compound is not chiral. So no optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me parse this. The compound is a bicyclic structure, probably with a bridge. The substituents are chloromethylene (CH2Cl), and the configuration is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The E here probably refers to the double bond geometry. But wait, what about the structure itself?

   Methanoisobenzofuran is a fused ring system. Hexahydro means it's fully hydrogenated, so it's a cyclohexane ring system. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is a group like CH2Cl attached via a double bond (since methylene is CH2). Wait, 8-(chloromethylene) would mean that the substituent is at position 8, which is CH2Cl connected by a double bond. Hmm.

   Wait, methylene groups are CH2, so chloromethylene would be CH2Cl. But if it's attached as a substituent, perhaps it's a bridge or a side chain.

   Now, considering the E configuration. The E refers to the geometry around the double bond. But the question is whether the molecule has a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element. So, given the stereodescriptors (3aR and 7aS), those are definitely stereocenters. Each of those carbons is a stereocenter, meaning they have four different substituents. So, the molecule has stereocenters (chiral centers), so it's chiral and would exhibit optical activity. So yes, this compound contributes to the count.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2,3-dimethyl, that becomes HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)COOH. Wait, but that's 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid. So each of the CH2 groups in the middle is replaced by a methyl group.

   So, looking at the molecule, the two middle carbons (C2 and C3) each have two methyl groups, a carbonyl group, and the other carbon. Wait, no: succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So replacing CH2 with CH(CH3) would make it CH(CH3) on each C2 and C3?

   Wait, no, 2,3-dimethyl means a methyl on C2 and a methyl on C3. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   Now, looking for stereocenters. At C2, we have the substituents: one COO- (from the adjacent carbonyl?), wait, no. Let me think: each of C2 and C3 in succinic acid would be CH2. But when you add methyl groups, they become CH(CH3). Wait, no, each is CH2 with a methyl substituent? Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

   Wait, the structure of succinic acid is HOOC-(CH2)2-COOH. So adding methyl groups to C2 and C3 would make them each have a methyl. So each of the two middle carbons (C2 and C3) would be CH2 groups, but with a methyl substituent. So each is CH(CH3) attached to two CH2 groups.

   Wait, perhaps I should draw it:

   HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has the following groups:

   C2: attached to HOOC- (from C1), two CH(CH3) groups (from C2 and C3), and a methyl group? Or wait, no, each C is connected to four groups.

   Wait, no. Each C in the chain is bonded to four groups. For C2: the groups are two CH(CH3) groups (from the adjacent carbons?), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, let's correct. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

   So, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) would have:

   - C2: connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), a CH(CH3) group (C3), and two CH3 groups (from the methyl substituent)? No, wait, each middle carbon is CH(CH3) and is connected to two other carbons (C1 and C3), a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing up the substituents.

   Alternatively, perhaps each of the C2 and C3 is a CH2 group with a methyl substituent, but that would be CH(CH3) and CH2, which is not possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here; maybe I should think about whether the molecule has any stereocenters.

   The compound is (2R,3S)-configured. So each of C2 and C3 must be stereocenters. For a carbon to be a stereocenter, it must have four different substituents. Let's check C2:

   C2 has: 
   - The group from C1 (which is a carbon connected to two O's (COOH)), 
   - A methyl group (CH3), 
   - The group from C3 (which is a carbon connected to another methyl and another COOH, perhaps), 
   - And a hydrogen (since it's CH(CH3)).

   Wait, no. Let's think again. C2 is CH(CH3), so the substituents are:

   - The adjacent C1 (which is CH2 in the original succinic acid, but in this case, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (which is COOH group)), maybe. Hmm, I'm not entirely clear, but perhaps each of C2 and C3 has four different substituents. If that's the case, then they are stereocenters, making the molecule chiral. So this compound should exhibit optical activity.

   Wait, but wait: the substituents on C2 would be:

   - The COOH group from C1,
   - The CH(CH3) group from C3,
   - Two methyl groups? No, no, each carbon in the chain is connected to two other carbons, a methyl group, and a hydrogen. Wait, that's CH(CH3) meaning one methyl, but then the other substituents would be: the two adjacent carbons and a hydrogen. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

   Let me think about the structure again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, the central two carbons are each CH(CH3), connected to each other. So for C2:

   - Group 1: the COOH from C1 (which is a carbonyl group attached to an OH),
   - Group 2: a CH(CH3) group (from C3),
   - Group 3: a methyl group (CH3),
   - Group 4: a hydrogen atom (since it's CH(CH3)).

   Wait, but that would make four substituents: COOH group (as a substituent), CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So yes, four different groups. So C2 is a stereocenter. Similarly, C3 is a stereocenter as well. So the molecule has two stereocenters, and given the R and S configurations, it's chiral. So yes, this compound would exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
   This is the same as the previous compound but with both C2 and C3 in the R configuration. Wait, but the compound is (2R,3R). Let's check if this has stereocenters.

   The structure is the same as the previous one: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So again, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four different substituents. So each is a stereocenter. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and can exhibit optical activity. So this one counts as well.

   Wait, but wait a second. What if the molecule has a plane of symmetry? For instance, if both C2 and C3 are R, maybe the molecule is symmetric? Let me think: the molecule is (2R,3R), which would be a meso compound if the configurations are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. But in this case, the two stereocenters are both R, which might not necessarily make it a meso compound.

   Wait, no, because in meso compounds, the stereocenters are mirror images, leading to internal compensation. Let me consider the structure.

   If C2 is R and C3 is R, then looking at the molecule, perhaps it's a meso form. Because the two stereocenters could be mirror images, leading to internal planes of symmetry. For example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two R configurations and is achiral.

   So in this case, if the two stereocenters are both R, and the molecule is symmetric, it might be a meso compound and thus not chiral. Hmm, that's a possibility.

   Wait, but the question gives the configuration as (2R,3R), so perhaps that's the case. Let me think: in the case where the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the two stereocenters could be mirror images, leading to an achiral molecule.

   So for succinic acid with 2,3-dimethyl groups, if both are R, would that make it a meso compound?

   Let me think: the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. If C2 is R and C3 is R, then perhaps the molecule is symmetric. Let me imagine the molecule. The two methyl groups are on C2 and C3, which are adjacent. So the substituents on C2 are: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and H. On C3: COOH (from the other end?), CH(CH3), CH3, and H. Wait, no, because the two ends are both COOH, so perhaps it's symmetric.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, making it a meso compound. If that's the case, then the compound is achiral, so it won't exhibit optical activity.

   Wait, but in the previous compound, the configuration was (2R,3S), which might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. But here, (2R,3R) might have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral.

   So for this compound, I'm not sure yet. I'll have to think carefully. Let me consider the substituents. If C2 is R and C3 is R, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

   Let me imagine the structure: the two COOH groups are at both ends, and the middle two carbons each have a methyl. So in the case of (2R,3R), perhaps the arrangement is such that the molecule is symmetric. For example, if the substituents on C2 and C3 are mirror images, then it's a meso compound.

   Wait, but wait. The substituents on C2 and C3: each has a methyl group. So if the configurations are both R, does that lead to a symmetric structure?

   Let me think about the actual spatial arrangement. Let's say C2 is R: the substituents are arranged in a specific way. C3 is R as well. But because they're adjacent, perhaps the overall structure is symmetric. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it meso and thus not chiral. So in this case, this compound wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

   Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the state of the molecule. If the two stereocenters are both R, would that lead to a planar symmetry? Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether the molecule is achiral regardless of the configuration.

   Alternatively, perhaps the two stereocenters' configurations don't lead to a meso form. For example, if the substituents are arranged differently, maybe it's still chiral.

   Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possibility. For a molecule to be meso, it must have stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. If the two stereocenters are mirror images, then it's possible.

   So in this case, if (2R,3R) leads to a plane of symmetry, then the molecule is meso and not chiral. So it won't exhibit optical activity. But if not, then it's chiral.

   Alternatively, maybe the two stereocenters don't produce a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral.

   Wait, maybe it's easier to think about a specific example. Take (R,R) configuration in 2,3-dimethylbutane-1,4-diol, which is similar to succinic acid but with OH groups. In that case, if the configurations are both R, the molecule is a meso compound. So yes, in that case, it's not chiral.

   Therefore, in this case, the (2R,3R) configuration would lead to a meso compound, making it achiral and thus not exhibit optical activity. So this compound doesn't contribute to the count.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
   So this is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond between C3 and C4 (since it's 3-en). Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH at C1.

   Now, for cyclohexene, the ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. The question is whether this molecule has a chiral center.

   The OH is at C1. So let's look at C1: what are its substituents?

   C1 is connected to:

   - OH (from the alcohol),
   - The ring: which includes C2 and C6,
   - The double bond is at C3-C4, so C1 is connected to C2 and C6.

   Wait, but the key is whether C1 is a stereocenter. To be a stereocenter, it must have four different substituents.

   Let me think: the groups attached to C1 are:

   a) -OH,
   b) The ring (which includes C2, which is connected to C3 and the double bond),
   c) The ring (C6, connected to C5 and the double bond at C6 and C5? No, wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, which are each connected within the ring.

   But wait, in cyclohexene, the substituents on C1 would be:

   - OH,
   - CH2 groups (since the ring is six-membered and in cyclohexene, the substituents can vary).

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that C1 has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

   Alternatively, perhaps the ring's geometry (cis or trans) affects this.

   Let me imagine the molecule: cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The ring has double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - Two CH2 groups (since cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds, but in this case, only one double bond),
   - And a bridge to C2, which is part of the ring.

   Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the substituents on C1. The ring is six-membered, so each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, both of which are part of the ring.

   So the substituents on C1 would be:

   1. -OH,
   2. -C2 (which is connected to C3, which is part of the double bond),
   3. -C6 (connected to C5),
   4. And a hydrogen? Or is that part of the ring?

   Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon has two ring bonds, so each has two substituents. But if the ring is part of the structure, perhaps the substituents are two CH2 groups and the OH and another group.

   Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether C1 has four different substituents.

   - For C1: substituents are OH, two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6, which are part of the ring), and a hydrogen.

   Wait, no. Because in a cyclohexene, each carbon is bonded to two other ring carbons (so two substituents), but in this case, C1 has an OH as a third substituent. So the structure would be:

   C1: OH, C2, C6, and a hydrogen.

   So, substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (since C2 and C6 are each attached to other carbons via single bonds), and H?

   Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

   - OH,
   - CH2-C2 (which is connected to C3),
   - CH2-C6 (connected to C5),
   - And another CH2 group.

   Wait, no, perhaps I should think of each substituent as being attached to C1. So C1 is connected to:

   a) OH,
   b) C2 (which is part of the ring),
   c) C6 (another part of the ring),
   d) And a hydrogen (since it's a CH group with OH).

   So, the substituents would be OH, C2 (which is connected to C3 and the rest of the ring), C6 (connected to C5 and the rest of the ring), and H. Are any of these substituents the same?

   If the ring is such that C2 and C6 are identical in their substituents, then C1 might not have four different substituents. But in a cyclohexene, the ring is symmetric in some way, so perhaps C2 and C6 are not identical when considering the double bond at C3-C4.

   Wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so C2 is adjacent to C3, and C6 is adjacent to C5. So the substituents on C2 and C6 would be different. So C1's substituents would be:

   - OH,
   - C2 (which is adjacent to the double bond),
   - C6 (which isn't adjacent to the double bond),
   - H.

   If all four substituents are different, then C1 is a stereocenter, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.

   But wait, in reality, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents on C1 might not be all different. Because C2 and C6 are both part of the ring and their structures might be similar. Let me think: for example, if the ring has a certain symmetry, maybe C2 and C6 are mirror images. But because the double bond is at C3-C4, the substituents on C2 and C6 would be different.

   Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the molecule as follows: the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. The substituents on C1 are:

   - OH,
   - A CH2 group leading to C2,
   - A CH2 group leading to C6,
   - And a hydrogen.

   Are the CH2 groups leading to C2 and C6 different? Because C2 is next to the double bond, and C6 is on the other side. So the substituents on C1 would be:

   OH, CH2- (to C2), CH2- (to C6), and H. Are the two CH2 groups different? Because C2 is closer to the double bond, and C6 is further away. So perhaps the substituents are not identical. Hence, C1 would have four different substituents, making it a stereocenter.

   Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
   So this is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. The configurations are all s (so all R or S, but depends on numbering).

   Let's look for stereocenters. Each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) is a potential stereocenter if they have four different substituents.

   Let's consider C1: substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons), and another group. Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons, so each substituent includes two CH2 groups. But wait, that's not the case. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two adjacent ring carbons and two other substituents.

   So for C1:

   - OH,
   - C2 (adjacent, connected to C3),
   - C6 (adjacent, connected to C5),
   - And a hydrogen if it's a CH group.

   Wait, no. Each carbon in cyclohexane is CH2 in the case of a substituted cyclohexane. So if a carbon has an OH group, it would be a CH(OH) group, with substituents being OH, two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons), and a hydrogen. But wait, no, because in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two other carbons, so each substituent is a CH2 group, and the other substituent is the OH.

   So, for C1:

   - OH,
   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6),
   - And a hydrogen.

   Wait, no, let me think. Each carbon in the ring has two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6 for C1), and two substituent groups. So the substituents for C1 are:

   - OH,
   - Two substituents (probably CH2 groups leading to C2 and C6),
   - And a hydrogen.

   Wait, but each carbon in a chair cyclohexane would have two substituents in the ring and two others. But perhaps in this case, each of the three OHs is on a different carbon, with the other substituents being CH2 groups or hydrogens.

   Alternatively, perhaps each of the OH-bearing carbons (C1, C3, C5) has four different substituents, making them stereocenters.

   Let me think about C1 again:

   - OH,
   - C2 (which is a CH2 group connected to C3),
   - C6 (a CH2 group connected to C5),
   - And perhaps a hydrogen (if it's a CH(OH) group).

   Wait, but if each of these is a CH2 group, then substituents might not be unique. So if substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and H, but the two CH2 groups are identical (since the ring is symmetric), then the substituents on C1 might not all be different.

   Alternatively, perhaps when numbering the ring as 1,3,5, the substituents are arranged in such a way that each OH is opposite the others, leading to a symmetrical arrangement.

   Wait, let's think about the structure. If the hydroxyl groups are at 1,3,5 positions on the cyclohexane ring, the molecule would have three OHs arranged symmetrically. So, perhaps each OH is on a carbon that is a stereocenter, but the symmetry of the molecule might make some of them identical.

   Let me imagine the molecule: each of C1, C3, and C5 has an OH group. The configuration is (1s,3s,5s). So each of these carbons is a stereocenter.

   Now, each of these carbons would have substituents:

   For C1:

   - OH,
   - C2 (a CH2 group),
   - C6 (another CH2 group),
   - And a hydrogen.

   If the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and H, but the CH2 groups are connected to different parts of the ring, perhaps they are not identical. For example, C2 is attached to C3 (which has an OH), and C6 is attached to C5 (which has an OH). So the substituents on C1 might be all different.

   Therefore, each of C1, C3, and C5 has four different substituents, making them stereocenters. However, the entire molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

   Let me think: if the three OHs are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image, making it a meso compound. Alternatively, if the molecule is such that all three stereocenters are in the same configuration, it might have a plane of symmetry.

   Wait, considering the configurations are all s, which would correspond to all R or all S. In this case, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral.

   For example, if the molecule is symmetric when you rotate it 180 degrees, then it's a meso compound. So, the (1s,3s,5s) configuration might lead to the molecule being symmetric, hence achiral. Therefore, it wouldn't exhibit optical activity.

   Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the three stereocenters don't lead to a plane of symmetry. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of a similar structure. For example, if you have a cyclohexane with three stereocenters, each in the same configuration, but arranged symmetrically, it would be a meso compound. So in this case, (1s,3s,5s) would make it a meso compound, hence not chiral.

   So this compound would not exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the first carbon of butan-1-one (which is (CH3)2CO, but with a cyclopentyl group instead of a methyl). So the structure is cyclopentyl-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3C(O)CH3, but with the ketone at position 1. Wait, butan-1-one is actually (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-CH3? Hmm, maybe I should think again.

   Alternatively, butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

   Wait, no, because butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
   CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C?

   Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let's correct: butan-1-one is (CH3)2CH-C(=O)-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Butan-1-one is (CH2)2CHCH2-C(=O)-something? Wait, butan-1-one would have four carbons, with the ketone on the first carbon. So structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

   No, that would be pentan-1-one. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-, but that can't be right because butan-1-one would have four carbons, with the ketone on the first. So maybe it's (CH2)3-C(=O)CH3? No, that would be pentan-2-one.

   Hmm, perhaps I should look for the presence of a chiral center in this structure. The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.

   So the structure is:

   - The ketone is at position 1, so the carbon with the ketone is C1.
   - C1 is connected to a cyclopentyl group, a ketone group (O), and two other substituents.

   Wait, no. Let me think: the formula is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one means the ketone is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and another substituent.

   So the structure is:

   O
   ||
   C1 - C2 - C3 - C4

   But wait, no, butan-1-one would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 (connected to C2, which is CH2, etc.)

   So the structure is:

   O
   ||
   C(CH2CH2CH3)(cyclopentyl)(something else?)

   Hmm, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as:

   The ketone is on C1. C1 is connected to:

   - A cyclopentyl group,
   - A CH2 group (from C2),
   - And another substituent.

   Wait, but butan-1-one is:

   O

   C1-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

   So in this case, the ketone is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH2CH2CH3 group? No, perhaps not. Let me think again.

   Alternatively, the structure is:

   O
   ||
   C(CH2CH2CH3)(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2?)

   Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me focus on whether there's a chiral center in the molecule.

   The compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the carbonyl is at C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group, a methyl group (from 3-methyl), and two other groups. Wait, but butan-1-one is four carbons in total, with the ketone on C1. So the structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 (CH3) - C4

   So C1 is connected to:

   - The cyclopentyl group,
   - C2 (which is a CH2 group),
   - The ketone group (O),
   - And what else? Wait, but a carbonyl group is a double bond O, so the C1 would have three substituents: cyclopentyl, C2, and the carbonyl O (as a double bond). So it's a carbonyl group, which means C1 is double-bonded to O, so it's spÂ² hybridized. Therefore, it can't be a stereocenter because it's not tetrahedral.

   So C1 can't be a stereocenter. Now, let's look for any other chiral centers. 

   The other carbons: C2, C3, and C4.

   C3 has a methyl group (from 3-methyl), so substituents are:

   - C2,
   - C4,
   - CH3,
   - and perhaps a hydrogen.

   So for C3, the substituents would be CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. Are all four different? Let's see:

   - C2 is connected to C1 (which is the carbonyl group) and C3,
   - C4 is connected to C3 and perhaps a CH3 group (if it's a butanone).

   Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 (CH2) - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4.

   So C3 would have substituents: CH2 (from C2), CH2 (from C4), CH3, and H. So substituents are: CH2- (from C2), CH2- (from C4), CH3, and H. Are any of these the same?

   The CH2 groups: on C2, it's connected to C1, which is a carbonyl group, and on C4, it's connected to C3 and maybe a methyl group. So the substituents on C3 would be:

   a) CH2-C1 (which is a cyclopentyl and carbonyl group),
   b) CH2-C4 (which is connected to C3 and perhaps another CH3),
   c) CH3,
   d) H.

   So substituents a and b are different because the groups attached to them are different (C1 has a carbonyl and cyclopentyl, C4 is just a CH2). So substituents a and b are different. Therefore, all four substituents on C3 are different, making it a stereocenter.

   Wait, but what about the other substituents? Let me list them:

   - C2's group: connected to C1 (which has cyclopentyl and carbonyl),
   - C4's group: connected to C3 and perhaps a CH3 (but wait, in 3-methylbutan-1-one, C4 would be a CH3 group? Or not?)

   Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, which would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4.

   So C3 has substituents:

   - C2 (CH2),
   - C4 (CH2),
   - CH3,
   - H.

   So, substituents are CH2-C2, CH2-C4, CH3, and H.

   Wait, but C2 is connected to C1 (which is a carbonyl with a cyclopentyl) and C3. C4 is connected to C3 and (since it's butan-1-one, the chain is four carbons, so C4 would be a CH3 group? Or is it a CH2 group? Wait, butan-1-one has four carbons in the chain, with the ketone on C1. So butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-something? No, wait, butan-1-one would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 - C2 - C3 - C4

   So butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
   C1 (connected to C2, which is CH2, etc.)

   But in the given compound, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 (CH3) - C4.

   Wait, but that's not possible because the chain has to be butan-1-one, so four carbons in a row, with the ketone on C1. So the structure would be:

   O
   ||
   C1 (cyclopentyl) - C2 (CH2) - C3 (CH(CH3)) - C4 (CH3).

   So C3 would have substituents: C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), CH3 (from 3-methyl), and H.

   So substituents on C3 are:

   a) CH2-C2,
   b) CH3-C4,
   c) CH3,
   d) H.

   Are any of these the same? a and b are different because C2 is connected to C1 (cyclopentyl and carbonyl) and C3, while C4 is connected to C3 and perhaps nothing else (as it's the end of the chain).

   So, substituents a and b would be different because the groups attached are different. So all four substituents on C3 are different, making it a stereocenter. Therefore, this compound is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

   Wait, but wait. C3 is CH(CH3). So substituents are:

   - Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4),
   - One CH3,
   - One H.

   So in this case, substituents a and b are CH2 groups but connected to different parts of the molecule. So they're not the same. Hence, all four substituents are different, making C3 a stereocenter. Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

   Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me consider that C3 is connected to:

   - C2 (CHâ),
   - C4 (CHâ),
   - CH3,
   - H.

   So substituents are CHâ, CHâ, CH3, and H. Wait, but if the two CHâ groups are attached to different parts of the molecule (one to C2 and the other to C4), then the two CHâ groups are not identical. Hence, all four substituents are different, making C3 a stereocenter.

   Therefore, this compound is chiral and optically active.

Now, let me count the number of compounds that exhibit optical activity:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Yes (1)
3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes (2)
4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No (it's a meso compound)
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Yes (3)
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: No (meso)
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes (4)

So four compounds exhibit optical activity. Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, the seventh compound, 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: I thought C3 is a stereocenter. But wait, the structure is O=C1-C2-C3-C4, where C1 has cyclopentyl, C3 has a methyl, etc. So in this case, only C3 is a stereocenter. But I thought that the substituents on C3 are all different, so it's a stereocenter. Hence, yes, it's chiral.

So the count is four.

But looking back at the options, option D is 4. So the answer would be D.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a stereocenter (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits stereoisomerism that prevents superimposability on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. The double-bonded carbons are spÂ² hybridized and cannot be stereocenters. Additionally, no other carbon in the molecule has four different substituents. Thus, this compound is **not optically active**.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This bicyclic compound has stereocenters at C3a and C7a, as indicated by the (3aR,7aS) configuration. These carbons are bonded to four different groups, making them stereocenters. The molecule is chiral and **exhibits optical activity**.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has two middle carbons (C2 and C3) that are each bonded to four different groups: a carbonyl group, a methyl group, a hydrogen, and the adjacent carbon. Both C2 and C3 are stereocenters, and the (2R,3S) configuration ensures the molecule is chiral. This compound **exhibits optical activity**.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is also a succinic acid derivative with stereocenters at C2 and C3. However, the (2R,3R) configuration creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and **do not exhibit optical activity**.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group at C1 is bonded to four different substituents: a hydrogen, two different carbons in the ring, and the double bond at C3-C4. This makes C1 a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. This compound **exhibits optical activity**.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This cyclohexane ring has hydroxyl groups at C1, C3, and C5. While each of these carbons is a stereocenter, the (1s,3s,5s) configuration creates a plane of symmetry in the molecule, making it a meso compound. Meso compounds are achiral and **do not exhibit optical activity**.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The ketone group at C1 is spÂ² hybridized and not a stereocenter. However, C3 is bonded to four different groups: a methyl group, two different carbons in the chain, and a hydrogen. This makes C3 a stereocenter, and the molecule is chiral. This compound **exhibits optical activity**.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are:  
- (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione  
- (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid  
- (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol  
- 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one  

Thus, **4 compounds exhibit optical activity**.
