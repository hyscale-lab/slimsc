Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, the question is about particles moving at ultra-relativistic speeds and how many reach the detector's inner walls. Let me read it again.

Alright, the setup is that particles are collided in the center of a spherical detector. These new particles decay quickly and are moving at a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of them reach the detector's inner walls. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so initially, at a Lorentz factor of 20, only about 1/3 of the particles reach the walls. We need to find a higher Lorentz factor so that 2/3 reach the walls. Hmm, that makes sense because a higher gamma would mean they can travel further, so more would make it to the detector walls.

I remember that the distance a particle travels before decaying is related to its lifetime, which is dilated by the Lorentz factor. The lifetime of the particle in its rest frame is tau, and in the lab frame, it's gamma * tau. So the proper lifetime is tau, and the observed lifetime is gamma * tau.

The speed of the particles is ultra-relativistic, so we can approximate their speed as the speed of light, c. So the distance they can travel before decaying is approximately v * gamma * tau = c * gamma * tau. But wait, because they're moving at speed v, the time they have is gamma * tau, so the distance is v * (gamma tau). Since they're ultra-relativistic, v is approximately c, so the distance is c * gamma tau.

Wait, but the detector is a sphere of radius 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel from the center is 30 meters. Wait, no, because the particles are produced at the center. So the distance from the center to the wall is 30 meters. So the particles must travel 30 meters before decaying.

Hmm, but wait, the problem says that on average, one third of the particles reach the detector's inner walls when gamma is 20. So when gamma is 20, the mean distance they can travel is 30 meters multiplied by 1/3, which is 10 meters? Or wait, no.
