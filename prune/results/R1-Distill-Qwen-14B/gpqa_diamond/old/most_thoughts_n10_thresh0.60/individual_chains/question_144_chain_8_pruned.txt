Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about a meson resonance called X. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given data includes the production energy E_X of 8 GeV, mass m_X of 1.2 GeV, and width Gamma_X of 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters. 

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime. Oh right, because the decay distance is how far the particle travels before decaying, which depends on its lifetime and speed. So the formula should involve the lifetime, speed, and probably some constants.

I remember that the mean lifetime tau is related to the width Gamma. The uncertainty principle says that the product of the lifetime and the width is inversely proportional to some constants. Oh wait, the relation is Gamma = ħ / tau, or maybe tau = ħ / Gamma. Wait, no, the natural linewidth is Gamma = ħ * (1/tau), so tau is ħ divided by Gamma. Let me think: the relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

But wait, units are important here. Gamma is given in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s or something like that. Hmm, I need to be careful with the units.

Once I have the lifetime, I need to find the velocity of the meson. Because the decay distance L is v multiplied by tau. So L = v * tau.

But to find v, I'll use the relativistic energy formula. The particle's energy E is given as 8 GeV, which is its total energy. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV. So E = gamma * m c². Wait, but since we're working in natural units where c=1, maybe it's easier. So E = gamma * m, but wait, m is in GeV/c², E in GeV, so yeah, in natural units c=1, so E = gamma * m.

So gamma = E / m. E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV, so gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667.

Then, gamma is also 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), where beta is v/c. So beta is sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). Let me compute that.

Gamma is 8/(1.2) = 6.6667. So 1/gamma squared is (1/6.6667)^2. Let me compute that numerically: 6.6667 is approximately 6.6667, so 1/6.6667 is about 0.15. Squared is 0.0225. So 1 - 1/gamma² = 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. Taking the square root of that, sqrt(0.9775) is approximately 0.9887. So beta is about 0.9887, which is v/c. So v is approximately 0.9887c, which is a high speed, about 0.9887 times the speed of light.

Now, putting it all together. The mean decay distance L is v * tau. So I need to compute tau first.

Tau is ħ / Gamma. Wait, but Gamma is in MeV, and ħ has units of GeV·s. Let me make sure about the units.

Let me recall that ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. Right, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV, and ħ is about 6.582e-25 GeV·s.

Wait, Gamma is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So Gamma = 0.32 GeV.

So tau = ħ / Gamma = (6.582e-25 GeV s) / (0.32 GeV)
