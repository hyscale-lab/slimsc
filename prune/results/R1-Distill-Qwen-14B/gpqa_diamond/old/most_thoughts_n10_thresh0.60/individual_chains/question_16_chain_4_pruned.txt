Okay, so I have this question about optical activity, and I need to figure out how many of the given compounds exhibit it. Let me start by recalling what optical activity means. A compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or if it's meso. Oh right, so I have to check each compound for chirality, considering possible internal planes of symmetry or if it's a meso compound.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, I'm thinking about the structure. The formula is Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3, but wait, no: but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but substituted as 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So structure is Cl attached to carbon 1, which is double-bonded to C2. And C2 has a methyl group. So the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no: wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, wait, wait. Let me think again.

But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon: ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, but that's butane. Alternatively, wait, the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So structure is Cl-C(=CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, perhaps better to write it as Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and another CH2CH3 group? Or wait, maybe it's (Z)-configuration.

Wait, but any way, since it's an alkene, if there's a double bond, could it have E/Z isomerism? Yes. But optical activity is about chirality, which requires a chiral center. So does this molecule have any? Let's see: the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-C(=CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but with substituents on the first and second carbons.

Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be: CH2Cl is not correct. Wait, maybe it's Cl attached to C1, which is double-bonded to C2, which has a methyl group.

So structure: Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2CH3? Wait, no, but but-1-ene is four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. So 1 is Cl, 2 is CH2CH3. Wait, no, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, but that would make it ClCH2-CH=CHCH3? No, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, but 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure is Cl–C(=CH₂)–CH(CH3)–CH3? No. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z) configuration, but more importantly, does it have a chiral center? Let me think: each carbon in the double bond (C1 and C2) is connected to two substituents. For C1: Cl, and two CH2 groups? Or wait, perhaps C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2 which has a methyl and another substituent. Wait, maybe the structure is Cl–C(=CH(CH3))–CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl–C(CH2CH3)=CH2–CH(CH3)? I'm getting a bit confused, but perhaps it's better to focus on the presence of a chiral center.

Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups (or maybe a CH2 and a CH group). Wait, perhaps C1 is CH2Cl, but that would make it CH2Cl–CH=CH–CH3. No, that would be 1-chlorobut-1-ene. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl attached to a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, but the main point is: does this compound have a chiral center?

Wait, a chiral center is a
