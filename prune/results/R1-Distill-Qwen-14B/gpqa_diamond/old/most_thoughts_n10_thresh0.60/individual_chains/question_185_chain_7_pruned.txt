Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the Pauli vector, right? So each component of σ is a Pauli matrix.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. And they're 2x2 matrices. The dot product σ · n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z, where n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The eigenvalues of Pauli matrices... wait, what's the general approach here? For any 2x2 Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are given by the trace and determinant. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way since this is a spin operator.

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues of ±1. Let me check. Oh yeah, each Pauli matrix, when squared, gives the identity matrix. So σ_x^2 = I, similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So for example, if you have σ · n, which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, the square would be (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2.

Expanding that, each σ_i squared is I, and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i. I think that cross terms would be 2 σ_i σ_j when i≠j, but wait, actually σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k when i≠j. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe when you square σ · n, you get I because n is a unit vector.

Wait, let me compute (σ · n)^2. So (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Multiplying term by term: each σ_i^2 is I, so the terms where i=j would be n_i² σ_i^2 = n_i² I. The cross terms would be n_i n_j σ_i σ_j for i≠j. Now, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. Wait, no, the product of two Pauli matrices is I δ_ij (if i
