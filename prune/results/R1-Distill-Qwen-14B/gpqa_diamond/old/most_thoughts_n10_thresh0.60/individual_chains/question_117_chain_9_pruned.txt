Alright, so I've got this chemistry question here about optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, meaning they can rotate plane-polarized light in opposite directions. These are also called enantiomers. So, the question is asking which of the given compounds show this property.

The question lists four organic compounds and four options to choose from. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**: Okay, biphenyl rings connected at position 1. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate esters at 2 and 2'. So, I'm thinking about the symmetry here. If the groups are all on the same side of the biphenyl, does it create a chiral center? Wait, wait. Wait, the biphenyl has two phenyl rings attached at one carbon each. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me visualize this. The molecule is symmetrical? If the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it won’t have optical isomerism. Alternatively, if the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it might be chiral.

Wait, if the substituents are at 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups, how does that affect symmetry? Let me think. The positions 2 and 6 on each ring are across from each other, right? So maybe the nitro groups are opposite each other, but the ester groups are on the same side. Or maybe the arrangement allows for the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that it lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl itself can have a certain conformation. Wait, biphenyls can have different dihedral angles, but for isomerism, the molecule must be chiral. So, if the substituents on the two benzene rings are arranged asymmetrically, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, let's think about the positions. The substituents at 2 and 2' – are these on the same side or opposite? If they are on the same side, then perhaps the molecule can be
