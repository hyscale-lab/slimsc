Okay, so I have this question about the redshift of clouds of neutral hydrogen and how they're detected using optical telescopes. Hmm, I remember that redshift is related to the expansion of the universe, right? The higher the redshift, the further away the object is. 

The question mentions that these clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, Lyman alpha is a specific emission line in hydrogen, right? It's the transition from n=2 to n=1, which emits ultraviolet light. But in this case, it's being absorbed by neutral hydrogen, so it's about absorption lines.

So, if the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen clouds, those absorption lines must be at a certain wavelength depending on the redshift. I think the observed wavelength lambda_obs is related to the rest wavelength lambda_rest by the redshift z: lambda_obs = lambda_rest * (1 + z). 

But wait, the quasar emits light across a spectrum, and the hydrogen clouds absorb at their rest wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So for us to observe that absorption, the quasar's emitted light must reach us through the cloud, but the part at 1216 Angstroms is absorbed. But how does this relate to the redshift?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up emission and absorption. Oh, right, the quasar emits light across a broad spectrum, and any intervening material will absorb at certain wavelengths. So when we look at the quasar's spectrum, we'll see a dark absorption line at
