Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Hmm, I remember that in such wells, the energy levels are quantized. Each particle's energy depends on its quantum number. The formula given is E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), which I think is the base energy for the ground state, so the first level. Then, higher states would have higher energies based on n², right?

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they can have two possible spins: up or down. But since they're identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers. That includes their spatial part and spin part.

So for each spatial state (defined by n), the spin part can have two possible states. That means each n can be occupied by two particles with opposite spins.

The system has four particles. So how many energy levels do we need to accommodate all four?

Let me think. Each level n can hold up to 2 particles (because of spin up and down). So for four particles:

Ground state would have the lowest energy levels filled. So the first two n's: n=1 and n=2, each holding two particles. Because 2 particles in n=1 (spin up and down), and 2 in n=2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, no: for each n, two particles can occupy the same n because of spin. So for four particles:

n=1: 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: 2 particles (spin up and down)
So that's four particles total.

Wait, but if that's the case, then all four particles are in the lowest two energy levels. So the ground state has all four, with n=1 and n=2 each filled with two particles.

So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. Each particle in n=1 has energy E, and each in n=2 has energy 4E (since E proportional to n², so n=2 gives (2)^2 E =4E).

So for the ground state:

Number of particles in n=1: 2, each contributing E → 2E
Number in n=2: 2, each contributing 4E → 8E
Total for ground state: 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but that's the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait no. Oh wait, no. Each particle in n=1 is E, and each in n=2 is 4E. Since there are two in each, the total energy is 2*(E +4E) = 2*5E=10E. Hmm, but wait no, no. Let me recount.

No, wait. Two particles in n=1: each has energy E, so 2 * E. Two particles in n=2: each has energy 4E, so 2 *4E. So total energy is 2E +8E =10E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but
