Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves a series of reactions starting from a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then it goes through several steps, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product.

Let me break down each step.

First, step one: combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Hmm, okay, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups. Wait, maybe this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Because the first compound is a diene, and the other has dienophiles? Or maybe it's a coupling reaction. Wait, no, the other molecule has two dibromomethyl groups on a cyclohexadiene. Oh wait, sodium iodide is often used in substitution reactions, especially with vicinal dihalides. So maybe this is a ring-opening or some kind of coupling.

Wait, another thought: when you have a dienophile with two leaving groups, and you have a diene, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the first compound is a bicyclic diene. Let me think about the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene would have two double bonds, or maybe one? Wait, the name is hepta-2,5-diene, so two double bonds. Hmm, but the other compound is cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Oh wait, no, the other is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each cyclohexadiene has two carbons substituted with dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6.

Wait, sodium iodide is a source of iodide ions, which can substitute bromides. So perhaps each dibromomethyl group is undergoing an SN2 substitution. Wait, but two equivalents are used. So each di-bromo group would substitute twice
