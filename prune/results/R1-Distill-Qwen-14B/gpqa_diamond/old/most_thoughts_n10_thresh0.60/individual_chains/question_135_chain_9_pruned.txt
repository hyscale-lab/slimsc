Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, I need to figure out the possible decay channels for this boson X based on the given Lagrangian and its mass. Let me try to break this down.

First, the problem gives me the Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, what does this mean? Oh right, the Lagrangian describes the interaction between the boson field X and the fermion fields. The term looks like it's a Yukawa interaction because it's similar to the form of Yukawa's theory, which describes the interaction between scalar bosons and fermions.

In the Lagrangian, the interaction term has (v + X(y)), where v is probably the vacuum expectation value (vev). But wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs field gets a vev, and it interacts with fermions via Yukawa coupling. So maybe X is similar to the Higgs boson here? But the mass here is given as 6 GeV, which is much lighter than the Higgs which is about 125 GeV. Hmm, maybe it's a different kind of scalar.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. So when it decays, it needs to produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The decay products must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, a particle can only decay into particles whose total mass is less than its own. So I need to find all the fermion pairs that satisfy that condition.

Fermions come in different types. The known fermions are quarks (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top) and leptons (electron, muon, tau, and their neutrinos). But wait, neutrinos are very light, almost massless. So if X is a boson, it could decay into a pair of neutrinos, but that's probably negligible unless the neutrinos are very light. But in this problem, probably the fermions are charged leptons and quarks.

So, X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The mass of each fermion must be less than half of X's mass, right? Because the maximum mass each can have is when
