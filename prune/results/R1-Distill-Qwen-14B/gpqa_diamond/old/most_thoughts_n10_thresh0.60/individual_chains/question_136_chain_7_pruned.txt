Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. 

Alright, the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. Wait, so f is a radial vector field, which means its components in the theta and phi directions are zero. So in spherical coordinates, it's only the r-component that's non-zero.

The problem is asking for the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere. Oh right, that's the divergence theorem scenario. Because the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the field over the boundary.

But wait, I don't know if I should use the divergence theorem here. Alternatively, I could calculate the divergence in spherical coordinates and then integrate it over the volume.

Let me think about the divergence formula in spherical coordinates. For a vector field F = (F_r, F_θ, F_φ), the divergence is given by:

∇ · F = (1/r²) ∂(r² F_r)/∂r + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂(F_θ sinθ)/∂θ + (1/(r sinθ)) ∂F_φ/∂φ

But in this case, the vector field has only the radial component. So F_θ and F_φ are zero. That simplifies the divergence to just the first term: (1/r²) d/d r (r² F_r) 

Since F_r is given as 1/r², let me plug that in. So F_r = 1/r². 

So substitute into the divergence:

∇ · f = (1/r²) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Simplify inside the brackets: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, the divergence ∇ · f = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin where r=0, since 1/r² blows up there. Oh right, because the field is 1/r², which isn't defined at r=0. So the divergence is zero everywhere else, but there's a point singularity at the origin.

But the integral is over the volume, including the origin. So the volume integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius R would be the integral of zero everywhere except at a single point. But in terms of integration, a single point has measure zero. So the integral would be zero.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. If the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then integrating over the volume would give zero, because the integrand is zero almost everywhere. So the integral would be zero.

Alternatively, if I apply the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence equals the flux through the surface. But in this case, the flux would be the integral of F · n over the surface of the sphere. F is radial and equal to 1/r². So on the surface at radius R, F is 1/R² in the radial direction. The normal vector n is also radial. So F · n = (1/R²) * R
