Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember that the notation [Element/Element] represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number of those elements compared to the Sun. So, for example, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means that the ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times the ratio in the Sun.

Wait, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So I need to calculate [n_Si_1 / n_Si_2], I think.

Let me list the given data:

Star_1:
- Mass: 1.5 solar masses
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0

Star_2:
- Mass: 1.2 solar masses
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0

Sun's photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Wait, wait, no, wait. The notation is 12 + log(nX/nH) = value. So for Fe, it's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = 7.5-12= -4.5 → so nFe/nH =10^(-4.5) = approx 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg in the Sun: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Wait, but I might not need the Sun's Mg/H ratio directly, but let's see.

Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as the Sun's. So [Fe/H]_1 = log(nFe1/nH1) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun) =0 → So nFe1/nH1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So nFe1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * nH1.

Wait, but the same would apply for Star_2: [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg2/nH2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun.

But how do I get nSi for each star?

For Star_1, [Si
