Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector. 

Wait, first, I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors since an electron is a spin-1/2 particle. So the state (3i, 4) must be a column vector with components [3i; 4], right? So the electron is in a spin state χ = [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh, but wait, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. I think the S_y operator is related to the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh right! The spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The Pauli σ_y matrix is given as:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So putting that together, S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

Now, I need to compute the expectation value. Let's break it down. 

First, I'll write the state as a column vector. So χ is [3i; 4]. But wait, wait. When you compute the expectation value, you need to take the conjugate transpose (bra) of χ, multiply by S_y, then multiply by χ again.

So let's compute each part step by step.

The conjugate transpose of χ, which is χ†, would be the row vector [ -3 (since (3i)* is -3i?), wait no, wait. Wait, 3i is the first component. The complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ] as a row vector? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the original vector is [3i;4]. So χ† would be [3i*, 4*]. 3i is a complex number; its conjugate is -3i. 4 is real, so its conjugate is 4.

So χ† = [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, I need to compute χ† multiplied by S_y, then multiply that with χ. Alternatively, since S_y is an operator, perhaps it's better to compute S_y acting on χ first, then multiply by χ†.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute χ† * S_y * χ.

Let me think. Let me compute S_y χ first.

S_y is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So when I apply S_y to χ, which is [3i;4], I get:

S_y χ = (ħ/2) * [ 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 , i*3i + 0*4 ]^T.

Wait wait, matrix multiplication. Let's compute it step by step.

Each component of the resulting vector is
