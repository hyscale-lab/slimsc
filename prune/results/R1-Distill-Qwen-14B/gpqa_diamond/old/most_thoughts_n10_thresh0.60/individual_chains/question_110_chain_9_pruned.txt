Okay, so I have this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure out which stars are visible to both instruments based on their magnitudes and other factors. Let's start by understanding the problem.

The question gives me five stars (Star1 to Star5) each with different properties. For each star, I think I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude because the spectrographs have limits on how bright (or dim, in terms of magnitude) the stars they can observe are.

Wait, the question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. Wait, no, wait. Oh, it says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed." Wait, but in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So magnitude 17 is dimmer than, say, magnitude 16. So ESPRESSO can see stars up to 17 mag, meaning it can't see stars brighter than 17? Wait, no, wait. No, I think I got that wrong. Let me think. The higher the magnitude, the dimmer the star. So, if a telescope can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17, that means it can observe stars with magnitude 17 or lower (since lower magnitudes mean brighter). So for example, a star with V mag 17 is the dimmest it can see. A star with V mag 16 is brighter, so it's also visible.

Wait, no, no. I think the way it's phrased is that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag. So that would mean stars with V magnitudes less than 17. Because, for example, a star with V mag 16 is brighter than 17, so it's visible. Similarly, a star with V mag 15 is also visible, but a star with V mag 18 would be too dim.

Wait, maybe I should check. Oh wait, the question says: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed." So, a star with apparent V magnitude = 17 is at the limit. So, stars with V mag <=17 are detectable by ESPRESSO. Because brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So a V mag of 17 is
