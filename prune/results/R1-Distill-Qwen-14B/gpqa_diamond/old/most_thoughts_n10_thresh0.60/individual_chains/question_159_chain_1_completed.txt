Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar observed in the near infrared and optical spectrum. The peak is at around 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, wait, what does that tell me about the quasar? Oh right, I think that when we observe objects with redshift, their emission lines can be stretched into longer wavelengths. So if the peak is at 790 nm, maybe that's due to some emission line being redshifted.

Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's way longer. So the redshift z would be (observed - emitted)/emitted. So 790 - 121 is 669, so z = 669 / 121 ≈ 5.528. So z is about 5.53.

Now the question is about the comoving distance of the quasar. The universe here follows Lambda-CDM model parameters: Hubble constant H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm is 0.3, dark energy Ωλ is 0.7, and it's flat (so Ωk=0).

Comoving distance is the distance we use to express the position of objects in the universe based on their redshift, assuming the universe is expanding. The formula for comoving distance D_C is c multiplied by the integral from 0 to z of dz' / H(z'), where H(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + Ωλ).

But integrating this exactly is complicated, and I'm not going to do it by hand. I think there are some standard approximations or look-up tables for comoving distances based on H0, Ωm, and redshift.

Wait, I remember that for z around 5, the comoving distance is on the order of a few gigaparsecs. Let me think, what do I know about the relation between redshift and distance? The Hubble law says that velocity v ≈ H0 * distance, but that's only for small z. For larger z, the relation isn't linear anymore because you have to account for the expansion history.

So for z=5.5, we need to calculate the comoving distance. Let me think about the formula again: D_C = (c/H0) * integral from 0 to z of dz' / E(z'), where E(z)=sqrt(Ωm*(1+z')^3 + Ωλ).

Hmm, but how do I calculate that integral? I don't have a calculator, so I need to approximate or recall some standard values.

I remember that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at high redshifts can be found using the so-called "comoving distance formula" or perhaps look-up tables. Alternatively, I might have encountered some standard values.

Wait, for example, at z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc (but wait, that's without considering H0). Wait, with H0=70, the Hubble distance is c/H0. Let me compute that. The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. So c/H0 = 3e5 /70 ≈ 4285.7 Mpc. Which is about 4.286 Gpc.

So, D_C would be this value multiplied by the integral. So for various redshifts, how does the integral look?

Wait, perhaps I can approximate the integral. Let me think about the function E(z). E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). So as z increases, the (1+z)^3 term dominates, so E(z) increases, which means 1/E(z) decreases. The integral from 0 to z of 1/E(z') dz' is thus adding up smaller and smaller fractions as z increases.

But without the exact integral, maybe I can recall that for Ωm=0.3, Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is about 10 Gpc. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of how D_C scales with these parameters.

Alternatively, maybe using the approximation that for high z, the universe's expansion is dominated by dark energy. Wait, no, at high z, matter dominates because (1+z)^3 grows quickly, so Ωm*(1+z)^3 would be much larger than Ωλ. So as z increases, E(z) approaches (1+z)^(3/2), because Ωm*(1+z)^3 dominates over Ωλ.

Wait, but at z=5.5, (1+z)=6.5, so (6.5)^3 is 274.625. Multiply by Ωm=0.3 gives 82.3875. Ωλ is 0.7, so E(z) would be sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) = sqrt(83.0875) ≈ 9.115. So E(z)=9.115. So 1/E(z)=0.1097.

But wait, that's at z=5.5. For the integral from 0 to 5.5, I need to evaluate 1/E(z') for each z' and sum up. This is getting complicated. Maybe I can approximate the integral for high z.

Wait, for z >> 1, E(z) ≈ sqrt(Ωm (1+z)^3) ) = (1+z)^(3/2) sqrt(Ωm). So 1/E(z) ≈ (1+z)^(-3/2) / sqrt(Ωm).

Thus, the integral from z=0 to z=Z of dz/(E(z)) ≈ integral from 0 to Z [ (1+z')^(-3/2) / sqrt(Ωm) ) ] dz'.

Which is (1/sqrt(Ωm)) * integral (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'.

Let u = 1 + z' → du=dz'. The integral becomes ∫ from u=1 to u=1+Z of u^(-3/2) du.

Which is [ (-2) u^(-1/2) ) ] from 1 to 1+Z → (-2)(1/sqrt(1+Z) - 1).

So the integral is (2)(1 - 1/sqrt(1+Z)) / sqrt(Ωm).

Substituting back, the comoving distance D_C would be (c/H0) * (2)(1 - 1/sqrt(1+Z)) / sqrt(Ωm).

Wait, but this is an approximation for large Z, where matter dominates. Let's plug in Z=5.5.

So sqrt(Ωm) = sqrt(0.3) ≈ 0.5477.

Then, 2 / 0.5477 ≈ 3.651.

So, [1 - 1/sqrt(6.5)] → sqrt(6.5) is about 2.5495. So 1/2.5495 ≈ 0.392. So 1 - 0.392 ≈ 0.608.

Multiply 3.651 * 0.608 ≈ approximately 2.217.

Then D_C ≈ (c/H0) * 2.217.

Earlier, we calculated c/H0 as about 4.286 Gpc.

So 4.286 * 2.217 ≈ 9.51 Gpc.

Hmm, but wait. That's an approximation. The exact integral will be a bit larger or smaller?

Wait, because in reality, dark energy starts to have some effect even at z=5.5. So our approximation might underestimate the integral because dark energy becomes more dominant at lower redshifts but less so at higher. Wait, no, at high z, matter dominates, so dark energy's contribution is less. So the integral we calculated is for the matter-dominated era. But maybe for z=5.5, the dark energy's contribution is negligible, so this approximation is acceptable.

Wait, but I think a more accurate method would be to compute the integral numerically. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for Ωm=0.3, the comoving distance at z=5 is about 10 Gpc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the Hubble distance is c/H0. So with H0=70, c=3e5 km/s, so Hubble distance is about 3e5 /70 = 4285.7 Mpc, which is 4.286 Gpc.

The comoving distance for a given redshift is (c/H0) multiplied by the integral of 1/E(z) dz from 0 to z.

So for z=5.5, perhaps the integral is about 2.2, so D_C is about 4.286 * 2.2 ≈ 9.43 Gpc.

Looking at the options, the choices are 6, 7,8,9 Gpc.

Option C is 9 Gpc. So the closest would be 9 Gpc.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact value. Also, my approximation considered only matter dominance, but perhaps dark energy has a slight effect.

Alternatively, let's consider that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3 and Ωλ=0.7, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 10 Gpc. But wait, I'm not certain. Maybe I should think about the scale.

Another thought: the age of the universe at z=5 is about 1.7 billion years. Wait, but how does that relate to distance? Maybe not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, I can think about standard candles. For example, if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, and the emitted is 121 nm, the redshift is about 5.5. So that's a high redshift. So the comoving distance should be in the range of a few gigaparsecs, but how exactly?

Wait, I think I've read that for a flat universe with Ωm=0.3, the comoving distance at z=5 is approximately 10 Gpc. But I'm not exactly certain.

Wait, another approach: the Hubble parameter H(z) = H0 * sqrt(Ωm(1+z)^3 + Ωλ). So when z is large, H(z) ~ H0*(1+z)^(3/2)*sqrt(0.3).

But integrating 1/H(z) from 0 to z involves solving ∫ dz/(H0 * sqrt(0.3 (1+z')^3 + 0.7)).

This integral is not straightforward, but perhaps I can use a calculator or a table. Since I can't do that, I'll have to make an educated guess.

Alternatively, perhaps the comoving distance for z=5.5 with these parameters is around 9 Gpc. So the answer would be option C) 9 Gpc.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again about my approximation.

Earlier, I had D_C ≈ (c/H0) * (2.217) ≈ 4.286 * 2.217 ≈ 9.5 Gpc. So that's close to 9.5, which would round to 10. But since the options are 6,7,8,9 Gpc, perhaps 9 is the intended answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation would yield around 9 Gpc.

So the answer should be option C) 9 Gpc.


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar with a redshift \( z \approx 5.5 \) in a flat Lambda-CDM universe, where the Hubble constant \( H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc} \), matter density parameter \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \), and dark energy density parameter \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \). The observed wavelength of a spectral line is 790 nm, which corresponds to a redshifted Lyman-alpha line (\( \lambda_{\text{emitted}} = 121 \, \text{nm} \)), giving \( z \approx 5.5 \).

The comoving distance \( D_C \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{E(z')},
\]

where \( E(z') = \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda} \). For high redshifts (\( z \gg 1 \)), matter dominates the energy density, and \( E(z') \approx \sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3} \). This simplifies the integral, but exact numerical integration is required for precision. Approximations and standard results for a flat universe with \( \Omega_m = 0.3 \) and \( \Omega_\lambda = 0.7 \) suggest that the comoving distance at \( z \approx 5.5 \) is approximately 9 Gpc.

Given the options, the closest and most reasonable estimate for the comoving distance is **9 Gpc**.
