Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some processes happening in the immune system. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. When they looked via imaging, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh, right, the stomach has a lot of acid, so that probably denatures some proteins. But some made it through and got stuck in the intestinal mucus. Then they reached the secondary lymphoid organs, like Peyer's patches. They isolated the proliferating cells and looked at their variable heavy chain genes, which showed high variability.

Hmm, what processes are these about? So, secondary lymphoid organs are where immune responses get initiated. Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, right? They're involved in mucosal immunity, which makes sense because the rotavirus was delivered orally.

The variable heavy chain gene's high variability suggests some kind of diversification. I remember that during an immune response, B cells undergo certain processes to increase diversity. So the options are about those processes.

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This occurs in B cells after they've been activated. It increases the diversity of the B cell receptors, allowing for better antigen binding. This happens in the germinal centers during the immune response.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, helping to tag pathogens for phagocytosis. Doesn't directly cause variability in the heavy chains.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't change the variable regions. So it's about the type of antibody produced, not the variability.

D) VDJ recombination: This is during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow. It's the process where V, D, and J segments are combined to create the variable region. But this happens during B cell development, not during a response.

So, the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes after exposure suggests that the B cells are undergoing some process that diversifies their receptors. That's somatic hypermutation. Because when the rotavirus antigens are presented, the B cells get activated, form germinal centers, and undergo somatic hypermutation to increase the diversity of their antibodies, leading to a more robust immune response.

Therefore, the process taking place is somatic hypermutation. So the answer should be A.


The question involves rotavirus capsid proteins tagged with GFP being delivered to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while others are entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer's patches. Upon isolating the proliferating cell population and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes, high variability is observed. This suggests a process that diversifies the B cell receptor variable regions.

To analyze the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in activated B cells during the immune response, particularly in germinal centers, where it increases the diversity of B cell receptors to improve antigen binding. This aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variability of the variable heavy chain genes.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the heavy chain.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during the initial development of B cell receptors in the bone marrow, combining V, D, and J segments to form the variable region. However, it does not explain the observed variability after antigen exposure.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes indicates that the B cells are undergoing somatic hypermutation, a process that diversifies the B cell receptors during the immune response. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
