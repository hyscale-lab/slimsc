Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n, which lies in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like this are often related to angular momentum, especially spin operators.

Wait, but the operator is called P, not S. Oh, but muons are leptons, and their spin is 1/2, similar to electrons. So the operator P probably represents the spin component along a certain direction. Since it's given in terms of its X, Y, and Z components, I think these are the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So, P_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which has elements [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, which is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right, any direction can be represented by a unit vector n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) or something like that. But since it's in the x-z plane, the angle φ is zero? Wait, no, the x-z plane would have angles where φ is 0 or π or something. Wait, no, wait—the x-z plane is where y=0, so the polar angle θ would be measured from the z-axis, and the azimuthal angle φ would be 0 or π. Or perhaps φ is 90 degrees for x-y, but no, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Wait, no, the x-z plane is defined by φ=0 or π, because in spherical coordinates, the angle φ is measured from the x-axis when looking from the origin. So, the x-z plane would have φ=0 or π. So the direction n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because for φ=0, cosφ=1, sinφ=0. So n is a vector in the x-z plane, and we're to find the eigenvector of the operator P along n.

Wait, the operator P along direction n would be P.n, which is P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P.n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Given that, the operator we're interested in is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. And we want the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Since the eigenvalue is ħ/2, and the operator is P_n, the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Alternatively, another way to think about this: since P is a spin-1/2 operator, the eigenstates are spin-up and spin-down along direction n. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. We need the spin-up state.

Wait, but the eigenvectors of P_n are the same as the eigenstates of the spin along n. So the eigenvectors can be written in terms of the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices.

But perhaps it's easier to construct the matrix P_n and then find its eigenvectors.

So, let's compute P_n. Let me write down each component:

n is [n_x, 0, n_z], because it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, wait: n is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_z² = 1, since n_y=0.

So, P_n = n_x (ħ/2) σ_x + n_z (ħ/2) σ_z.

But σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], and σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-
