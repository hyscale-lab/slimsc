Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

The problem says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation means a two-component spinor. So the state vector is a column vector with components 3i and 4. So it's χ = [3i; 4]. But wait, I remember that spin states are usually represented as column vectors in a two-dimensional space because electrons have spin-1/2, right?

The expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ | Ŝy | χ⟩. Oh right, the expectation value is the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator acting on the state vector.

I need to recall what the spin operator S_y is. The problem gives it in matrix form as σ_y (the Pauli matrix for y), which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. But wait, the spin operator S is ħ/2 times σ. Because the spin angular momentum operator is S = (ħ/2)σ. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y. That's important because the units depend on it.

So let me write down the components again. χ is [3i; 4]. So I'll need to compute the expectation value as χ† S_y χ. Wait, let's make sure about
