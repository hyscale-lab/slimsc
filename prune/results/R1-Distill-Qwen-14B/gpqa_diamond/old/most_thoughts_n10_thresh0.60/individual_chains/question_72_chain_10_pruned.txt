Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions. But let's take it step by step. 

The question is about a series of reactions starting with a compound and ending up with a product. The final step is about counting the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. Let's break down each reaction to figure out what's happening.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I think this is a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds. The substituent is tert-butoxy at position 7. So the structure has a bridge, and the tert-butoxy group is attached to one of the bridgehead carbons.

The first reaction is with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, especially in a polar aprotic solvent, but wait, the question says elevated temperature. Oh, maybe it's an elimination or substitution reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction? Wait, the starting material is a diene, and the other compound is a dienophile? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That structure has two double bonds. Wait, cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a conjugated diene. So, positions 5 and 6 each have a dibromomethyl substituent. So each of those carbons (5 and 6) has two CH2Br groups attached? Or wait, 'bis(dibromomethyl)' probably means each of the two positions (5 and 6) have two bromomethyl groups? Or it's a di-substitution on each of the carbons 5 and 6?

Wait, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each of the positions 5 and 6 has a dibromomethyl group. Dibromomethyl would be a CH2Br2 group? Wait, no. Dibromomethyl is Br2CH2, but wait, that's not possible because a CH2 group can have two bromines attached. So, each substituent is CH2Br2? But that can't be right because CH2Br2 is a single group. Wait, maybe it's a 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl) group, meaning each of the 5 and 6 positions has two methyl groups, each with two bromines? Or perhaps each substituent is a methyl group with two bromines attached, i.e., CBr2. So each substituent is a CBr2H2 group? Or wait, maybe each substituent is a CH2Br group, and there are two of them on each of the 5 and 6 positions. So for each of the 5 and 6 positions, there are two CH2Br groups. So the structure would be:

Cyclohexa
