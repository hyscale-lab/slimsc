Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the product of the Cope rearrangement for this compound: (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, which typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. But wait, this compound isn't a diene but has a bicyclic structure with an azabicyclo ring. Oh right, I think the Cope rearrangement can also occur in some cyclic structures, especially those that can form the necessary conjugated dienes upon rearrangement.

So, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene system. Let me try to visualize the structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a five-membered and a three-membered ring? Wait no, bicyclo[2.2.1] has two bridges. The numbering is such that the bridgehead carbons are at positions 1 and 4. So, the molecule is a norbornene derivative, with a substituent at position 2 being a vinyl group, and an azabicyclo, meaning a nitrogen is part of the ring.

Wait, the structure: 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the nitrogen is at position 2, and there's a vinyl group (CH2CH2?) Wait, no
