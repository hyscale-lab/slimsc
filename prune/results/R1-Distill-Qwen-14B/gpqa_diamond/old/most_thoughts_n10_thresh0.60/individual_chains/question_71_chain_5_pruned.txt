Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Let's break it down step by step.

Alright, the question says there are five planets in a system, all with circular orbits. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But wait, the TTV method is used to detect planets by the gravitational influence on each other, causing variations in their transits. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. The key part is that the planets are in orbital resonance, which usually means their orbital periods have a ratio of small integers, but the given ratios are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. Hmm, that's interesting because 2.5 and 3.5 aren't integers, but perhaps they are part of a larger ratio.

The orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P. Then Planet_2 is 2P, Planet_3 is 2.5P, Planet_4 is 3.5P, and Planet_5 is 5P. 

The question is about equilibrium temperatures. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star. The formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 - e^2) )^(1/2) ), but wait, that's probably not necessary. Since all the planets have the same albedo, and their orbits are circular (so e=0), the albedo cancels out. So the main factor would be their distance from the star.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula, when considering only the star's luminosity and the planet's distance, is T = T_eff * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) / ( (1 + ... ) )? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me get this right.

The equilibrium temperature (T) of a planet is given by the equation:

T = T_★ × sqrt(R_★ / (2a)) × ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Wait, no, that's for a star's light. Wait, equilibrium temperature is based on the balance between incoming and outgoing radiation. The formula I recall is:

T_p = T_★ * sqrt( R_★ / (2 a_p) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4)

Wait, not exactly. Let me think. The formula for a planet's equilibrium temperature is:

T = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ a²) ]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, A is the planet's albedo, a is the semi-major axis (distance), σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Since all planets have the same albedo (A is same for all), and L and σ are constants for the star, the temperature ratio would depend on the inverse square root of the ratio of their a² (distances squared), because the formula involves a^(-2) inside the fourth root.

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature is invers
