Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically dealing with vectors and gene expression. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

So, the setup is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The question is about why there's no green signal when they look under the confocal microscope. The green comes from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor.

The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs in one transcript. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. So, the ligand would be first, then the receptor.

The vector has specific elements. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed as a separate protein from the same transcript, after the ligand.

But wait, the ligand's ORF has a stop in a loxP cassette, and the receptor has a stop in a lox2272 cassette. Oh right, those are loxP sites used for Cre-mediated recombination. So, the idea is that Cre will excise these stop cassettes, allowing the genes to be expressed.

So, if you have Cre, it will recognize the lox sites. LoxP and lox2272 are different, and Cre can't recombine between them. So the ligand's stop is flanked by loxP, and the receptor's stop is flanked by lox2272.

In the problem, they used a mouse model homozygous for the construct, crossed to SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, I think, so the Cre should be active in those cells. So, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest-derived cells, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the Western blot, after transfecting the vector into primary astrocytes, the antibodies against overexpressed proteins show a signal proportional to actin. So expression is happening in the cells. But when they look in the mouse model, no green signal. So, the eGFP isn't being expressed, or not in the same cells as the ligand.

Wait, but why would the Western blot show a signal? The plasmid is transfected into astrocytes. Oh, because in the plasmid, the ligand and receptor are both expressed because Cre isn't present in the culture presumably. The stop cassettes are in place, but without Cre, they don't get excised. Wait, no—without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent expression. But in the question, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocytes, so I'm confused. Wait, in the plasmid, the stop cassettes are present—so the ligand is under CBA promoter, but if the stop is in between, without Cre, the ORF would be interrupted. So how would the ligand and receptor be expressed?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The ligand is at the 5' end, followed by a stop in a loxP cassette. So the construct is something like CBA promoter, ligand ORF, then loxP stop loxP, then mCherry. Then IRES, receptor ORF, lox2272 stop lox2272, then eGFP.

So without Cre, the ligand is followed by a stop, so only the ligand would be expressed (if at all), but wait, in the plasmid, would the stop prevent the ligand from being expressed? Because the ORF would end at the stop. But the ligand is fused to mCherry. Hmm, but
