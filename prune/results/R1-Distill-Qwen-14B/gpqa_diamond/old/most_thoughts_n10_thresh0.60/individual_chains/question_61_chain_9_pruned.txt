Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with benzene being treated with HNO3 and H2SO4 to form product 1. I remember that nitric acid is a nitrating agent, and sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst. Benzene under these conditions undergoes nitration. So nitration typically adds a nitro group. Where does it go? Since benzene is symmetric, the nitration should form nitrobenzene. Wait, but wait, sometimes the position depends on other factors. Oh, right, nitration of benzene is a meta-directing group when it's a strong nitration condition. No, wait, actually, nitro groups are meta directors. So when benzene reacts with HNO3 and H2SO4, it forms nitrobenzene as product 1. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder to form product 2. Iron and bromine usually act as a catalyst for electrophilic substitution. Oh, wait, no, iron with Br2 is for bromination, but wait, in the presence of Fe, Br2 is used for substitution reactions. But wait, does it add a bromine? So when we have a nitro group, which is a meta director, the bromine will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group.

Product 1 is nitrobenzene. Adding Br2 with Fe as a catalyst would brominate it. So where will the Br go? Nitro is meta directing. So in nitrobenzene, the Br will add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. Wait, nitro is at position 1, then the Br would be at position 3? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me visualize nitrobenzene. The benzene ring has a nitro group in one position, say position 1. Then, the bromine would enter in position 3 or 4? Wait, nitro is a meta director, so the Br should come in the meta position, which would be position 4, but wait, wait: no, the nitro group is at position 1. So the meta would be positions 3 and 5? Or I'm getting confused.

Wait, in nitrobenzene, the nitro group is in position 1. The meta positions are 3 and 5
