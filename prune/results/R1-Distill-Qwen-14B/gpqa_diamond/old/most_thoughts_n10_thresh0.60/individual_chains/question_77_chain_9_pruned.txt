Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about two reactions, A and B, and I need to pick the correct major products from the options given. Let's start by breaking down each reaction.

First, Reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+.

BuLi is a strong base, a good nucleophile. It's often used to deprotonate compounds, especially at acidic positions. The structure of the starting material is a benzene ring with an ether group attached. The ether group is OCH2CH(CH2CH3)CH2. Wait, no, let me clarify. Let's see, the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Because but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but wait, 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with a substituent. Wait, but if it's 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl, the structure is CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-? No, wait: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So for 3-methyl substitution, the substituent is on the third carbon, but wait, in a four-carbon chain (but), the positions are 1,2,3,4. So the double bond is between 2 and 3 (but-2-ene). So the substituent at position 3 would be on the third carbon, which is CH2. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the substituent. The substituent is OCH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2. Because but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but with a methyl on the third carbon, so it's CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2-? Or maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. Let me write but-2-en-1-yl: it's CH2=CHCH2CH2- where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, and the substituent is at position 1. So if it's 3-methyl, that's a methyl group on carbon 3, which is the middle carbon of the double bond.

Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- (since but is four carbons, and the substituent is at position 1). So with a methyl on position 3, that would be CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH2CH2-? No, that
