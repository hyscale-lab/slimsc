Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

Alright, so the setup is about white lupine and resistance to anthracnose, which is a fungal disease. They did an experiment with knock-out mutants and double mutants. The goal is to find out which genes are involved in resistance.

They have three genes: G1, G2, G3. The knock-out mutants are g1, g2, g3. Also, the double mutants are g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. The data given is the percentage of resistance compared to the wild-type (100%).

The results are:
- g1: 75% (so less resistance, but not super bad)
- g2: 0% (no resistance at all)
- g3: 50% (half the resistance)
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0% (again, no resistance)
- g1g2: 0% (no resistance)

Wait, and the question says that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, transcription factors are usually regulatory proteins that turn on other genes. So if a TF is knocked out, the downstream genes it activates might not work, leading to lower resistance.

Now, looking at the data:

First, the single mutants:

g2 has 0% resistance. That's bad; the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. So maybe G2 is a critical gene, perhaps a transcription factor. Because if its function is missing, everything downstream stops. For example, if G2 is a TF that activates other genes, knocking it out would disable those genes, leading to no resistance.

G1: 75% resistance. So the plant is still somewhat resistant but less than wild-type. Maybe G1 is involved but not absolutely essential. Or maybe it's a component that works in parallel to another pathway.

G3: 50%â€”so it's half as resistant. So knocking out G3 reduces resistance but doesn't eliminate it. Hmm.

Now the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (so when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is gone. Wait, but G2's knockout alone already gives 0% resistance. So adding G1 knockout doesn't make it worse, because G2 knockout already gives 0. So perhaps G1 is part of another pathway that's separate from the one controlled by G2.

Wait, but when G2 is knocked out, resistance is zero. So any double mutant that includes g2 (g1g2, g2g3) also has 0% resistance. So maybe G2 is in a pathway that is required for resistance.

Looking at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% resistance. That's really low. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, resistance is almost gone.

g2g3: 0% (so same as g2 alone, because G2 knockout already gives 0% anyway). So it doesn't matter if G3 is also knocked out.

g1g2: 0% (again, same as g2 alone).

So what's the hierarchy here?

If G2 is a transcription factor, then it's probably upstream of other genes. Let's think: G2 could be activating G1 and G3. Or maybe G1 and G3 are downstream of G2. Alternatively, maybe G2 is part of a redundant pathway.

Wait, another possibility is that G2 is a transcription factor that directly activates another gene, say, a resistance gene. But when G2 is knocked out, that gene's expression is lost, leading to no resistance. But the single mutant g3 has 50% resistance, which suggests that G3 is not the only gene involved. Maybe G3 is another gene that's
