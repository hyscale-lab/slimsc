Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me think this through.

The question says that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I remember that dipole transitions are governed by the selection rules. Right, the selection rules for electrons in hydrogen (non-relativistic) state transitions are based on the quantum numbers n, l, m.

The selection rules are usually: Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1, and Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but for dipole transitions, the main ones are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, but wait—wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>, so l is 0. So when it transitions, the next l has to be l±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. Because l can't be negative. So the first transition must be from l=0 to l=1.

So the first step is from n=3, l=0, m=0 to n=2 or something, but l must be 1. Because the selection rule is Δl=±1. So the possible l after transition is 1.

Wait, the initial state is 3,0,0. So it's n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It decays via two dipole transitions. So first transition: from 3,0,0 to something, then that state transitions to 1,0,0.

Wait, but the final state is |1,0,0>, which has l=0. So in the second transition, the l has to go from 1 to 0 again. Oh, but wait, for each dipole transition, the l changes by ±1. So first transition: l=0 → l=1 or l=-1, but l can't be negative, so l=1. Second transition: l=1 → l=0. So yeah, that makes sense.

So the first transition is from (3,0,0) to some (2,1, m). Hmm, wait, n can change by more than 1, but each dipole transition can change n by 1 or 2? Or can it change by any number as long as l changes by 1. Oh wait, the selection rules for n are more permissive. So from n=3, the next state could be n=2 or n=1, as long as l changes correctly.

But in this case, since the second transition must bring it to n=1, because the final state is |1,0,0>, which is n=1. So the first transition must go from n=3 to n=2, because if it went to n=1 in the first transition, then the second transition would have to go to n=0 or something, which isn't possible for hydrogen. So the first transition must take n=3 → n=2.

So the first transition is from 3,0,0 → 2,1, m. What m can it be? The selection rule for m is Δm = 0, ±1. So m can change by 0, +1, or -1. But the initial m is 0, so the possible m for the first state after transition are -1, 0, +1. So the possible states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,1>.

Then, in the next transition, from 2,1,m to 1,0,0. So for m: the initial state here is m', and the next state has m=0. So Δm = -m', because m is going from m' to 0. So m' can be 0, ±1. Because Δm is 0, +1, or -1.

Wait, let's think. The second state after the first transition has
