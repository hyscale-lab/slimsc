Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks like it's in two dimensions because I see dx and dy. So this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? But the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a surface with constant negative curvature, I think. So this must be a space with hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, the area of a pseudosphere. I remember that in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (which would be like a pseudosphere) is different from the usual spherical area. But wait, pseudosphere is a specific term. Oh wait, in 2D, a pseudosphere is kind of an abstract concept, but perhaps the question is referring to the area in terms of this metric.

The options are A to D. Let me look at them. Option A is 0, which doesn't make sense for an area. Option B is 4π(x² + y²), option C is 4π(x² - y²), option D is positive infinity.

Wait, the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh, wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle (which would correspond to a sphere in 3D but a circle in 2D) of radius r is 2π r² (times the curvature factor, but I'm not sure). Wait,
