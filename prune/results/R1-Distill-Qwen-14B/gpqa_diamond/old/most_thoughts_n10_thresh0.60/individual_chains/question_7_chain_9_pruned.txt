Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking about the energy of the gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. Hmm, I remember that when high-energy particles interact with the CMB, it can affect their propagation through the universe, like in the case of the pair production or photon-photon interactions.

The reaction given is γγ → e+ e-. So a gamma-ray photon and a CMB photon annihilate into an electron-positron pair. I think the process is called photon-photon annihilation or maybe the inverse Compton scattering, but in this case, it's producing matter-antimatter pairs.

The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 10^-3 eV. Wait, that's pretty low. CMB photons are typically in the microwave range, so that makes sense. They have energies around 1 meV, I think.

So the problem is about the energy of the gamma-rays where their lifetime is limited by this annihilation. So the gamma-rays would be losing energy or getting annihilated by the CMB photons, which would determine how long they can exist before they're gone. The lifetime is probably related to the probability of this interaction.

I remember that the probability of photon-photon annihilation depends on the energy of the photons involved and the number density of the background photons. The cross-section for this process is probably a key factor here. The cross-section σ is a measure of the probability that the interaction will occur.

The formula for the interaction rate Γ (which is the inverse of the lifetime) is something like Γ = n σ v, where n is the number density of the target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity. But for photons, since they are massless and moving at speed c, the velocity factor might just be a constant.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the condition for the optical depth τ. The optical depth is the product of the cross-section, the number density, and the length over which the interaction occurs. If the optical depth is about 1, that's when the interaction becomes significant. So τ ≈ 1 implies that the probability of interaction is about 63% (since e^(-τ) ≈ 1 - τ for small τ, but for τ=1, it's about 37% survival probability).

The optical depth τ is given by τ = n σ L, where L is the length of the path. But since the universe is homogeneous, we could express L in terms of the Hubble length or something similar. Alternatively, for a photon traveling for the age of the universe, L = c τ_universe, where τ_universe is the age of the universe.

Wait, the age of the universe is about 13.8 billion years. Let's compute that in seconds. 1 year ≈ 3.15e7 seconds, so 13.8e9 years is about 13.8e9 * 3.15e7 ≈ 4.35e17 seconds. So τ_universe ≈ 4.35e17 s.

But another approach is to use the formula for the photon-photon interaction. The cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by the formula σ = (8 π/3) (α^2 m_e^2)/(s), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, but I think the exact formula might depend on the specifics. Alternatively, for high-energy gamma-rays (much higher than the CMB photons), the cross-section is approximated as σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 m_e^4)/(E1 E2), where E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons. Since in this case, E2 is the CMB photon energy, which is much smaller than E1, the gamma-ray energy.

So, if the gamma-ray energy is E, and the CMB photon is ε, then σ ≈ (8π/3) (α^2 m_e^4)/(E * ε).

The number density n of CMB photons is about the same as the photon density in the blackbody spectrum. The CMB photon density is n ≈ a photon number density, which is approximately (energy density)/(average photon energy). The energy density of CMB is about 1e-4 erg/cm^3. Wait, but let me think: more accurately, the energy density u is (8 pi) (k_B^4)/(h^3 c^3) g_{*s} T^4, where g_{*s} is the entropy degrees of freedom. For CMB, T is about 2.7 K, and g_{*s} is about 2 for the early universe, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can approximate the number density n as about 10^8 photons/cm^3.

Wait, let me compute it. The number density of CMB photons
