Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying a di-substituted aromatic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. That makes me think of benzene rings with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, which means there's an O-C=O somewhere in the structure. Esters usually have strong absorption around 1700 cm⁻¹, so that's a key clue.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: six signals. Let's see what they correspond to. Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern affects the NMR signals. If the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two types, like para-substituted, but wait, no, para would typically result in two equivalent H's each. Wait, di-substituted could be ortho, meta, or para. But in either case, the aromatic Hs might split into two sets. For example, in para, the two sets of Hs would each have two protons each, so two singlets perhaps? Or maybe doublets if they're adjacent to substituents. Hmm. Or maybe if it's a meta substitution, the ring might have two sets of Hs as well. But wait, the NMR has two signals for aromatic Hs, each perhaps integrating to two H each. So that would account for four aromatic Hs. But wait, benzene is six-membered, so if two substituents are present, that would take away two Hs, leaving four. So two substituents, each maybe as a substituent that takes one H each? Wait, no, substituents replace Hs. So if you have two substituents, you lose two Hs, so four Hs remain. So two signals for the aromatic Hs implies that these four Hs are split into two groups. Like, for example, if the substituents are in para positions, the ring would have two sets of two Hs each—like two doublets. Or if it's meta, perhaps a triplet and a doublet? I'm not entirely sure about that part yet.

Next, the NMR also shows two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl groups are CH₂=CH
