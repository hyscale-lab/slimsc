Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). We're given the rest masses of Pi(+) as 139.6 MeV and mu(+) as 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D with different KE values. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since Pi is at rest, the initial momentum is zero. So the products must have equal and opposite momenta. Oh wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they're neutral and have very little mass, but in this case, maybe the problem is assuming the neutrino is massless? Or maybe it's treated as having negligible mass compared to the muon. I'm not entirely sure, but probably the neutrino's mass can be ignored for this problem.

So, the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. The Pi is at rest, so the total energy before decay is its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of mu+ and nu. But since the muon is a massive particle, it will have both rest mass energy and kinetic energy, while the neutrino, being (approximated as) massless, will have energy just equal to its momentum times c (but since we're working in MeV and such, maybe units are handled with c=1).

So, let me consider the conservation of energy and momentum. Let me denote the energy of mu+ as E_mu, and the energy of the neutrino as E_nu. The momentum of mu+ is p_mu, and the neutrino's momentum is p_nu. Since the initial momentum is zero, p_mu must equal -p_nu, so their magnitudes are equal. So p_mu = p_nu = p (say).

Energy conservation: E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

But for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but maybe I can ignore the c factors because we're working in units where c=1? Or maybe in particle physics, energies are in MeV, masses in MeV/c², but I'm a bit confused about the units. Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of natural units where c=1. So then, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ). And E_nu, since it's a neutrino, is approximately p (because E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4, but if m is negligible, E ≈ p c. But with c=1, E_nu ≈ p).

So from energy conservation:

sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Hmm, let's plug in m_mu = 105.7 MeV. So,

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6
