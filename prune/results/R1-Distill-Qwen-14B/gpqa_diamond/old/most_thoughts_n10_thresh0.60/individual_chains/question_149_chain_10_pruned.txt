Okay, I'm trying to solve this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me go through it step by step. So the question is about a peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR and LC-MS analyses show some unexpected peaks, and I need to figure out why.

First, let's read the question again carefully. The NMR spectrum of the crude compound looks mostly as expected except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. So the integral suggests that both peaks together account for one proton, which is what we'd expect for a single proton. But why two peaks then?

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Spin-spin splitting usually happens when neighboring protons are causing splitting, like in AB systems. But the question says that's ruled out, so it's not that. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton? Maybe some sort of splitting due to other factors. 

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, matching the expected molecule. So the mass is the same, but there are two peaks. Wait, but if they have the same mass, wouldn't that be the same compound? Unless there's some other reason for different peaks, like isomers.

So the options are A, B, C, D. Let's think about each possibility.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different because a precursor would usually have a lower mass (like the starting material before a reaction). But the question says the mass is the same as expected. So A might not be the case.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight, so the mass would match. But in an NMR spectrum, enantiomers are not split because they're mirror images and the protons would have the same environment. So the NMR would look the same as a single enantiomer. But wait, would the NMR peaks change? For enantiomers, the NMR signals should be identical because the environment is the same. So in this case, the NMR wouldn't show two separate peaks for the same proton. So option B might not explain the NMR observation.

Option C: Double coupling during amide bond formation. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. Double coupling could refer to a situation where a proton is coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons. But I think in such cases, the splitting would lead to more than two peaks, not two. Alternatively, maybe it's something during the synthesis, like forming an amide where two different groups are attached, causing some sort of coupling. Not sure yet, but let's keep this in mind.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR spectra would differ. Each diastereomer would have its own set of peaks. So in the NMR, if the sample is a mixture, each diastereomer's protons would give separate signals. But in the case of the alpha-proton, if that proton is in a different environment in each diastereomer, their chemical shifts might be similar but split into two. 

But wait, the two peaks have similar
