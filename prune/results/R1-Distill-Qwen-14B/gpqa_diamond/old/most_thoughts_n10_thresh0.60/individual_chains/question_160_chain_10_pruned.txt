Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N approaches infinity. Hmm, that sounds a bit complicated, but let's break it down.

First, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of maxima and minima called the diffraction pattern. The specific shape of the aperture affects where these maxima and minima occur.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So in that case, the problem simplifies to a circular aperture.

Oh right, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot (the Airy disk), and the first minima occur at a specific angle. I think the formula for the angle of the first minimum is given by something like sin(theta) = 1.22 * (lambda)/(diameter of the aperture). But wait, the apothem is given, not the radius or diameter.

Wait, what's an apothem? The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' is related to the radius (distance from center to a vertex) R. For a regular polygon, R = a / cos(π/N). But when N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1 because π/N becomes very small. So R ≈ a. Wait, no, because as N increases, the polygon becomes a circle, so the apothem 'a' in the limit should be the radius. So the diameter would be 2a.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. For a regular polygon, the apothem (a) is related to the radius (R) by a = R * cos(π/N). As N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle, so the apothem 'a' becomes equal to the radius R. So the diameter is 2a.

Wait, but wait, another approach: the size of the aperture for the circular case is the diameter. So the diameter D is 2a, because the apothem a is the radius. So D = 2a.

Now, the formula for the first minimum in a single-slit (or circular) diffraction occurs when the path difference is about λ/2, but considering the geometry. Wait, no, the single-slit formula is based on the angle where the path difference causes destructive interference.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles given by the condition that the path difference around the circumference is an odd multiple of half wavelengths. The formula for the first minimum is when sin(theta) = 1.22 * λ/(D), where D is the diameter. Wait, yes, that's right. So for the first minimum, m=1, and the formula is sin(theta_m) = (m * lambda) / (D).

Wait, no, wait. The general formula for the minima in a circular aperture (single-slit) is sin(theta) = (m * lambda)/(D), where m is
