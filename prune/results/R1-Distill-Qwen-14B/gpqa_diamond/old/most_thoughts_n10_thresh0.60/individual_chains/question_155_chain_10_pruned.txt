Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the operator P_z. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

Hmm, the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of the operator P_z in this state.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is given by the square root of the expectation of the operator squared minus the square of the expectation of the operator. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

So first, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z in this state. Then compute ⟨P_z²⟩, which is the expectation of P_z squared. Then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write down the matrix for P_z. The given matrix for P_z is:

[ ħ   0    0  ]
[ 0   0    0  ]
[ 0   0  -ħ  ]

So, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ along the diagonal.

The state vector is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I should check if this is normalized. Let's compute the norm: |(-1/2)|² + (1/√2)² + |(-1/2)|² = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 makes 1. So yes, it's normalized. Good.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute <ψ| P_z |ψ>.

Since P_z is diagonal, it's easier. The expectation value is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think. The state is |ψ> = [a, b, c]^T, where a = -1/2, b=1/√
