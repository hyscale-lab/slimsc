Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. Hmm, I need to think this through carefully. Let's break down the information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. A broad peak around 3000 suggests an -OH group, like in a carboxylic acid. The strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carbonyl group, which fits with a carboxylic acid's carbonyl (usually around 1700 for carboxylic acids). So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid functional group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are several signals, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So there are no double bonds or triple bonds (like in alkenes or alkynes) in the molecule. That suggests the structure is fully saturated, maybe with branching but no unsaturation.

The NMR has some complex splitting patterns. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. That sounds complicated, but perhaps it's due to the molecule's symmetry and the coupling between different sets of protons.

The options given are all different structures with varying substituents and a COOH group. Let's look at each option:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Structure-wise, this would be something like a central carbon attached to two ethyl groups, a methyl, and a CH2COOH. Wait, no, let me parse it correctly. The formula is CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Wait, that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's (CH2CH2C... no, perhaps it's a structure like CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, maybe it's a geminal diethyl group? No, because each C(H) is attached to other groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a structure where each central CH is connected to a CH3 and a C2H5 group. Wait, maybe it's like (CH3)(C2H5)C(H)-C(H)(CH3)(C2H5)CH2COOH? Not sure, perhaps I should draw it out mentally.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Similarly, maybe a structure where the central C is attached to CH2CH3, CH2CH3, and two other groups. Wait, looking at the formula, it's CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So each C(H) is attached to a C2H5 and a CH2CH3 group. That would
