Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there's a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So first thing, I need to figure out the normalized state because it's only proportional, meaning it's not necessarily normalized yet. The state is a combination of the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which are |up> and |down>.

The first part of the question asks about the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2 because it's spin-1/2? Let me think about that. So for a spin-1/2 system, the possible states are up and down, so the matrix would be 2x2.

So matrix A would look like this:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because when i≠j (so (1,2) and (2,1)), the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements (i=j) are 0.

Wait, but that's the matrix for the operator. So the operator is represented as a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere. Hmm, what kind of operator is that? Well, I remember that the Pauli matrices have similar structures. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and the others are different. So this operator A is proportional to the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2.

The eigenstates of this operator will be the same as those of the Pauli X matrix because they're proportional. The eigenstates of X are the |+> and |-> states, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. Or wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and its eigenstates are |+x> = (|0> + |1>)/sqrt(2) and |−x> = (|0> - |1>)/sqrt(2), right? So yes, the eigenstates of A are the same as those of X, because A is just (hbar/2) times X.

So the operator A has eigenstates |+x> and |−x>, and the eigenvalues would be (hbar/2)*1 and (hbar/2)*(-1), since the eigenvalues of X are ±1.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The operator A is hbar/2 times the Pauli X matrix. So the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(±1), so ±hbar/2.

The problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each of these eigenstates of operator A. Also, find the average value of that operator.

So first, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates
