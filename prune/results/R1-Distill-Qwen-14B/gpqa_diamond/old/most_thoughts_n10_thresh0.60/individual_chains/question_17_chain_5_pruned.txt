Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these kinds of questions. But let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant (K_Ca-EDTA) is given as 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The answer options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it binds metal ions like calcium. The Ca-EDTA complex would be something like CaY^2-, where Y^4- is the EDTA^4- ion. The formation constant (K) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of this complex.

The reaction would be: Ca^2+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2−. The K for this reaction is 5x10^10, which is a very large number, indicating that the complex forms almost completely.

Wait, but the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that when the complex dissociates, it releases Ca^2+ and EDTA^4- ions. But because K is so large, the complex is very stable, so the dissociation should be minimal. So the concentration of free Ca^2+ ions would be very low.

Let me think about the expression for the formation constant. The equilibrium expression for the formation of CaEDTA^2− is:

K = [CaEDTA^2−] / ( [Ca^2+][EDTA^4−] )

But wait, in this case, the complex is already present at 0.02 M. So let's denote the initial concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Let's let x be the amount that dissociates. So when some of the Ca-EDTA dissociates, the concentration of Ca^2+ would be x, and the concentration of EDTA^4− would also be x, because each mole of complex releases one mole of each.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, the reaction is 1:1, so for each mole of complex that dissociates, you get one mole of Ca^2+ and one mole of EDTA^4−.

So, if the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M and it dissociates by x, then:

[CaEDTA^2−] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since K is large, x will be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02)

[Ca^2+] = x
[EDTA^4−] = x

So substituting into the K expression:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 0.02 / x²

We know K is 5e10, so:

5e10 = 0.02 / x²

Solving for x²:

x² = 0.02 / 5e10

Let me compute that. 0.02 is 2e-2. So:

x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 /5) * 1e-12 = 0.4 * 1e-12 = 4e-13

Wait, no. Wait, wait: 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12. 2/5 is 0.4, so 0.4e-12 which is 4e-13.

So x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5. Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute that again. The square root of 4 is 2, square root of
