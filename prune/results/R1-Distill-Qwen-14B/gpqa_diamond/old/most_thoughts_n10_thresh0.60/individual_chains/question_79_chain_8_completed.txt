Okay, so I've got this question about identifying a compound based on its NMR spectra after a reaction. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step.

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used as a catalyst in certain reactions, maybe like an elimination or an epoxidation? Wait, wait. Oh right, it's commonly used in the Sharpless epoxidation reaction, but wait, no, Sharpless uses a different catalyst. Or perhaps it's used in other epoxidations. Or maybe it's used in acid-catalyzed reactions, but wait, in this case, since it's a base... Hmm, not sure. Maybe it's part of an elimination reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's used in a ring-opening of an epoxide? Wait, but the product is after reaction with this base. Let me think.

Wait, the product's NMR is given. Let's look at the data. The 1H NMR has several signals. Let's list them:

- δ 2.28 (3H, s)
- δ 2.31 (3H, s)
- δ 6.75 (1H, d)
- δ 7.08 (2H, d)
- δ 7.68 (1H, d)
- δ 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, so the aromatic region has several doublets. Let me think about the coupling patterns. The downfield signals (around 7.68 and 7.71) are likely to be adjacent to substituents, perhaps. The 6.75 might be a proton that's deshielded but not as much. The two singlets at around 2.28 and 2.31 suggest two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe carbonyls or something else that doesn't cause splitting.

Looking at the 13C NMR:

- 21.3 (s) – likely a methyl group, maybe attached to an electronegative atom like oxygen.
- 28.4 (s) – another methyl, perhaps more shielded, maybe not directly attached to anything electronegative.
- There's a bunch of carbons in the 125-140 range, which are typical for aromatic carbons. The 197.7 is a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or an ester, but wait, what else? Oh, wait, epoxides have carbons attached to oxygen. Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, the reaction is with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a base, and the solvent is nonpolar. At 403 K, which is about 130°C. So maybe this is an elimination reaction. Alternatively, it's a ring-opening of an epoxide? Or perhaps a diene formation.

Wait, another thought. The product's NMR has a carbonyl at 197.7. That's a high shift for a carbonyl. Wait, let me think: ketones are about 205-220 ppm? No, wait, wait. Let me recall. Typically, aldehydes are around 190-210, ketones about 205-225, esters about 165-175, amides lower. Wait, but 197.7 is more like an aldehyde. Or maybe a carbonyl from an epoxide? Wait, no, epoxide carbons are around 60-70 ppm? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the 13C NMR of epoxides: the carbons adjacent to oxygen are usually in the 50s-70s. So a carbonyl at 197 suggests maybe an aldehyde group or a ketone. But wait, in the 1H NMR, we don't have an aldehyde proton. So perhaps it's a ketone.

Wait, but looking back, the 1H NMR doesn't show any peaks that would suggest a carbonyl. So maybe I'm thinking wrong. Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of an epoxide ring opening? Or perhaps it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an enone.

Wait, looking at the 13C data again: 21.3 is a methyl, maybe attached to an oxygen. 28.4 is another methyl, perhaps. Oh wait, maybe two methyl groups in the structure, one attached to an oxygen, another not.

Let me consider each option:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So that's an oxirane (epoxide) with a styryl group at position 2, where the styryl is 4-methyl. So the structure would be an epoxide ring attached to a styryl group (a vinylbenzene). So the structure would have a benzene ring, a vinyl group connected to an oxygen. Wait, but epoxide is a three-membered ring with two carbons and one oxygen. Wait, the structure would be like O connected to two adjacent CH2 groups, but perhaps in this case, one of the CH2's is connected to the styryl group.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So that's an oxirane where one of the oxygen-attached carbons is connected to a propenyl group which is substituted with a phenyl. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and a phenyl attached to C2. So the structure would be a 3-membered ring: O-C-(CH2-Ph) which is double bonded? Not sure, maybe.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane has substituents at positions 2 and 3. Position 2 has a methyl, and position 3 has a styryl group. So the oxirane is a three-membered ring with two carbons substituted: one with a methyl, the other with a styryl.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So an epoxide where one of the carbons (position 2) is attached to a styryl group. So the structure would be the styryl group (vinylbenzene) connected to the epoxide ring.

Let me think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups, which probably are attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Singlet suggests no neighboring Hs. So maybe two methyl groups attached to electronegative atoms, like oxygen.

In the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. So one is more deshielded (higher ppm) than the other. 21.3 is probably a methyl attached to an oxygen, as those tend to be around 20-30 ppm. 28.4 is a more typical CH3 in an alkyl group.

Looking at the aromatic protons: the 1H NMR has a 1H d at 6.75, and two doublets around 7.08 and 7.71. Wait, let me think about the coupling. In a styryl group (vinylbenzene), you typically have two doublets for the protons on the double bond.

Wait, in a typical trans-styryl group, you have two sets of doublets. For example, in para-substituted styryl (like para-methyl styryl), the protons on the double bond would be two doublets, each as a pair, or perhaps each as a singlet? No, wait, the coupling would be between the two protons on the double bond. So each would be a doublet. So in the 1H NMR, perhaps the 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d) are the two protons on the double bond. Then the 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) would be the aromatic protons. Let's see.

Wait, the aromatic region can sometimes be more complex. But in a para-substituted benzene, you have two doublets of doublets or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a way that causes certain coupling.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR shows:

- 6.75 (1H, d)
- 7.08 (2H, d)
- 7.68 (1H, d)
- 7.71 (2H, d)

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me count the protons. 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6, but benzene has 6 H. So maybe there's a substitution pattern where some are equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps some of these are from a vinyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure has a benzene ring and a vinyl group. Let me think: in a vinyl group (CH2-CH2?), but actually, styryl is a vinyl attached to a benzene. Styryl is a vinylbenzene, so it's a benzene ring with a CH2-CH2 group? No, styryl is Benzene-CH2-CH2? No, no, wait, styryl is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, so it's benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Styryl is benzene with a vinyl group, i.e., benzene-CH2-CH2? No, wait, the structure is benzene with a CH2-CH2 group where the double bond is between the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, styryl is more like benzene-CH2-CH2 with a double bond: benzene-CH2-CH2 would be styrene (vinylbenzene). So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2, but wait, no, it's Ph-CH=CH2. Oh wait, no, the styryl group is a benzene ring attached to a vinyl group, so it's Ph-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, wait: styryl is (vinyl)benzene. So it's Ph-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, actually, it's Ph-CH=CH2. So the structure is benzene connected to a CH2 group which is double-bonded to another CH2? No, wait, no. It's benzene connected to a vinyl group: so benzene-CH2-CH2 with a double bond. No, perhaps:

Structure is:

Benzene ring connected to a CH group which is double-bonded to another CH2. So, the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? No, wait, no, the correct structure is Ph-CH2-CH2 isn't right. Let me think again. The styryl group is a vinyl group attached to the benzene, so it's Ph-CH2-CH2? No, wait. No, it's Ph-CH=CH2. So the structure is benzene ring connected to a CH2-CH2 group, but that's not the correct structure. Wait, no, the correct structure of styryl is a benzene ring with a vinyl substituent, which is benzene-CH=CH2. So that's correct.

So, in the 1H NMR, the two protons on the double bond (CH2-CH2) would each be a doublet, because each is coupled to the other. But wait, in the product's NMR, the doublets are 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d). Wait, that's two different protons each as a doublet. Then the 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d) are probably the aromatic protons.

Wait, but if the benzene ring is para-substituted, then the aromatic protons would be two doublets. For example, in para-methyl styrene, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in a pattern that causes this.

Alternatively, maybe the product has an epoxide ring. Let me think about that. If the reaction involved epoxidation, then the product would be an epoxide.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C11H12O: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, N=0. So (2*11 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (24-12)/2=6. So DoU is 6. That could be one ring (from oxirane, which is a 3-membered ring, so that's one ring) and three double bonds? Or other combinations.

Wait, but the product after reaction would have a different structure. Let's think about the reaction conditions: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K. Wait, this is a base, perhaps used in an elimination reaction. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the formation of an epoxide from a diene? Or maybe it's a base that deprotonates something to form a double bond.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting compound is an epoxide, and the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, not an acid. So maybe it's part of a base-catalyzed ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a rearrangement.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the NMR data again.

The 1H NMR shows two singlet methyl groups. So in the structure, there must be two methyl groups, each attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe one is attached to an oxygen (like an epoxide), and the other is in an alkyl chain.

The 13C NMR shows two methyl carbons and several aromatic carbons. The carbonyl at 197.7 might be a ketone, but that doesn't seem to match the 1H NMR data because there's no peak for a carbonyl proton. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but again, no aldehyde proton in the 1H NMR. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: looking at the 13C NMR, the 144.1 and 141.5 are probably carbons attached to oxygen, like carbonyl carbons or epoxide carbons. Wait, the 197.7 is a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, let me think about epoxide structures. In an epoxide, the carbons adjacent to oxygen are usually in the 50-70 ppm range. So 144 and 141 might not be epoxide carbons. Wait, but if the epoxide is conjugated, perhaps the carbons are more deshielded, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the carbonyl is part of an ester or a ketone elsewhere in the structure.

Wait, the product's molecular formula isn't given. Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O. After reaction, what changes? Hmm, the reaction might be an epoxidation, which would add an oxygen, but wait, the starting material already has one oxygen. Alternatively, perhaps it's an elimination, removing a water or similar.

Wait, but without knowing the product's formula, perhaps it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, so the starting material might have had a double bond that was epoxidized.

Wait, the options are all epoxides. Wait, option D is 2-styrylepoxide, which would be an epoxide with a styryl substituent.

So, perhaps the starting material was a diene that was epoxidized, but wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let's try to model each option's NMR.

Take option D: 2-styrylepoxide. Structure is an epoxide where one of the carbons is attached to a styryl group (vinylbenzene). So the structure would be O-CR2, where R is the styryl group (Ph-CH2-CH2 with a double bond?), no, wait, the styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the epoxide would be a three-membered ring with one carbon attached to the styryl group.

So in this structure, the epoxide has one carbon connected to the styryl group, and the other connected to another R group.

Wait, but the starting material is C11H12O. Let's count the carbons. Styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2? No, styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the epoxide would have a structure like O-C-(CH2-Ph-CH2-CH2?), no, perhaps O-C-CH2-CH2-Ph?

Wait, perhaps it's O-C-(CH2) connected to the styryl group. Let's see:

Epoxide structure: O-CH2-CR, where R is the styryl group. So the styryl is Ph-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but this might not add up correctly. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure after reaction has an epoxide and a styryl group. Let me think about the NMR.

In option D, 2-styrylepoxide. The structure would be:

O
||
C - CH2-CH2-Ph (but that's not right). Wait, no, the styryl is Ph-CH=CH2. So the epoxide would have one carbon attached to the vinyl group (Ph-CH=CH2) and another R group. So the structure would be O-C-(CH2-Ph-CH=CH2) or something similar. Maybe it's O-C-(CH2-CH2-Ph), but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-C-(CH2-CH2-Ph), but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O-C-(CH2-CH2-Ph), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for what the NMR of each option would look like.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide with a 4-methylstyryl group attached. So the styryl group is Ph-CH=CH2, but with a methyl group on the benzene ring in the para position. So the benzene has a methyl in para to the point of attachment.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, perhaps. The double bond protons (from styryl) would be two doublets. Additionally, the methyl on the benzene would be a singlet. Wait, but in the 1H NMR, we have two singlets for methyl groups. So perhaps this structure includes two methyl groups: one on the benzene (para to the styryl), and another perhaps on the epoxide.

Wait, the product's 1H NMR has two singlet methyl groups: 2.28 and 2.31. So maybe one is attached to the epoxide oxygen and the other is a para-methyl on the benzene.

Wait, but in option A, the structure has a 4-methylstyryl group, so the benzene would have a methyl in the para position relative to the point of attachment. So the benzene would have two sets of aromatic protons. Let's think about their coupling.

The aromatic protons would be in a para-substituted benzene, which would give two doublets in the 1H NMR. But wait, the product's NMR shows 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d). That suggests two sets of two protons each as doublets. So maybe that's the case here.

Additionally, the vinyl protons (from the styryl group) would each be a doublet, as they are coupled to each other. So that would give the 6.75 and 7.68 as the two vinyl protons. And the two methyl groups would be the one on the epoxide (maybe) and the para methyl on the benzene.

Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons are at 21.3 and 28.4. So the methyl on the benzene (para) would be around 21 (like a methyl attached to a benzene ring). The methyl on the epoxide (if any) would be around 28.4, as it's more shielded.

Wait, but in option A, would the epoxide have a methyl group attached? Let's see: the structure is oxirane (epoxide) with a 4-methylstyryl group. So the epoxide is O-C-(CH2-Ph-CH=CH2). Hmm, perhaps the other carbon in the epoxide is a CH2 group. Wait, but in the 13C, we have a 28.4 s, which could be a CH3 attached to something else, maybe the other carbon in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe the structure is O-C-(CH2-Ph-CH=CH2) and another CH3 attached to the same carbon. No, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between two carbons, one attached to the styryl group and the other to a methyl group.

Wait, that would make sense. So the structure would be O-C-(CH2-Ph-CH=CH2)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but that would complicate the structure. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide has a methyl group on one carbon and the styryl on the other.

So, in that case, the structure would be O-C-(CH3) and O-C-(CH2-Ph-CH=CH2). Then, the methyl group (CH3) would be attached to the epoxide carbon, giving a singlet in the 1H NMR. The other methyl on the benzene (para) would also be a singlet. That explains the two singlet methyl groups in the 1H NMR.

In terms of the 13C NMR, the methyl attached to the epoxide would be around 21.3, and the para methyl on the benzene would be around 28.4? Or vice versa. Wait, methyl groups attached to electronegative atoms (like oxygen) are usually more deshielded, so their carbon shifts are higher. So the methyl attached to the epoxide would be around 21.3, and the para methyl would be around 28.4.

Then, the aromatic protons would be two doublets of two each, which would match the 7.08 (2H, d) and 7.71 (2H, d).

The vinyl protons would be 6.75 (1H, d) and 7.68 (1H, d), each as a doublet.

So this seems to fit. So the structure would be 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane.

Alternatively, let's check option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the epoxide has methyl at position 2 and styryl at position 3.

In that case, the structure would have the epoxide ring with a methyl group on one carbon and a styryl group on the adjacent carbon. So, the styryl would be attached to the same carbon as the methyl. Wait, but how would that look in terms of NMR?

The methyl attached to the epoxide would be a singlet, and the styryl would have its own protons. But in the 1H NMR, there are two singlet methyl groups, so perhaps the other methyl is somewhere else, like on the benzene ring. But in option C, the styryl is attached to the epoxide, so the benzene's substituents would determine the aromatic NMR signals.

Hmm, for option C, the structure would be O-C-(CH3)-C-(styryl). The styryl would be Ph-CH=CH2. So the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern, but I'm not sure if they would match the given NMR.

Let me also think about option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the structure is an epoxide where one of the oxygens is attached to a propenyl group which is substituted with a phenyl. So the structure is O-C-CH2-C(Ph)=CH2.

Wait, but the substituents on the carbons would be different, and the NMR might not match. The 1H NMR would have more complex splitting for the protons on the propene chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an epoxide with a substituent that includes a methyl group and a styryl group.

Wait, maybe the reaction of compound X with the base forms an epoxide with a substituent that includes a styryl group and a methyl group. So looking back, the starting material is C11H12O. After reaction, perhaps it's an epoxide with certain substituents.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option D is 2-styrylepoxide: O-C-CH2-Ph-CH=CH2. So the epoxide is between two carbons, one attached to a styryl group and the other to perhaps a CH2 group.

In that case, the NMR would have signals from the styryl group's vinyl protons, the aromatic protons, and any other substituents.

Wait, but according to the 1H NMR, there are two singlet methyl groups. So if option D doesn't have any additional methyl groups beyond the styryl, then perhaps it's not the right option.

Wait, in the product's 1H NMR, two methyl groups are present as singlets. So the structure must have two methyl groups. Looking at option A again: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. The styryl has a para methyl on the benzene (so that's one methyl), and the epoxide has another methyl attached to one of its carbons (so that's the second methyl). So the two singlets come from these two methyl groups.

In the 13C NMR, the two methyl carbons would be at around 21.3 and 28.4. The methyl on the benzene (para) is attached to a benzene ring, so it's more deshielded, perhaps around 21.3. The methyl attached to the epoxide would be more shielded, around 28.4.

Putting this together, the 1H NMR shows two singlet methyls, and the aromatic and vinyl protons matching.

So, based on this, option A would have the expected NMR signals.

Wait, but let me double-check the 13C NMR. The styryl group's carbons would be in the aromatic region, which the 13C NMR shows as 126.9, 127.1, 129.1, and 130.3. Those are typical for aromatic carbons. The 141.5 and 144.1 would be the carbons attached to the oxygen, perhaps the epoxide carbons.

So, in option A, the structure would have an epoxide with a methyl group and a styryl group. The styryl's benzene has a para methyl. So the 1H NMR would have two singlet methyls, which matches.

So, the correct answer would be option A.


The question involves identifying Compound X (C₁₁H₁₂O) based on its NMR data after reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in nonpolar solvent at 403 K. The reaction likely forms an epoxide, as the product's NMR data suggests the presence of an epoxide ring and other substituents. The analysis of the NMR data and the options is as follows:

### Key Observations from the NMR Data:
1. **1H NMR**:
   - δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): Two singlet methyl groups, likely attached to different environments (e.g., one to an oxygen atom and the other to an aromatic ring).
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d) and δ 7.68 (1H, d): Two vinyl protons from a styryl group, each as a doublet due to coupling.
   - δ 7.08 (2H, d) and δ 7.71 (2H, d): Aromatic protons from a para-substituted benzene ring, appearing as two doublets.

2. **13C NMR**:
   - δ 21.3 (1C, s) and δ 28.4 (1C, s): Two methyl carbons, likely one attached to an oxygen atom (described as more deshielded, around 21.3) and the other in a more shielded environment (around 28.4).
   - δ 126.9 (2C, s), δ 127.1 (1C, s), δ 129.1 (2C, s), δ 130.3 (1C, s): Aromatic carbons from a benzene ring.
   - δ 141.5 (1C, s) and δ 144.1 (1C, s): Likely carbons adjacent to the oxygen in the epoxide ring.
   - δ 197.7 (1C, s): A carbonyl carbon, possibly from a ketone or aldehyde, though no corresponding proton is observed in the 1H NMR.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**  
   - Structure: An epoxide with a 4-methylstyryl group (a benzene ring with a methyl group in the para position and a vinyl group attached to the epoxide).  
   - The two singlet methyl groups in the 1H NMR correspond to the methyl group on the benzene ring (para to the vinyl group) and the methyl group attached to the epoxide carbon.  
   - The aromatic protons (δ 7.08 and δ 7.71) and vinyl protons (δ 6.75 and δ 7.68) match the expected splitting patterns for a para-substituted benzene and a vinyl group.  
   - The 13C NMR data also aligns with this structure, including the carbonyl carbon at δ 197.7, which could arise from conjugation with the epoxide ring.

2. **Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane**  
   - Structure: An epoxide with a propenyl group substituted with a phenyl ring.  
   - This structure would not produce the observed NMR data, as it lacks the two singlet methyl groups and does not match the aromatic proton pattern.

3. **Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane**  
   - Structure: An epoxide with a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.  
   - This structure does not explain the two singlet methyl groups in the 1H NMR, as it only contains one methyl group on the epoxide carbon.

4. **Option D: 2-styrylepoxide**  
   - Structure: An epoxide with a styryl group attached to position 2.  
   - This structure lacks the second methyl group observed in the 1H NMR, making it inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is most consistent with **Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane**, as it explains the two singlet methyl groups, the aromatic proton pattern, and the overall structure of the product.

Answer: A
