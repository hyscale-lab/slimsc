Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves an experiment where Compound X, with the formula C11H12O, is reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and we need to identify Compound X from the options.

Hmm, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, right? Oh wait no, wait. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a strong, non-nucleophilic base. Oh, it's commonly used in elimination reactions, like in the formation of epoxides from certain starting materials. Oh wait, wait, noâ€”wait, actually, in some cases, it can deprotonate compounds to form enolates or epoxides. Or wait, perhaps it's used in the ring-opening of epoxides? Or maybe more likely, it's used to deoxygenate something. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Oh wait, wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is DBU, right? Yeah, DBU is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, used in various reactions, including eliminations, like in E2 mechanisms. So, if the solvent is nonpolar, maybe the reaction is an elimination, forming a double bond or something.

But wait, the product's NMR data is given. So perhaps the reaction is an epoxidation? Or maybe the reverse. Wait, another thought: if Compound X is an epoxide, and when treated with DBU, it might undergo ring-opening. But the question says the product's NMR is given. Wait, but the product is formed from X reacting with DBU. So, maybe X is an epoxide, and DBU is deoxygenating it or something else. Or perhaps X is something else, and DBU is inducing some kind of elimination.

Wait, the product's NMR is given, and we have to figure out what the product is, then
