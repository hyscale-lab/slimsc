Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom. The magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 T. It mentions small m values and a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that in hydrogen atoms, the energy levels are quantized, and transitions between these levels emit or absorb photons with specific wavelengths. The wavelength given, 0.4861 μm, that's around the blue-green range. I think that's the Balmer series, specifically the H-alpha line, which is a transition from n=3 to n=2. Or wait, maybe it's from n=2 to n=1? No, wait, H-alpha is n=3 to n=2, right? So the energy difference ΔE would be related to that transition.

So first, I need to find ΔE for the hydrogen atom. I recall the Rydberg formula, which relates the wavelength of the emitted photon to the energy levels. The formula is 1/λ = R*(1/n1² - 1/n2²), where R is the Rydberg constant, approximately 1.097e4 m⁻¹. But wait, since n2 > n1 for emission, if the transition is from higher to lower energy, so for H-alpha, n2=3 and n1=2? Or wait, no, I think I might have that backwards. Let me think: when an electron transitions from a higher energy level to a lower one, it emits a photon. So for H-alpha, it's n=3 to n=2. So n1=2 and n2=3.

So plugging into the Rydberg formula: 1/λ = R*(1/2² - 1/3²). Let me compute that. 1/4 is 0.25 and 1/9 is approximately 0.1111. So 0.25 - 0.1111 is about 0.1389. Multiply by R, which is 1.097e4 m⁻¹. So 0.1389 * 1.097e4 ≈ let's see, 1.097e4 is 10970. So 10970 * 0.1389 ≈ approx 1523 m⁻¹. Then 1/λ would be about 1523, so λ is 1/1523 ≈ 0.000656 meters, which is 656 nm. Wait, but the given wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. That doesn't match H-alpha. Hmm, maybe I got the transition wrong.

Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So the wavelengths are for transitions from higher n to n=2. H-alpha is n=3→2, which gives about 656 nm. But the given wavelength is 486 nm, which is H-beta. H-beta is n=4→2. Let's check: 1/λ = R*(1/2² - 1/4²) = R*(1/4 - 1/16) = R*(3/16). 3/16 is 0.1875. So 1.097e4 * 0.1875 ≈ 2051 m⁻¹. So λ is 1/2051 ≈ 0.000487 meters, which is 487 nm. Oh, that's close to the given 486.1 nm. So that's the transition n=4 to n=2, so ΔE is the energy difference between n=4 and n=2.

So now, I need to compute ΔE for that transition. The energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = - (R * h c) / n², where R is Rydberg constant, h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Alternatively, I can use the relation between energy and wavelength, which is E = hc/λ.

So let's compute ΔE. Since the energy difference between n=4 and n=2 is E_2 - E_4. Because E_n is negative, E_4 is more negative than E_2. So E_2 is higher (less negative) than E_4. So ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = ( - R h c / 2² ) - ( - R h c / 4² ) = R h c (1/(4²) - 1/(2²)) )? Wait, no, wait. ΔE = E_final - E_initial. When the electron transitions from n=4 to n=2, it emits a photon. So E_initial is E_4, E_final is E_2. So ΔE = E_2 - E_4.

E_4 = - R h c (1/4²) = - R h c (1/16)
E_2 = - R h c (1/4)
So ΔE = (-1/4 + 1/16) R h c = ( (-4/16 + 1/16 )) R h c = (-3/16) R h c. But the magnitude is positive, so the energy emitted is (3/16) R h c.

Alternatively, since the photon's energy is E_photon = hc/λ. Let's compute that.

Given λ = 0.4861 μm = 486.1e-9 meters.

h = Planck's constant = 6.626e-34 J·s
c = 3e8 m/s
So E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = let me compute that.

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m
Divided by 486.1e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 4.088e-18 J.

So ΔE ≈ 4.09e-18 J.

Wait, but maybe I should use Rydberg's energy expression. The Rydberg energy is about 13.6 eV, so the energy levels are E_n = -13.6 eV / n².

So E_2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV
E_4 = -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV
So ΔE = E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) = -2.55 eV. The magnitude is 2.55 eV. Hmm, but 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 2.55 eV is 4.08e-18 J, which matches the earlier calculation.

So ΔE is approximately 4.08e-18 J.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩. I think this refers to the Zeeman effect, where a magnetic field causes the splitting of atomic energy levels. The Zeeman Hamiltonian is H' = - μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. For electrons, the magnetic moment is μ = -gμ_B m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor, μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the exact form here.

Wait, wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is usually the perturbation due to the interaction between the magnetic moment and the external field. For an electron, the magnetic moment due to spin is μ = -g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is approximately 2. So the perturbing Hamiltonian is H' = μ·B = g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The Zeeman perturbation is H' = -μ·B. So H' = - (g μ_B m_s) B, because μ = g μ_B m_s. So, H' = - g μ_B m_s B.

Wait, or is it positive? Let me think: the energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is U = -μ·B. So yes, H' = -μ·B.

But for electrons, the magnetic moment is μ = -g_s (eħ/(2m_e)) m_s, so H' = -μ·B would be positive g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to write it more carefully.

The magnetic dipole moment μ is given by μ = g * μ_B * m_s, where g is the Landé g-factor (≈2 for electrons), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m_s is the spin magnetic quantum number.

The perturbing Hamiltonian due to the external magnetic field B (assuming B is in the z-direction) is H' = -μ·B = -g μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but wait, if B is along Oz (z-axis), then μ·B is μ_z B. So, H' = -μ_z B.

But μ_z = g μ_B m_s. So H' = -g μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have mixed up the signs. Let me think about the direction. The magnetic moment μ tends to align with the magnetic field. So the potential energy is U = -μ·B. So when μ and B are in the same direction, U is negative, which is lower energy. So H' = -μ·B.

Alternatively, if the magnetic moment is μ = -g μ_B m_s, then H' = -μ·B = g μ_B m_s B. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should just proceed with the magnitude.

So the expectation value ⟨H'⟩ for a given state is H' = -g μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but the problem states that m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the question refers to the orbital magnetic dipole, not spin? Because for orbital angular momentum, the magnetic dipole is given by L, and the magnetic quantum number is l. But the question mentions m, which is the orbital m. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused between spin and orbital contributions.

Wait, the question says 'paramagnetic coupling term'. Paramagnetism arises from unpaired electrons, which are due to spin, not orbital angular momentum. So perhaps the paramagnetic coupling is due to spin, not orbital. But the question says m is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think.

Wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, but m is the z-component, m_l. Spin has a different m, m_s. So perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but the term 'paramagnetic coupling' suggests it's spin-related. But the question says "for small values of m", which is the orbital m. Hmm, perhaps the problem refers to the orbital contribution, but that's diamagnetic. Oh wait, no. Diamagnetic comes from paired electrons, but paramagnetic comes from unpaired, which is spin.

Wait, I'm perhaps getting stuck here. Let's proceed.

Assuming that the paramagnetic coupling is due to spin, then the expectation value would be proportional to m_s. But the question says "for small values of m", which is the orbital m. Hmm, perhaps the question is referring to the orbital magnetic dipole interaction, but that's diamagnetic, which is weaker.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think again.

The problem says: compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE.

Paramagnetic coupling is due to the spin magnetic moment. So, the term would be H' = -μ·B, with μ being the spin magnetic moment.

μ = -g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s is approximately 2, μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

So H' = g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but the problem says "for small values of m". Wait, m here refers to the orbital m? Or the spin m? Hmm, the question states "m (orbital magnetic quantum number)", so maybe the paramagnetic term is due to the orbital angular momentum.

Wait, no, orbital angular momentum is usually diamagnetic. So this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the m as the spin quantum number. Because paramagnetism comes from spin.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using m as the spin magnetic quantum number.

But the question says 'm is the orbital magnetic quantum number', which is m_l. Hmm, perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting.

But regardless, let's proceed. Let's assume that the paramagnetic coupling term is due to spin, and m is the spin magnetic quantum number m_s, which can be ±1/2. But the question says m is small, so perhaps m_s is 1/2? Or perhaps it's referring to the orbital m being small, like m=0, but that would give ⟨H⟩=0.

Wait, but the problem states m is small, so perhaps m is 0, but that would make the term zero. So maybe the question is referring to another effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the paramagnetic coupling term refers to the Zeeman effect due to the orbital angular momentum. The orbital magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (e/(2m_e)) * L_z, where L_z is the z-component of orbital angular momentum. So the perturbation would be H' = -μ_orbital · B = -(e/(2m_e)) L_z B.

So in terms of quantum numbers, L_z = ħ m_l, so H' = -(e/(2m_e)) ħ m_l B.

Wait, but the Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), so H' = - μ_B m_l B.

So the expectation value ⟨H'⟩ would be - μ_B m_l B.

Now, for small m, like m=1, m_l can be -1, 0, +1. So let's take m_l = 1. Then ⟨H'⟩ would be - μ_B * 1 * B.

Wait, but what's the value of μ_B? The Bohr magneton is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

So μ_B ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So, for m_l = 1, ⟨H'⟩ = - (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 * 1 T = -9.274e-24 J.

The magnitude is approximately 9.27e-24 J.

Now, comparing this with ΔE, which was about 4.08e-18 J.

So 9.27e-24 is much smaller than 4.08e-18. So ⟨H'⟩ is much less than ΔE.

But wait, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term" which is usually associated with spin, but I just calculated the orbital contribution. So perhaps I should have used the spin contribution instead.

Wait, for spin, the magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B m_s, where g_s ≈ 2, and m_s = ±1/2.

So H' = -μ_s · B = -g_s μ_B m_s B.

So for m_s = 1/2, ⟨H'⟩ would be - (2) (9.274e-24 J/T) (0.5) (1 T) = - 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, same magnitude as the orbital case. Hmm.

So regardless of whether it's orbital or spin, the expectation value would be on the order of 1e-23 J or so.

Wait, let's compute it accurately.

μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T.

So with m_l=1, ⟨H⟩ = - μ_B * m_l * B = -9.274e-24 *1 *1 = -9.274e-24 J.

Similarly, for spin, m_s=1/2: ⟨H⟩ = -g μ_B m_s B = -2 * 9.274e-24 * 0.5 *1 = -9.274e-24 J.

So the magnitude is about 9.27e-24 J.

Comparing this to ΔE of 4.08e-18 J, which is much larger. So 9.27e-24 is way smaller than 4.08e-18.

So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, is the paramagnetic coupling term the dominant term or not? The question is to compare the two.

So, according to our calculations, ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

But wait, let me double-check the numbers.

ΔE is 4e-18 J, and ⟨H⟩ is about 9e-24 J. So the ratio is ΔE/|⟨H⟩|= (4e-18)/(9e-24)= ~4.4e5. So ΔE is much larger than ⟨H⟩.

Wait, but the question states that m is small. So perhaps m=1, leading to ⟨H⟩=9.27e-24 J, which is 1e-23 magnitude.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the paramagnetic term is H, so ⟨H⟩ is the expectation value of the perturbation Hamiltonian. So ⟨H⟩ is about 1e-23 J, which is much smaller than ΔE of 4e-18 J.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. So ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.

Which corresponds to option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The transition energy is about 4e-18 J, and the paramagnetic term is about 1e-23 J. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller. So in terms of magnitude, ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

So the correct answer would be option C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and perform the following steps:

1. **Transition Energy ΔE**:  
   The wavelength of the emitted photon is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 486.1 \, \text{nm} \). Using the relationship \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{486.1 \times 10^{-9}} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   This corresponds to the energy difference between the \( n=4 \) and \( n=2 \) levels of the hydrogen atom.

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩**:  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( \vec{B} \). For spin, the magnetic moment is \( \mu = g \mu_B m_s \), where \( g \approx 2 \) is the Landé g-factor, \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( m_s = \pm \frac{1}{2} \) is the spin magnetic quantum number. The perturbing Hamiltonian is \( H' = -\mu \cdot B \), so the expectation value is:  
   \[
   \langle H' \rangle = -g \mu_B m_s B.
   \]  
   Substituting \( g = 2 \), \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \), \( m_s = \frac{1}{2} \), and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \), we find:  
   \[
   \langle H' \rangle = -2 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 = -9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   The magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \).

3. **Comparison**:  
   The transition energy \( \Delta E \) is approximately \( 4.08 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term \( |\langle H' \rangle| \) is approximately \( 9.27 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J} \). The ratio \( \frac{\Delta E}{|\langle H' \rangle|} \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{|\langle H' \rangle|} = \frac{4.08 \times 10^{-18}}{9.27 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 4.4 \times 10^5.
   \]  
   This shows that \( \Delta E \) is much larger than \( |\langle H' \rangle| \), i.e., \( \langle H' \rangle \ll \Delta E \).

**Conclusion**: The paramagnetic coupling term is orders of magnitude smaller than the transition energy.
