Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these acid-base reactions. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed, and determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

First, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. I remember its molar mass is something like... well, let's calculate it. Iron (Fe) has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen (O) is 16, and hydrogen (H) is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(1 + 16) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Hmm, around 9.36e-4 moles.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, right? So when we add a strong acid, it should react. The reaction would be: Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O. So the acid provides H+ ions, which will react with the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but how much H+ is needed? Well, each mole of Fe(OH)3 can neutralize 3 moles of H+. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3. So 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles of H+ required.

The acid is monobasic and strong. Monobasic means it provides one H+ per molecule, like HCl. So the concentration is 0.1 M, and we need to find the volume (V) that gives us at least 0.002808 moles of H+.

Using the formula: moles = Molarity × Volume → Volume = moles / Molarity. So V = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³. Close enough, probably due to rounding.

But wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. Does that affect anything? Oh, right, because the acid added will contribute to the total solution volume. But when the acid is added, the volume may change slightly, but I think the problem assumes that the total volume is approximately 100 cm³, so the calculation for the acid volume doesn't consider the solution's total volume change. So my initial calculation of 28.08 cm³ should be correct.

Now, for the pH. After dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution will contain Fe³+ ions and excess H+ ions from the acid. So I need to find the concentration of H+ in the solution.

Wait, but first, let me check the stoichiometry again. Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- per formula unit. So when it reacts with H+, each mole of Fe(OH)3 consumes 3 H+.

So moles of H+ needed = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The amount of H+ provided by the acid is 0.1 M * V (in liters). So V in
