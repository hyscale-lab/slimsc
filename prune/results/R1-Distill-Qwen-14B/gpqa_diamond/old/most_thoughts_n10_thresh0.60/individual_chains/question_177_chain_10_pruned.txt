Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again carefully.

Alright, so we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. They did spectroscopy and found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is related to its temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max * T = constant. Since the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. So T1 = T2.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. But the problem says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, wait. So when we observe the stars, their emitted wavelengths are shifted due to their velocities. But the peak wavelengths they measured are the same. So maybe the actual emitted wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they appear the same. Or perhaps the problem is considering the rest wavelengths, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, I think the problem is that the observed peak wavelengths are the same. So the Doppler effect must have shifted them. So Star_1 is at rest (radial velocity 0), so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Now, if it's moving away, the wavelength would be redshifted. If moving towards, blueshifted. But since the observed peak wavelengths are same, then the actual emitted wavelengths would be different. So let's model that.

So the observed wavelength for Star_2 would be λ_observed = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r)/ (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that. Wait, no, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact Doppler shift formula. Oh right, the relativistic Doppler effect formula is λ_obs / λ_rest = sqrt( (1 + v/c) / (1
