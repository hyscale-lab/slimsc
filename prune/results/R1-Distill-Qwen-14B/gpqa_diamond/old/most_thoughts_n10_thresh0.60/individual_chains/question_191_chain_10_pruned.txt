Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm. So I should probably draw that structure. Let's see, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (–CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–C(CH2?) Wait, no, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–C(=CH2). Wait, actually, propene is CH2=CHCH3, so the substituent would be where? The ene is between carbons 1 and 2. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–CH2–CH2, but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think. The structure is CH2–C(R)=CH2? No, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2–CH2–CH2 with the double bond starting at 1. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH2). No wait, I'm getting confused. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So the substituent is the group attached to the cyclohexane at position 5. So the substituent is CH2–C(CH2) is that right? Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2–C(=CH2)–, meaning the group is CH2–CH(CH2–?), perhaps. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as the group is CH2–CH2–CH2 with the double bond in between? No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2–CH2–CH2 but with a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, making it CH2=CH–CH2–. But in that case, the substituent would be CH2–CH2–CH2 with a double bond. Wait, the substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2–C(=CH2)–. So the substituent is attached via the middle carbon, with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So the structure would be CH2–C(=CH2)
