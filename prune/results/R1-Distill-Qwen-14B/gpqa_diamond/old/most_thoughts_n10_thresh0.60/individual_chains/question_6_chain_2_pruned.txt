Okay, so I need to find the energy spectrum for a quantum mechanical particle moving in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, especially when the potential has radial symmetry or can be expressed in polar coordinates, we can separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts. Wait, but here the potential isn't purely radial because it has a cos²θ term. That complicates things a bit.

Wait, let me think. So, the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor this as V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). But maybe it's better to separate the terms. So, maybe write V(r,θ) as V(r) + V(θ), where V(r) = (1/2)k r² and V(θ) = (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, no, because the second term is dependent on both r and θ, so it's a bit more complicated than that. Or perhaps not.

Wait, no, because the potential isn't just a function of r and θ separately. It's actually a function of r times a function of θ. Because V(r,θ) = [ (1/2)k r² ] + [ (3/2)k r² cos²θ ] = (
