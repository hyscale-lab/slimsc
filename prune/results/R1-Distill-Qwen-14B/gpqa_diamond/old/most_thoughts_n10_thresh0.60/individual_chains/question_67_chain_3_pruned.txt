Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals and their angular momentum. Hmm, let me see if I can work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 because p orbitals have l=1. The question talks about coupled angular momentum states, and the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. Let me parse that. Oh right, the notation is |l1, l2, L, M>, where l1 and l2 are the individual orbital angular momenta of each electron, L is the total orbital angular momentum quantum number, and M is the z-component of that total.

So the state here is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Because for two electrons with l1=1 and l2=1, the possible values of L would be the sum and difference of their individual l's. So L can be 2, 1, or 0. Oh wait, but in this state, L is 2. That makes sense because 1 +1 =2, so when they add constructively, L=2.

And M is -1. So the z-component of the total angular momentum is -1. 

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. Each of these is the z-component of the individual electrons' angular momentum.

Each electron's Lz can be -l, ..., +l. So for l=1, each Lz can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ. But wait, the problem says to ignore spin angular momentum, so we're only considering the orbital part.

Wait, the problem is asking for the joint probability of both measurements giving -ħ for their respective Lz components. So both electrons would have Lz = -ħ.

So I need to find the probability that when I measure L1z and L2z, both are -ħ.

The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. So this is a coupled state. How does this state relate to the product states of the individual electrons' angular momenta?

I remember that when dealing with angular momentum coupling, the states can be expressed in terms of the uncoupled (product) states. So for two particles, the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M>
