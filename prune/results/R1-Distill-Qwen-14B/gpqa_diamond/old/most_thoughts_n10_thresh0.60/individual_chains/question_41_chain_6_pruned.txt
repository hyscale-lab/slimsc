Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium like glass is usually given by c divided by the index of refraction n. But wait, the glass is moving here, so how does that affect things?

The question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, towards the observer. Oh right, so the glass is moving toward me while the light is also moving in the same direction. Wait, no, the light is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving toward the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving in their frame.

I think I need to use some sort of velocity addition here. Oh wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally because of the speed limit. But wait, the speed of light in a medium is less than c. But in this case, the medium (glass) is moving, so the speed of light as observed in the lab frame might change.

Wait, normally, when you have a medium moving at velocity v, the speed of light in that medium relative to the lab frame isn't just the regular speed plus v. Because of relativity, you can't have velocities exceeding c. So the speed u' of the light in the lab frame would depend on how the medium's motion affects the light's speed.

Wait, in the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n, right? Because in the glass, speed v = c/n. So from the lab frame
