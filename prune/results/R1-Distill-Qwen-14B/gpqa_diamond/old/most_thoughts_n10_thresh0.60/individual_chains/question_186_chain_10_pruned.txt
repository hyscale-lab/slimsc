Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the Cope rearrangement of a specific compound. Let me break it down.

First, what is a Cope rearrangement? From what I remember, it's a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. The reaction usually forms another 1,5-diene but in a different structure. So the key here is that the molecule must have two conjugated double bonds separated by a single bond, forming a 1,5-diene.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, let me visualize this structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene derivative. The numbering would have bridgeheads at positions 1, 2, and 5 perhaps? Wait, norbornene has two bridges, right? The structure is bicyclic, with two carbons in each bridge. So position 5 would be one of the bridgeheads.

The substituents are 2-vinyl and 2-azabicyclo. Oh wait, 2-azabicyclo means there's a nitrogen in the bridge. So the bicyclo system has a bridge with a nitrogen atom. So the structure is a norbornene with a bridge that includes a nitrogen, making it a azabicyclo structure. And at position 2, there's a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂) attached.

Wait, let me sketch this. So bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has three bridges: one of two carbons, another of two, and a single carbon bridge. The double bond is between carbons 5 and perhaps another position. Wait, no, the numbering would have the double bond at position 5. So the double bond is part of the bicyclic system. The substituents: position 2 has a vinyl group and a nitrogen. Wait, no, 2-azabicyclo would mean that the bridge itself has a nitrogen at position 2. So the bridge is between positions 1 and 4, perhaps, and in the bridge, position 2 is the nitrogen.

So the structure is an azabicyclo structure, with a double bond in the ring
