Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, let's try to unpack this step by step. Okay, the question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, and the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. 

Wait, so what's T(NN)? Oh right, that's the isospin quantum number of the NN system. The final state has T(NN) = 0. I think I remember that for two nucleons, the isospin can be either 0 or 1. T=0 would mean that the two are in a singlet state, maybe anti-aligned or something.

The problem is to determine which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing an initial state (1S0) and a possible transition to a different state plus a particle X. The letters p, s, f, etc., denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. Wait, I think p is l=1, s is l=0, d is l=2, f is l=3, and so on. So each option involves the emission of a particle X with a specific orbital angular momentum state.

The question states that both angular momentum and parity must be conserved. So I need to consider both conservation laws.

Let me outline what I need to do:

1. Determine the initial state's quantum numbers.
2. For each option, determine the quantum numbers of the final state (NN) and the emitted particle X.
3. Check if angular momentum is conserved (vectorially, but maybe just considering the total J? Or considering the orbital angular momentum? Hmm, I think it's about the addition of angular momenta.)
4. Check parity conservation as well.

Wait, the initial system is in 1S0. The 1S0 notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0, J=0. Because (2*0+1)*S (which is 1*S0) and J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the final NN state has T=0. So using the equation T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Wait, T is 0, so 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S and L must be of opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

Wait, but what are S and L in the final NN state? The options give each the final state of NN as, for example, 7D1. Let me parse that. 7D1 would be (2S+1)L J. So 7 is (2S+1) → 2S+1=7 → S=3. D is L=2 (since S is for spin, L for orbital). Then J is 1.

So for each option, the final NN state has specific S, L
