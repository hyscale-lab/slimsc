Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that two compounds A and B are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. After the treatment, two different diketones are produced. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water are often used in the formation of nitrous acid, which can lead to various reactions depending on the starting material. Wait, nitrous acid is a strong oxidizing agent. Oh right, in acidic conditions, it's HONO, and can act as an oxidizing agent. So maybe this is a oxidation reaction.

Wait, the products are diketones. Diketones have two ketone groups. So the starting materials must have something that can form two ketones upon oxidation.

I think about what reactions can form diketones. One possibility is the oxidation of vicinal diols (two adjacent alcohols) to form diketones. Oh right! The Oppenauer Oxidation or maybe the use of KMnO4 under certain conditions. Wait, but in this question, the reagents are HCl, NaNO2, and water. That rings a bell. Oh yes! The Stephen reduction or maybe it's for the formation of nitro compounds... Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait another thought: when an alcohol is treated with nitrous acid (HONO) under acidic conditions
