Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, and the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. There are four options to choose from, labeled A to D. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I need to visualize the structure of the target molecule. So, it's a cyclohexane ring with a substituent. The substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), which probably means a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that methyl group also has a hydroxyl group and another cyclohexane ring attached. Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. The main ring is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, so that's a cyclohexane ring with a carbonyl group attached (the aldehyde). Then, at position 1, there's a substituent which is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl). So the structure would be a cyclohexane ring with an aldehyde group, and attached to the same carbon (position 1) is a methyl group that's connected to a hydroxyl group and a cyclohexyl group.

Wait, maybe more accurately: the main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is cyclohexane with an aldehyde (CHO) group. The substituent is at the 1 position, which is attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. So it's like, the main ring has at one carbon a substituent that is CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexane? Or maybe it's CH2 connected to both a cyclohexyl and an OH group. Wait, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)-, so that's a methyl group with a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl substituent. So the substituent would be CH(OH)(cyclohexyl). So the structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde with a substituent at position 1 which is CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

So starting from ethynylcyclohexane. Ethynylc
