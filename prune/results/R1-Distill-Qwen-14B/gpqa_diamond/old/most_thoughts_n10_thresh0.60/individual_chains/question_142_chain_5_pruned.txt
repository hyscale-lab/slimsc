Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and where it's located geometrically in the qubits space. Hmm.

The density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, a density matrix usually describes the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. So for a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix.

I remember that the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states geometrically. Pure states are on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside. The Bloch vector representation comes into play here.

Let me recall how to express a density matrix in terms of the Bloch sphere. The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where I is the identity matrix, r is a 3-dimensional vector, and σ are the Pauli matrices. Oh wait, yeah, that's right.

So the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Wait, let me compute what that would be. Let's see, |0><0| is a matrix with 1 at (1,1) and 0 elsewhere, and |1><1| is 1 at (2,2). So adding them together gives a matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s off-diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2 gives each diagonal element as 0.5. So ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. That's the identity matrix times 1/2.

Wait, because I = [[1,0],[0,1]], so (1/2)I is [[0.5,0],[0,0.5]], which matches. So ρ is equal to (I + 0·σ)/2, because when r is zero, the identity matrix comes from (I + 0)/2. So that means the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0).

But wait, let me think again. The general form ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So let's compute that. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ would
