Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), which I think means the star's atmosphere behaves like a perfect blackbody in terms of emission.

Wait, I remember something about the Boltzmann distribution. Oh right, in LTE, the population of energy levels depends exponentially on the energy difference and the temperature. The formula is something like the ratio of populations N_upper/N_lower = exp( -ΔE/(kT) ), where ΔE is the energy difference, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

So in this case, for star_1, the excitation is higher. Let's denote the excitation level for star_1 as N1 and star_2 as N2. The given is that N1 = 2 * N2. But wait, no, actually the question states that "iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2". Oh wait, I need to clarify: when they say "excited in a specific energy level", are they talking about the number of atoms in that higher energy level compared to some lower level? Or perhaps the ratio of their populations?

Assuming it's the ratio of the number of excited atoms in a certain energy
