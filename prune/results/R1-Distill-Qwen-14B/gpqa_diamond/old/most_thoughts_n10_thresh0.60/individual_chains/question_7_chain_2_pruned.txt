Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays their lifetimes in the universe are limited by this process γγ → e+e−. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are A to D, all in GeV range.

Hmm, I remember that this process is related to the photon-photon interaction, which only happens at very high energies. The CMB has a certain energy, and when a high-energy gamma-ray photon interacts with a CMB photon, they can annihilate into an electron-positron pair. This process would limit the lifetime of such gamma-rays because they get absorbed over time.

So, the lifetime is limited because the gamma-rays are being converted into other particles. The question is about finding the energy where this happens. I think I need to calculate the energy threshold for this process.

Wait, the threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to produce the rest mass of the electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so the pair would require at least 1.022 MeV. But wait, in the center-of-mass frame, the total energy needs to be at least twice the electron mass.

But wait, the energy of the CMB photon is given as 1e-3 eV, which is much lower than MeV. So the high-energy gamma-ray photon must have enough energy when combined with the CMB photon to create the pair.

So the condition is that the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame should be at least twice the electron mass. Alternatively, considering the photon energies, the product of their energies should be greater than a certain value.

Wait, photons have energy E1 and E2. But since CMB photon is low energy (E2 ≈ 1e-3 eV), the gamma-ray photon must have E1 such that when they interact, their combined energy is sufficient.

I think the formula is something like the product of their energies must be on the order of (mc^2)^2, where mc^2 is the electron rest mass energy. Because the photon-photon cross-section for pair production is significant when the center-of-mass energy is above 2mc^2.

Wait, to
