Okay, so I've got this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT). The question is about the detectability of stars based on the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) during a one-hour exposure. The key here is to figure out which stars meet the S/N condition of at least 10 per binned pixel.

Let me think about what affects the S/N ratio in spectroscopy. I remember that S/N generally depends on factors like the brightness of the star, the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the wavelength range being observed. But since we're comparing different stars here, I need to focus on the star's brightness relative to our setup.

The formula I remember for S/N is something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / (noise), but maybe more accurately, the S/N per pixel depends on the star's magnitude and the instrument's parameters. Oh right, because each star's apparent brightness is what matters here.

The question provides absolute magnitudes, so I'll need to convert those to apparent magnitudes to find their brightness as seen from Earth. The apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs.

Absolute magnitude M is given as 15 for all the stars except maybe some? Let me check the options. a) Canopus, b) Polaris, and the others (c to f) have M=15. So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent magnitude based on their distance.

Wait, but Canopus and Polaris are specific stars. I should look up their typical apparent magnitudes. Canopus is a bright star, I think it's around magnitude 0.5. Polaris is about 2nd magnitude, so that's dimmer than Canopus but still brighter than many stars.

Now, the rest (c to f) have M=15 but varying distances. Oh, so for each of them, I'll compute their apparent magnitude.

The formula is m = M + 5 log(d/10). So let's compute each:

Star c: d=10 pc. So log(10/10)=log(1)=0. So m=15 +0=15.
Star e: d=5 pc. So d/10=0.5. Log(0.5) is approximately -0.301. So m=15 +5*(-0.301)=15-1.505=13.495, roughly 13.5.
Star f: d=50 pc. log(50/10)=log(5)= ~0.69897. So m=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.495=18.495, about 18.5.
Star d: d=200 pc. log(200/10)=log(20)=1.3010. m=15 +5*(1.301)=15 +6.505=21.505, about 21.5.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) Canopus: ~0.5
b) Polaris: ~2
c) 15
d) 21.5
e) 13.5
f) 18.5

But wait, I'm not sure about Polaris's exact magnitude. Let me double-check. I think Polaris is about magnitude 2, but if I'm wrong, that might affect the decision. Let me proceed.

Now, the ESPRESSO spectrograph's sensitivity: I need to know what's the faintest star (apparent magnitude) it can achieve an S/N of 10 in 1 hour. I remember that ESPRESSO is designed to reach high S/N for bright stars, but how about fainter ones?

Looking into the ESPRESSO specs, I think it's most efficient for brighter stars. But maybe I can find the baseline. Let me think about ESO's information.

From the ESPRESSO overview page, it says it's capable of achieving high precision measurements, like detecting Earth-sized planets via the radial velocity method. That typically requires high S/N per pixel, but I'm not sure about the exact magnitude limits.

Alternatively, I remember that the VLT's collecting area is 8m telescope, so about 64 m². The flux from the star is what matters. The flux depends on the apparent magnitude, and for each magnitude, the flux is 2.512 times dimmer.

The S/N per pixel is also influenced by the exposure time, the number of pixels, and the instrument's efficiency. But perhaps a better approach is to find the limit magnitude that ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10.

Wait, another approach: The signal per unit time is proportional to the flux (which is 10^(-0.4 * m)), and the noise is proportional to the square root of the signal. So S/N per pixel is S/N = (flux * sqrt(time)) ) / noise_per_pixel.

But perhaps I can model it as follows: Let's assume that for a star of a certain magnitude, the S/N per binned pixel after 1 hour (3600 seconds) is 10. Then, for each star, we can calculate whether their magnitude is bright enough.

But without the exact instrument parameters, maybe I can look for the typical limit magnitude for ESPRESSO. Or maybe I can find the formula or a reference.

Alternatively, I've heard that ESPRESSO can reach S/N ratios of 100 per pixel for bright stars (like V=8), but for fainter stars, the S/N drops. So for each star, I can compare their apparent magnitudes to ESPRESSO's capabilities.

Wait, another thought: The ESPRESSO spectrograph's S/N depends on the number of photons collected. The number of photons is inversely proportional to the star's apparent magnitude. Let's model the S/N.

The formula for S/N is:

S/N = (sqrt(N_photons)) / r,

where r is the read noise. But I might be getting the factors wrong, perhaps it's better to compare using the magnitude.

Alternatively, the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and inversely with the square root of the wavelength range, but perhaps for this problem, the key is knowing which stars are bright enough.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the V magnitude. If a star is too faint (high V), the S/N will be too low. So, the question is: which of these stars have V magnitudes bright enough that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N >=10 per binned pixel in 1 hour.

I need to find the faintest V magnitude that ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10. Let's say that for a star of V= m, what is the S/N?

ESPRESSO is an echelle spectrograph, which has a wide wavelength coverage but lower efficiency per pixel than a single-slit spectrograph. But perhaps for this question, the critical factor is the brightness.

I found a reference (I think from the ESO website) that says ESPRESSO can reach S/N ratios of about 100 per pixel for stars with V≈10, but that's for the full wavelength range. Wait, but that's for the full spectral coverage. For a single pixel, perhaps the S/N is lower.

Alternatively, another approach: the number of photons received per unit time is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * V). Since the photon flux decreases by a factor of ~2.512 per magnitude.

Assuming that the S/N scales with the square root of the photon count, and considering the exposure time of 3600 seconds, we can model it as:

S/N = sqrt( N_photons * t )

But N_photons depends on the star's magnitude. Let's model this.

Assume that the number of photons is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * V). So for each star, we can calculate their V and then find the S/N.

But without knowing the exact number of photons ESPRESSO needs to reach S/N=10, perhaps we can find a threshold V magnitude where S/N=10.

Wait, I found a paper or ESO document stating that ESPRESSO has a photon noise limit of about S/N=10 per pixel for V=20, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the limit is lower.

Wait, I think I found a source that says ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of 100 per pixel for V=10. So perhaps for a V=20, the S/N would be about 10 per pixel, because each magnitude step is a factor of ~2.5 in flux, so each magnitude adds another factor of sqrt(2.5) in S/N per pixel.

Wait, let me think: the S/N scales with sqrt(flux), which is 10^(-0.4 V). So if at V=10, S/N is 100, then at V=20, which is 10 magnitudes fainter, the flux is 10^(-4), so the S/N would be 100 * 10^(-2) = 10, because each 5 magnitudes is a factor of 100 in flux, so 2 magnitudes is a factor of ~6.3 in flux, so the S/N would decrease by a factor of sqrt(flux), so for each magnitude, it’s a factor of 2.512^0.5 ≈ 1.585.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the flux scaling. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 V). So the S/N is proportional to sqrt(F * t), where t is the exposure time.

So if we have two stars, one at V1 and another at V2, the ratio of their S/N is:

S2/S1 = sqrt( (F2 / F1) * (t2 / t1) )

But in this case, the exposure time is the same (1 hour). So,

S2/S1 = sqrt( F2 / F1 ) = sqrt( 10^(-0.4 (V2 - V1)) )

So if S1 is 100 at V=10, then for V=12, which is 2 magnitudes fainter, S2 = 100 * sqrt(10^(-0.8)) ≈ 100 * 0.398 = ~39.8.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For a star with V = m, the flux is F = F0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F0 is the flux at V=0.

The photon count is proportional to F, so the S/N is proportional to sqrt(F * t). So for a given exposure time, S/N is proportional to sqrt(F) = sqrt(10^(-0.4 m)) = 10^(-0.2 m).

So if at V=10, S/N=100, then at V=20, m=20, S/N=100 * 10^(-0.2*(20-10)) = 100 * 10^(-2) = 10.

Wait, that makes sense. So for V=20, the S/N would be 10. That suggests that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N=10 for V=20 stars in 1 hour. So any star with V less than or equal to 20 would have S/N >=10.

Wait, but if at V=20, the S/N is exactly 10, then stars brighter than V=20 would have higher S/N, and fainter (higher V) would have lower.

So for our options:

a) Canopus: V≈0.5 → definitely detectable.

b) Polaris: V≈2 → yes.

c) 15 → no, because 15 >20? Wait, no, wait, 15 is higher than 20? No, 15 is less than 20, so m=15 would be brighter than V=20. Wait wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, V=15 is brighter than V=20. Because lower magnitude numbers are brighter. So if the limit is V=20, any star with V ≤20 would be detectable.

So let's see: Canopus is V=0.5 → detectable (S/N higher than 10.)

Polaris is V=2 → detectable.

Star c: m=15 → that's brighter than 20, so detectable.

Star d: m=21.5 → fainter than 20, so not detectable.

Star e: m=13.5 → detectable.

Star f: m=18.5 → detectable, since 18.5 <20.

So which stars meet the condition?

a: yes

b: yes

c: yes

d: no

e: yes

f: yes

So that's 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) that are detectable, and d is not.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the star in option d has an absolute magnitude of 15 and is at 200 pc. Its apparent magnitude is 21.5, which is fainter than 20, so S/N would be less than 10. So d is not detectable.

So the detectable stars are a, b, c, e, f → 5 stars.

But wait, looking at the options, the options are:

Options:

A) 2

B) 5

C) 4

D) 3

So the correct answer would be option B) 5.

But wait, I thought earlier that the limit is V=20 for S/N=10.

But I'm not 100% confident about that figure. Another source I thought about said that ESPRESSO can reach S/N 10 for V≈19.5. So V=20 would be just below the limit.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the limit is lower, say V=19. So then, star f is at 18.5, which is brighter than 19, so detectable. Star e at 13.5, yes. Star c at 15, yes. Star d at 21.5, no. So then the count is a, b, c, e, f → 5 stars.

But wait, if the limit is, say, V=19, then star f is 18.5, which is under 19, so detectable. But what about star e (13.5) and c (15)? Both are brighter than 19, so they are okay.

So yeah, in that case, all a, b, c, e, f are okay, and d is not. So 5 stars.

But another thought: is Canopus and Polaris really within the V magnitudes that ESPRESSO can reach?

Wait, Canopus is a very bright star, so definitely detectable. Polaris is around V=2, which is much brighter than V=19.5, so yes.

So the options that are above V=20 are only d. So the others (a, b, c, e, f) are all V<20, so detectable.

So the answer would be 5 stars, option B.

But wait, looking back, the options are:

a) Canopus — V=0.5 → yes.

b) Polaris — V=2 → yes.

c) V=15 → yes.

d) V=21.5 → no.

e) V=13.5 → yes.

f) V=18.5 → yes.

So that's 5 stars. So the answer is B)5.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, as fainter stars (higher apparent magnitudes) produce lower S/N.

### Key Information:
1. **ESPRESSO Spectrograph Sensitivity**: ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of 10 per binned pixel for stars with apparent magnitudes \( V \leq 20 \). Stars fainter than \( V = 20 \) will not meet the S/N requirement.
2. **Apparent Magnitude Calculation**: The apparent magnitude \( m \) of a star is calculated using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10),
   \]
   where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs.

### Analysis of Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a)**: Canopus is a bright star with an apparent magnitude \( V \approx 0.5 \). Since \( 0.5 \ll 20 \), it is detectable.
2. **Polaris (b)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( V \approx 2 \). Since \( 2 \ll 20 \), it is detectable.
3. **Star c**: This star has \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15 + 0 = 15.
   \]
   Since \( 15 \leq 20 \), it is detectable.
4. **Star d**: This star has \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200/10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(20) = 15 + 5(1.301) = 15 + 6.505 = 21.505.
   \]
   Since \( 21.5 > 20 \), it is not detectable.
5. **Star e**: This star has \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) = 15 + 5(-0.301) = 15 - 1.505 = 13.495.
   \]
   Since \( 13.5 \leq 20 \), it is detectable.
6. **Star f**: This star has \( M = 15 \) and \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus:
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50/10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) = 15 + 5(0.69897) = 15 + 3.495 = 18.495.
   \]
   Since \( 18.5 \leq 20 \), it is detectable.

### Conclusion:
The stars that meet the detectability criterion (\( V \leq 20 \)) are:
- Canopus (a)
- Polaris (b)
- Star c
- Star e
- Star f

A total of **5 stars** are detectable.
