Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN^-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal-ligand complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So the higher β complexes will form more readily.

Wait, but what's the structure of the complexes here? Cobalt can form different complexes with thiocyanate. The question mentions dithiocyanato complexes, so that's complexes with two SCN^- ligands, right? So the blue complex is probably Co(SCN)_n where n is 2? Or maybe another structure.

Wait, the β values are for different complexes. Let me think. The stability constant, β, for a complex [M(L)_n] is defined as [ML^n]/([M][L]^n). So each β here corresponds to a different order of ligands attached to Co^2+.

Wait, the βs are given for each complex. So β1 is for the first complex, probably [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], β3 for [Co(SCN)_3], and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]. So each βn is for the complex with n SCN- ligands.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Dithiocyanato would be two SCN- per Co^2+. So the complex [Co(SCN)_2]^something. So the relevant β here is β2=40, but wait, but also, higher β might mean more of that complex. But I think the question is asking about the total percentage of the blue complex, which I think is the one with two SCN- ligands.

Wait, but I might be mixing up the
