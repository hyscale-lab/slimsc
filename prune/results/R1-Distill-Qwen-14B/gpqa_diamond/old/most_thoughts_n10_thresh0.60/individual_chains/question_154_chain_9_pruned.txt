Okay, I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of an unknown compound based on the spectral data provided. Let's see what I've got.

So, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest peak at 100%. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, that could be a fragment or maybe an isotope. Wait, m/z 158 is two units higher than 156. Chlorine has an atomic weight of around 35, so if the molecule has a Cl, that would make sense because Cl has a significant mass. Oh wait, Cl's isotopes are about 35 and 37. So the molecular ion would have different isotopic peaks. Let me think: the molecular formula might include Cl. So the molecular weight is 156. Hmm, I need to figure out possible formulas.

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That sounds like an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have a broad O-H peak and a strong carbonyl around 1700. So maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative? Or perhaps an ester or something with an acid group.
