Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember from the question that ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than V magnitude 17. HIRES can observe stars brighter than V mag 16. So any star that's brighter than (or equal to) their respective thresholds can be detected by each. But wait, the question is asking which stars can be observed by both. So the stars must be detectable by both instruments.

Looking at the stars, each has different parameters. I think I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each because that's what the spectrograph limits depend on.

Wait, Star1 has an absolute magnitude of 15.5 and is at 10 pc. So apparent magnitude m = M + 5 log10(d/10). So for Star1, M=15.5, d=10.

So m = 15.5 + 5*(log10(10/10)) = 15.5 + 5*0 = 15.5. So apparent V mag is 15.5.

Star2: it already gives the apparent V mag as 16.5. And it's at 5 pc. But wait, maybe I should check if that makes sense. Absolute magnitude M is m -5 log10(d/10
