Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that σ matrices are related to the generators of Lorentz transformations or something like that.

Wait, but the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. So I need to figure out the dimensions first.

I think the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is determined by ensuring that the entire Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because it's in 4 spacetime dimensions. The Lagrangian density has units of [Energy]^4, so each term must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down each part of the term. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ ψ F.

What are the dimensions of ψ? Fermions like ψ have mass dimension 3/2. Because for a scalar field φ, the mass dimension is 1, and since ψ is a spinor, it's (1 + 3)/2 = 2? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. In 4 dimensions, a scalar field has mass dimension 1. For a Dirac spinor ψ, each ψ has dimension 3/2 because the action is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ ψ has dimension (3/2 + 3/2) = 3. So each ψ is 3/2.

Now, σ_{μν} is a product of γ matrices. The γ matrices are dimensionless. So σ is also dimensionless. So when ψ̄ acts on σ, that's just ψ̄ times σ (so dimension 3/2 + 0 = 3/2? Wait, no. Wait, ψ̄ is adjoint spinor, same dimension as ψ, which is 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be 3/2 (ψ̄) * (dimensionless σ) * 3/2 (ψ) = 3. Because 3/2 +
