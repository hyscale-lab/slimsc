Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about diatomic molecules. Hmm, let me think. The question is about a molecule in its fundamental state and what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, the model they're using is the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh right, because in the rigid rotor model, the bond length doesn't change, but here it can vibrate, so it's non-rigid.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (usually J=0 or maybe J=1, depending on whether it's a rigid or non-rigid rotor). Oh wait, but in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational contributions.

Wait, no, wait. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. Because the ground state would have both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers at their lowest values. So if the molecule is in the fundamental state, it's at v=0, J=0.

The question is about the photon needed to switch to the next lowest energy state. Oh, the next state would be the next possible higher energy state. Since energy levels in a diatomic molecule involve both vibration and rotation, the next state could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the next rotational state (like J=1, but that's higher than v=1? Not sure about the ordering). Hmm, but in terms of energy, which one is lower: increasing J or increasing v?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels have a spacing of ħω, while rotational energy levels are spaced by (ħ²/(2I)), where I is the moment of inertia. So which is larger? Let's see.

Given the parameters, the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. Let me calculate the vibrational energy spacing. The energy for vibration is (1/2) ħω for v=0 and (3/2) ħω for v=1. So the difference is ħω.

For rotation, the energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1))/(2I). The moment of inertia I is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass.

Wait, the reduced mass μ is (Mx * My)/(Mx
