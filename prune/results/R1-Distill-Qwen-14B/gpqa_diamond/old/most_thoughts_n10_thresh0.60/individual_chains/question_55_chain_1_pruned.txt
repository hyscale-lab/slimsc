Alright, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Okay, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Let me start by recalling what each of these compounds would look like. Acetate esters typically have the structure R-O-CO-O-R, but wait, no, acetate is OAc, so the structure would be R-O-CO-OCH3. Oh wait, no, acetate is CH3COO-, so the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no. Acetate esters are like R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, the structure is R-O-CO-O-R', but in this case, R' is methyl because it's acetate. So the ester group is OAc attached to an oxygen connected to an alkyl group.

Wait, no. The acetate ester would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, I think it's R-O-CO-O-R, but for acetate, R would be CH3. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure of propenyl acetate. Propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2- but that's not right. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but if it's propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the acetate ester would have the structure CH3COO-O-R, where R is the propenyl group. So the R group is attached to the oxygen of the acetate.

Wait, maybe I should draw this. So, for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait. No, the acetate is CH3CO-O-R, so R is the propenyl group. Propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2... No, wait. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-? Hmm, but propenyl can have different structures
