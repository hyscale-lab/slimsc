Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson X. The question gives the interaction Lagrangian and the mass of X. I need to figure out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.

First, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, I think I might be misreading that. Oh, right, the way it's written, I think it's L_int = -λf f(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So this looks like an interaction term where the boson X couples to fermions. The fermion part is ψ_f, and f could be the flavor or type of fermion.

So the interaction term suggests that X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. Because in the term, X is multiplied by ψ_f and its adjoint, which would correspond to creating or annihilating a fermion pair. So the boson X can decay into any fermion species that this term allows.

Now, the mass of X is 6 GeV. To find the allowed decay products, I need to check the mass of the fermion pairs. Each decay channel produces a pair of fermions, like b b-bar, c c-bar, etc. The mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion for that decay to be possible.

Let me list the masses of various fermions:

- Up-type quarks: u, c, t. But the top quark is about 173 GeV, which is way higher than 6 GeV. So t quark is out because 2*173 is 346 GeV, way more than X's mass.

- Down-type quarks: d, s, b. The bottom quark is around 4.5 GeV. So 2*4.5 is 9 GeV. X is 6 GeV, which is less than 9 GeV. So b quarks can't be produced because 6 < 9 → 6 < 2m_b. Wait, wait, that's important. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 2m_b is more than X's mass. So any decay channel involving bottom quarks is not allowed.

Similarly, for other quarks:

- u quark is about 2 MeV, so 2m_u is negligible. So X can decay into u u-bar.

- d quark is around 3-5 MeV, so again, 2m_d is way less than 6 GeV. So d quark pairs allowed.

- s quark is about 95-100 MeV, so 2m_s is about 190 MeV, way less than 6 GeV. So s s-bar allowed.

Wait, but earlier for b quarks, 2m_b is about 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. So any decay involving b quarks is not allowed.

Now for leptons:

- e is about 0.511 MeV,
