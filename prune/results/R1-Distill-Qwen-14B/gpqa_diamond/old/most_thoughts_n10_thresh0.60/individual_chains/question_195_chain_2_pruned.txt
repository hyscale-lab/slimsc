Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question says. 

Alright, the setup is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius, and it's in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2. The star's radius is 1.5 times the Sun's. The orbital period of the first planet is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. I need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have such that it also exhibits both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane, and the second also has a circular orbit.

Hmm, okay. So, what do I know about transits and occultations? Well, transit is when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we lose the planet's light (if it's bright enough) from our view. For both events to happen, the planet must pass both in front and behind the star. That probably means their orbits must be aligned in a way that allows this.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect this? I think the key here is the orbital periods of both planets. They need to be in such a ratio that the second planet doesn't take too long an orbit, so that the first planet can catch up to it, allowing them to transit each other's paths from our perspective. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's about the synodic period or something like that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the conditions needed for both transits and occultations. Let me recall. For a transit, the planet must pass in front of the star. The impact parameter is 0.2, which tells us how far the planet's path is from the center of the star. An impact parameter of 0 would mean a direct transit through the center.

But how does that relate to the occultation? Oh, right. For an occultation, the planet has to pass behind the star. So the planet must be on the opposite side of the star relative to us at some point. So the two events (transit and occultation) happen when the planet's orbit is such that it can swing in front and behind the star as seen from Earth.

Wait, but both planets are in the same orbital plane. So, for the second planet to have both events, the alignment must be just right. But I think the main point is about the orbital periods of the two planets. The first planet has a period of 3 days. The second's period is what we're trying to find.

Wait, but why would the orbital period affect whether both events happen? Oh! Because if the second planet's orbital period is too long, the first planet would have lapped it, so the alignment necessary for both transit and occultation wouldn't occur. Wait, no, maybe the other way around. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the second planet's orbital period must be such that it's in a resonant orbit with the first planet. But I'm not sure. Maybe it's about the relative orbital periods and the timescale over which transits can occur.

Wait, another approach: the transit and occultation events are possible only if the second planet's orbital distance allows it to pass
