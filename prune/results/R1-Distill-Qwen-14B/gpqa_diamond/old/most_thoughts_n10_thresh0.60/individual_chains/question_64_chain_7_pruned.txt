Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it says. Hmm, it's about heating a mixture of salts and analyzing the gases produced through various reactions.

Alright, the problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams is heated to 200°C without air. This produces a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through a series of tubes. The first tube has Mg(ClO4)2, which I know is a desiccant, but wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is actually a strong dehydrating agent and can react with water. Oh wait, but in this case, the gases pass through it. So maybe it's absorbing moisture? Or perhaps reacting with certain gases? Hmm. Then the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Oh, right, because when gases pass through a basic solution, they might react. And the third tube is red-hot copper, so probably reacting with gases like CO2 or something else.

The results are that tubes 1 and 3 gained 3.60 g and 0.80 g respectively. The second tube's weight didn't change. Then, after all that, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained. Under standard temperature and pressure (STP), 22.4 liters is 1 mole, so 2.24 L is 0.1 moles.

I need to figure out what's happening here. Let me think about the possible reactions.

First, the initial salts A and B are heated. If they're equimolar and form gases upon heating, maybe they decompose. For example, common salt decompositions can produce gases like NH3, CO2, H2O (though H2O is a liquid at 200°C?), maybe NO, SO2, etc. But since the gases are passed through Mg(ClO4)2, which is a drying agent, perhaps the first gas is something that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2. Wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water. So any gas that is moisture (like water vapor) would be absorbed by tube 1. So if the initial heating produces water vapor and some other gases, that could explain the 3.60 g gain in tube 1.

Then, the remaining gases go into the Ca(OH)2 solution. If any CO2 or SO2 is present, they would react. But the weight of the second tube didn't change, so maybe no CO2 or SO2 was present? Or perhaps the gases didn't react with Ca(OH)2. Alternatively, maybe the Ca(OH)2 is in a tube, and if the gas doesn't react, the weight wouldn't change. So maybe the gas here is something inert, but that doesn't make sense because the third tube is copper. Oh wait, maybe the gas is NH3 or something else that reacts with copper.

Wait, in the third tube, red-hot copper is present. So if a gas like CO2 is passed over hot copper, it might not react. But if the gas was H2S, it might react, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe
