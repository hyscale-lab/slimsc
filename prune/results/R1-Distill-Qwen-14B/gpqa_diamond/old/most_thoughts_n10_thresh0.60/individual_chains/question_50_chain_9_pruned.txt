Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on the given "size estimate" expression. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the order of the terms in the perturbative expansion. Each loop typically adds a certain factor to the amplitude calculation, which comes from integrating over the loop momentum.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to break this down. Let's see, alpha is the fine-structure constant, right? So alpha is e^2/(4pi epsilon_0) or something like that, but more generally, it's a dimensionless coupling constant. The 'g' here is probably another coupling constant, maybe from a non-Abelian gauge theory like SU(2) or SU(3).

Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (i) from the propagators, but more importantly, it introduces an integral over the loop momentum, which introduces factors of 4pi (from the volume of the sphere in the loop integral) and possibly factors of sqrt(2 pi) if using some integration conventions. But wait, the exact factors might vary depending on the regularization scheme, like dimensional regularization or cutoff methods.

But looking at the term (4pi)^6 in the denominator: that suggests that each loop contributes a 4pi factor. So, how many loops would lead to (4pi) raised to the power of 6? Let's see, if each loop contributes a 4pi, then the number of loops L would have (4pi)^L. But in the denominator, it's (4pi)^6, so that would imply L is 6. But wait, that can't be right because the overall term is 1/(4pi)^6, so the denominator would be (4pi)^6, meaning the numerator would have (4pi)^L. But the expression is 8 * sqrt(2) * ... etc., divided by (4pi)^6. So, if the numerator has (4pi)^L and the denominator is (4pi)^6, then the net would be (4pi)^(L-6). But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe each loop contributes a 4pi factor in the denominator. Wait, no, because when you do loop integrals, you often have factors like 1/(4pi)^d, where d is the spacetime dimension. But our spacetime is four-dimensional, so maybe each loop brings in a 1/(4pi)^2 factor, since in 4D, the loop integral in momentum space would involve integrating over d^4k, and the integral might typically result in a 1/(4pi)^2 factor after some manipulations. But I'm not exactly sure of the exact factor.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the general scaling with the number of loops. Each loop typically adds a certain number of factors of the coupling constants and might also introduce factors from the integrals. For example, a one-loop diagram would have a term proportional to (alpha * g^something) multiplied by 1/(4pi)^something. 

Let's think about the degrees. Let's say the expression is proportional to (alpha^3 g^2)
