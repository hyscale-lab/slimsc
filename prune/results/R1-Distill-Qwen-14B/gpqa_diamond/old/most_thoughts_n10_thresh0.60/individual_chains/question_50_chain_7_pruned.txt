Okay, so I need to figure out how many loops the Feynman diagram has based on the given "size estimate" expression. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process, which in turn affects the dimensions of the terms in the perturbation expansion.

Wait, the expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break down each part.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is a dimensionless quantity. Similarly, g would be a coupling constant, also dimensionless. The sqrt(2) and 8 are just numerical factors. The denominator (4pi)^6 is interesting because 4pi often comes from integrals in loop calculations. And (Q/M)^2 is a ratio of energy scales; since they're both energies, their ratio is dimensionless.

But how does this relate to the number of loops? I think each loop contributes a factor of (1/(4pi)^d) where d depends on the loop integral's dimension. Wait, no, more accurately, each loop in four-dimensional spacetime (which is the usual case) gives a factor that includes (4pi)^{-n}, where n is the number of loops. Or maybe it's (4π)^{- (number of loops)}? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, I remember that in dimensional regularization, the loop integrals contribute factors of (4π)^ε, but that's in dimensional regularization around 4 dimensions
