Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total weight is 7.20 grams. They heated this mixture to 200°C without air, which probably means it's a closed container or under conditions where no oxygen is present. When heated, only a mixture of gases formed. These gases were then passed through several tubes without cooling.

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (tube №1), then a Ca(OH)2 solution (tube №2), and finally red-hot copper (tube №3). The results are that tube 1 gained 3.60g, tube 3 gained 0.80g, and tube 2 didn't change. Additionally, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure (STP). 

Our goal is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options given are 13, 15, 17, or 19.

Hmm, okay, I think the first step is to analyze what's happening in each of these tubes. Each tube is probably reacting with specific gases in the mixture. Let's break it down.

Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can react with water vapor. So, if the gas mixture passes through it and the tube's weight increased by 3.60g, that probably means Mg(ClO4)2 is absorbing water, which would mean the gas has water vapor. So, the weight gained (3.60g) is the mass of water absorbed. 

Wait, but let me think about the reaction. Mg(ClO4)2 is an anhydrous salt; when it reacts with water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O. So the mass increase is the mass of water. So, 3.60g of H2O is added to the tube. That's a key point.

So, the amount of H2O is 3.60g. Let me calculate the moles of H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So, 3.60g / 18 g/mol = 0.2 mol of H2O. So, 0.2 moles of water were present in the gas mixture.

Next, tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change. I think that means the gas didn't react with the solution. Usually, CO2 could react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But if no reaction occurred, maybe the gas didn't have CO2. Alternatively, maybe other gases don't react, but if CO2 was present, the solution would gain mass. Since there's no change, perhaps CO2 isn't present. Or maybe another possibility, but I think CO2 is the main suspect here.

Then, tube 3: red-hot copper. The weight increased by 0.80g. Red-hot copper in a gas stream is usually used to react with gases containing oxygen. The reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. So, the gas must have O2 because copper is reacting and forming CuO. The mass gained here would be the mass of O2 consumed.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think: if copper is in tube 3, and O2 is present, then the reaction is 2Cu + O2 → 2CuO. So, for every mole of O2, two moles of CuO are formed. The mass increase is due to the O2 that reacted.

So, the mass gained in tube 3 is 0.80g. Let's calculate moles of O2. Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol. So, 0.80g / 32 g/mol = 0.025 mol of O2. So, 0.025 moles of O2 were present.

But wait, wait. Because each mole of O2 contributes 32g, so 0.80g is 0.80/32 = 0.025 mol. So, that's correct.

Now, what about the remaining gas C? It's 2.24 liters at STP. STP is 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, 2.24 L is 2.24 /22.4 = 0.1 mol. So, 0.1 moles of gas C remain.

What could gas C be? Let's think about the gases that could be in the mixture.
