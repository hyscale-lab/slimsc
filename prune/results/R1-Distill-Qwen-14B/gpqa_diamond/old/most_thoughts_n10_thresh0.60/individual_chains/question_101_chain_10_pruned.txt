Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that a student performed an acid-catalyzed reaction of 3-methylpyrrolidine with compound A. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to find out what A and the catalyst B are.

Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a cyclic amine, right? It's a five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen, and a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is a pyrrolidine with a methyl substituent on the third position.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Let me draw that out. So the pyrrolidine ring has a substituent at position 1. What's that substituent? It's cyclohexylidenemethyl. Wait, cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene substituent attached via a double bond. So the substituent is a cyclohexene group connected via a methylene (-CH2-) group? Or wait, cyclohexylidenemethyl would be a cyclohexene ring attached to a methylene group. So the structure would be the pyrrolidine ring with a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexene ring. But wait, the term "cyclohexylidenemethyl" makes me think of cyclohexylidene as a substituent on a methylene group. So it's like CH2-Cyclohexene? Or maybe it's a cyclohexane ring with a double bond (cyclohexene) attached via a methylene group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene group to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reaction. Acid-catalyzed reaction. So possible reactions could be some kind of alkylation, or maybe a condensation reaction. Wait, 3-methylpyrrolidine is a secondary amine. In acid catalysis, amines can undergo various reactions, like forming their salts, or perhaps participating in some kind of ring expansion or substitution.

Wait, I remember that in acid conditions, amines can act as nucleophiles. So maybe a nucleophilic substitution reaction? But the product seems to have a cyclohexene ring
