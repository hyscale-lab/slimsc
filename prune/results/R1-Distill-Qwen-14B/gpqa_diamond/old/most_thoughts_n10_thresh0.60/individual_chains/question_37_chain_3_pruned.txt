Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of 13C-NMR signals in the final product E. Let's break it down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on some of these reactions.

First, the starting material is propionaldehyde. I remember that propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. Then, the first reaction is with EDT and BF3. Hmm, EDT is probably ethanethioldithiolate, which is a strong base. BF3 is a Lewis acid. Oh wait, I think that's a variation of the Wittig reaction. The Wittig forms alkenes from aldehydes. So, the aldehyde (CHO) group reacts to form an alkene. So A would be an alkene.

Wait, but the reagents are EDT and BF3. Oh right, that's the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction. That's used to make alkenes with good stereochemistry. So propionaldehyde (CH3CH2CHO) would react to form an alkene. The structure after the Wittig-like reaction would be CH3CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, wait. Wait, the aldehyde is RCHO, and the Wittig would replace the O with CH2, giving RCH2CH2. Wait, that's not right. Let me think: the general Wittig reaction is R2C=O + Ph3P=CH2 → R2C=CH2 + Ph3P=O. So for propionaldehyde, CH3CH2CHO, the reaction would produce CH3CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, the aldehyde is RCHO, so the Wittig would give RCH2-CH2. Wait, propionaldehyde is CH3CH2CHO. So after Wittig, the product would be CH3CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Wait, the aldehyde group is CHO. The Wittig would form CH2=CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, the starting material is propionaldehyde: CH3CH2CHO. The Wittig reagent (from EDT and BF3) would react with the aldehyde. The general Wittig reaction replaces the O with a CH2 group. So, CH3CH2CHO → CH2=CH2? No, that can't be right. Because if it's propionaldehyde, the carbonyl is at the end. So the product would be CH2=CHCH2CH3
