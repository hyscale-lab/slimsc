Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm. Let me read through the question again.

So, there's a planet with Earth's radius orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet with 2.5 Earth radius. I need to find the maximum orbital period for this second planet such that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, what's transit and occultation again? Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so we stop seeing its light (if it's reflecting or emitting), which causes a slight increase in the star's brightness or a dip in the planet's light curve, depending on the setup.

But for both to happen, the orbital plane must be aligned so that we see both events. That probably means they're in the same orbital plane, which the question states. So the planets must have their orbits in the same plane, which is edge-on from our point of view. Because if the second planet's orbit is at a different inclination, we might not see the transit or occultation.

Wait, but the question says both planets share the same orbital plane. So their orbital planes are aligned. So their orbital periods must be such that one doesn't orbit too quickly or too slowly for both events to occur.

Hmm, I think this relates to the mutual inclination and orbital periods. But wait, maybe it's more about the
