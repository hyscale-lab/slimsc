Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I remember that density is mass divided by volume. So I need to figure out which of these options has the highest density. Let me read the options again.

Option a is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So since Earth's density is roughly 5.5 g/cm³, this one should be the same as Earth, right?

Option b is a planet with twice Earth's mass and a density of about 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if the density is given as 5.5, then that's the same as Earth. But hold on, the mass is double. Does that mean the radius is different? Because if mass increases and density stays the same, the volume (and thus radius) would change. Let me think: density is mass/volume. So if the density is the same as Earth, but mass is twice, then the volume would be twice that of Earth. Volume scales with radius cubed, so the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius, which is about 1.26 times larger.

Option c is a planet with the same composition as Earth but five times more massive. Oh, same composition as Earth, so it's made of similar materials, which would mean the same density as Earth, which is 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but if it's more massive, and same density, then the radius would be larger. Because volume would be mass/density, so five times mass would be five times volume. Volume is (4/3)πr³, so radius would be cube root of 5 times Earth's radius, which is about 1.71 times.

Option d is a planet with same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density, lower mass. The volume would be half of Earth's, so radius would be cube root of 0.5, which is about 0.794 times Earth's radius.

Wait, but the question is about density. So let's reevaluate each option's density.

Option a: Earth's density, 5.5.

Option b: Density is given as 5.5. So same as a.

Option c: Same composition → same density, 5.5.

Option d: Same composition → same density, 5.5.

Wait, then all of them have the same density? That can't be right. Am I missing something?

Wait, looking again. Option a is Earth-mass and Earth-radius, so same density
