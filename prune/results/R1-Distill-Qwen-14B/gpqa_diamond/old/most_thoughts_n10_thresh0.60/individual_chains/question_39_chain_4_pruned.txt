Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the value of 'a' in the wave function of a particle. The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position of the particles, they all ended up between x=1 and x=3. So none were found outside that range.

Wait, I remember that for a wave function, the probability of finding the particle in a certain region is given by the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wave function over that region. And since all the particles are measured between x=1 and x=3, that means the probability there must be 1, right? Because there's a 100% chance of finding the particle in that interval.

So the wave function needs to satisfy the normalization condition. That is, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 should equal 1. Oh wait, but wait, the wave function given is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me write that as ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] - 0.5i.

To find the probability density, I need to compute |ψ(x)|², which is ψ*(x) multiplied by ψ(x). Since ψ(x) is a complex number, its complex conjugate is [a / sqrt(1+x)] + 0.5i. So when I multiply them:

ψ*(x) ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)]² + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + cross terms. Wait, the cross terms would be [a / sqrt(1+x)]*(0.5i) + [a / sqrt(1+x)]*(-0.5i). Oh wait, because when you multiply (a - b)(a + b) = a² - b², so that's the same as (a)^2 + (b)^2, because b is imaginary here. So actually, ψ*(x)ψ(x) would be [a² / (1+x)] + (0.5)^2, because the imaginary parts would square to positive since i squared is -1, but with the negative signs cancelling out. Wait, let's compute it properly.

So ψ(x) = (
