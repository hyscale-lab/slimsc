Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, right? Yeah, the formula I think is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

Wait, but first I need to find the radius of the event horizon. Oh right, the event horizon radius R for a black hole is given by R = 2 G M / c^2, where M is the mass. But I don't have M directly. Oh wait, but I can find it using the angular size θ and the distance d.

The angular size θ is given as 10^-17 degrees. Let me convert that to radians because I'll need it for calculations. Oh yeah, 1 degree is π/180 radians. So θ in radians is θ_rad = (10^-17) * (π/180). That's approximately (10^-17) * 1.745e-3 ≈ 1.745e-20 radians. But maybe I can just keep it as θ ≈ 1e-17 degrees for estimation purposes.

The formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d, when R is much smaller than d. Since d is 1e10 parsecs and R is probably much smaller, this approximation should hold. Let me check: 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So, rearranging θ ≈ R/d, R = θ * d. Let me compute R. θ is 1e-17 degrees, which I converted to radians earlier. Oh wait, no, wait. No, the small angle approximation in radians is θ_rad ≈ R/d. So R = θ_rad * d.

Let me calculate θ_rad: 1e-17 degrees is 1e-17 * (π/180) ≈ 1.745e-19 radians (since π≈3.1416,
