Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's read it again.

The problem says: We've got an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their masses are negligible. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals.

Hmm, so all the particles are charged, and they're either fixed or constrained at a certain distance. The system's energy is what we're after. Since these are charges, I'm thinking about electrostatic potential energy here.

I remember that the potential energy between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = k * (q1 * q2) / r. But wait, when you have multiple charges, you have to consider the potential energy between each pair of charges. So the total potential energy would be the sum of the potential energies of all pairs.

But wait, the system is isolated, so the energy is just the sum of all the individual pair potentials. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are at 2m from P. So each of the 12 charges is 2m away from the 13th. So the potential energy between the 13th and each of the 12 is the same.

So for the 13th charge, each of the 12 contributes a potential energy of (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2m). Wait, no, wait. 2e each? Since each charge is 2e, yeah. So each pair between the central charge and the 12 others has energy (k*(2e)^2)/(2m).

Wait, but the 12 charges are all at the same point? Or are they at different points but at 2m from P? Because if they're all at the same point, that might complicate things. Or maybe they are arranged in a way that each is at 2m from P but not necessarily from each other.

Wait, the problem states that 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of those 12 is 2m away from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Because if all 12 are at the same point, then the potential energy between them would
