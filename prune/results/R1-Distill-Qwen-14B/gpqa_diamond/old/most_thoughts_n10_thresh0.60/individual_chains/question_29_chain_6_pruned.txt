Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found mutations in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the bad compound, probably by disrupting the gene's function.

The intact gene and four mutants are given. I need to look at the sequences and see which mutation is likely to cause a loss of function, which would stop the compound from being made.

So, let's think. The gene is the same in all, but each mutant shows some changes. The first step is to figure out where the mutations are located and what kind of changes they cause.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Mutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm. I'll compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Starting with the beginning:

The intact gene has the sequence starting as ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, let's break it down. Let me compare each nucleotide.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...
Wait, perhaps I should compare each part.

Wait, perhaps thinking about the changes in the exons. Since the first exon is where the changes are, and exons are coding regions, mutations here can change the amino acids.

But wait, the gene has five exons and four introns. So the exons are parts of the gene that are transcribed into mRNA. So any mutations in exons could lead to changes in the protein product.

Our goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, so we want a mutation that disrupts the gene function. That could be a nonsense mutation (early stop codon) or a frameshift that truncates the protein, or a missense that changes an important amino acid.

So let's look for changes that introduce a stop codon or disrupt the reading frame.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1:

Intact: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...

Wait, let me write the exact sequences:

Intact starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant 1: ATG TTCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT... Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutations are.

Alternatively, perhaps the best approach is to look for any insertions, deletions, or changes that would lead to a stop codon or a frameshift.

Let's compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Mutant1: The sequence changes from ...TTTCTCG... to ...TTCTACG... Maybe.

Wait, let me compare the first part.

Intact:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... 

Mutant1:
