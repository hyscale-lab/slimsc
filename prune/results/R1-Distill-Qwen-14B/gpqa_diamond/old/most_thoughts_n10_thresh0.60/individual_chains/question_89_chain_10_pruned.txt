Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see.

The initial compound is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two of the bridgeheads. 

Heating this with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, and in such cases, elimination reactions might happen. Wait, but since it's dibromide, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, let me think. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo something) react with strong base, they usually eliminate to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal; the bromines are on opposite bridgeheads. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Oh, wait! Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, and when you have dihalides on bridgeheads, especially when treated with a strong base, it might undergo a ring-opening or a rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation but that seems tricky since they're 1,3 apart. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: When dihalides undergo elimination, sometimes you get allenes or maybe even more substituted alkenes, but in adamantane's case, the structure is rigid. Alternatively, maybe each bromide undergoes elimination with the base, leading to the loss of HBr twice, forming a double bond. But in 1,3 positions, that would form a conjugated diene? But adamantane's structure is such that the bridgeheads are connected in a way that maybe it's possible to form a bridge.

Wait, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination or something else. Alternatively, could it be a ring-opening? Or perhaps a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne? Wait, but two eliminations would give an alkyne if it's a dihalide. Wait, but 1,3-dibromo... To form an alkyne, you'd need two adjacent halides, right? So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not elimination but substitution. With KOH, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But in the case of bridgehead positions, SN2 is unlikely because
