Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me read it carefully. So, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Wait, let's break it down. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring because it's a 6-membered aromatic ring. Di-substituted means it has two substituents attached. The total number of carbons is 8, so the benzene ring itself is 6 carbons, meaning the substituents add up to 2 carbons. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again. If the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add two more, that's 8 in total.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in total. The aromatic ring is 6 carbons. So the substituents must contribute 2 carbons. But the substituents are two groups attached to the ring. So each substituent would be one carbon each, or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, no, because it's di-substituted, meaning two substituents. So each substituent is one carbon each, because 2 substituents × 1 carbon each = 2 carbons. So each substituent is a single carbon group.

But wait, one substituent could be a group with more than one carbon. Wait, no, because the total is 8 carbons. 6 for the ring, so substituents contribute 2, which is two substituents each of one carbon, because 2 substituents ×1=2. Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero, but that can't be because it's di-substituted. Okay, I'm a bit confused, maybe I should approach it differently.

The IR data shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents on the benzene ring must include a carbonyl group and a halogen. Oh wait, but wait. The carbonyl group is part of a substituent. So, one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc
