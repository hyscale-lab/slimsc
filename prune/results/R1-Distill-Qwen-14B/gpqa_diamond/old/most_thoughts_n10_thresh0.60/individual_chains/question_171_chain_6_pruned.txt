Okay, so I have this question about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I need to arrange substances 1-6 based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer in increasing order. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring determine where the incoming electrophile (here, bromine) will attack. Strongly activating groups are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups are meta directors. Also, the nature of the substituent affects the reactivity of the ring—activating groups make the ring more reactive, deactivating make it less.

Let me list out each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating, ortho/para-directing substituent.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: Phenoxyethyl ester? Wait, no, it's C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure is benzoyloxyethyl? No, wait, the formula is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5? Or is it C6H5-COO-C2H5? Oh, wait, it's C6H5-CO-O-C2H5, which would be benzoyloxy ethyl? Or wait, maybe it's the ester of benzoic acid with ethanol, so it's PhCOOEt. So the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to an ethoxy group? No, wait, the structure is benzene with a carbonyloxy ethyl group—like O=C-O-Et attached to benzene. So the substituent is an ester group, O-CO-OEt. Wait, no, the substituent is actually a COOEt group. So that's a carbonyl group attached to an ether.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct. The structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So the substituent is a COOEt group attached to benzene. So that's a carbonyl oxygen connected to an ethoxy group. So, the substituent is an ester group.

Ester groups are deactivating, right? Because they're electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl. So, they are meta directors. So in such a case, when bromine adds, it would go to the meta position with respect to the ester group.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a deactivating (due to electronegativity) but ortho/para-directing substituent because of its lone pairs. So it's a meta director? Wait, no—Cl is a deactivating group but is ortho/para directing. Because even though it's deactivating, it can donate electrons through resonance, making the ortho and para positions more activated than meta.

Wait, no: Chlorine is deactivating (so ring is less reactive), but it's an ortho/para director. So in chlorobenzene, the Br would add in ortho, para, and maybe meta, but the major products are ortho and para.

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitrobenzene. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So bromine would add mainly to the meta position relative to the nitro group. So para isomer would be less in this case.

Wait, no, wait. The substituent is nitro, which is meta directing, so the major product is meta, so the para would be minor. But wait, nitro is a meta director. So when bromine reacts, the substituent directs incoming Br to meta positions. So the para-isomer, if possible, would be not the major. Wait, but in nitrobenzene, the substituent is in position 1. The possible positions for substitution are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Since it's meta, positions 3 and 5 would be major. So the para position is 4, which would not be a major product
