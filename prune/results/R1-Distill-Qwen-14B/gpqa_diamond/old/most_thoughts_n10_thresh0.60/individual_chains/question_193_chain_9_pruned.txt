Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to think it through. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, it's like N ∝ 1/plx^5. I need to find out how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) in arcseconds is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. The formula is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if the distance increases, the parallax decreases. That makes sense.

So if N is proportional to 1/plx^5, I can substitute plx with 1/d. Because plx equals 1/d, replacing that in, I get N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that: 1/(1/d)^5 is the same as d^5. So N ∝ d^5. But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm.

Wait, the number of stars as a function of distance. Oh, maybe it's the number of stars in a shell at a certain distance. So like, in a thin shell between r and r + dr, how many stars are there?

Wait, alternatively, since the number varies as 1/plx^5, which is d^5, but that's for a certain count
