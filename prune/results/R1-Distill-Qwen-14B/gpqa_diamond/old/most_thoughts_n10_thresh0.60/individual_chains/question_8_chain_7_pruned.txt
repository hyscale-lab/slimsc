Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question. Let's see what it's about. So, they're talking about white lupine and a fungal disease called anthracnose. They did an experiment to find genes that contribute to resistance. They got three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. Then they made knock-out mutants for each, and also double mutants: g1g2, g1g3, g2g3. 

The question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are proteins that help turn on other genes. So, if one is upstream, it probably regulates the others.

They tested the mutants for resistance. The wild-type has 100% resistance. Let's look at the data:

- g1:75% → So, the mutant has 75% resistance, which is less than wild-type. So, they're more susceptible, but not as bad as others.
- g2:0% → No resistance at all. So, this mutant is super susceptible.
- g3:50% → Half the resistance. So, worse than g1 but better than g2.
- g1g3:10% → Very low resistance. So, even worse than either alone.
- g2g3:0% → Also no resistance.
- g1g2:0% → No resistance.

Hmm, okay. So, the single mutants: g2 is the worst, g3 is next, and g1 is the least affected. The double mutants are even worse. For instance, g1g3 is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. Similarly, the other doubles are all 0% or 10%.

Wait, transcription factors are usually upstream. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, that might mean it's regulating others. If a plant can't make G2 (g2 mutant), it's completely susceptible. So, if G2 is a transcription factor, it might be activating other genes that provide resistance. So without G2, those downstream genes aren't expressed, leading to susceptibility.

Looking at the data, the g2 single mutant is the most susceptible (0% resistance), which suggests that G2 is critical. So, perhaps G2 is the transcription factor, because without it, all the downstream genes (like G1 or G3) aren't expressed, leading to no resistance.

Wait, but in the double mutants, the g1g2 and g2g3 are 0%, which is the same as g2 alone. That could mean that G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. Because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 can function, so the resistance is gone.

Looking at the single mutant g1:75%, which is less than wild type but not as bad as g2. So, maybe G1 is downstream of G2, but when G1 is missing, the remaining function of G3 (if present) might still provide some resistance. But in the g1g3 double mutant, resistance is 10%, which is really low.

Wait, let's think about the possibilities. The options suggest different relationships. Let's see the options:

Option A: G1 is a transcription factor, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1.

Wait, if G1 is a TF, then G2 might be downstream. But in the g2 mutant, the resistance is 0, which is worse than G1's 75%. So, if G2 is downstream of G1, then knocking out G1 would reduce resistance, but maybe not as much as knocking out G2. But in the data, G2's single mutant is worse. So, perhaps G2 is upstream.

Option B: G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 have same promoter, G3 is epistatic towards G1.

Hmm. Same
