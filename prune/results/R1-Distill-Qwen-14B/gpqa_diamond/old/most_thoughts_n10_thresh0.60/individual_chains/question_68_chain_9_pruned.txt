Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu equals gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin in the z-direction. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. After that, the average of the z-component of the particle’s moment starts oscillating. The question is asking for the oscillation frequency.

Hmm, okay. So initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with it, so I guess its magnetic moment is in the Z direction. Then, the field is switched off and turned on along Y. Since the field changes, the spin will precess around the new field direction, right?

Wait, but how does that affect the z-component of the moment? Oh, because the spin is now precessing around Y, which is perpendicular to Z. The projection along Z will oscillate sinusoidally over time.

I remember that when a magnetic moment precesses in a magnetic field, the Larmor frequency comes into play. The Larmor frequency is the frequency at which the magnetic moment precesses around the field. The formula for the Larmor frequency is omega = gamma * B. But wait, in this case, the field is along Y. So the precession is around the Y-axis, which is perpendicular to the initial direction of the spin (since the initial spin was along Z).

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the z-component of the moment. So the z-component will vary sinusoidally as the spin vector rotates around Y. So the oscillation period will be related to the Larmor frequency.

Let me think about the math. The spin state can be described using spin operators. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so in the initial state, mu_z is maximum, say mu = gamma (ħ/2) because it's a spin-1/2 particle. But then the field changes, so the Hamiltonian changes.

The initial state is |+z>, I think. When the field is along Z, the energy eigenstates are |+z> and |-z>. After the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - mu · B. Wait, wait. The magnetic dipole interaction energy is H = - mu · B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and the field is along Y, so B = B_0 * (0,0,1) when it was along Z, but now it's (0,1,0).

Wait, no. Wait, when the field is along Y, the direction is (0, B, 0), right? Because the magnitude is B, same as before. So the Hamiltonian becomes H = - mu · B = - gamma S · (0, B, 0) = - gamma B S_y.

So H is proportional to S_y. Therefore, the energy eigenstates are the eigenstates of S_y. The eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

But the initial state is |+z>. The state |
