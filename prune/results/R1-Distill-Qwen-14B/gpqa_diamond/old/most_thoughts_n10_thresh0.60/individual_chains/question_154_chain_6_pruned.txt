Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the drug is based on the spectral data given. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's a peak at 158 with 32%. Wait, molecular ion is the main peak, so the molecular weight is probably around 156. But the 158 might be a fragment or maybe an isotope. Like, chlorine has a high abundance isotope at around 35Cl (about 75%), so if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion could have a peak at 156 and another at 158 (which is 156 + 2, because Cl is about 35, so maybe Cl is present).

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But the strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So maybe a carboxylic acid (which has O-H and C=O), but wait, a carboxylic acid's O-H would be broad, but maybe in this case it's deprotonated or something. Or maybe it's an ester or another carbonyl compound.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 11.0 ppm singlet, 1H. That's really high; that's probably an O-H proton, like from a carboxylic acid. Because in D, the O-H of a carboxylic acid would be around there as a broad peak, but in this case, it's a singlet. Wait, but wait, in the IR, the O-H is broad. If it's a singlet in NMR, maybe it's not exchanging and is in a different environment. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde is around 9-10 ppm, and a singlet. But wait, the IR doesn't show a strong peak around 2800 cm^-1 for aldehyde C-H. Alternatively, the aldehyde would have a peak in IR around 1700 cm^-1 for the carbonyl.

Wait, the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720, which is a bit higher than a regular carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids are usually around 1700, but maybe it's an acid chloride or an ester. Oh, acid chloride carbonyls are higher, around 1750-1800 cm^-1. Hmm, wait, 1720 is more like an ester or maybe an acyl chloride. Wait, no, esters are around 1730-1760 cm^-1. Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think: carboxylic acids have lower carbonyl frequencies (around 1680-1720), esters are higher, maybe 1720-1760, and acid chlorides even higher. So 1720 could be either a carboxylic
