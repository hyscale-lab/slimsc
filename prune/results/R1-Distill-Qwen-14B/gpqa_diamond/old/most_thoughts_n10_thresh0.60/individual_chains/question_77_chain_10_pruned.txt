Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question presents two reactions, and I need to find the major products A and B. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different structures for A and B. Hmm, let's break it down.

First reaction: ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene is treated with BuLi and then H+. So, BuLi is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation, maybe to form an enolate. Wait, but the starting material is an enol ether. Enol ethers can undergo various reactions, but in the presence of a base like BuLi, perhaps it's undergoing some kind of elimination or rearrangement.

Wait, the Cope rearrangement involves 1,5-dienes. Oh right, the molecule given is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let's draw that structure. The benzene ring is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to an oxygen. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. So that's (CH2)2C=CHCH2-O-CH2-C6H5?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure is (3-methyl
