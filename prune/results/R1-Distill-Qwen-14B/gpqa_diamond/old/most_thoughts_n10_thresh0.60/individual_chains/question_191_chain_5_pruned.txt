Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out what the product looks like after a series of reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize it. So, it's a cyclohexanone ring. At position 3, there's a hydroxymethyl group (which is a CH2OH). At position 5, there's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like a CH2-C=CH2, but wait, more accurately, it's CH2=CH-CH2? No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2-C=CH2 but attached to the cyclohexane at the second carbon. Wait, no, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2- but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is at position 2. So structure would be CH2-C(=CH2)-. Wait, maybe it's more accurate to think of it as an isopropenyl group. Because prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's the same as isopropenyl group, which is CH2=C(CH2) but attached in a specific way. Maybe I should draw it out.

So the starting molecule has a cyclohexane ring. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl (OH-CH2-), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group, which is like a CH2-C=CH2 attached to the ring. Wait, no, maybe it's more like a CH2 group attached to a CH2-C where the CH2 is part of the double bond. Wait, perhaps it's an allyl group attached at the 2-position. Hmm, maybe it's better to think of it as a substituent with a double bond adjacent to the point of attachment.

Anyway, moving on to the first reaction. The starting material is treated with sodium hydride, followed by benzyl bromide, forming product 1. Sodium hydride is a strong base. When you have a carbonyl group like a ketone (as in cyclohexanone), adding a strong base like NaH can deprotonate the alpha hydrogens. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is a ketone (cyclohexan-1-one), so the alpha carbons are at positions 2 and 6 (if the carbonyl is at position 1). But the starting molecule has substituents at 3 and 5, which are adjacent to the carbonyl at 1. Hmm, maybe the NaH is deprotonating something else.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is getting deprotonated. The hydroxymethyl is at position 3: -CH2OH. If NaH is added, which is a strong base, it can deprotonate the OH group to form an alkoxide. Then, when benzyl bromide is added, it would perform an alkylation. So, the OH-CH2- group would become O- after deprotonation, then benzyl bromide (which is a good electrophile) would attack, leading to substitution. Wait, but the OH is on a CH2, which is attached to the ring. So, the mechanism might be an SN2 reaction, where the benzyl bromide acts as an alkylating agent.

Alternatively, maybe it's an example of the Willgerodt reaction, where a ketone is alkylated. But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, perhaps the NaH is used to deprotonate the alpha position to the carbonyl, making an enolate, and then benzyl bromide would add to that.

Wait, in the starting material, there's a ketone at position 1, and substituents at
