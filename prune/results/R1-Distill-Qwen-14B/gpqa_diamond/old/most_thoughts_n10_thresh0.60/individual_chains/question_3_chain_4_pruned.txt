Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that a spin-half particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome you'd expect from measuring an observable many times on a system in a particular state.

First, I think I should recall how to compute expectation values for operators. The expectation value of an operator O in a state |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩. So for 10σz + 5σx, the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ + 5⟨σx⟩, because expectation values are linear.

So I can compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately and then combine them with their coefficients.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, I can directly find ⟨σz⟩. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write that as a column vector. Oh wait, |↑⟩ is typically (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1). So the state vector ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let me check: 0.5 squared plus (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (0.25) + (3/4) = 1, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, σz is the Pauli z matrix: [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when you multiply σz with |↑⟩, you get 1 times |↑⟩, and with |↓⟩, you get -1 times |↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. The coefficient for |↑⟩ is 0.5, so the probability is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The coefficient for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2, so the probability is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. So, ⟨σz⟩ = 0.25 * 1 + 0.75 * (-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Wait, let me compute that again: 0.25(1) is 0.25, and 0.75*(-1)= -0.75. So 0.25-0.75 is -0.5. Correct.

Now for σx, which is the Pauli x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]]. I think σx doesn't have the same eigenbasis as σz, so the expectation value isn't as straightforward. Hmm, right, so I can't just sum probabilities multiplied by eigenvalues because the states are not eigenstates of σx.

So I need to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

Alternatively, I can write the state ψ as a column vector and compute σx multiplied by ψ, then take the conjugate transpose of ψ and multiply by that result.

Wait, ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let's compute σx * ψ. σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So multiplying this by ψ:

The first component is 0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2.

The second component is 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2) = 0.5.

So σx|ψ⟩ is
