Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again and see what I can do.

Alright, so there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, but I don't think the mass directly affects this calculation. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

They've given me some elemental abundances using the EW method, which I remember stands for Equivalent Width. And they're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so that should mean we can use standard abundance calculation methods.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2

Wait, wait. So the brackets here denote logarithmic abundances relative to another element. I remember that [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number of X to Y atoms, adjusted by the solar ratio.

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Hmm, wait, let me parse that. So, for the Sun, log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5. Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5.

Wait, no, wait. Because the formula is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals a value. So for the Sun, for Fe: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, for Mg, log10(nMg/nH) =7 -12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

I think I need to find the ratio (n_Si/n_H) for each star, then take the ratio of those two to get (n_Si,Star1)/(n_Si,Star2).

Let me list what I know.

For Star_1:
[Fe/H]_1 =0. So [Fe/H] = log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun =0. So log10(nFe/nH) = same as the Sun. So nFe/nH for Star_1 is the same as the Sun, 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

But wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) divided by solar value. So [Fe/H] = log(nFe Star /nH Star) - log(nFe Sun /nH Sun) ) → which equals log( (nFe Star /nH Star) / (nFe Sun /nH Sun) ) = 0 → so (nFe Star /nH Star) = (nFe Sun /nH Sun) → same as Sun.

So Star_1's Fe abundance is the same as the Sun's. So nFe,1 /nH,1 = nFe,Sun /nH,Sun =3.16e-5.

Wait, but I'm interested in Si. The [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] = log10(nSi/nFe) - log10(nSi/nFe)_sun =0.3.

Wait, let me think about that. The Sun's [Si/Fe] would be log10(nSi_Sun / nFe_Sun) because the denominator is the same element.

Wait no: [X/Y] is log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun, right? So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi1/nFe1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) =0.3.

Let me compute the solar ratio of Si to Fe.

Wait, I don't have the sun's [Si/Fe]. Oh wait, maybe I can compute it. Because for the sun, nFe/nH is known, and nMg/nH is known. But to get nSi/nH, I probably need more info.

Wait, the question doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe], but perhaps I can calculate it using the given data. Because for the Sun, [Mg/Si] is not given, but wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] would be log(nMg/nSi) - log(nMg/nSi)_sun. Wait, but without knowing nSi in the sun, perhaps I need another approach.

Wait, maybe the Sun's [Mg/Si] is given indirectly. Let me think. The Sun's [Mg/H] is given as 7 when you do 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7
