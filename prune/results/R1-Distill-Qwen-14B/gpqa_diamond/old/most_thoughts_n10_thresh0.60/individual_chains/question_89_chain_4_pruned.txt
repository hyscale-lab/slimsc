Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I'm a bit rusty on adamantane structures, but I remember they're diamondoid, like a diamond lattice but in a molecule. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on carbons 1 and 3.

The first step is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240Â°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination might happen here. Maybe an E2 mechanism? If the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, heating with a base could lead to dehydrohalogenation. Since there are two bromines, perhaps two eliminations happen. Each elimination would form a double bond. So maybe this forms an allene or a conjugated diene? Wait, but the product is a light yellow solid. Oh, wait, elimination of HBr would form a double bond. But since the starting material has two Brs, maybe each Br is eliminated, but given the positions, the product would be 1,3-diene? Or perhaps it's a diene in the adamantane structure.

Wait, but the NMR of product 1 shows certain peaks. The 1H NMR data is: 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O stretch). Wait, but elimination of HBr would form a double bond, but how does that lead to a carbonyl?

Hmm, maybe it's not elimination but substitution. Wait, KOH can also do substitution. But with two Brs, perhaps it's a double substitution. But then, what would that produce? Maybe each Br is replaced by an OH group, but that doesn't seem to fit the IR. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide formation? No, because epoxides are from alkenes, but I don't think that would explain the IR.

Wait, maybe the reaction is forming a ketone. The IR at 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. How could that happen? Oh, wait, maybe the elimination isn't just elimination but some kind of cyclization. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH is causing a cleavage or some kind of Hofmann rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: 1,3-dibromoadamantane could undergo dehydrohalogenation twice, forming a conjugated diene, but then maybe some ring-opening. Hmm, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the IR peak. 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl. So maybe the product is a ketone. How could 1,3-dibromoadamantane become a ketone upon heating with KOH? Perhaps a double elimination with formation of a carbonyl group via some mechanism, maybe like a gem-dihalide forming a ketone upon dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but 1,3 positions are not geminal (same carbon), they're on different carbons.
