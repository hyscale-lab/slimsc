Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that when synthesizing aromatic compounds, the order of substituent introduction matters because of the directing effects of the substituents. Benzene is a planar molecule, and each new substituent will direct where the next one goes. So, I need to consider the substituents on the ring and their positions relative to each other.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituents are tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Let's note their positions:

- 1-position: ethoxy group
- 2-position: tert-butyl group
- 3-position: nitro group

Wait, wait. Wait, 1, 2, 3 are adjacent positions. So, the ring has substituents in the 1, 2, and 3 positions. So, the numbering is such that each substituent is in a meta or para position relative to the others? Let me think. The ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, ethoxy is at ortho to tert-butyl and meta to nitro. Or no, wait, in benzene, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent, meaning each is next to the other. So, the substituents are all ortho to each other, but wait, that's impossible because three substituents can't all be adjacent in a benzene ring without overlapping. Oh, wait, no, benzene has six positions, so 1,2,3 are three consecutive positions. So, substituents are at adjacent positions, but that's impossible on a benzene ring without some being meta. Wait, no—each substituent is in a distinct position. Maybe I should sketch this out.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct ordering is where each substituent is introduced in a way that directs the next group into the correct position.

The substituents are:

- tert-butyl (a strong activating group, but wait, no—tert-butyl is an alkyl group, which is activating. Wait, but in Friedel-Crafts alkylation, tert-butyl chloride would add as a substituent. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires that the alkylating agent is not too bulky. Wait, no, wait: Friedel-Crafts alkylation is possible with tert-butyl chloride, but sometimes it's difficult because of carbocation rearrangements. Alternatively, maybe it's a direct substitution or using another method.

Wait, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's think about the substituents' directing effects. Let me list each substituent and their directing:

- tert-butyl: it's an activating group, ortho/para directing.
- ethoxy: activating, ortho/para directing.
- nitro: deactivating, meta directing.

Wait, but wait—the nitro group is meta directing. So if I have a nitro group on the ring,
