Okay, I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. So, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from their 1H NMR spectrum. The molecular formula is C10H14 for each, which suggests each is a substituted benzene with some methyl groups. 

The problem says the solution is a 1:1 mixture of two compounds, and the NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

First, I'll recall that in aromatic compounds, the protons can split into different signals depending on their environments. For example, para-substituted groups can lead to specific splitting patterns, but in NMR, if all the aromatic protons are equivalent, they'll show up as a singlet. Wait, but in this case, the question says two singlets around 6.7 ppm. So, each compound must have aromatic protons that are equivalent, but the two compounds' protons are different enough to show up as two separate singlets.

Wait, but let me think: each compound contributes their own signals. So, the mixture is 1:1, so each compound's signals are integrated as 1:1. So, in the aromatic region, each compound has one singlet, and they are different enough to not overlap, hence two singlets.

Now, looking at the methyl groups: the 2.2 ppm signals. Each compound probably has some methyl groups, but perhaps in different environments. The three signals at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio suggest that the two compounds have a total of three different types of methyl groups, but wait, the ratio is 2:1:1. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Maybe each compound contributes different numbers of methyl groups, or perhaps each has multiple methyl groups in different environments.

Let me look at each option:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would have four methyl groups. Let me visualize that. On a benzene ring, positions 1,2,3,4 have methyl groups. That's a 1,2,3,4 substitution. Similarly, 1,2,3,5 would have methyl groups at those positions. How are the methyl groups arranged? For 1,2,3,4, the ring has methyl groups adjacent to each other in a way that perhaps the ring is almost fully substituted. Wait, no, 1,2,3,4 would have all four substituents adjacent in a way that positions 1 and 4 are across from each other if the ring is numbered in a circle. Wait, maybe I should think about the symmetry.

Wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Let's imagine the benzene ring with substituents at 1,2,3,4. So, that's a para arrangement? Or maybe it's more like 1,2,3,4 are in a row, but that's impossible on a benzene ring because it's a six-membered ring. Wait, perhaps I should consider what their structures look like.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene as 1,2,3,4 being adjacent in a way that the ring has substituents on four consecutive carbons. Wait, but benzene is a ring, so 1,2,3,4 would imply four substituents in a row, but that's impossible because the ring only has six positions. Wait, perhaps the numbering is such that the substituents are on every other carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene is actually 1,2,3,4-tetra, which is a naphthal
