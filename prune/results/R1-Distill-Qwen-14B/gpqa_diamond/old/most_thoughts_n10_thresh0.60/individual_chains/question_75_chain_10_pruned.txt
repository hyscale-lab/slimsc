Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. They want to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They've introduced a coding sequence into a plasmid, modified with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected. 

Looking at the problem, the issue must be in the construct they made. The provided sequence is the plus strand of the construct. So I need to analyze this DNA sequence to find any possible issues.

First, let's look for the start and stop codons. The start codon is usually at the beginning of the coding sequence. The sequence starts with 5' ATG..., which is the start codon (methionine) in frame. So the translation should start there.

Now, looking for the stop codon. The sequence ends with ...TGA3'. So the last three codons would be TGA. Wait, TGA is a stop codon. So the construct ends with TGA.

Wait, but the question says they're inserting a sequence for the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct should have the HA tag followed by GADD45G. But in the DNA sequence, the start codon is ATG right before the HA sequence. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, the HA tag is part of the coding sequence, so the ATG is the start, then comes the HA tag, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence.

But the problem is that the protein isn't being expressed. So maybe the issue is with the stop codon. Let's see. The last part of the coding sequence is ...TGGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, looking more carefully
