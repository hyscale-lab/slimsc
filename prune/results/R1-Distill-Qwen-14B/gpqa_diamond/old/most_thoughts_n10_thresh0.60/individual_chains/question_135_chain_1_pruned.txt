Okay, so I've got this physics question about the decay of a boson. Let me try to break it down. The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction, which is the formula that describes how the boson X interacts with fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out what particles it can decay into at the lowest order.

Alright, first, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf fψ(y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh wait, perhaps it's better written as L = -λ f_f ψ̄ (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So the interaction term is proportional to X ψ̄ ψ. That suggests that X couples to fermions, probably as a Yukawa interaction. So X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. For a decay to be allowed kinematically, the total mass of the decay products must be less than the mass of X. Also, we have to consider the possible fermions that X can interact with, based on the Lagrangian.

Wait, the Lagrangian says that the interaction is with ψ_f, which I think is a fermion field. So the fermions that X can decay into are those that are present in the interaction term. So the possible fermions would be the ones that ψ_f represents.

But what fermions are available? Well, the fermions in the Standard Model are quarks (u, d, c, s, t, b) and leptons (e, μ, τ, and neutrinos). But in the interaction term, since it's ψ_f, which is a Dirac fermion, it can be any of these except neutrinos, as they are lepton number but left-handed. But the specific fermions that X can decay into depend on the possible masses allowed.

Wait, but wait. Because the mass of X is 6 GeV, any fermion pair that X decays into must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. So each fermion and antifermion pair would have a mass of 2m_fermion. So the maximum mass for each fermion would be m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV, because 2m ≤6 GeV.

So let's list all possible fermions and their masses. Let me recall the approximate masses:

- Up-type quarks: u is about 2.2 MeV, c is about 1.3 GeV, t is about 173 GeV (way too heavy).
- Down-type quarks: d is about 4.7 MeV, s is about 95 MeV, b is about 4.5 GeV.

Leptons: e is ~0.5 MeV, μ is ~105 MeV, τ is ~1.78 GeV.

Neutrinos are negligible in mass, but since the Lagrangian doesn't mention them, perhaps X doesn't interact with them? Or maybe it does. Wait, in the given Lagrangian, it's ψ_f,
