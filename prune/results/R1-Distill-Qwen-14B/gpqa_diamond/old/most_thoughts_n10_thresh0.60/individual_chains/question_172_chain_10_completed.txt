Okay, so I've got this question about two stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let's try to think this through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The stellar photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I remember that in LTE, the conditions in a small region are uniform, and things like the Boltzmann equation apply.

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of two energy levels. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), right? Where n_i and n_j are the number of particles in each state, g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So I think the ratio of the excited states is 2:1 between star_1 and star_2. But wait, I'm not sure if it's star_1's level relative to its own ground state or compared to star_2. The question says "twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2". So perhaps the ratio is [n1 (excited)] / [n1 (ground)] = 2 * [n2 (excited)] / [n2 (ground)].

Wait, no, maybe star_1's excited level population is twice that of star_2's. Or perhaps the excitation in star_1 is twice as much as in star_2. Hmm. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me read the problem again.

Oh, wait: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, the excitation level (like the population in the excited state) is twice as high in star_1's photosphere than in star_2's.

So if I denote the ratio of excited to ground states for star 1 as (n1_e / n1_g), and for star 2 as (n2_e / n2_g), then according to the problem, (n1_e/n1_g) = 2 * (n2_e/n2_g). Is that correct? Or is it that n1_e is twice n2_e? Hmm, probably the former case since it's about their excitation in their respective stars.

But then, the Boltzmann equation for each star would be:

n1_e / n1_g = (g_e/g_g) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

Similarly, for star 2:

n2_e / n2_g = (g_e/g_g) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, assuming that the energy levels are the same for both stars, so the ΔE is the same for both. Also, the statistical weights g_e and g_g are the same for both stars. So the ratio would be:

(n1_e/n1_g) / (n2_e/n2_g) )= exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because when you divide exponents with the same base, you subtract the exponents. So, exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, let me double-check that. The exponents are [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] and [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]. So when you take the ratio (n1_e/n1_g)/(n2_e/n2_g) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] ) / exp( [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] ) = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) ] ) which is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) )

But according to the problem, (n1_e/n1_g) = 2*(n2_e/n2_g). So the ratio is 2.

So:

2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) )

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, let me make sure I have the signs right. Because in the exponent, it's (1/T2 - 1/T1 ), and when I move things around, I can write it as (1/T2 - 1/T1 ) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Wait, because 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So substituting:

ln(2) = [ΔE / k ] * [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ]

Hmm, but wait, I might have messed up the signs. Let me go back.

We have:

2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Take ln:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rewritten as:

ln(2) = [ΔE/(k)] ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2) )

So that's:

ln(2) = [ (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2) ) ] * (ΔE/k )

In the problem statement, we're given ΔE = 1.38e-23 J. But we're not given k, but perhaps it's not needed because the options don't include any numerical factors. So the equation we have is in terms of T1 and T2.

So looking at the options:

Option D) ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

But wait, in our equation, it's multiplied by ΔE/k. But the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that all the constants (like ΔE and k) are already accounted for, so the structure of the equation is what matters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have ΔE. So perhaps the way the problem is presented, the equation is simplified, considering that the ratio of the populations is given by the exponentials, and we can set up the equation without needing the ΔE and k terms. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier step.

Wait, no, the problem gives the energy difference, but the options focus on the relation between T1 and T2. So perhaps I can rearrange things to get the ratio in terms of ln(2) equal to some function of T1 and T2.

Wait, in the equation I have:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Which can be rearranged as:

ln(2) = (ΔE/(k)) * ( (T1 - T2) ) / (T1 T2 )

But the options don't have ΔE or k, so perhaps the equation is simplified to the form ln(2) equals the expression with T1 and T2, but the constants are ignored because they're not part of the multiple-choice options.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So that matches the structure of our equation if we assume that (ΔE/(k)) is 1. Which would only happen if ΔE equals k. But given that ΔE is 1.38e-23 J and k is about 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k would be (1.38e-23)/(1.38e-23) ) = 1 K.

Oh! Because k is 1.38e-23 J/K, so ΔE/k is (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K.

Wait, that's a key point. Because ΔE is given as 1.38e-23 J. So ΔE/k = (1.38e-23 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K) ) = 1 K. So that term is 1.

So our equation becomes:

ln(2) = (1 K) * ( (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2) )

But wait, K is the unit for temperature, but in the equation, the (ΔE)/(k) term is 1, so it's just 1 in the equation.

So:

ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

Which is exactly option D: ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2 )

So the correct answer is option D.


The problem involves two stars, star_1 and star_2, where the excitation of iron atoms in star_1 is twice as high in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), and the photospheres are in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The goal is to determine the correct equation relating the effective temperatures \( T_1 \) and \( T_2 \) of the stars.

In LTE, the Boltzmann equation governs the population ratio of two energy levels:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( n_i \) and \( n_j \) are the populations of the energy levels, \( g_i \) and \( g_j \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. For star_1 and star_2, the ratio of excited to ground state populations is given as:

\[
\frac{n_{1e}}{n_{1g}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2e}}{n_{2g}}.
\]

Using the Boltzmann equation for both stars, the ratio of the population ratios becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{1e}}{n_{1g}}}{\frac{n_{2e}}{n_{2g}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Substituting \( \frac{n_{1e}}{n_{1g}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{2e}}{n_{2g}} \), we get:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \) as \( \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \), the equation becomes:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Given \( \Delta E = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \) and \( k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \), the term \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \) simplifies to 1. Thus, the equation reduces to:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches option D: \( \ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2} \).

**Answer: D**
