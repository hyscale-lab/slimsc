Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. That's due to the symmetry in the equations, I think. 

The question is about which of Maxwell's equations would be different in this alternate scenario. The options are A, B, C, D, each pointing to different parts of the equations. Let me think about the original Maxwell's equations.

Maxwell's equations are four in total. The first one is Gauss's Law for electricity: divergence of E is rho over epsilon. The second is Gauss's Law for magnetism: divergence of B is zero. The third is Faraday's Law of induction, which involves the curl of E and the time derivative of B. The fourth is Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition, which deals with the curl of H and the current plus the displacement current.

In our universe, the second equation (divergence of B is zero) ensures that there are no isolated magnetic poles because it implies that the magnetic field lines are always continuous, starting at a north pole and ending at a south pole. So if in this parallel universe, you can have isolated poles, that equation must change.

So in that universe, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. That's the second equation. But wait, what about the other equations? The first equation is about electric fields and charge, which probably remains the same. The third equation deals with the changing magnetic fields and induced electric fields—that might still hold unless magnetic monopoles affect it. Hmm, Faraday's Law doesn't directly involve magnetic monopoles, so maybe it stays the same. The fourth equation includes the displacement current, which I think would also remain, as it's about electric fields and currents.

Wait, but I remember something about magnetic monopoles and how they would modify Maxwell's equations. Oh right! If magnetic monopoles exist, then not only the second equation changes, but perhaps the third equation as well. Because Faraday's Law includes the term for the time derivative of B, and if B could have sources (like divergence not zero), then maybe the equation for the curl of E would change too.

Wait, no, let me think again. In our universe, the curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. If there were magnetic charges, then we would have a divergence of B equals the magnetic charge density. But how would that affect Faraday's Law? Or is it Ampère's Law that would change?

Oh wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure this.

Original Equations:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇·B = 0
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

If magnetic monopoles exist, equation 2 would become ∇·B = ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. That's one change.

What about equation 3? Faraday's Law. In our universe, it's about induced E fields due to changing B fields. If there are magnetic charges, would that affect this? I think equation 3 remains the same because it
