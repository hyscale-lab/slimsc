Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit new to this so I'll try to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning it's not superimposable on its mirror image, leading to enantiomers which are non-superimposable mirror images. These can rotate plane-polarized light, hence the term optical isomers.

The options given are four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

And the choices are between options A, B, C, D, each listing different combinations. So I need to analyze each compound one by one.

Starting with compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can have stereoisomerism if the substituents are arranged in a way that creates chirality. So the biphenyl part here is connected at the 1,1' positions. The substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6'. Wait, but wait, do the substituents lead to a chiral center?

Hmm, in biphenyls, the arrangement around the central bond can sometimes allow for stereoisomerism if the substituents on each benzene ring are in positions that make the molecule non-symmetrical. But wait, in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me visualize: each benzene ring has two substituents? Or is it that each ring has two substituents, one from the ester groups and one from the nitro groups.

Wait, the compound is dimethyl, so the ester groups are at 2 and 2' (because it's 2,2'-dicarboxylate). Also, 6,6' are dinitro. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. Now, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, meaning the two benzene rings are connected by a single bond between the 1 and 1' positions.

So each ring has substituents at positions 2 and 6. Now, for a biphenyl system, the possibility of diastereomerism (like cis and trans) arises when the substituents on the two rings are arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry or not. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Since the rings are connected at 1, substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring could lead to different arrangements.

Wait, but in a biphenyl, the substituents can cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry. Let me think about the structure. If the substituents on each ring are in positions that are mirror images, the molecule might be symmetrical. But with nitro and ester on each ring, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement in the biphenyl allows for the possibility of enantiomers.

Alternatively, maybe this compound doesn't have a chiral center because the substituents are in positions that make the molecule symmetrical. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on the biphenyl are such that the molecule can't be superimposed on its mirror image.

Wait, another approach: if the biphenyl has substituents that make the molecule asymmetric, then it would have stereoisomerism, but if it's symmetric, then no. So the substituents are at 2,2' and 6,6' positions. Let me imagine the structure. Each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester group at 2. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

So the positions 2 and 6 on each ring are such that for each ring, the substituents are across from each other (since benzene is a six-membered ring). Wait, position 2 is adjacent to 1, and 6 is opposite to 1 in each ring. So each ring has two substituents: one at 2 (ester) and one at 6 (nitro). Thus, each ring has substituents in positions that are 180 degrees apart.

In that case, the molecule as a whole might have a plane of symmetry. Because if you mirror the molecule, the substituents on each ring would swap places, but since they're the same (both have nitro and ester), it would look the same. So maybe the molecule is symmetrical and doesn't have a chiral center. Hmm, but wait, biphenyl derivatives can sometimes have axial chirality, which is a form of stereoisomerism without chiral centers. Axial chirality occurs when there's a lack of a plane of symmetry around the central axis, allowing the two halves to be non-superimposable.

In biphenyls, the arrangement of substituents around the single bond can lead to axial chirality. For example, in 1,1'-binaphthyl compounds, substituents on the two rings can lead to enantiomers if the arrangement is not symmetrical. So in this case, with substituents at 2 and 6, perhaps the molecule has axial chirality.

Wait, but the substituents are the same on each ring (nitro and ester). So if each ring has a nitro and an ester, and the arrangement is such that one ring has the nitro in a position that's mirrored on the other, but perhaps the overall molecule lacks a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe in this case, the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is actually meso, making it achiral. Wait, no. Wait, meso compounds have multiple stereocenters but an overall plane of symmetry, making them achiral. But in biphenyl axial chirality, it's about the arrangement around the central bond, regardless of whether the substituents are the same.

So for compound 1, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that prevent a plane of symmetry, then it would exhibit optical isomerism. But if the substituents are such that the molecule is symmetrical, then no.

Wait, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Let me imagine each ring: with the connection at 1, substituents at 2 (ester) and 6 (nitro). So, for each ring, the substituents are opposite each other. So looking at the biphenyl, perhaps the arrangement is such that each ring has substituents in a certain orientation. If the two rings have their substituents arranged so that the esters are on the same side, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule can't be mirrored, then it would have axial chirality. For example, if the ester groups are both on the same face of the biphenyl, that could lead to a chiral structure. Alternatively, if they are on opposite faces, it might be symmetrical.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged symmetrically because 6 is across from 1, and 2 is adjacent. So, when connected at 1, the substituents at 2 and 6 would be in positions that create a symmetric structure. So perhaps compound 1 doesn't have any optical isomerism.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's move on and come back if I have more time.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is an ester where the acid part is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the propanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is also known as (R)- or (S)-lactic acid's ester. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait no, wait, the structure would be CH3CH(OH)COOH. Wait, no, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH? No, propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid as HOCH2CH2COOH. But I might be getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's CH3-C(OH)H-COOH, which would be 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. But that's (R)- or (S)-lactate.

Wait, the formula is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. So structure is OMe-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3. Wait, no. Wait, the propanoate is CH2CH(OH)COO- with methyl ester. So the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CHOH. Wait, no, maybe the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH(OH)CH3. Wait, no, propanoate is CH3CH2COO- but 2-hydroxypropanoate would be (CH3)COO- with an OH on the middle carbon. Wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-? No, perhaps the correct structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon chain is: COOCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. Wait, no, because propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as in CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. Wait, but that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate, but perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

In any case, the key point is whether there's a chiral center. The carboxylic acid part is after the oxygen. So in the ester, the propanoate is methyl ester, so the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-CH(OH)-something. Wait, perhaps I should draw it out mentally.

The molecule is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-Me
       |
CH2-CH(OH)-CH3?

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

COOCH3 is the ester group. Attached to that is the CH(OH) group, which is attached to another CH3.

So the molecule would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, that's 2-hydroxypropanoate. So the central carbon (the one attached to the OH) has four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the other CH attached to it? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate or 2-hydroxy?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether the molecule has a chiral center. For a chiral center, the carbon must have four different substituents.

In the case of 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Wait, propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH(OH)CH2COOH. So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(OH)-.

Wait, so the ester would be CH(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let's count the carbons. Propanoate is three carbons: COOCH3 is the first carbon, then the next two.

So, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
       |
CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of the structure as:

The propanoate is CH2-CH2-COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HO-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the ester would be CH2-CH2-COO-OCH3 but with an OH on the second carbon.

Wait, that can't be right because that would make the structure CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the carbon chain is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

But that would make the OH on the first carbon, not the second. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the IUPAC numbering. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so the COOH is on carbon 3. Then 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have an OH on carbon 2. So the structure would be HO-CH2-COOH, but that's not possible because that would be two carbons, not three.

Ah, wait, no. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-CHOH-COOH. So the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOH. Thus, the methyl ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one attached to OH) has:

- CH3 (methyl group)
- OH
- COOCH3 (ester group)
- and another CH attached to it? Wait, no, because the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the central carbon (the CH(OH)) is connected to:

- CH3 (on one side)
- OH (on the adjacent)
- COOCH3 (on the other adjacent)
- And the other adjacent is the CH group, but wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, which would mean the central carbon has:

Groups:
1. CH3
2. OH
3. COOCH3
4. And a single bond to the adjacent carbon, which is the next CH.

Wait, no, in this case, the central carbon is the CH(OH) connected to CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other. So the four substituents are: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and the other CH (from CH3-CH(OH)-...). Wait, no, because the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the CH(OH) is between the CH3 and the COOCH3. So the substituents would be:

- CH3 (left)
- OH (on the same carbon)
- COOCH3 (right)
- And the central carbon is CH, so it's connected to two CH groups? No, wait, the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The central carbon is CH, with CH3 on one side and COOCH3 on the other, plus the OH and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The structure is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon of the propanoate. So the structure would be CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So the carbon chain is:

COOCH3 is the first carbon, then the second carbon (with OH), then the third (CH3). So the second carbon is CH(OH), connected to COOCH3, CH3, and two other groups. Wait, but that can't be right because the second carbon would have:

- COOCH3 (from the first carbon)
- CH3 (from the third)
- OH (on the second)
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because a carbon can only have four bonds. So the second carbon is connected to:

- The COOCH3 group (from the first carbon)
- The CH3 group (from the third carbon)
- An OH group
- And a hydrogen.

So the four substituents are: COOCH3, CH3, OH, and H. So that makes the second carbon a chiral center. Because all four substituents are different (COOCH3, CH3, OH, H). Therefore, this compound has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism. So compound 2 will have optical isomerism.

Moving on to compound 3: benzophenone. Benzophenone is (phenyl)(phenyl)ketone, so its structure is Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is part of the ketone group. So the structure is (Ph)₂CO. Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers?

Looking at the structure, the ketone group is C=O, so the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two phenyl groups. The structure would be:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

The central carbon is bonded to two phenyl groups, one oxygen (double bond), and another group. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of benzophenone is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

Each phenyl is connected to the same carbon, which is double-bonded to oxygen. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups, one oxygen (double bond), and has a lone pair. Wait, but in a carbonyl group (C=O), the carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and connected to two R groups, which in this case are phenyl.

So the structure is:

Ph–C(=O)–Ph.

But the central carbon is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded to oxygen, so it's trigonal planar, not tetrahedral. Chiral centers require four different substituents on a tetrahedral carbon. Here, the carbon is part of a double bond, so it's not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So compound 3 does not show optical isomerism.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid, but in the case of dimethyl fumarate, it's the diester where each end is a methyl ester. The structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, no, more accurately, it's:

O
||
O-CO-OCH3
       |
CH₂-CH₂

Wait, no, fumarate is the trans-diestereomer. Wait, no, wait: maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer. So dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer.

The structure of fumarate is:

Phthalic anhydride is a cyclic structure, but fumarate is a dicarboxylic acid with a double bond. The structure is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but in the trans configuration (the double bond is between the two CH₂ groups, and the two COOH groups are on opposite sides). So the dimethyl ester would have two methyl ester groups on the ends of the double bond.

So the structure is:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, wait, fumarate is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

COOCH3-CH₂-CH₂-COOCH3, but with a double bond in the middle, but that's not right. Let me correct that.

Wait, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups. Wait, no, fumaric acid is HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the central two carbons, making it HO₂C-CH₂-CH₂-COOH? No, that can't be right. Let me get this straight.

Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer: HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with the two acidic groups on the same side of the double bond. No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, so it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the CH₂'s. So more accurately, it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, but the double bond is between the two CH groups. So the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups, making it HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but in the cis configuration (the two COOH groups are on the same side). Fumaric acid is the trans isomer, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate would be the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid. So the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂, but in the trans configuration.

Wait, no, the structure should be O=C(OCH3)-CH₂-CH₂-CO(OCH3)=O? No, that's not correct. The correct structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂. Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)-CH₂-COOCH3 but in the E configuration.

Wait, perhaps a better way to write it is (E)-1,2-dimethyl fumarate: the structure is CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂ in the E configuration. So the two ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any stereoisomerism?

In the case of dimethyl fumarate, the molecule has a double bond with two ester groups on either end. The double bond can be in the cis (Z) or trans (E) configuration. However, the question is about optical isomerism, which is due to chiral centers, not geometric isomerism.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, does it have any chiral centers?

In dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. If the structure is E (trans), then the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, the molecule has a central double bond with two identical substituents on each end. Wait, each end is a COOCH3 group, so the substituents are the same on both sides.

If the substituents are the same on both ends, then the molecule may not have any chiral centers, but perhaps it can have geometric isomerism. However, geometric isomerism (cis vs trans) is not the same as optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Is there any possibility of chirality in dimethyl fumarate? Do any of the carbons have four different substituents?

Looking at the structure, perhaps the two carbons adjacent to the double bond each have two COOCH3 groups and two CH₂ groups. Let me think.

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons adjacent to the double bond (the ones attached to the COOCH3 groups) is connected to two CH₂ groups and two COOCH3 groups. Wait, no, each of those carbons is connected to the double bond and two other groups.

Wait, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂.

Wait, no, that would be 1,2-dimethyl fumarate, but perhaps more accurately, it's (E)-1,2-dimethyl fumarate as CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂ but in the E configuration. Wait, perhaps I should draw it as:

   O
   ||
O-C-OCH3
      \
CH₂-CH₂
      /
   O
   ||
   O-C-OCH3

But that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOCH3
     \
C=CH
     /
COOCH3

But in the trans configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about whether any of the carbons in dimethyl fumarate have four different substituents.

The two carbons attached to the COOCH3 groups each have two COOCH3 groups, a double bond to the adjacent carbon, and two CH₂ groups (or perhaps just CH₂ groups). Wait, no, in the actual structure, each of those carbons is connected to the double bond and two COOCH3 groups, but that can't be because each carbon can have only four bonds.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and a single bond to another carbon. Wait, no, that's not possible because the double bond takes two bonds.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: in the case of dimethyl fumarate, are there any chiral centers?

Looking at the structure, each of the two carbons adjacent to the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH₂ groups. Wait, but that can't be. Let me imagine the structure:

The molecule is (E)-butenedioate dimethyl ester, so the structure is CH₂=CH(COOCH3)₂ in E configuration.

Each of the two middle carbons (the ones attached to the COOCH3 groups) is connected to:

- One CH₂ group (from the double bond)
- Two COOCH3 groups
- And another CH group (from the double bond)

Wait, no, perhaps each of those carbons is connected to:

- One CH₂ group (from the double bond)
- One COOCH3 group
- Another CH₂ group (from the other end of the double bond)
- And another COOCH3 group.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, each of those carbons is connected to:

- The double bond (so two bonds: one to the adjacent carbon)
- Two COOCH3 groups
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps those carbons are each connected to:

- The double bond (so two bonds)
- Two COOCH3 groups
- And a single hydrogen.

Wait, that would make each of those carbons have four substituents: two COOCH3, a double bond (so two substituents), and a hydrogen. But wait, that's not possible because the double bond is a single substituent; each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two other carbons, not substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the double bond each have:

- One CH₂ group (from the double bond)
- One COOCH3 group
- And two more substituents.

Hmm, perhaps this is getting too detailed. Let me think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers.

If any of the carbons in the molecule has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. In dimethyl fumarate, looking at each of the carbons:

- The two carbons in the double bond (the central ones) each have two COOCH3 groups and two CH₂ groups attached. So each of those would have two identical substituents (two COOCH3 and two CH₂ groups), so they wouldn't be chiral centers.

Wait, but that's not correct. Let me think: each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is bonded to two other carbons (the adjacent ones) and two substituents (the COOCH3 groups). So the substituents on each central carbon are:

- Two COOCH3 groups
- Two CH₂ groups (from the double bond)

But if the substituents are mirrored, then perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no chiral centers.

Wait, but in the E configuration, the substituents are on opposite sides. So, for example, each of the two central carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH₂ group. But since the substituents are the same on each side, perhaps there are no chiral centers.

Therefore, compound 4, dimethyl fumarate, doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, wait. Dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. But in terms of chiral centers, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong, and dimethyl fumarate does have chiral centers. Let me think again. Each of the carbons attached to the COOCH3 groups in dimethyl fumarate is connected to:

- The double bond (so two substituents)
- Two COOCH3 groups (but wait, one on each side)
Wait, no, each of those carbons is connected to one COOCH3 group and another substituent.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that each of the carbons in the double bond (the two middle carbons) are connected to two CH2 groups and two COOCH3 groups, but that would mean each has two identical substituents, making them non-chiral.

Hmm, I'm not entirely confident about this, but perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers because the substituents are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, in the E configuration, the substituents on each end are mirror images, making the molecule achiral. So in that case, there would be no optical isomerism.

Wait, no. Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. But in the E configuration of dimethyl fumarate, the substituents are on opposite sides, and since both ends have the same substituents, the molecule would be symmetrical. So for example, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but since they are the same on each end, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. If the substituents are identical on both ends, then any asymmetry would be mirrored, making the molecule achiral. So dimethyl fumarate might not have any chiral centers, and thus no optical isomerism. So compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: Are there any chiral centers in dimethyl fumarate? Let me think about the structure again. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
        \
CH₂-CH₂
        /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But with the two COOCH3 groups on opposite sides (E). Each of the CH₂ groups (the middle two carbons) are connected to two COOCH3 groups, a double bond, and another CH₂ group. Wait, each of those middle carbons is connected to:

- One CH₂ group (from the double bond)
- Two COOCH3 groups (but wait, each is only attached to one COOCH3 group on each side)
Wait, perhaps each of the middle carbons is connected to:

- Two CH₂ groups (left and right)
- One COOCH3 group
- And another substituent.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it as:

Each of the two middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is bonded to a CH₂ group on one side and a COOCH3 group on the other. So the substituents on each would be:

- CH₂ group (from one side)
- COOCH3 group (from the other)
- And two more substituents, perhaps hydrogen or another group.

Wait, no, perhaps each of those middle carbons is bonded to two substituents from the double bond and two substituents from the ester groups. But I think I'm getting stuck here, and perhaps I should move on.

So, to recap, the four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate → Maybe has axial chirality (so optical isomerism), but I'm not entirely sure.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate → Has a chiral center, so optical isomerism.

3. benzophenone → No chiral centers, no optical isomerism.

4. dimethyl fumarate → No chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

But wait, I'm not sure about compound 1. Earlier, I thought maybe it doesn't have any, but perhaps it does.

Alternatively, perhaps compound 1 doesn't have any chiral centers because the substituents are arranged symmetrically on the biphenyl rings. So the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Or perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that creates axial chirality, making it chiral.

Wait, another thought: in biphenyls with substituents that are not symmetrical, axial chirality can occur. For example, if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the molecule asymmetrical around the central bond, then the molecule can have axial chirality, leading to enantiomers.

In compound 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. The 6 position is across from the 1 position where the rings are connected. So each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2.

So, for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent and opposite to the point of connection. So the arrangement could create a situation where the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality. So compound 1 would have optical isomerism.

So, putting it all together:

Compound 1: Yes (optical isomerism)
Compound 2: Yes
Compound 3: No
Compound 4: No

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 4 didn't have any. Let me check again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine compound 4: dimethyl fumarate. The structure is (E)-CH₂=C(COOCH3)₂, which is:

COOCH3
     \
C=C
     /
COOCH3

In the E configuration, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. Now, are there any chiral centers in this molecule?

Each of the two carbons in the double bond (the C's in C=C) is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two CH₂ groups. Wait, no, each of those carbons is connected to one COOCH3 and one CH₂ group. Wait, no, each is connected to a CH₂ group on one side and a COOCH3 on the other. So each of those carbons has:

- One CH₂ group (left or right)
- One COOCH3 group
- And two more substituents from the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is bonded to two substituents from the double bond and two others. Let me think: each C in the double bond is bonded to two substituents (one on each side). So for example, the left C is bonded to a CH₂ group (from the left) and a COOCH3 group (from the right), and the right C is bonded to a COOCH3 group (from the right) and a CH₂ group (from the left). So each of those carbons has two substituents that are different (CH2 and COOCH3), but wait, each carbon in the double bond is connected to two identical substituents on each side.

Wait, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond is connected to two CH₂ groups and two COOCH3 groups, but that would require four substituents, which isn't possible because the double bond takes two bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps each of those carbons is bonded to one CH₂ and one COOCH3 group, and the double bond, making their substituents: CH2, COOCH3, and two from the double bond. But that wouldn't give four different groups; each would have CH2, COOCH3, and two from the double bond, but I'm not sure if that makes them chiral.

Wait, perhaps the carbons in the double bond are each bonded to two identical groups. For example, each C in the double bond has a CH₂ group on one side and a COOCH3 on the other. So each has:

- CH₂ (left)
- COOCH3 (right)
- And the double bond.

But that would give each C two different substituents and two identical (from the double bond), but that doesn't necessarily make them chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. For dimethyl fumarate in the E configuration, the molecule is symmetrical along the plane that bisects the double bond. So the two COOCH3 groups are mirror images of each other across this plane. Therefore, the molecule is achiral, and thus, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, to sum up:

1: Yes
2: Yes
3: No
4: No

Looking at the options, the question is, which of the four compounds show optical isomerism.

So among the four, compounds 1 and 2 do, while 3 and 4 do not.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1, 2, and 4 → 4 doesn't, so A is incorrect.

Option B: 3 and 4 → Both are incorrect.

Option C: 2 and 3 → 3 doesn't, so C is incorrect.

Option D: 1 and 2 → Both are correct. So the correct answer is option A if 4 is also correct, but according to my analysis, 4 is incorrect. So option D (1 and 2) would have both correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought 4 didn't have any optical isomerism, so that would make option D the correct choice.

Wait, but let me check again: dimethyl fumarate, does it have any chiral centers?

Another approach: look for any carbon in the molecule that has four different substituents.

In dimethyl fumarate, each of the two carbons in the double bond (the central carbons) is connected to:

- One CH₂ group (from one side)
- One COOCH3 group (from the other side)
- And two substituents from the double bond (which are the same on each carbon), but wait, that's not correct. The substituents from the double bond are each bonded to two other carbons, so perhaps each carbon in the double bond is connected to:

- Two substituents (CH₂ and COOCH3) and two bonds to other carbons (the double bond).

So each central carbon has:

- CH₂ group (left)
- COOCH3 group (right)
- And two more substituents (the double bond, which is one substituent but consists of two bonds).

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons has:

- Two CH₂ groups (left and right)
- One COOCH3 group
- And a double bond.

No, that's not correct because each carbon can't have two CH₂ groups.

Alternatively, perhaps each of those carbons has a CH₂ group on one side and a COOCH3 on the other, and the two substituents from the double bond are both CH₂ groups. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps each of the carbons in the double bond has:

- One CH₂ group (from one side)
- One COOCH3 group (from the other)
- And two substituents that are part of the double bond (each a single bond to another carbon).

In that case, each carbon would have four substituents: CH₂, COOCH3, and two CH₂ groups from the double bond.

Wait, but that can't be, because the double bond would only connect to one substituent on each side.

I'm getting stuck again. Let me think differently. Perhaps in dimethyl fumarate, the two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to a CH₂ group and a COOCH3 group, and the other two bonds are part of the double bond. So each of those carbons has:

- CH₂ group (left or right)
- COOCH3 group (right or left)
- And two bonds forming the double bond.

But that would make each carbon have only two substituents (CH₂ and COOCH3) and two bonds to other carbons (the double bond). So each carbon doesn't have four substituents, meaning no chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options:

Only compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, option D is "1 and 2".

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 1 might have axial chirality. So is that correct?

Biphenyl compounds with substituents that prevent a plane of symmetry can have axial chirality. So in compound 1, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and an ester at 2. Now, the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1' positions.

So for each ring, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are adjacent and opposite to the connection point. Now, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it would exhibit axial chirality.

But in this case, each ring has the same substituents: a nitro group and an ester. So if they are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, but if the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not mirror images, the molecule could be chiral. Let me think: if on each ring, the ester is at position 2 and the nitro at 6, then each ring has substituents that are opposite each other. So when connected in a biphenyl, the arrangement could be such that the esters are on the same face, leading to a chiral molecule.

But without a clear plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral. Therefore, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

So, in the options, the correct compounds are 1 and 2, which is option D.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chiral centers or axial chirality, as these are necessary for optical isomerism.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound is a biphenyl derivative with substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The substituents include nitro groups and ester groups. Biphenyl systems can exhibit axial chirality if the substituents on the two rings lack a plane of symmetry. In this case, the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that prevents a plane of symmetry, leading to axial chirality. Therefore, this compound exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The carbon atom bonded to the hydroxyl group (OH), the methyl group (CH₃), the ester group (COOCH₃), and a hydrogen atom is a chiral center. Since this carbon has four different substituents, the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), which is double-bonded to oxygen and does not have four different substituents. Additionally, the molecule lacks any tetrahedral chiral centers or axial chirality. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the dimethyl ester of fumaric acid, with the structure CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂ in the trans (E) configuration. The two carbons in the double bond are each bonded to a CH₂ group and a COOCH₃ group. Since the substituents on both sides of the double bond are identical, the molecule has a plane of symmetry and is achiral. Thus, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Compounds 1 and 2 exhibit optical isomerism, while compounds 3 and 4 do not. The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
