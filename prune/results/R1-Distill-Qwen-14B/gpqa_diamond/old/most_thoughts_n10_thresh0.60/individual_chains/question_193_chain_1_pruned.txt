Okay, so I've got this astronomy question to tackle. Hmm, let me read it again. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Wait, parallax... I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. So when parallax is small, the distance is large, right?

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit distance. So, I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and distance r. Let's break it down.

First, I recall that parallax (usually denoted as 'plx') and distance are inversely proportional. The formula I remember is plx = 1 / distance (in parsecs), so distance r = 1 / plx. So plx is inversely proportional to r: plx = k/r, where k is some constant.

The number of stars, let's call it N, varies as 1/plx^5. So N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Substituting plx in terms of r, that becomes N ∝ 1/( (k/r) )^5. Let's compute that exponent. (k/r)^5 is k^5 / r^5. So taking reciprocal, 1/(k^5/r^5) is r^5 / k^5. So N is proportional to r^5 times a constant (since 1/k^5 is just another constant). So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)"? Oh wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N varies with plx as N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = 1/r. So plx = 1/r → so 1/plx is r. So substituting, N ∝ (1/plx)^5 → which is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, wait. No, wait, let me do it more carefully. Let's model it with equations.

Let me define:

N = (constant) * (1/plx^5)

But plx = 1 / r → so plx = r^{-1}.

So substituting,

N = C * (1
