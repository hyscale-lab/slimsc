Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, and G3. They created knockout mutants for each and also double mutants. Then, they tested how resistant these mutants are to anthracnose. The control is 100%, and the mutants have varying percentages.

The question is about figuring out the interactions between these genes. The results are:

- g1:75%
- g2:0%
- g3:50%
- g1g3:10%
- g2g3:0%
- g1g2:0%

And the options are A, B, C, D, each talking about which gene is a transcription factor, whether they show pleiotropy or redundancy, and epistatic relationships.

Hmm, so I remember that epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, then the phenotype of B depends on A. Also, a transcription factor usually acts upstream, regulating other genes. So the transcription factor would be the one that's upstream.

Looking at the data, the wild-type is 100%, which is the maximum resistance. Let's see the individual mutants:

g1 is 75% → it's less resistant than wild-type, but not completely susceptible. So maybe G1 contributes to resistance, but not the only factor.

g2 is 0% → this is the most susceptible. So the mutant g2 can't resist the pathogen at all. So G2 is probably a key gene, maybe a transcription factor that activates other genes necessary for resistance.

g3 is 50% → so it's halfway in resistance. So G3's product might contribute to resistance, but not as critical as G2.

Now, the double mutants:

g1g3 is 10% → which is worse (more susceptible) than either g1 or g3 alone. Wait, but why? If G1 and G3 are both contributing, then their combined knockout should be worse than either alone. So g1g3 at 10% is much worse than g1 (75%) and g3 (50%).

g2g3 is 0% → same as g2 alone. So when you knock out both G2 and G3, the resistance is the same as when only G2 is knocked out. That suggests that G3 doesn't add anything when G2 is already knocked out. So G2 is epistatic over G3 perhaps.

g1g2 is 0% → same as g2 alone. So when G1 and G2 are both knocked out, the resistance is 0, same as g2. That suggests that G2 is epistatic over G1. Because when you have g2, even if you also knock out G1, the resistance doesn't get any worse than 0. So G2's function is upstream of G1, perhaps.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. In the case where G2 is a transcription factor, maybe it activates G1. So without G2 (g2 mutant), G1 isn't expressed either. But in the g1 mutant, G2 is still present since it's only G1 that's knocked out. So in the g1 mutant, G2 is working, but G1 is not. But G3 is still active.

Wait, looking at the g1 mutant which has 75% resistance. So when G1 is gone, the resistance drops by 25%. But when G2 is gone, resistance is 0. So this suggests that G2 is more important than G1. Also, when both G1 and G2 are knocked out (g1g2), the resistance is 0, same as when only G2 is knocked out. That
