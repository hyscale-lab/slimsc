Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details. The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of two exoplanets, Planet_4 and Planet_2, which are part of a system of five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. All planets have the same albedo.

Wait, so the orbital periods are in this ratio. Let's list them out. Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is 2*P1, Planet_3 is 2.5*P1, Planet_4 is 3.5*P1, and Planet_5 is 5*P1. Right.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = T*( (L/(16πσD^2) )^(1/4) )

Wait, but another way to write it is using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The formula I think is more accurately:

Te = T_earth * ( (P / P_earth) )^(-1/4) * ( (1 - albedo)/2 )^(1/4) * ( (L / L_sun) )^(1/4)

Wait, but in this problem, all planets have the same albedo. So that term cancels out. And the star's luminosity is the same for all, I suppose, since it's the same star. So the formula simplifies to:

Te ∝ (P)^(-1/4)

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The orbital period P is related to the distance from the star. Using Kepler's third law, which says that P² is proportional to a³ (with a being the semi-major axis), assuming the same star.

So P² = (4π²/GM) * a^3 → a³ = (P² * GM)/(4π²). So a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the distance D is proportional to P^(2/3). So for each planet, D is proportional to P^(2/3).

Then, the equilibrium temperature formula is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because the flux from the star goes as 1/D², and Te is proportional to (flux)^(1/4). Wait,
