Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm. It's about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution containing two different phosphates. Alright, I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

The problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In that solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with two waters. The temperature is 25°C, which probably matters for some constants but maybe it's just standard conditions here.

The options given are four different concentrations, all in the order of 1e-7 M, so I'm guessing the solution involves some sort of equilibrium calculation with the acid dissociation constants provided. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given as 7.5e-3, 6.2e-8, and 1.8e-12 for Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 respectively. So that's the first, second, and third dissociations.

Wait, I should recall the dissociation steps. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. So, the first deprotonation is H3PO4 → H2PO4^- + H+. The second is H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- + H+, and the third is HPO4^2- → PO4^3- + H+. Each of these has their respective Ka values.

The problem involves both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what these salts dissociate into. 

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So, each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (and the water, but that doesn't contribute to ions). So each mole gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can form a buffer solution. But wait, which species are present here?

H2PO4^- is the conjugate base of H3PO4 (from the first dissociation), but it's also the acid that can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (the second dissociation). So H2PO4^- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become HPO4^2-) or as a base (gaining a proton to become H3PO4). But in this solution, we also have HPO4^2-, which can act as an acid (losing a proton to become PO4^3-) or a base (gaining a proton to become H2PO4^-).

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of PO4^3- ions. So I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution.

Hmm, since the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps they are going to react with each other or with water to form PO4^3-? Or maybe I can use the second dissociation to find the PO4^3- concentration.

Wait, another approach: the presence of both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- means we're in a buffer solution scenario. But perhaps the overall pH is determined by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation considering the second dissociation.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of the possible reactions. H2PO4^- can lose a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can lose
