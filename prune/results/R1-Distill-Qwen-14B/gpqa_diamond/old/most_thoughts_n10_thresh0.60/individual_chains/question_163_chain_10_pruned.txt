Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding out the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, the problem states: We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. The acid we're using is a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. The options are given with different pH and volume values.

First, I think I should find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(1 +16) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Now, calculating moles of Fe(OH)3: mass divided by molar mass. So 0.1 g divided by 106.85 g/mol. Let me compute that. 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles, or 9.36e-4 mol.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and a solid here. When it dissolves in a strong acid, it should react. The reaction should be Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Because it's a monobasic acid, each mole of H+ comes from one mole of the acid. So each Fe(OH)3 will need 3 moles of H+.

So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+. So the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume needed is moles divided by concentration. So 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³. That's close, but let me check if I did everything right.

Wait, did I compute the moles correctly? 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85. 106.85 goes into 0.1 about 0.000936 times. Yes, that seems right. So 3 times that gives 0.002808 mol H+.

Volume is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So the minimum volume needed is approximately 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. Close enough, probably due to rounding differences.

Now, what about the pH? After dissolving, we have Fe³+ ions in solution. Since the solution is acidic, we need to find the pH based on the concentration of Fe³+.

Wait, how much Fe³+ do we have? The moles of Fe³+ should be the same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mol. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.

So concentration of Fe³+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

But wait, Fe³
