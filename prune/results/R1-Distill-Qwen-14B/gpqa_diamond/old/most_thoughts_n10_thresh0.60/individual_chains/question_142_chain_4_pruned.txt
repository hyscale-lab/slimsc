Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and determining its geometrical position in qubit space.

Hmm, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I remember that a density matrix is a way to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's the difference between a pure and mixed state? Oh right, a pure state is a single ket vector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, while a mixed state is a statistical mixture of different pure states.

So looking at ρ, it's a sum of |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, each multiplied by 1/2. That makes sense because each term like |0⟩⟨0| is a projection operator for the state |0⟩, and similarly for |1⟩. Since they're added together with equal coefficients, it's like an equal probability mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. So ρ is a mixed state with 50% |0⟩ and 50% |1⟩.

Wait, but the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. I'm a bit fuzzy on how density matrices correspond to points in space. I think this relates to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh right, for a single qubit, the density matrix can be represented as a point on the Bloch sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside.

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is a vector (like (x,y,z)) that determines the position on the Bloch sphere. The vector r has a magnitude less than or equal to 1 for valid quantum states.

So let me expand the given ρ. Let's see, |0⟩ is the vector [1; 0], so |0⟩⟨0| would be a diagonal matrix with 1 and 0 on the diagonal. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is diagonal with 0 and 1. Adding them together gives a matrix [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (1/2)(I), right? Because I is the 2x2 identity matrix.

Wait, so ρ = (I)/2. Now, using the general form I + r·σ all over 2. Let's set ρ equal to that:

( I + r·σ ) / 2 = I/2.

Multiply both sides by 2: I + r·σ = I.

Subtract I from both sides: r·σ = 0.

Hmm, so r·σ equals zero. Let's think about what that implies. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this sum to be zero, each of the components multiplied by the corresponding matrix must sum to zero.

Calculating each term:

σ_x = [[0, 1], [1,
