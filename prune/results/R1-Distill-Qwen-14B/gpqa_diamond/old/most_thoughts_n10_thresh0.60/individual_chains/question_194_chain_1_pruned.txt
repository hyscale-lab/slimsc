Okay, so I'm trying to solve this statistical mechanics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So my goal is to find Z for this system.

Wait, the system has three spins, each with two possible states. So the total number of possible configurations is 2^3 = 8. Oh right, that makes sense. So I need to consider all 8 possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1.

The energy E depends on the product of each pair of spins. Let me write down all the possible states and calculate their energies.

Let me list all 8 states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

For each state, I need to compute E and then compute exp(-βE) for each, then sum them all.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about the possible distinct energies the system can have. Because some configurations will have the same energy. So I can group them by energy and count how many states are in each group.

Let me compute the term S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 for each state.

For state 1: all +1. Then S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) → E = -3J.

State 2: S3=-1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1 → E = -J*(-1) = J.

Wait wait, no, wait: E= -J*(sum). So sum is 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

State3: S2=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 + (-1) = -1. So E= J.

State4: S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is (-1) + (-1) +1= -1. E= J.

Wait, wait: Let me double-check.

Wait state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2=1*1=1.

S1S3=1*(-1)=-1.

S2S3=1*(-1)=-1.

Sum = 1-1-1 = -1. So E = -J*(-1) = J.

Same for state3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = 1*(-1) = -1.

S1S3 = 1*1 =1.

S2S3 = (-1)*1 = -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E= J.

Similarly, state4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = -1.

S1S3= -1.

S2S3 = (-1)*(-1)=1.

Sum: -1-1+1 = -1. E= J.

Wait, so states 2,3,4 all have E=J.

State5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)*1 = -1.

S2S3 = 1*1=1.

Sum: -1 -1 +1 = -1. E= J.

State6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)*1 = -1.

S1S3 = (-1)*(-1)=1.

S2S3 = 1*(-1) = -1.

Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -
