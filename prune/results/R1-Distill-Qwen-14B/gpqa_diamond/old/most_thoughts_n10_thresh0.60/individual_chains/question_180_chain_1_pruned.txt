Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum energy of a system of charges. Hmm, let's read the question again carefully.

The system has 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So the setup is that 12 charges are placed on a sphere of radius 2 meters around point P, which has the 13th charge. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Energy in an electrostatic system is usually the electric potential energy. I remember that electric potential energy for a system of point charges is the work required to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions one by one, considering the potential created by the others as we go.

Wait, but the problem says it's an isolated system. So no external fields influence it. So we can calculate the potential energy due to each pair of charges.

But wait, how do I compute the total potential energy for multiple charges? I think for each pair of charges, I calculate the potential energy and sum them all. But that can get complicated when there are many charges. 

Let me think: Each charge contributes to the potential at the location of every other charge. Since all the 12 charges are at the same distance from P, their positions are symmetric. So maybe I can find a way to compute this more efficiently.

The 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are at 2 meters away. Each of those 12 charges will contribute to the potential at the central charge. Also, the 12 charges on the sphere will have potential energy between themselves.

But wait, the central charge is fixed. So when computing the potential energy, do I consider the work done in bringing each of the 12 charges to their positions in the presence of the central charge?

Yes, because each of those 12 charges is being placed at 2 meters from P, which has a charge of 2e. So each charge will feel a potential due to the central charge, and their placement affects the total energy.

But wait, potential is a scalar quantity, so the potential at each of the 12 charges due to the central charge is the same. So the potential
