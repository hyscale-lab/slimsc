Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, and I want to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state can be written as a vector in a two-dimensional space since it's dealing with spin-up and spin-down states. So the state vector is a combination of |up> and |down>, which are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, S_z.

First, I think I need to normalize the state. Because the coefficients are given as (1+i) and (2-i), I should find the normalization factor. The normalization condition is that the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients equals 1.

So, the coefficient for |up> is (1+i). The absolute square is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. Because |a + ib|^2 is a² + b². So |1+i|² is 1² +1²=2.

The coefficient for |down> is (2 - i). The absolute square is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5.

So the squared magnitudes are 2 and 5. The sum is 2 +5=7. Therefore, the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7), because the state is given as proportional, meaning it's scaled by this factor.

So the state |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the next part is about measuring the eigenstates of an operator whose matrix elements are given. The matrix A has elements A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So let me write out what this matrix looks like.

In a two-dimensional space, the basis states are |up> and |down>. So the matrix will be:

A = [ [0, (hbar/2)], 
      [(hbar/2), 0] ]

Because A_12 and A_21 are hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero.

Wait, no. The indices are i and j. So for a 2x2 matrix, when i≠j, that's the elements (1,2) and (2,1). So yes, that's correct.

This matrix looks familiar. It's a 2x2 matrix with zeros on the diagonal and hbar/2 off-diagonal. I recall that such a matrix is proportional to the Pauli X matrix. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so A is (hbar/2) X.

So the operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x, where σ_x is the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the question is about finding the probability of measuring the eigenstates of A. So we're to find the probability that a measurement of A yields each of its eigenvalues.

Wait, but the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, because A is just a scalar multiple of σ_x. The eigenvalues of σ_x are ±1, so the eigenvalues of A would be (hbar/2)(±1) → ±hbar/2.

But wait, the operator A is given, so we might need to find its eigenstates and then compute the probabilities.

Alternatively, since A is a Hermitian operator (because it's proportional to σ_x, which is Hermitian), its eigenstates form an orthonormal basis. The probabilities will be the squared modulus of the components of |alpha> in each eigenstate.

So first, I need to find the eigenstates of A.

Let me compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A.

The matrix A is:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0    ]

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(A - λ I) = 0.

So the determinant is (0 - λ)(-λ) - (hbar/2)^2 = λ² - (hbar²/4) = 0.

So λ² = hbar²/4 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So eigenvalues are +hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

Now, for each eigenvalue, find the eigenvectors.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0

Matrix becomes:
[ -hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   -hbar/2 ]

Which can be written as:

Row 1: -hbar/2 (a) + hbar/2 (b) = 0 → -a + b = 0 → a = b.

So the eigenvector can be any scalar multiple of (1,1). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

Matrix:
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2   hbar/2 ]

Which simplifies to:

Row 1: (hbar/2)(a + b) =0 → a = -b.

So the eigenvector is (1, -1), normalized as (1/sqrt(2), -1/sqrt(2)).

So the eigenstates are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Let me confirm. Wait, the matrix A is [[0, h/2], [h/2, 0]].

Wait, the eigenvectors I found are for A. So the eigenstates are |+> = (1,1)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (1,-1)/sqrt(2), but expressed in the computational basis |up>, |down>.

So |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. The eigenvectors for λ= +h/2 are (1,1), so in the basis |up>, |down>, that's (1,1) which would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), right? Because the components are 1/sqrt(2) each.

Similarly, the other eigenvector is (1, -1), which would be (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates of A are these two states.

But our state |alpha> is in the computational basis (|up>, |down>), so to find the probability of measuring each eigenstate of A, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and then take the squares of the amplitudes.

So, let's write |alpha> as a linear combination of |+> and |->.

First, express |alpha> as:

|alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] |up> + [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ] |down>

We can write this as:

|alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i)/sqrt(7), b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

We can express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Let me write |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) = (1/sqrt(2)) (|up> + |down>).

Similarly, |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, let's express |alpha> as:

|alpha> = c |+> + d |->.

We can find c and d by taking inner products.

c = < + | alpha >.

Similarly, d = < - | alpha >.

Compute c:

c = < + | alpha > = [1/sqrt(2) ( <up| + <down| ) ] [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ]

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> + (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

But <up|up> =1, <up|down>=0, same for <down|up>=0 and <down|down>=1.

So this simplifies to:

c = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ) ]

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ]

Simplify inside:

(1+i) + (2-i) = 3 + 0i → 3.

So c = (3) / (sqrt(2) * sqrt(7)) ) = 3 / sqrt(14).

Similarly, compute d:

d = < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra is ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So,

d = [ ( <up| - <down| ) / sqrt(2) ] ( (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> )

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) <up|up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <up|down> - (1+i)/sqrt(7) <down|up> - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) <down|down> ]

Again, cross terms are zero.

So,

= (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) *1 - (2 -i)/sqrt(7) *1 ]

= (1/sqrt(2) * 1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ]

Simplify inside:

(1 +i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) )= (-1) + 2i.

So d = [ (-1 + 2i) ] / (sqrt(14) )

So, |alpha> = c |+> + d |->, where c = 3/sqrt(14), d = (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate are |c|² and |d|².

Compute |c|²:

|3/sqrt(14)|² = (9)/(14) ≈ 0.642857 ≈ 0.64.

Compute |d|²:

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 / (14)

The numerator is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4 =5.

So |d|² =5/14 ≈ 0.35714 ≈ 0.36.

Wait, but wait, the eigenstates of A are |+> and |->, and |alpha> is expressed in terms of them, so the probabilities are |c|^2 and |d|^2, which are 9/14 and 5/14, respectively.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, and 5/14 is approximately 0.3571. So round to two decimal places, that's 0.64 and 0.36.

Wait, but the options don't show these exact fractions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, ... So the first two numbers match.

But let me check the calculations again, because perhaps I made a mistake in calculating c and d.

Wait, when I calculated c:

c = [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / (sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) → 3/sqrt(14). So |c|² is 9/14, correct.

For d, the calculation was [ (-1 + 2i) ] / sqrt(14). The magnitude squared is 1 +4 =5. So |d|^2 is 5/14.

So that's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64 and 5/14 ≈ 0.36.

So the first two numbers in the options match option A and option D.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

Wait, but the third part is the average value of the operator. So we need to compute the expectation value of A.

The expectation value <A> is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (hbar/2) σ_x, the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of σ_x in |alpha>.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute it using the state's components.

The state |alpha> is a|up> + b|down>, where a=(1+i)/sqrt(7), b=(2 -i)/sqrt(7).

The operator A is represented by the matrix:

[[0, hbar/2],
 [hbar/2, 0]]

So, <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Compute this as:

= (a* <up| + b* <down|) A (a |up> + b |down> )

Expanding this, the terms will be:

a* a ( <up| A |up> ) + a* b ( <up| A |down> ) + b* a ( <down| A |up> ) + b* b ( <down| A |down> )

But looking at matrix A, the diagonal elements are zero. So <up| A |up> = 0, <down| A |down> =0.

The off-diagonal elements: <up| A |down> = hbar/2, <down| A |up> = hbar/2.

So,

= a* b (hbar/2) + b* a (hbar/2 )

= (hbar/2) [ a* b + b* a ]

Which is (hbar/2) [ 2 Re(a* b) ].

Because a* b + b* a = 2 Re( a* b )

So compute a* b.

a = (1 + i)/sqrt(7), so a* = (1 - i)/sqrt(7).

b = (2 - i)/sqrt(7).

So a* b = [ (1 - i)(2 - i) ] / (7).

Multiply numerator:

(1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) = 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1. So 2 -3i -1 → 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1 -3i)/7.

So Re(a* b) is 1/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * 2 * (1/7) ) = (hbar/2) * (2/7) ) = hbar/7.

So the expectation value is hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7.

That matches.

Wait but let me check the other options. Option D: 0.61, 0.29, which would imply 9/14 is about 0.64, so no. Option A's third part is hbar/7, which matches.

So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation of a* b.

a is (1+i)/sqrt(7), so a* is (1-i)/sqrt(7).

b is (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

So a* · b = (1 - i)(2 - i) / (7).

Multiply (1 -i)(2 -i):

=1*2 +1*(-i) + (-i)*2 + (-i)*(-i)

= 2 -i -2i + i².

i² is -1, so:

2 -3i -1 → (2-1) =1, so 1 -3i.

So a* b = (1-3i)/7.

So Re(a* b) is 1/7.

So 2 Re(a* b) is 2/7.

So (hbar/2) * 2/7 = hbar/7. Correct.

Thus, the third part is hbar/7, which matches option A.


The problem involves an electron in a quantum state |α⟩, expressed as proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2-i)|down⟩, where |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates of an operator A, whose matrix representation is given by A_ij = ℏ/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Additionally, the average value of A must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state |α⟩
The coefficients of |up⟩ and |down⟩ are (1+i) and (2-i), respectively. The normalization condition requires the sum of the squared magnitudes of the coefficients to equal 1. The magnitudes are:

- |1+i|² = 1² + 1² = 2,
- |2-i|² = 2² + (-1)² = 4 + 1 = 5.

The total is 2 + 5 = 7, so the normalization factor is 1/√7. Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|α⟩ = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} |up⟩ + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} |down⟩.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates and eigenvalues of A
The operator A has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a Hermitian matrix, and its eigenvalues are ±ℏ/2. The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ + |down⟩), \quad |−⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|up⟩ - |down⟩).
\]

### Step 3: Express |α⟩ in terms of |+⟩ and |−⟩
To find the probabilities of measuring the eigenstates |+⟩ and |−⟩, express |α⟩ as a linear combination of these states:

\[
|α⟩ = c|+⟩ + d|−⟩,
\]

where:

\[
c = \langle +|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} + \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}},
\]

\[
d = \langle −|α⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}} - \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \right) = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of c and d:

\[
|c|² = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|² = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad |d|² = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|² = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
\]

### Step 4: Average value of A
The expectation value of A is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \langle α|A|α⟩.
\]

Using the matrix representation of A and the components of |α⟩, this becomes:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( 2 \, \text{Re}(a^* b) \right),
\]

where \( a = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, b = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}} \). Compute \( a^* b \):

\[
a^* b = \frac{(1-i)(2-i)}{7} = \frac{1-3i}{7}.
\]

The real part is \( \text{Re}(a^* b) = \frac{1}{7} \). Thus:

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot 2 \cdot \frac{1}{7} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36, and the average value of A is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These match the values in **Option A**.
