Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about angular momentum operators, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator A_y, which is given as A_y = c·S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). 

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the components of angular momentum are represented by matrices. For spin-1/2 particles, like electrons or muons, the Pauli matrices are used. Oh right, S here must be proportional to one of the Pauli matrices. Let me think—Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Which one does S correspond to?

Looking at S:
First row: 0, -i
Second row: i, 0
Wait, the Pauli matrix σ_y is actually [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S is σ_y, right? Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and σ_z is diagonal.

So A_y is c multiplied by σ_y. Since c is h/(4π), let's write that out. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. The eigenvalues equation is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found using the characteristic equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

But wait, what's the matrix for A_y? Let's compute it. Since σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], multiplying by c = h/(4π), each element becomes (h/(4π)) times the corresponding element of σ_y. So:

A_y = [[0, -(i h)/(4π)], [(i h)/(4π), 0]].

So the matrix is:

[0, -i h/(4π)]
[i h/(4π), 0]

Now, the characteristic equation is:

|A_y - a I| = 0
Which is determinant of:
[-a, -i h/(4π)]
[i h/(4π), -a]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [(-i h/(4π))(i h/(4π)) ] = a² - [ (-i)(i) (h/(4π))^2 ]

Simplify the second term: (-i)(i) = (-i²) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant becomes a² - (1)*(h²/(16 π²)) ) = 0.

So equation: a² - (h²)/(16 π²) = 0 → a² = (h²)/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and a = -h/(4π). Both are real numbers, so their imaginary parts are zero.

Wait, this contradicts the options given. Let's look at the options again.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). But according to my calculation, the eigenvalues are purely real. So the imaginary parts are zero, which isn't what any of the options suggest. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I got the matrix S wrong. Or perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the matrix S is given as:

Row 1: 0 -i

Row 2: i 0

Which is exactly σ_y. So A_y = (h/(4π)) * σ_y.

Hmm. Another approach: Perhaps the eigenvalues aren't real? Because when I calculated the determinant, I ended up with
