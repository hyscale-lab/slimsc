Okay, so I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but I'll try to think through this.

First, the metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that metrics can describe different kinds of geometries, like flat spacetime or curved. This one has a denominator with 4 - x² - y². That suggests maybe some kind of spherical symmetry because the denominator looks similar to the equation for a sphere, like x² + y² + z² = r², but here it's in two dimensions maybe?

Wait, the metric is in 2D, right? Because it's written in terms of dx² and dy². So it's a two-dimensional manifold. The coefficient is 32 over (4 - x² - y²). So the line element depends on position in x and y. Hmm.

Wait, but we're talking about a pseudosphere. Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, like a saddle shape. Its metric usually looks different, maybe more like something with a hyperbolic function in it. But this metric might be representing a pseudosphere in some coordinate system.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the area element. The area in such a metric would be the integral of the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor, but since it's diagonal here, it's simpler. The area element dA is sqrt(g_xy) dx
