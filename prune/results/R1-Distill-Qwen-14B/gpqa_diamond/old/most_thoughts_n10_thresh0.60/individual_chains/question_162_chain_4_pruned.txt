Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric provided is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a two-dimensional metric, right? Because dx² and dy² are involved. So the space here is two-dimensional, meaning it's a surface. But the question is referring to a pseudosphere, which I remember is a surface of constant negative curvature. Oh wait, pseudosphere is a specific example, like the tractricoid, which is the surface of revolution of a tractrix.

But wait, the question is about the area of this pseudosphere when the radius r is 2. So I need to find the area of this surface. But how?

I think the area in a given metric can be found by integrating the area element over the surface. The area element in 2D, when given a metric ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j, is sqrt(g) dx dy, where g is the determinant of the metric tensor.

Wait, in this case, the metric is written as ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). So the metric tensor components are g_{xx} = 32/(4 - x² - y²), g_{yy} the same, and the off-diagonal terms are zero. So the determinant of the metric tensor g would be (32/(4 - r^2))^
