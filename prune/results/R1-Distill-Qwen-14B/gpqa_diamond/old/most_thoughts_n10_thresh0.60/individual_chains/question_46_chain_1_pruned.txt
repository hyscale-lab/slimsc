Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it again. So, the question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. I need to find out how many possible products there are, excluding ethene.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used for olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis is when the positions of the substituents on a double bond are swapped. So, the catalyst helps break and reform the double bonds in a way that rearranges the substituents.

The starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. But since the molecule is unsymmetrical, the two enantiomers would have the same structure but opposite configurations. But wait, wait—3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene has the double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl branch on the third carbon from the double bond. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)₂? No, wait, wait. Let me think again. Pent-1-ene is five carbons with the double bond starting at C1. So positions are 1 2 3 4 5.

Wait, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-C(CH3)-CH₂CH3? No, wait, that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, that would make it four carbons after the double bond. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me count: 1 (CH2=CH), 2 (CH), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH3)? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively,
