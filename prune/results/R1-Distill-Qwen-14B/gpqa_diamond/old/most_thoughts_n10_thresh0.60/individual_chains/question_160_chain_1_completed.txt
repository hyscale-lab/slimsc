Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about diffraction, which I remember is when light bends around obstacles or through apertures. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact details, so I need to think carefully.

The question says that there's an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light (so single wavelength λ) is shining along the z-axis, falling vertically on this aperture. In the far field, which I think is the region where the light has spread out a lot, there are intensity maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, right, when N is really large, the polygon becomes a circle because a polygon with many sides approximates a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

Wait, but wait. The options given include 1.220 λ/a, which I remember is the first minimum for a single slit. So maybe this is a single-slit diffraction scenario. But wait, the aperture here is a polygon. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says that all apothems are the same. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the same for all sides. So if N is very large, the shape becomes a circle with radius equal to the apothem? Or wait, no. Wait, the apothem of a regular polygon is related to the radius (distance from center to a vertex). For a regular polygon, the apothem is given by a = R * cos(π/N), where R is the radius. So when N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So the radius of the polygon would approach the apothem. So the polygon becomes a circle with radius a.

Wait, but no, that can't be right. Because for a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. The radius of the circumscribed circle (the one touching the vertices) is R = a / cos(π/N). So when N is large, cos(π/N) is approximately 1 - (π²)/(2N²), so R ≈ a (1 + (π²)/(2N²)) ) approximates a when N is very large. So the apothem a is the radius of the inscribed circle, which is the same as the radius of the polygon when N is large.

So the polygon becomes a circle of radius a. So the diffraction pattern would be the same as a single-slit circular aperture.

In single-slit diffraction, the minima (dark fringes) occur at angles θ where a sinθ = m λ, where m is ±1, ±2, etc. The first minima (m=1) would be at θ = λ/(a), since a sinθ = λ ⇒ sinθ ≈ θ ≈ λ/a for small angles.

But wait, the options don't have λ/a as an option. Looking at the options:

A) 0.610 λ/a

B) 0.500 λ/a

C) 1.220 λ/a 

D) 0.506 λ/a

Oh, wait! I think I remember that for a single slit, the first minimum is at θ where sinθ = λ/a. So the angle is about λ/a. But wait, the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Or maybe the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but wait, the first two minima would be m=1 and m=2. The angular separation would be the difference in θ between m=2 and m=1.

Wait, but wait, the first minimum is at m=1, the next at m=2. So the angular separation is θ2 - θ1.

But when N is large, the aperture is a circle, so it's a single-slit circular aperture. So the diffraction pattern would have the same minima as a single slit, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the single-slit formula for minima is a sinθ = m λ, where a is the slit width. For a circular aperture, the minima occur when the path difference is m λ, but the formula is a bit different. Wait, no, wait. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is different. The minima occur at angles where a sinθ = m λ, but this applies to the first, second, etc., minima. But wait, for a circle, the intensity distribution is given by the Bessel functions, and the minima (like the dark rings) occur at certain θ values, but I think the first minimum is actually at θ where a sinθ = 1.220 λ, which is option C. Wait, but that would be the first minimum for a single-slit circular aperture.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. For a single-slit (rectangular), the first minimum is at a sinθ = λ. But for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a sinθ ≈ 1.220 λ. So if the problem is considering a circular aperture, then the first minimum would be at 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. But wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity, which would be the same as a circular aperture. Wait, but in that case, the first minimum is at θ1 = 1.220 λ/a, and the second would be at θ2 = 2.440 λ/a, so the separation is θ2 - θ1 = 1.220 λ/a. But that would make the angular distance between the first two minima as 1.220 λ/a, which is option C. But looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a. But wait, wait a second, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says "the first two minima" — but perhaps it's the first minima, and what's the separation between the first two adjacent minima. For a single slit, the minima are at m=1,2,... So the first is m=1, the next is m=2. So the angular separation is (λ/a) * ( (2) - (1) ) = λ/a. But that's only for a rectangular slit. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ = 1.220 λ. So the first minimum is at θ1 = (1.220 λ)/a, and the next minimum would be at θ2 = (2.440 λ)/a. So the separation is θ2 - θ1 = 1.220 λ/a, which is option C.

But wait, the options don't have that. Wait, the options are:

A) 0.610 λ/a 

B) 0.500 λ/a 

C) 1.220 λ/a 

D) 0.506 λ/a 

So option C is 1.220λ/a, which would be the separation between the first two minima. But wait, what if the question is about the distance between the first and second minima, but for a circle, the first minima is at 1.220λ/a, and the next minima is at 2.440λ/a, so the separation is 1.220λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two is 1.220λ/a. So that would be option C.

But wait, the options have option C as 1.220 λ/a. So that would be the answer. But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Wait, in the question, the apertures are N-sided polygons, but when N is very large, it becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is that of a circular aperture. The minima for a circular aperture occur at θ where a sinθ = m λ, where m is 1,2,3 etc., but for the minima, m is the order. So the first minimum is at m=1, which for a circular aperture, the minima are given by a sinθ = m λ, but the first minimum is at m=1.220 λ? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused between single-slit and circular apertures.

Wait, no. For a single-slit (rectangular), the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, m=±1, ±2,... So the first minimum is at θ = λ/(a), assuming small angles. The second at 2λ/a, etc.

But for a circular aperture, the minima are at a sinθ = (m) λ, where m is the order, but the first minima occurs at m=1, but the angle is larger than for the single-slit. So for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ where a sinθ ≈ 1.220 λ, so θ ≈ 1.220 λ/a. So the angular separation between the first two minima would be (2.440 λ/a - 1.220 λ/a) = 1.220 λ/a. So that's option C.

But wait, why is the first minimum for a circular aperture at 1.220 λ/a and not λ/a? Because the single-slit formula is different. So for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at a sinθ = 1.220 λ. So the angular separation between the first two minima would indeed be 1.220 λ/a, leading to option C.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says that when N is infinitely large, the aperture is a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the same as a single-slit with width a. But wait, no, a single-slit is a rectangular aperture, not a circle. Oh wait, wait. The shape in this problem is a polygon which becomes a circle when N is large. So the diffraction pattern would be that of a circular aperture. So the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, but for circular apertures, the first minima is at m=1, but the angle is 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture. The intensity minima occur at a sinθ = 1.220 λ, 2.440 λ, etc. So the first minimum is at θ=1.220 λ/a, the second at θ=2.440 λ/a. The angular separation between these two is 1.220 λ/a, which is option C.

But looking back at the problem statement: it's asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. So that would be the difference between the first and second minima's angles. So, yes, it's 1.220 λ/a, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm seeing another possibility. Maybe the question is considering the polygon as a slit rather than a circle. Because if the polygon is a regular N-gon, when N is large, it's like a circle, but perhaps the width of the slit is 2a, since the apothem is a, and the width would be twice that. Wait, wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the side. So for a polygon with N sides, the width (for a regular polygon) is 2a. So when N is large, the width approaches 2a. So if the polygon becomes a circle, the radius would be a, so the diameter is 2a. But wait, for a circular aperture, the width is 2a, so the radius is a. But perhaps in that case, the diffraction pattern would actually have minima at a sinθ = m λ. But wait, no, because the radius is a, so the diameter is 2a. So wait, perhaps the width is 2a, so the slit would be a rectangle of width 2a, and height tending to 0, making it a single slit of width 2a. But that's a different scenario.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between the apothem and the radius. Let me clarify:

In a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side (the radius of the inscribed circle). The radius (distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(π/N). For large N, cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²), so R ≈ a (1 + (π²)/(2N²)), which approaches a as N approaches infinity.

So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem is a, and the radius approaches a as N becomes very large. So the polygon becomes a circle of radius a.

In that case, the circular aperture's diffraction pattern applies. For a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at a sinθ = 1.220 λ. So the angle is θ = (1.220 λ)/a.

The second minimum is then at θ = (2.440 λ)/a.

The angular separation between the first and second minima is (2.440 - 1.220) λ/a = 1.220 λ/a.

So the answer would be option C: 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the first minimum for a circular aperture is at m=1, which is 1.220 λ/a. So the angular separation between m=1 and m=2 is 1.220 λ/a, so the answer is C.

But wait, looking at the options, option C is 1.220 λ/a. So that's the correct answer.


The problem involves a diffraction pattern created by a monochromatic light of wavelength $\lambda$ falling vertically on an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. When $N$ is infinitely large, the aperture approximates a circle with radius $a$, where $a$ is the length of the apothem. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in the far field.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at angles $\theta$ where $a \sin\theta = m\lambda$, with $m = 1, 2, 3, \dots$. The first minimum corresponds to $m = 1$, and the second minimum corresponds to $m = 2$. The angular separation between these two minima is the difference in their angles:

\[
\theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{2\lambda}{a} - \frac{\lambda}{a} = \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

However, for a circular aperture, the first minimum does not occur at $\theta = \frac{\lambda}{a}$ as it does for a rectangular single slit. Instead, the first minimum for a circular aperture is shifted to a larger angle due to the nature of Bessel function zeros. The first minimum occurs at $a \sin\theta = 1.220\lambda$, corresponding to $\theta_1 = \frac{1.220\lambda}{a}$. The second minimum occurs at $a \sin\theta = 2.440\lambda$, corresponding to $\theta_2 = \frac{2.440\lambda}{a}$. The angular separation between the first and second minima is:

\[
\theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{2.440\lambda}{a} - \frac{1.220\lambda}{a} = \frac{1.220\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture is $\frac{1.220\lambda}{a}$, which matches option C.

Answer: C
