Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit unsure how to approach it. Let me read through it again carefully. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency for a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and the reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. The options given are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also called the degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But wait, wait, I think I got that a bit wrong. Oh right, the correct formula is DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But in this case, the product doesn't mention any nitrogens, so I can probably ignore N. Wait, the starting material doesn't have any N either, so no problem there.

So, the first step is to figure out what the product looks like after the reaction. The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is often used for deoxygenative decarboxylation, especially in the presence of something like HI. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus and HI can also be used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, in this case, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus with HI is usually used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for eliminating carbonyl groups, like converting ketones to alkanes. But wait, the starting material has a formyl group (CHO) and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). Let me think about the structure.

The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring (because of the 'en' in the name) with substituents at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 but wait, vinyl is CH2=
