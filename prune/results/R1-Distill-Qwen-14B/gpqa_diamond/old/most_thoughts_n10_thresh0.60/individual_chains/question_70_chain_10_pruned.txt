Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take a deep breath and start analyzing.

The question is about a series of chemical reactions, and ultimately, I need to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are various symmetry groups, so I think I need to identify the structure of E first.

Let's go through the reactions one by one.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, the number of equivalents might give a clue about the stoichiometry. 8 equivalents suggests an 8:1 ratio, so maybe A is being oxidized or something. Bright red product... Wait, I remember that when metals react with certain gases, they form colored compounds. For example, sulfur trioxide reacts with something? Or maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with chlorine or another halogen. Oh wait, another thought: the reaction of sodium (Na) with chlorine (Cl2) in a 1:1 ratio forms NaCl, but that's white. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe A is a transition metal. Let's think of another reaction. Oh, maybe A is copper reacting with sulfur vapor. Wait, copper and sulfur in a 1:1 ratio (but that gives CuS which is maybe black). Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction that forms something like FeS? No, that's not red. Wait, maybe the product C is sulfur. Because when metals like iron react with sulfur, they form sulfides. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: when a solid metal reacts with a diatomic gas (like Cl2 or O2) to form a product. For example, aluminum reacts with oxygen to form Al2O3, but that's white. Alternatively, perhaps A is sodium and B is chlorine? Then, sodium (solid) reacts with Cl2 gas to form NaCl. But that's a white solid, not red. Hmm. Or maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with another gas, like sulfur vapor. For example, iron reacting with sulfur forms FeS, which is black, but maybe in a different stoichiometry. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where A is an element that forms a bright red product. Oh, I remember that when copper reacts with sulfur vapor, it forms CuS, but that's black. Wait, perhaps the product is something else.

Wait, another thought: the bright red product. Maybe it
