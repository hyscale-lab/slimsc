Okay, I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about parallax and star distribution.

Parallax, plx, is a measure of distance. The formula I remember is plx (in arcseconds) = 1 / distance (in parsecs). So the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Wait, no, waitâ€”wait, I think it's the opposite. Because if something is closer, its parallax is larger. Like, when you stick your thumb out and move your head, the closer your thumb is, the bigger the angle it subtends. So yes, plx is inversely proportional to distance.

Now, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. Oh, wait, uniform distribution in what sense? Do they mean uniform in space, like same density everywhere, or uniform in some other way?

Wait, if stars are uniformly distributed in space, that means their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So if we look at a small volume, the number of stars in it depends on the size. But how does that relate to parallax?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how many stars have a certain parallax. Parallax is related to distance, and if stars are spread out uniformly, then more stars would be at larger distances because as you go further out, each shell of volume contains more space. But how does that translate into the number of stars with a certain parallax?

Let me think in terms of distance. Suppose we have a range of parallax from plx to plx +
