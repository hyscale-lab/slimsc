Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. 

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So that means it's something like benzene with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, so there must be an ester functional group in the molecule. Ester groups have specific IR absorptions, like a strong peak around 1740 cm^-1 for the carbonyl. 

Then looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let me break them down. Two aromatic H signals—so the substituents on the benzene ring are such that the ring has two different sets of aromatic protons. Since it's di-substituted, the ring isn't symmetric enough to have all equivalent protons. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be two sets each with two H's, but maybe this is ortho or meta substitution.

Then there are two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons are the ones attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or ester group. One is a doublet and the other is a doublet of quartets. Hmm. So maybe there's an ester group with a vinyl group attached. Or perhaps part of a substituent that's an ester with a double bond nearby. 

Also, there are two signals for –CH3 groups. No –CH2 groups, which is interesting. So where would CH3 groups come into play? Maybe as substituents on the ring or part of an ester.

Let me think about the possible structures. Since it's an ester, the structure might have something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So maybe a benzene ring with two ester groups attached? Or perhaps one ester and another substituent.

Wait, but it's di-substituted, so two substituents on the ring. One could be an ester group, like a benzoyloxy group or maybe a methyl ester or something else. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a vinyl group.

Wait, the NMR mentions vinyl H, so perhaps a substituent is a vinyl group, like a CH2=CH-O- group or something attached. Alternatively, maybe a substituent is a vinyl ester.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Let's say the benzene ring has two substituents: one is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. Or perhaps both substituents are ester groups, but that's less likely because the NMR shows only two CH3 signals. Hmm.

Wait, the two –CH3 signals: perhaps one is from the ester's R group and the other from another substituent. If the substituents are, say, an ester group (like O-CO-O-R) and a methyl group, but that doesn't fit because the aromatic ring would have two substituents, but the NMR shows two CH3 signals, which would be from two different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are an ester (like a methyl ester, so CH3 attached via an ester) and another group that has a CH3. Wait, but if both
