Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my spin operators, but I'll give it a go.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli matrices, right? And n is a unit vector. So σ · n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. Let me recall, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So the dot product would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. 

Wait, but each Pauli matrix is a 2x2 matrix. So σ · n would be a 2x2 matrix as well. Since the Hamiltonian is this matrix multiplied by ε, which has units of energy. So H is a 2x2 matrix with each component scaled by ε.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of H. Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0. But wait, I remember something about the Pauli matrices. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. Oh, because for example, σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, the Hamiltonian here is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. So maybe there's a more straightforward way.

Wait, the trace of a Pauli matrix is zero, because σ_x has trace zero, same with σ_y, σ_z. So any linear combination
