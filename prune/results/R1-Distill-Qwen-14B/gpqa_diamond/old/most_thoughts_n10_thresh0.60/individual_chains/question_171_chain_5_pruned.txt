Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I remember that electrophilic substitution usually involves adding something like a bromine atom to a benzene ring. But wait, the question is about the para-isomer's yield. Oh right, when a substituent directs the incoming electrophile to certain positions, like ortho, meta, or para.

The question gives six substances, each with a benzene ring connected to a different group. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. That means I need to figure out for each substituent whether it is activating or deactivating and whether it's meta or para directing.

Let me list out each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to the benzene. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron donor (alkyl). Activating groups typically increase the rate of substitution. And since it's an activating, ortho/para directing group, the para position will be a major product.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: Wait, that's a benzoyloxy group. Wait, no, the structure is C6H5-COOC2H5, so it's an ester group attached to the benzene. The group is O-CO-OEt? Wait, no, wait. The structure is benzene with a COOEt group attached. So the substituent is a ester, specifically a carbonyloxy ethyl group.

Wait, so
