Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian here, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let me think. I've studied some quantum field theory, but I'm a bit rusty. Let me try to remember the steps.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Oh right, γ matrices are the Dirac matrices. So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from the gamma matrices.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the mass dimensions of all the other terms in the Lagrangian. Remember, in natural units where ħ = c = 1, the Lagrangian has mass dimension [L] = 4 because the action S = ∫ L d^4x is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

So each term in L_int must have dimension 4. Let's see: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F.

Wait, each term is a product of fields and κ. Let's break it down.

The fields involved are ψ (a spinor), F_{μν} (the field strength tensor of a gauge field, like electromagnetism or Yang-Mills). So ψ is a Dirac spinor, which has mass dimension 3/2. Because for fermions, [ψ] = 3/2.

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for a gauge field, which is a tensor of dimension 2. Because the gauge field A has dimension 1 (since it's like a derivative term in the covariant derivative), and F is the derivative of A plus terms with A squared, so [F] = 1 + 1 = 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless because they're just matrices. So σ has the same dimensions as [γμ, γν], which is dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] is 0.

So putting it all together: the term κ ψ̄ σ F must have dimension 4. Let's compute the dimensions:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [F] = 4.

Wait, [ψ̄] is the same as [ψ], which is 3/2. [σ] is 0, [F] is 2. So:

[κ] + 3/2 + 0 + 2 = 4.

Adding those: 3/2 + 2 is (3/2)+(4/2)=7/2. So [κ] = 4 - 7/2 = (8/2 -7/2)= 1/2? Wait, that can't be right because 3/2 + 2 is 3.5, and 4 - 3.5 is 0.5. So [κ] is 1/2. Hmm, but none of the options have 1/2. Wait, did
