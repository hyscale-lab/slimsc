Okay, I've got this chemistry question here about which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question gives four options: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, a benzo-trifuran compound, and a triphenyleno-trifuran compound. The options are labeled A, B, C, D.

Wait, what's C3h symmetry again? Oh right, it's a type of molecular symmetry. C3h is a point group, I think. It has a threefold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and should have a mirror plane that's horizontal, maybe bisecting the molecule.

Let me go through each option.

First, option C: triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure around the boron atom. The molecule is symmetric with three identical isopropyl groups attached to boron. So, the structure is like a three-bladed propeller. Would that have C3h symmetry?

Wait, C3h requires a threefold rotation and a horizontal mirror. The molecule has three identical substituents. The structure is symmetric upon 120-degree rotations, but does it have a mirror plane? I think it does. The plane would pass through the boron atom and the center of each isopropyl group. So yes, it should have C3h symmetry. So that's a possible candidate.

Option D: quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, right? It's a cube-shaped structure with eight-membered ring, I think. Wait, actually, quinuclidine is a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivative. It has a bridge structure. Its symmetry... I think quinuclidine has C3 symmetry because each of the three bridgeheads are equivalent. But does it have a mirror plane that's horizontal? Or maybe it's just C3 without the mirror plane. I'm not too sure, but I don't recall quinuclidine having a horizontal mirror. Maybe it's C3v or something else. So maybe quinuclidine doesn't have C3h symmetry.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Hmm, sounds complex. Let me try to visualize. It's a benzo-fused trifuran system. Benzo rings are six-membered, and trifuran would have three furan rings. The way they're fused... Maybe the molecule has multiple substituents. I'm not sure about the symmetry here. Benzo rings are usually planar, but the trifuran part might complicate things. I'm not certain about the symmetry. Without a clear image, maybe it doesn't have the required C3h symmetry.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene rings attached to a trifuran system. Triphenylene itself has a certain symmetry, perhaps D3h or something. But since it's attached to a trifuran, I'm not sure. The main point is whether the entire molecule has a threefold axis and a horizontal mirror. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically in three positions, maybe it does. Alternatively, triphenyleno might contribute to a higher symmetry.

Wait, but wait, triisopropyl borate is symmetric with three identical groups. Each isopropyl is a substituent on boron. So the structure has a threefold rotation axis (C3), and mirror planes. Because each isopropyl is identical, the molecule should have multiple planes of symmetry. I think for C3h, it needs a horizontal mirror plane. So if the mirror plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis, that would make sense. So triisopropyl borate's structure, with three identical groups arranged in a trigonal fashion, would have a C3 axis and a σh plane. So that's C3h symmetry.

So option C is triisopropyl borate, which is option C. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. The question asks which has C3h, so the correct answer is option C. Wait, let me double-check the options. The original question lists the options as:

A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine which molecule has **C₃h symmetry**, we analyze the given options based on the definition of C₃h symmetry. C₃h consists of a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule must appear identical after a 120° rotation and must have a horizontal mirror plane.

### Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule is a complex fused system with triphenylene rings attached to a trifuran core. While triphenylene itself has a high degree of symmetry, the overall structure of this molecule does not clearly exhibit a threefold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Thus, it does not have C₃h symmetry.

### Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The benzo ring introduces planarity, but the fused trifuran system complicates the symmetry. The structure does not clearly exhibit a threefold rotation axis (C₃) or a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not have C₃h symmetry.

### Option C: Triisopropyl Borate  
Triisopropyl borate has a trigonal planar structure around the boron atom, with three identical isopropyl groups attached. This arrangement provides a threefold rotation axis (C₃) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). The molecule is symmetric under a 120° rotation and has a clear horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it exhibits C₃h symmetry.

### Option D: Quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[3.2.1]octane structure. While it has a threefold rotation axis (C₃), it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (σh). Therefore, it does not exhibit C₃h symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, **triisopropyl borate** is the only molecule that exhibits C₃h symmetry due to its threefold rotation axis and horizontal mirror plane.

**Answer: C**
