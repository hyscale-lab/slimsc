Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is defined as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have a density matrix corresponding to a Gaussian distribution in phase space, like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. Non-Gaussian states have more complex distributions, like Fock states or certain superpositions.

The Schrödinger cat state is a superposition of two coherent states, right? So in this case, it's a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states but with opposite phases. Coherent states are Gaussian, so the superposition would make a non-Gaussian state.

Non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. The relative entropy method compares the state's entropy to a reference Gaussian state. If the state is Gaussian, the difference would be zero. So if the state is non-Gaussian, del_b would be positive.

In the problem, we're to compute this del_b. But wait, how do I find the reference Gaussian state tau? I think the reference is the closest Gaussian state to the given non-Gaussian state. Alternatively, perhaps it's the mixture of the two coherent states that make up the superposition. Hmm, not sure about that.

Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the one that minimizes the relative entropy, which would be the optimal Gaussian approximation. But I'm not exactly sure how to approach finding tau.

Wait, maybe for a two-mode or single-mode cat state, the reference Gaussian state is the maximally mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's the state that has the same first moments as the non-Gaussian state, but I think that's for other measures like the Hilbert-Schmidt distance.

Alternatively, for the relative entropy of entang
