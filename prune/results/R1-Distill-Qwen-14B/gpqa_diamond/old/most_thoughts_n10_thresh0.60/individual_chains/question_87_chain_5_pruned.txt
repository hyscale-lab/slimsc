Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. So the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a certain compound based on the given information.

First, let's parse the question. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, a di-substituted benzene ring? Oh, wait, benzene is a 6-membered ring with 6 carbons. So if the compound has 8 carbons in total, that would mean there are two more carbons in substituents attached to the ring. Because 6 (ring) + 2 (substituents) = 8.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the molecule has both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. An aromatic ring with two substituents. One substituent is a halogen, like Cl or Br, and the other is a carbonyl-containing group. So maybe something like an acyl group attached via an oxygen, like an ester or a ketone? Or perhaps a nitro group? Hmm, but nitro groups don't have carbonyls, right? So more likely, the substituents are a halogen and a carbonyl-containing group.

So the substituents are X (like Cl) and R, where R has a carbonyl. Let's think about possible structures. For example, maybe it's an aromatic ring with a Cl and a ketone substituent, but that would be R as a carbonyl group attached directly. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester group, like OCO-R', where R' could be an alkyl.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the number of carbons. The ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents account for 2, so each substituent is a single carbon? No, wait, because di-substituted means two substituents on the ring. So each substituent could be a single carbon, but perhaps more. Let me think again. Oh wait, the ring has 6 carbons. The total is 8. So substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent contributes one carbon, making two substituents
