Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this electron microscope question. Let me read it carefully.

So, Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating at 1000 kV. He uses vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea here is to minimize gas molecules because in electron microscopy, these can interfere with the electron beam. But even after doing that, some gas particles are still present because the mass spectrometer detects them. 

Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment. I remember that the mean free path λ is given by λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecules, and P is pressure. So lower pressure would mean a longer mean free path.

But when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices that the mean free path changes. Now it's λ2 instead of λ1. But the temperature in the compartment is the same as before. So why would λ change?

Hmm. The mean free path is usually calculated when considering gas molecules moving and colliding with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the electrons are moving through the gas. So the electrons would interact with the gas molecules, causing more collisions.

Wait, wait. So in a normal scenario without the electron beam, the gas molecules are just moving around, colliding with each other. The mean free path λ1 would be based on their mutual collisions. But when the electron beam is active, the electrons are high-energy particles (since it's 1000 kV, which is a million volts, so the electrons have a lot of energy). These electrons would knock into the gas molecules, right?

So the gas molecules now have another source of collisions: with the electrons. This would increase the effective number of collisions each molecule experiences. More collisions mean a shorter mean free path because the molecules are hitting things more often.

So before the electron beam (λ1), the mean free path is based only on gas-gas collisions. After turning on the beam (λ2), there are additional collisions with electrons. Therefore, λ2 should be less than λ1 because the mean free path decreases when more collisions happen.

Wait, but wait—what's the actual physics here? In the mean free path formula, P is pressure. Pressure is related to the number of collisions. But when you have another type of collision (like with electrons), does that affect the mean free path? Because the mean free path as calculated normally doesn't account for collisions with other particles like electrons.

So when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are being hit by electrons as well. This would add to the collision rate, making the effective mean free path shorter. So the observed mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1.

Looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1, which would be correct. So the correct answer should be C.


When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike aimed to minimize gas molecules in the sample compartment by achieving an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr). The mean free path of the gas molecules, λ1, was calculated based on factors such as pressure, temperature, and compartment volume. However, upon initiating the electron beam, Mike observed a new mean free path, λ2, which deviated from λ1 despite the temperature remaining constant.

The mean free path λ is determined by the rate of collisions between gas molecules. Initially, λ1 was based on gas-gas collisions. When the electron beam was activated, high-energy electrons interacted with the gas molecules, introducing additional collisions. These collisions increased the effective collision rate, thereby reducing the mean free path. Since the observed mean free path λ2 is shorter than λ1 due to the added electron-gas collisions, the correct conclusion is that λ2 < λ1.

Answer: C
