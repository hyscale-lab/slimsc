Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says. The user has prepared an unknown compound and used FTIR and 1H NMR to identify it. The options are four different organic compounds, and I need to choose the right one based on the spectral data.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm-1. Broad peaks around 3000 usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. A strong peak at 1700 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone, aldehyde, or maybe an ester or carboxylic acid. But wait, since the broad peak is more characteristic of -OH in a carboxylic acid, maybe that's what's happening here. So, the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are several peaks, none of which correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, no double bonds or triple bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That means the structure doesn't have any =CH2 or similar groups.

Also, two specific signals in the NMR are given. One is a doublet of triplets of quartets (that's a mouthful), and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. I remember that splitting patterns in NMR can give information about neighboring protons. Let me think about what each splitting implies.

Starting with the doublet of triplets of quartets. Let's break it down. A quartet means each proton is split into four by neighboring protons. But wait, waitâ€”quartets are adjacent to a group of three protons. So, if a proton is next to a CH3 group, it would be a quartet. But then, the next level is a triplet. So, each quartet is further split by a neighboring group of two protons. So, the structure here might be something like a CH2 group adjacent to a CH (which is next to a CH3). Hmm, maybe more accurately, the splitting is happening from multiple neighboring groups.

Alternatively, the splitting could be due to coupling with multiple sets of protons. For example, a proton that's next to two different groups, each with a certain number of protons. Let me think: if a proton is next to a CH2 group (which would split it into a triplet) and another group, say, a CH3 (which would split it into a quartet), but wait, that might not directly lead to a quartet of triplets. Maybe I should think in terms of each splitting step.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider that each splitting is from neighboring groups. For example, a proton that's next to two different sets of protons. Let's say a CH group next to a CH2 and another CH group. Let's model this.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex, like in a beta-diketone or something with branching. But wait, the compound options
