Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, enthalpy of formation... right. I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. 

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. It looks like a molecule with multiple double bonds and methyl groups attached. Wait, maybe it's a polystyrene or something similar? Or perhaps it's a diene or some conjugated system. But regardless, the exact structure might not matter as much for the calculation, as long as I can count the number of each type of bond.

The problem gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Let's list out the given data:

- Enthalpy of atomization of carbon (C) = 1000 kJ/mol.
- Bond energy of H-H = 100 kJ/mol.
- Bond energy of C-C = 200 kJ/mol.
- Bond energy of C=C = 300 kJ/mol.
- Bond energy of C-H = 400 kJ/mol.

Wait, but I'm trying to find the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula I remember is:

ΔHf° = [sum of bond energies of reactant bonds] - [sum of bond energies of product bonds]

But wait, no. Actually, the enthalpy of formation of the molecule can be calculated using the bond energies of the bonds in the molecule. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the enthalpy change when the molecule is formed from its constituent elements.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formation from elements. Let's consider the molecule is made from carbon and hydrogen. So, the standard enthalpy of formation would be the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements (C and H) in their standard states.

So, the general approach is:

ΔHf° = (sum of enthalpies of bonds broken in reactants) - (sum of enthalpies of bonds formed in products)

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up the approach. Another way is to consider
