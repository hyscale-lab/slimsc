Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the mouse model. Let's see, the setup is that the researcher made a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G gene is inducibly overexpressed. They wanted to affinity-purify the protein to study its partners after SARS-CoV-2 infection. To do this, they added a sequence for the influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus of the recombinant protein. Then they transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with the plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. But when they tested, the protein wasn't expressed as expected.

The key thing here is looking at the provided DNA sequence of the plus strand to find the issue. The problem is probably in the construct. Let's think about what could go wrong.

Looking at the options, the possible issues are: a missense mutation in the HA sequence, premature termination due to a stop codon, proteolysis because of missing linker, or a missing tRNA for a UAA codon.

Let me look at the DNA sequence given. I'll need to translate it to see if there's a stop codon or anything else. The plus strand is given as a long string. Let me break it down into triplets starting from the beginning.

The sequence starts with ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then TAC, which is tyrosine. CCC is proline, ATC is isoleucine, etc. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA). 

Hmm, looking through the sequence. Let me go step by step:

The first few codons: ATG TAC CCC ATC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA TGA... Wait, wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh, so in the DNA sequence, the codon is TGA. That's the second part of the coding sequence. Wait, but in the mRNA, it's the same as the plus strand except T becomes U. So the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon. So that's a problem.

Wait, the construct starts with ATG, then TAC, etc., and at some point, the codon is TGA in the DNA. When transcribed, that would become UGA in mRNA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate early, right before the HA tag or the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, but the HA tag is at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA followed by GADD45G. So if the HA is followed by a stop codon, the HA might not be expressed or the whole thing stops early.

Looking back, where does the HA tag sequence come in? The HA is the first part. So if the construct includes the HA, then the coding sequence continues. So in the DNA, the HA sequence is at the beginning. If in the DNA, there's a TGA (which is
