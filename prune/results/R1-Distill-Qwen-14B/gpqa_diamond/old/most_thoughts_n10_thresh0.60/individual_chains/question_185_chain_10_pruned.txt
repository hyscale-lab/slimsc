Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n. Oh right, sigma is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So, let me break this down.

Pauli spin matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product sigma · n would be sigma_x * n_x + sigma_y * n_y + sigma_z * n_z. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² equals 1.

Wait, but when you take the eigenvalues of such an operator, maybe the direction of n doesn't matter because the eigenvalues depend on the magnitude, not the direction. Because any rotation shouldn't change the eigenvalues, just the eigenvectors.

So, H is proportional to sigma · n. And sigma · n is a matrix. What are the eigenvalues of a matrix like sigma · n?

I remember that for Pauli matrices, each sigma_i has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Oh wait, no. Wait, each Pauli matrix is traceless and has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a combination like sigma · n, which is a sum of sigma_i multiplied by components of n, the eigenvalues would be different.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the general case. Suppose I have H = epsilon * (n · sigma), which is a
