Okay, let me try to solve this problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's look at the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are some hints:
- Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with a phosphorous ylide, gives 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
- Hint b: IR of A has a peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E at ~1715 cm^-1.

Looking at the options for E, they are all cyclic ketones. So E is a ketone. That suggests that maybe D is an alcohol or something that would eliminate to form a ketone when it loses a gas (like water or another small molecule).

Let me think about the IR part. The strong peak around 1750 cm^-1 for A is probably a carbonyl group, like a ketone. Because the peak shifts, E's IR is at 1715, which is a bit lower than A's. That might suggest that A is an ester or another type of carbonyl, but wait, E is a ketone. Wait, but if A's carbonyl is at higher wavenumber, maybe A is an ester or a ketone as well. Hmm. Let's see.

Wait, the reaction steps: A to B is HCN. That makes me think of a substitution. If A is a ketone, reacting with HCN would typically form a cyanohydrin. But wait, HCN adds to carbonyls to form cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, B would have an OH and a CN group adjacent? Or maybe it's a ring opening.

Wait, but let me think about the hints. Hint a says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it gives a specific compound. Phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which form alkenes by reacting with carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, reacting with a Wittig reagent would form an alkene.

The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me parse that structure. So cyclopentane ring with substituents at positions 1 and 2. Position 4 has a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is the same as isopropenylidene, meaning it's CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or wait, propan-2-ylidene would be the ylid part, so it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)- something? Hmm, maybe it's (CH3)2C=CH- group attached.

Wait, the structure is 4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclop
