Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

The problem is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure what that implies about their orbits, but maybe I don't need that right now. The main thing is about the orbital periods of these planets.

So the question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. Also, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. The albedo for all is 0.3. And the question is by what factor is Planet3's orbital period larger than Planet1's.

Hmm, equilibrium temperature. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. The formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 pi sigma d^2 (1 - a)) ) )^(1/4), but wait, perhaps the simplified version where T is proportional to (L/(d^2))^(1/4). Wait no, because the star's luminosity is a factor, but since all three planets are around the same star, L is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature T should be proportional to (1/d)^(1/2), because T scales with (L/(16 pi sigma d^2 (1-a)))^(1/4), so (1/d^2) under square root when raised to 1/4 power gives (1/d)^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d).

But wait, equilibrium temperature formula. Let me think again. The formula is T = [( (1 - a) * L ) / (16 * pi * sigma * d^2 ) ]^(1/4). So if all have the same albedo, a=0.3, and same L and sigma, then T is proportional to (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). 

So, T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. So, T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1), because T1 = k / sqrt(d1), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). Or, rearranged, d1/d2 = (T2/T1)^2.

Wait, no. Let me re-express that. Let's say T1 is the equilibrium temperature of Planet1, T2 of Planet2. Then T1 = T_star * ( (1/d1²) )^(1/4) = T_star / (d1^(1/2)). Similarly for T2. So T1 / T2 = (d2 / d1)^(1/2). So (T1/T2)^2 = d2/d1. So d1 = d2 * (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, let me re-calculate. If T1 = T_star / sqrt(d1), then T1 / T2 = (sqrt(d2) ) / sqrt(d1) ). So square both sides: (T1/T2)^2 = d2 / d1. Therefore, d1 = d2 * (T1/T2)^2.

Wait, no. Let's think about it again. T1 = (L / (16 pi sigma d1^2 (1-a)) )^(1/4). Similarly for T2. So T1 / T2 = [ (d2^2) / (d1^2) ) ]^(1/4) * [ (1-a) same for both ] So (T1/T2)^4 = (d2^2)/(d
