Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the major products of two different reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is with ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene, and it's treated with BuLi followed by H+. Then, the second reaction involves a more complex molecule undergoing heat. The question is about the major products A and B, and I have four options to choose from.

Starting with reaction A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw this structure mentally. Benzene ring with an oxy group attached. The oxy is connected to a methyl group (OCH2-), and then there's a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group attached to that CH2. So the structure is OCH2-C(CH2CH2CH3)=CH2 connected to benzene. Wait, actually, but wait: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2-. So the full structure is benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but wait, the structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy group. Let's think. The butenyl group is four carbons long. But-2-en-1-yl means the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the substituent is at position 1. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait no, wait: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH-CH2 but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps better to write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, the butenyl group is 1-yl, so the substituent is on carbon 1. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-? No, that's but-1-en-4-yl. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So structure would be CH2-CH2-CH=CH, but with the substituent on C1. Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but that's 1-yl. Maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, the structure is (CH2)2CHCH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, no. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2- no, wait. The correct structure for but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- as the substituent? No, wait, wait. The butenyl group is four carbons. The substituent is on carbon 1. The double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but with the substituent
