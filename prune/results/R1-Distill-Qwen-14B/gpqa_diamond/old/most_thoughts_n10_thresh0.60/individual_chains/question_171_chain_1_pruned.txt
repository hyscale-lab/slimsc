Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the order of the substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer in their electrophilic substitution reactions with excess bromine. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that in electrophilic substitution reactions, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions. They can be either activating or deactivating, and whether they are meta or para directors.

The question gives six substances, all benzene derivatives with different substituents. The substituents are:

1) CH3
2) COOEt (ethoxy carbonyl)
3) Cl
4) NO2
5) C2H5 (ethyl)
6) COOH (carboxylic acid)

Wait, but the substituent for number 2 is actually COOEt, which is an ester group. And number 6 is COOH, a carboxylic acid.

So, the reaction is with excess bromine. I think that means each benzene ring will undergo bromination, but since it's an electrophilic substitution, each substituent will influence where the bromine adds.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each compound, when bromine adds, the major product will be either para or meta or maybe a mix, depending on the substituent.

Wait, no. Electrophilic substitution can sometimes form multiple products if the substituents are such that multiple activating positions are possible. But under certain conditions, the major product is either para or meta.

I think the directing effect determines where the substitution occurs. For example, an activating group (like -OCH3) would direct the incoming electrophile to the para and ortho positions. Wait, but activating groups are typically ortho/para directors, while deactivating are meta directors, but it depends on the type of deactivating group.

Wait, let's list each substituent and whether they are activating or deactivating, and whether they are meta or para directors.

1) CH3: This is a methyl group. It's an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's an ortho/para director. So, when bromine reacts, the para position would be one of the major positions. Since it's a strong activating group
