Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and we're supposed to figure out what it is based on the spectral data. Let's see what I can do.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is the highest point and 100% abundance. Then there's a peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, that's a difference of 2 mass units. Maybe the molecular formula is something like C8HClO2? Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the IR data, there's a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid because those have broad, strong O-H stretches. Also, there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1, which is around the range for a carbonyl group, especially a carboxylic acid (around 1700-1725 cm^-1). So that supports the idea of a carboxylic acid.

Now the 1H NMR: there's a singlet at 11.0 ppm. That's a really high chemical shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Since there's only one proton, maybe it's the acidic proton from a carboxylic acid. Then, there's a doublet at 8.02 ppm integrating for 2H and another doublet at 7.72 ppm also integrating for 2H. Those look like aromatic protons. The two doublets suggest a para-substitution because each set of protons is equivalent and coupling with each other. So the structure might have a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group (which aligns with the IR and NMR data), and a chlorine in the para position. That would give the aromatic protons as two doublets. Let me think about the molecular formula.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. If it's 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the formula becomes C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight. Carbon is 12*7=84, Hydrogen 5*1=5, Cl is about 35.5, O is 16*2=32. So 84 +5 =89; 89 +35.5=124.5; 124.5 +32=156.5. Wait, mass is 156. So that’s close. The molecular ion is at 156, which fits.

What about the m/z 158 peak? That's 2 mass units higher than the molecular ion. That might be due to the presence of a chlorine isotope. Chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35 (75%) and 37 (25%). So the molecular ion would have two possibilities: 35Cl or 37Cl. The molecular weight would be 156 when using 35Cl. Then, 37Cl would make it 158. So the 32% abundance is about 37Cl's natural abundance (about 35Cl is 75%, 37 is 25%), so 100% * (37Cl% / 35Cl%) gives the relative abundance. Wait, but the M+2 peak is at 32%, which is about the natural abundance of Cl-37 in a molecule with one Cl. Because for each Cl atom, the M and M+2 peaks are in a 3:1 ratio (75% Cl-35, 25% Cl-37). So the M peak would be 75% and M+2 25% of the total. But the question says M is 156 (100%) and M+2 is 158 (32%). Wait, that can't be right because the actual percentages would be 75% for M and 25% for M+2. So perhaps the molecular ion given is 100% of the base peak, but in reality, the M is 75% and M+2 is 25%, but the problem states it as M at 100% and M+2 as 32%. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion at 156 is 100%, and the 158 is 32%, which would imply that the M+2 is about 32% of the M. So if M is 156 at 100%, then M+2 is 32% of that, which would be 32% as given. But wait, in reality, for a single Cl atom, M+2 is about 25% of M. So 25% of 100 would be 25, but here it's 32. That doesn't add up. So maybe there's another Cl in the molecule?

Wait, looking at option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid has only one Cl. So, the M and M+2 would be in a 3:1 ratio. So if the base peak is 100%, then M would be 75% (but the problem says 100%), but wait, perhaps in the problem, the molecular ion is taken as 100% for simplicity. Alternatively, maybe the molecular ion isn't the most abundant peak, but it's the highest. Hmm. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is different. Let me check other options.

Option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Wait, that's similar to option B, but the Cl is in the ortho position. The NMR would have different splitting, though. For benzoic acid derivatives, the position of substituents affects the aromatic protons. For para-substituted rings, the two protons are in a para arrangement, leading to two doublets (like what's observed), whereas for ortho, it's more complicated. So, the NMR data suggests para substitution.

Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That would be a benzaldehyde derivative with hydroxyl and Cl substituents. The molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate the molecular weight: C=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So that's close to 156. Then, the M+2 would be 158, which would correspond to the Cl-37 isotope. The IR would have a strong O-H stretch (which is present), and a carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1, which would be an aldehyde (around 1720 is a bit high for aldehyde, more like 1700-1720 for aldehydes, but also, carboxylic acids are around that range). However, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9-10 ppm. But wait, the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm. For aldehydes, the protons are around 9-10. For carboxylic acids, it's higher, usually around 10-12 ppm, which is what's observed. So the singlet at 11 ppm fits the carboxylic acid, not the aldehyde.

Wait, but option A is a benzaldehyde, which would have an aldehyde group. So in that case, the singlet would be around 9.5-10 ppm. So why is it at 11.0? That's more like a carboxylic acid. So maybe option A is less likely.

Option C is Phenyl chloroformate. That would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. The molecular formula would be C6H5O2Cl (same as benzoic acid). Molecular weight: same as benzoic acid, around 156.5. The IR for chloroformate would have a strong carbonyl around 1750-1800 cm^-1, maybe higher than 1720. Also, the NMR, if it's a chloroformate, would not have an O-H proton because it's an ester. But the IR has a broad peak, which suggests O-H, so that's more in line with a carboxylic acid. So option C is probably not the answer.

So, going back, option B seems the best fit. 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Wait, but let me check the NMR. For benzoic acid derivatives, the aromatic protons are usually deshielded. For para-substituted benzoic acid, the two protons would be next to each other in the ring, but wait, no. Wait, in para substitution, the substituent is in position 4. Wait, benzoic acid has the COOH group in position 1. So if Cl is in position 4, which is para to the COOH group, the ring would have the COOH at position 1, Cl at 4. That would leave positions 2 and 6 on one side and 3 and 5 on the other. Wait, no, the ring is symmetric. So the two H's adjacent to COOH (ortho) would be at positions 2 and 6. But wait, if substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), then the remaining positions are 2,3,5,6. The protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. But I'm not entirely sure about the splitting. 

Wait, the NMR shows two doublets. Each H is next to one other H, so it's a doublet. That suggests that each H is equivalent to one other H and not more. So in para substitution, the two H's would be in equivalent positions. Wait, if the substituents are para, then the ring is symmetric. So positions 2 and 6 would have equivalent H's, and positions 3 and 5 would have another set of equivalent H's. But in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is at position 4 and COOH at position 1. So the H's at 2 and 6 would be adjacent to COOH and meta to Cl, while H's at 3 and 5 would be adjacent to Cl and meta to COOH. But in the NMR, both sets of H's would show up as doublets.

Wait, but the NMR here shows two doublets with the same integration (each is 2H). So that fits a para-substituted structure where there are two sets of equivalent protons. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two H's ortho to COOH would be a pair, and the two H's ortho to Cl would be another pair. Both would be doublets because each H is coupled with only one adjacent H (in a para-substituted ring). So that matches the NMR data.

Putting it all together: IR suggests a carboxylic acid, molecular ion at 156 with M+2 at 32% (which makes sense with Cl), NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (carboxylic proton) and two doublets for para-substituted aromatic H's. So the correct answer should be option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%) and a secondary peak at m/z = 158 (32%) suggest a molecular weight of 156 with a chlorine atom, as the 158 peak corresponds to the Cl-37 isotope. The IR spectrum shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, characteristic of a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes a singlet at 11.0 ppm, consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, and two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm, integrating for 2H each, which suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde)**: This compound contains an aldehyde group, which would show a proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the NMR. However, the singlet at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, ruling out this option.

2. **Option B (4-Chlorobenzoic acid)**: This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom in the para position relative to the carboxylic acid. The IR and NMR data align well with this structure: the broad O-H stretch, the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, and the two doublets in the NMR for the para-substituted aromatic protons. The molecular weight of 156 matches the molecular ion peak, and the M+2 peak at 158 corresponds to the Cl-37 isotope.

3. **Option C (Phenyl chloroformate)**: This compound contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-) rather than a carboxylic acid. The IR would show a carbonyl peak at a higher wavenumber (1750-1800 cm⁻¹), and the NMR would not have a singlet at 11.0 ppm due to the absence of an O-H proton. This option is inconsistent with the data.

4. **Option D (2-Chlorobenzoic acid)**: This compound has a chlorine atom in the ortho position relative to the carboxylic acid. The NMR of an ortho-substituted benzoic acid would show more complex splitting patterns due to the proximity of substituents, whereas the observed NMR data (two doublets) is more consistent with a para-substituted structure. Thus, this option is less likely.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR, and NMR, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The molecular weight, the presence of a carboxylic acid group, and the para-substitution pattern in the aromatic ring all support this identification.
