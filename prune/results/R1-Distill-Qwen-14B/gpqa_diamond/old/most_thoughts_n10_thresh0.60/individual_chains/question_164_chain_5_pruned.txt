Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars... right, they orbit around a common center of mass. The question is about figuring out by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options are given as A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

Let me read the problem again. So, both systems exhibit eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. Wait, the period is the time between two primary eclipses. So the orbital period for system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year. Got it.

Then, they mention spectroscopic observations showing radial velocity (RV) variations. System_1's stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10. So for each system, the two stars have different RV amplitudes. RV variations come from the Doppler effect as the stars move towards and away from us, right.

I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so its velocity (and hence RV amplitude) will be smaller. Because velocity is inversely proportional to mass in their orbits. Oh wait, the mass ratio is important here.

The key formula that relates these things is probably the one involving the masses and the velocities of the stars. So I think the mass of each star is proportional to the inverse of their velocity. Because the product of mass and velocity would be the same for both stars in the system since the center of mass is stationary (assuming no external forces). So m1 * v1 = m2 * v2. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think.

Wait, the center of mass condition says m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. And since velocity v = 2πa / P, where P is the period. So v is proportional to a. So substituting, m1*(v1) = m2*(v2), because a1 = (v1 * P)/(2π), same for a2. So yeah, m1*v1 = m2*v2.

So m1/m2 = v2/v1.

Wait, let me rephrase. For a given system, the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their
