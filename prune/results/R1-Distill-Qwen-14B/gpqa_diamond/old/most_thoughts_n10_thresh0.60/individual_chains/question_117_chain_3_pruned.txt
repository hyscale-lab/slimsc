Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism happens when a molecule can rotate plane-polarized light because it has chiral centers or some kind of asymmetry. Chiral centers are atoms, usually carbon, bonded to four different groups. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images, leading to optical activity.

Let me look at each option one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Wait, biphenyl rings connected at the 1,1' position. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. So on each ring, there's a nitro and a carboxylate group. Oh, but wait, the rings are connected in such a way. So the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center or a plane of symmetry.

Biphenyls can have different conformations, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, maybe it's not chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that makes the whole molecule asymmetric, it could have optical isomers. Wait, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate group. Let me think. The structure is such that each ring has two substituents: on each ring, substituents are at 2 and 6 positions (assuming the numbering
