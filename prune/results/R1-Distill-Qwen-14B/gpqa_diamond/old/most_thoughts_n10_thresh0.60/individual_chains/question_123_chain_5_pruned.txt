Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that makes sense because if the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy, the Galaxy would appear to move towards the ejecta in its frame.

The question is asking what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh right, so we have two different reference frames here, the ejecta's and the Galaxy's. I remember that when dealing with relative velocities, especially at significant fractions of the speed of light, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, the problem doesn't specify that the speeds are relativistic. Let me check: 60,000 km/s. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2 times c, which is pretty fast. So yeah, relativistic effects might matter here.

Wait, but the problem says to ignore gravity, rotation, and revolution. So we don't have to worry about those complicating factors.

So, the main issue here is figuring out how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Then, using that time to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. Wait: from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at some velocity. But wait, I might need to apply the velocity addition formula here, but wait, no. Because the frames are moving at some relative velocity, but I think the problem is set up so that the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s.

But wait, in reality, if frame S (Galaxy) sees the ejecta moving at velocity v, then the ejecta's frame S' would see the Galaxy moving at velocity -v, but we have to compute it using the velocity addition formula. Wait,
