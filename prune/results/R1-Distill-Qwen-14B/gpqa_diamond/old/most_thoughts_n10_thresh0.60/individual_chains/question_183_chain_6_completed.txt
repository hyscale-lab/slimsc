Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D, with D being 0, which would mean a fully saturated molecule.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. Oh wait, in this case, I don't think there are any halogens or nitrogens in the product, so the formula simplifies to (2C +2 - H)/2.

But first, I need to figure out what the product looks like after the reaction. Red phosphorus and excess HI... Oh, right! That's the reaction where red phosphorus is used to remove the functional groups by replacing double bonds with iodide groups. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, I think red phosphorus is used in the Cleland reaction, which converts carbonyl groups into alkanes. Or wait, maybe it's the hydroiodic acid reaction, which is about adding HI in presence of P, leading to cleavage or addition.

Wait, another thought: when a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) reacts with HI and red phosphorus, that's typically the Clemmensen reduction. Oh, right! Clemmensen reduction converts ketones or aldehydes into alkanes. So in this case, the aldehyde group (formyl) would be reduced to a CH2 group.

So the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let's break that down. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3 (cyclohex-3-ene), a formyl group at position 2, and a vinyl group at position 5. Also, there's a carboxylic acid group attached, probably at position 1 or something else.

So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:
- At position 3: a double bond (so part of the ring is a double bond, making it cyclohexene).
- At position 2: a formyl group (CHO).
- At position 5: a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-).

Wait, actually, the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5. Let me imagine the ring. So, the cyclohexene has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4, perhaps. Then, at position 2, the formyl group is attached, position 5 the vinyl, and the carboxylic acid group. Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1? Because in the numbering, the carboxylic acid takes the lowest possible number, so probably position 1. So the substituents are at positions 2, 3 (double bond), and 5.

So, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so it has one double bond in the ring), a formyl group (CHO), a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), and a carboxylic acid.

When we react this with red phosphorus and excess HI, that's the Clemmensen conditions, which reduces the aldehyde group (CHO) to CH2. So the formyl group becomes a CH2 group. What about the other groups?

The vinyl group is CH2=CH2? No, wait. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-. So in the starting material, it's attached to the cyclohexene ring. So the structure has a double bond in the ring (cyclohexene), and another double bond in the vinyl group (CH2=CH-). Also, the carboxylic acid is present.

So before reaction, the molecule has multiple double bonds. Let me count the hydrogen deficiency in the starting material.

The IHD is calculated as (2C +2 - H)/2.

But maybe it's easier to count the number of double bonds and rings. Each ring or double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.

So the starting molecule: cyclohexene has one ring (so 1) and a double bond (another 1). Then, the vinyl group has its own double bond (another 1). Plus the formyl group has a double bond (another 1). Also, the carboxylic acid has a double bond (O=C-OH, which is a carbonyl, so another 1). Wait, that would be 4 double bonds plus the ring.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The cyclohexene ring has one double bond, so that's one. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so that's another double bond, so two. The formyl group is CHO, which is a double bond (C=O), so three. The carboxylic acid is COOH, which has a carbonyl, so that's another double bond, making four. So the starting material has four double bonds. Also, the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring, which counts as one ring (so adding another 1). So total IHD is 5?

Wait, no. Wait, the index is the sum of rings and double bonds (each ring or double bond adds one). So let's count:

- The cyclohexene ring: 1 (from the ring) plus 1 (from the double bond) → but wait, no, a ring with a double bond is different. Wait, no. Actually, a cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So considering that, the ring structure itself contributes 1 (for the ring) and the double bond contributes 1, so total 2. Or wait, no. Wait, IHD is based on the number of double bonds and rings. A ring is equivalent to a double bond in IHD. So each ring counts as one, each double bond as one.

So for the starting molecule:

- Cyclohexene: 1 ring, 1 double bond → 2.
Wait, no. Wait, a cyclohexene is a cyclic compound with one double bond. So the ring itself is a ring (counts as 1) and the double bond within the ring is another double bond (counts as 1). So total IHD from the ring system is 2.

Then, the formyl group (CHO) has a double bond (C=O), so another 1.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) has a double bond, another 1.

The carboxylic acid (COOH) has a carbonyl (C=O), another 1.

So total IHD is 2 (from ring and double bond) + 1 (formyl) +1 (vinyl) +1 (carboxylic) = 5.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is: cyclohexene ring (double bond between carbons 3 and 4?), with substituents at positions 2 (formyl), 5 (vinyl), and the carboxylic acid at position 1.

So, total IHD is 5.

But when it reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, which is the Clemmensen reduction, the aldehyde group (formyl) is reduced to CH2. So the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2OH? Wait, no. Clemmensen reduction uses HI and red phosphorus, which usually reduces carbonyl groups (like ketones and aldehydes) to CH2 groups. So CHO → CH2.

So the formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2, and the double bond in the formyl (C=O) is gone.

But wait, the other groups: the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is a double bond. The starting material has that. After reaction, what happens to the other double bonds?

Wait, the reaction conditions—do they affect the vinyl group or the ring double bond?

Wait, under Clemmensen conditions, the reaction is mainly for reducing carbonyl groups. The vinyl group is a different structure. I think only the aldehyde (CHO) would be reduced, and the other double bonds (like in the vinyl group and the ring) would remain.

So after the reaction, the product would have:

- A cyclohexene ring (so one ring and one double bond in the ring → IHD of 2).
- The formyl group becomes CH2, so that removes the C=O double bond (so IHD decreases by 1 → from 5 to 4).
- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) remains, so another double bond (IHD remains 4).
- The carboxylic acid group: wait, doesn't the reaction affect that? No, because carboxylic acids don't participate in Clemmensen. So the COOH remains as is, which has a carbonyl (C=O) → another double bond (IHD remains 4 → 4 becomes ... wait, wait.

Wait, let me recount the IHD after the reaction.

The product would have:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 ring (counts as 1) and 1 double bond (counts as 1) → total 2.
- The formyl group was converted to CH2; that removes a double bond (so IHD decreases by 1 → 2 + 1 = 3 so far, but wait, perhaps I should recount all the double bonds again.

Wait, let me list all the possible double bonds and rings in the product.

1. The cyclohexene ring: 1 ring (1) and 1 double bond (1) → total 2.
2. The vinyl group: CH2=CH- → double bond (1) → total 3.
3. The carboxylic acid: COOH → carbonyl (1) → total 4.

Formyl group is now CH2, so the C=O is gone, which is one less double bond. So after reduction, the product has:

- Cyclohexene ring: 2 IHD.
- Vinyl group: adds 1 → 3.
- Carboxylic acid: adds 1 → 4.

So the IHD is 4? But wait, looking at the product.

Wait, let me think about the molecule after reaction. The formyl group (CHO) is at position 2, becomes CH2. The vinyl group at position 5 is still present. The cyclohexene ring remains, so it has a double bond. The carboxylic acid is present, so its carbonyl is present.

So the product has:

- One ring (cyclohexene) → 1.
- One double bond in the ring → 1.
- One double bond in the vinyl group → 1.
- One double bond in the carboxylic acid → 1.
So total IHD is 4.

But wait, no. Wait, the ring is a cyclohexene, which has a double bond. So the ring itself has a double bond, so for IHD, the ring counts as 1, and the double bond in the ring counts as another 1. So that's two.

Then, the vinyl group has a double bond (1), and the carboxylic acid has a double bond (1). So that's 2 +1 +1 =4.

So the IHD of the product is 4. But wait, none of the options are 4. The options are 1,3,5,0.

Hmm, that's a problem because the answer isn't among the options. So maybe I made a mistake in the reaction.

Wait, maybe I got the reaction wrong. Because the starting material is a carboxylic acid. I thought the Clemmensen only affects the aldehyde. But wait, what's the structure of the starting material again.

Wait, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the acid is at position 1, formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and the ring has a double bond at position 3 (so 3 and 4 are double bonded).

So the starting compound has four double bonds (ring double bond, formyl, vinyl, and carboxylic acid). IHD is 5.

After reaction, formyl is reduced to CH2. So that removes one double bond. So product has three double bonds.

Wait, no. The starting IHD is 5. After reaction, formyl becomes CH2, which removes one double bond (the carbonyl of formyl), so IHD becomes 4.

But none of the options are 4. So I must have made a mistake in considering the reaction. Maybe the reaction affects other groups.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction isn't Clemmensen. Maybe it's a different reaction. Red phosphorus and HI can be involved in other reactions, like the hydrohalogenation of alkenes or the removal of functional groups.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI can be used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones and aldehydes, and requires high temperatures. But wait, the Wolff-Kishner reduces carbonyl groups to CH2, same as Clemmensen. So perhaps same effect.

Wait, but if the starting material has an acid, would that affect the reaction? Because strong acids can sometimes protonate carbonyl groups. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is not just reducing the formyl group but also doing something else. Or perhaps I'm missing how the reaction affects the ring.

Wait, maybe the cyclohexene ring is getting hydrogenated? But red phosphorus and HI are not typically used for hydrogenation. Hydrogenation usually uses H2 and a catalyst. So I think the ring's double bond remains.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the starting molecule's structure leads to certain groups being more reactive. For example, the formyl group is more reactive than the vinyl group, so it gets reduced first.

So, after reaction, the formyl is CH2, and the vinyl remains as CH2CH2? No, no, wait. The vinyl group is CH2=CH-, so after reaction, it's still CH2=CH- because the reaction doesn't affect that.

But wait, in the reaction conditions, maybe the other double bonds are affected. Let me think about this.

Red phosphorus and HI: another reaction is the addition to alkenes. But wait, in the presence of excess HI, maybe the vinyl group would undergo addition. But wait, I thought the reaction is more about reducing carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's ring is undergoing some change. Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexene, so it's an alkene in the ring. If the reaction conditions are such that alkenes are attacked, but I don't think so. I think the conditions are more for carbonyl reductions.

So, let me re-examine the product structure.

After reaction:

- The formyl group (CHO) is converted to CH2.
- The cyclohexene ring's double bond is still present.
- The vinyl group's double bond is still present.
- The carboxylic acid's carbonyl is still present.

So, the product has:

- Cyclohexene ring: 1 ring (1) and 1 double bond (1) → 2.
- Vinyl group: 1 double bond → 1.
- Carboxylic acid: 1 double bond → 1.
- Formyl is now CH2, so that's no longer a double bond → removed 1.

So total IHD is 2 (from ring) +1 (vinyl) +1 (carboxylic) = 4.

But the options don't have 4. So, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the carboxylic acid is also being converted. But under Clemmensen conditions, the carboxylic acid is usually not reduced because it's a strong acid and the reaction conditions (like high heat and HI) might not reduce it. Clemmensen typically reduces aldehydes and ketones, but not carboxylic acids. So the COOH remains.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction is not Clemmensen but something else. Maybe it's adding HI across double bonds.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the Baeyer-Villiger reaction, but that's for ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but that's with other reagents.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is adding HI to the double bonds. So, the vinyl group and the ring's double bond would react with HI.

But wait, under what conditions would HI add to the double bonds? In the presence of red phosphorus, perhaps it's promoting some addition.

Wait, red phosphorus and HI can be used to add to alkenes in the presence of water, but I think that's in the preparation of diols. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation.

Wait, no. Let me think: HI is a strong acid, and with red phosphorus, perhaps it's acting as a Lewis acid, facilitating some addition. For example, H2O addition is possible, but in this case, it's HI.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is causing the vinyl group and the ring's double bond to undergo addition reactions, converting the alkenes into dihalides.

Wait, but the question says excess HI. So perhaps all the alkenes are being added with HI, leading to dihalides.

Wait, okay, let's think: when alkenes react with HI in excess, it's an addition reaction. So, each double bond would add two HI molecules, leading to vicinal diiodides. For each double bond, adding two HI would add two I atoms and remove the double bond, thus reducing the IHD by 1 per double bond.

So, if the starting material has three double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl, and carboxylic acid), wait, no. Wait, the starting material has:

1. Cyclohexene: 1 ring and 1 double bond → 2 IHD.
2. Formyl: 1 double bond → 1.
3. Vinyl: 1 double bond → 1.
4. Carboxylic acid: 1 double bond → 1.

So IHD is 5.

If the reaction adds HI to the ring's double bond and the vinyl group's double bond, each addition would remove one IHD each.

Wait, but the reaction uses excess HI, so it's possible that all double bonds are being saturated. But what about the formyl group and the carboxylic acid?

Wait, the formyl group is being reduced to CH2, which removes its C=O. So that's one IHD reduction.

The vinyl group's double bond, if it's opened by HI addition, would become a diiodide, removing another IHD.

The ring's double bond would also add HI, becoming a diiodide, removing another IHD.

The carboxylic acid's carbonyl would remain, right? Because the reaction is adding HI to the alkenes, not the carbonyl. The formyl has been reduced, but the carboxylic acid is a different group.

So, let's break it down:

Original IHD: 5.

After reaction:

- Formyl is CH2 → IHD decreases by 1 → 4.
- Vinyl's double bond is now a single bond after adding HI → IHD decreases by 1 → 3.
- Ring's double bond is now a single bond → IHD decreases by 1 → 2.
- Carboxylic acid's C=O remains → no change.

So total IHD would be 5 -3 = 2. But the options don't have 2 either. So that's not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the reaction doesn't affect the ring's double bond. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps only the formyl group is reduced. The other double bonds (vinyl and ring) remain. So what's the IHD?

- Formyl reduction: IHD decreases by 1 → from 5 to 4.

So the product IHD is 4, but the options don't have 4. So what's going on?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not just reducing the formyl group but also the ring's double bond. Let me think: could the ring's double bond be hydrogenated under these conditions?

Wait, hydrogenation usually requires H2 and a catalyst. But red phosphorus and HI might not do that. Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond reacts with HI, but I don't think so. Because in presence of excess HI, maybe the ring's double bond could undergo addition.

Wait, but if the ring's double bond reacts with HI, adding two I atoms, making a diiodide. So, each ring double bond would add two I, so each would contribute to the IHD.

But if all the double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl) are converted to single bonds, each would decrease IHD by 1. So:

- Formyl: becomes CH2 → IHD down by 1.
- Vinyl: becomes CH2CH2I2 (or similar) → IHD down by 1.
- Ring: becomes cyclohexane with two I atoms → IHD down by 1.

So from initial 5, subtract 3 → IHD 2. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps only the formyl and the ring's double bond are affected.

Wait, let me consider each step of the reaction.

1. The starting material has the following double bonds:

   a. The ring (cyclohexene) → 1.

   b. The formyl group → 1.

   c. The vinyl group →1.

   d. The carboxylic acid →1.

   So 4 double bonds, plus the ring → 5 IHD.

Wait, no, the ring is a six-membered ring, which is a ring structure (counts as 1), and the ring has a double bond (another 1). So the ring contributes two IHD.

The other three double bonds: formyl (1), vinyl (1), carboxylic acid (1) → 3 IHD. So total is 5.

After reaction with HI and red phosphorus:

The formyl group is reduced → loses its C=O (1 IHD).

The ring's double bond: do we add HI across it? Or is the ring opened?

Alternatively, perhaps only the formyl is reduced, and the other double bonds remain.

So after reaction, the product has:

- Ring: still a cyclohexene (so 2 IHD from the ring and double bond).

- Formyl: now CH2 → no C=O → IHD down by 1 → 5-1=4.

Wait, but then the IHD would be 4. But the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)0. So none match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the IHD of the product. Let me think about the exact structure.

After reaction, the product is 2-formyl → 2-CH2-... So the substituents are:

At position 2: CH2.

At position 5: CH2-CH2I or something? Wait, no—if the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is reacted with HI, it would add HI across the double bond, making CH2-I-CH2I? Or perhaps CH2-CH2I? No, addition of HI to a double bond would typically give the more substituted product, but perhaps it's cis addition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds HI to the vinyl group, converting it into CH2-CH2I. But I'm not sure about the exact structure.

But regardless, the main point is that each double bond addition reduces the IHD by 1.

So, the starting IHD is 5.

If the reaction reduces the formyl, adds HI to the ring and vinyl, each reduction would decrease IHD by 1. So:

5 -3 = 2. Still, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not adding HI to the ring but only to the vinyl group.

So, the vinyl group (double bond) is added with HI, becoming CH2-CH2I.

So, that reduces IHD by 1.

Formyl is reduced → IHD down by 1.

So total IHD →5-2=3.

Which is option B)3.

So the product's IHD would be 3.

Looking at the options, option B is 3. That's possible.

So let's go with that.

Wait, but why wouldn't the ring's double bond be affected? Because maybe the ring's double bond is less reactive than the vinyl group. Or perhaps, the reaction conditions only affect the formyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the ring's double bond is in a less accessible position.

Wait, perhaps the reaction conditions cause the formyl to be reduced, and the vinyl group's double bond to be added with HI, but the ring's double bond remains. So:

Original IHD:5.

After reaction:

Formyl reduction → -1 →4.

Vinyl addition → -1 →3.

Ring's double bond remains → contributes 2 IHD.

But wait, if the ring's double bond remains, then the IHD would be:

Ring (2) + carboxylic acid (1) + any other double bonds.

Wait, after reaction:

- Ring: 2 IHD (1 ring, 1 double bond).

- Vinyl: no double bond → 0.

- Formyl: no double bond →0.

- Carboxylic acid: 1.

So total IHD is 2 +1 =3.

So that makes sense. So the product would have IHD 3, which is option B.


The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated as:

\[
\text{IHD} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H - X + N)}{2}
\]

where \(C\) is the number of carbons, \(H\) is the number of hydrogens, \(X\) is the number of halogens, and \(N\) is the number of nitrogens. In this case, there are no halogens or nitrogens, so the formula simplifies to:

\[
\text{IHD} = \frac{(2C + 2 - H)}{2}
\]

The starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, has the following features:

1. A cyclohexene ring (1 ring and 1 double bond → 2 IHD).
2. A formyl group (C=O → 1 IHD).
3. A vinyl group (CH\(_2\)=CH- → 1 IHD).
4. A carboxylic acid group (C=O → 1 IHD).

Thus, the total IHD of the starting material is:

\[
\text{IHD}_{\text{starting}} = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
\]

When the starting material reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. **Reduction of the formyl group (CHO → CH\(_2\))**: This removes the C=O double bond, decreasing the IHD by 1.
2. **Addition of HI to the vinyl group (CH\(_2\)=CH- → CH\(_2\)-CH\(_2\)I)**: This removes the double bond in the vinyl group, decreasing the IHD by 1.
3. **No change to the cyclohexene ring or the carboxylic acid group**: The ring remains intact (1 ring and 1 double bond → 2 IHD), and the carboxylic acid group retains its C=O double bond (1 IHD).

After the reaction, the IHD of the product is calculated as follows:

- Cyclohexene ring: 2 IHD (1 ring and 1 double bond).
- Formyl group: 0 IHD (reduced to CH\(_2\)).
- Vinyl group: 0 IHD (converted to CH\(_2\)-CH\(_2\)I).
- Carboxylic acid group: 1 IHD (C=O remains).

Thus, the total IHD of the product is:

\[
\text{IHD}_{\text{product}} = 2 + 1 = 3
\]

The correct answer is **B) 3**.

Answer: B
