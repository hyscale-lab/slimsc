Okay, so I have this physics problem about the potentials in an electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when a charge is moving, it generates both electric and magnetic fields, and these are related to the scalar and vector potentials, respectively.

The question gives me a point charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and there's this vector d from where the field was generated at time tr to the observation point r. The velocity at the time tr is v.

I need to find expressions for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at time t, where t is greater than tr. The options are A, B, C, D.

From what I recall, the scalar potential V for a charge is similar to Coulomb's law but adjusted for the retarded time. Oh right, because the fields take time to propagate. So the scalar potential would depend on the charge divided by (4πε₀) times the distance, but with the distance expressed in terms of the retarded time.

Wait, the distance d is the vector from the event where the field was generated (at tr) to the point r. So the magnitude of d is the distance the charge's field travels to reach r. But since the charge is moving, the distance isn't just |r| because the charge's position has changed between tr and t. So the denominator for V would involve (d c - d · v), or something like that. Because d is the vector from the source position at tr to r, so the displacement is d, and the charge moves with velocity v over the time (t - tr). So the denominator would be (d - v (t - tr)), but in terms of the speed of light, since the fields propagate at c.

Wait, the time it takes for the field to reach the point is (t - tr) = |d| / c. Because the field travels at speed c, so |d| = c (t - tr). So the denominator in the expression for V is d c - (d · v) (t - tr), but since (t - tr) = |d| / c, I can substitute that.

Wait, let me think. The expression for the scalar potential when a charge is moving is given by V = (q / (4πε₀)) * [1 / (r' - (v/c²) (t - t'))], but I might be getting the exact formula wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the scalar potential for a moving charge is given by V = (q / (4πε₀)) * [1 / (d - (v (t - tr)))] where d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r.

Wait, another approach: maybe the scalar potential is similar to the static case but adjusted by the motion. So V(r, t) = q / (4πε₀ r') where r' is the distance from the charge's position at tr to r, but considering the charge's velocity.

Wait, the general expression for the scalar potential for a moving charge is V(r, t) = [ q / (4πε₀) ] * [ 1 / ( |r - (s(t) - s(tr) )| ) ] but that's not considering the propagation delay.

Alternatively, the proper expression accounts for the
