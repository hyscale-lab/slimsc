Okay, so I have this chemistry question in front of me. It's about electrophilic substitution reactions, and I need to arrange some substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer they produce when reacted with excess bromine. Hmm, I remember that in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile to certain positions—either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. That probably depends on the substituent's directing effects. Substituents can be activating or deactivating, and they can direct ortho/para or meta.

Let me list out the substituents for each compound:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine adds, the para position should be a major product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ethoxycarbonyl group. Hmm, I think that's a strong deactivating group because of the electron-withdrawing ester. Wait, the ester is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's meta-directing. So the para isomer might not be the major product here.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is a substituent. Wait, chlorine is deactivating because of the electronegativity, but it's ortho/para-directing because the lone pairs can donate electrons through resonance (though it's a weak activating effect). So, the para product would be more than meta, perhaps?

4) C6H5-NO2: Nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. So the nitro group directs the incoming electrophile to the meta positions, meaning para is not the main product. But wait, maybe the para isomer isn't formed much here.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethyl group, similar to methyl. It's an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So para is a major product.

6) C6H5-COOH: Carboxylic acid group. I think that's a strong deactivating group (because the COOH is electron-withdrawing). So it's meta-directing. So para might not be a big product here.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the para-isomer's amount depends on the substituent's directing. The more a substituent directs to para, the higher the fraction of para product.

Wait, but all substituents may have different directing effects. Let me think about each substituent:

1) Methyl: para is major.

2) Ethoxycarbonyl (OOCR): I think this is deactivating (since ester is EWG). So meta directing. So para isomer would be a minor product.

3) Chlorine: Ortho/para. So para is a major.

4) Nitro: meta directing. So para isomer is minor.

5) Ethyl: like methyl, so para is major.

6) COOH: strong deactivating, so meta directing. So para is minor.

So, the substances can be categorized based on their substituents and the amount of para isomer produced.

Wait, but wait: for some substituents, even though they are meta-directing, the para product might not form at all? No, I don't think so. Because in a benzene ring, each substituent can lead to multiple substitution possibilities. For para directing groups, the para product is major, but for meta, perhaps the major product is meta, but there could still be some para.

Wait, but the question says, "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, wait, wait, no—the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Does that mean that the reaction gives a single product? That can't be right because typically, with para and ortho directing groups, you get mixtures. But the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed," so maybe the substituent is strongly activating with a high tendency to direct the substitution to one position.

Wait, but if the substituent is
