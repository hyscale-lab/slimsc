Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to find the minimum uncertainty in the energy of an electron. Hmm, the question says that the electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v of 2 times 10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. Right, I remember something about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle from my studies. Let me think.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that there's a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, can be known simultaneously. The formula I recall is Δx * Δp ≥ ℏ/2, where ℏ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, but sometimes it's written as ΔxΔp ≥ ħ/2. Yeah, I think that's right.

So in this problem, we're given Δx, and we need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, but how does that connect? I think I need to find the uncertainty in momentum first because the uncertainty in energy is related to the uncertainty in momentum.

Wait, the Uncertainty Principle relates position and momentum. So using Δx and the Uncertainty Principle, I can find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Once I have Δp, I can relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

But wait, the electron's speed is given. So maybe I can also calculate the momentum using the classical formula p = mv. But wait, the problem is about uncertainties, not exact values. So perhaps I should stick with the Uncertainty Principle approach.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Use the Uncertainty Principle to find Δp.
2. Then, relate Δp to ΔE using the kinetic energy formula. Because the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), so if Δp is known, ΔE would be proportional to (Δp)^2.

Wait, but how exactly do I get ΔE from Δp? Let's think. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be related to the uncertainty in p. But wait, since energy is a function of p, we can approximate using calculus. The uncertainty in E (ΔE) can
