Okay, so I've got this question about cosmology and redshift, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen, right?

The wavelength given is about 1216 Angstroms. Wait, but wait—when it's in the rest frame of the hydrogen, I think the Lyman alpha emission is at 121.6 nm, which is 1216 Angstroms because 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. Oh wait no, wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Hmm, okay.

So the question is about detecting these clouds using optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes operate in the visible spectrum, roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But wait, deep space observations might go a bit beyond that, maybe up to around 1000 nm or so? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the visible range is up to about 700-1000 nm.

Now, the clouds of hydrogen are absorbing light at Lyman alpha, which in their rest frame is 1216 Angstroms. But when we observe it, the wavelength would be stretched due to redshift. So the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ_rest * (1
