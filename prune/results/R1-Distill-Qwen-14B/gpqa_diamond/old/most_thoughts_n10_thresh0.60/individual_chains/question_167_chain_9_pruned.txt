Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. 

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which they've provided as sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). 

The non-Gaussianity is measured using del_b, which is the relative entropy between the state's density matrix rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. The formula is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). 

The specific parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I'm to calculate the nG (non-Gaussianity) and choose the correct option from A to D.

Wait, what do I remember about Gaussian states? Oh right, Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. Non-Gaussian states have non-Gaussian Wigner functions, like the Schrödinger cat state, which is a superposition of two coherent states. So the state given is a non-Gaussian state, and we're comparing it to a Gaussian state tau.

But wait, the relative entropy is a measure of how non-Gaussian the state is. So del_b is the difference between the entropy of rho and tau. Since Gaussian states have certain entropy properties, perhaps this measure tells us how much rho differs from a Gaussian state in terms of entropy.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I'm a bit stuck on the steps. Let me outline what I need to do:

1. Compute the density matrix rho for the given |psi>.
2. Compute the density matrix tau of a reference Gaussian state. But wait, which Gaussian state? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps it's a coherent state with the same parameters or something else. Or maybe it's the maximum entropy Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because in some measures, the reference Gaussian state is chosen to match the first and second moments, like the moments of rho.

Alternatively, the reference state could be a coherent state |alpha>, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's the state with the same first and second moments as rho but Gaussian. I think in the context
