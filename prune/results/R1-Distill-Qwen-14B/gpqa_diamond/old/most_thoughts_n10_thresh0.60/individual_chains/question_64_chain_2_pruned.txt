Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

So, we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are then passed through some tubes.

First, the gases go through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (Tube №1). The weight of this tube increases by 3.60 grams. Then, the gases go to Ca(OH)2 solution in Tube №2, but there's no change in weight. Next, they pass through red-hot copper (Tube №3), and the weight increases by 0.80 grams, with CuO formed. Finally, only 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm, okay. Let's think about what each part of this setup means.

The first tube, Mg(ClO4)2, is a drying agent. But wait, wait—Mg(ClO4)2 is actually a deliquescent salt. It absorbs water from the air. But here, the tube is anhydrous, so when the gases pass through, any moisture in the gas would be absorbed, causing the tube to gain mass. So if the tube's weight increased, that suggests that the gas carried water vapor.

Wait, but wait—no. Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture. So if the gas has water vapor, it would be captured by the Mg(ClO4)2, increasing the tube's weight. So the gas after this tube would lose the water vapor.

But the weight increased by 3.60 grams. So that's the mass of water absorbed, I think. Because Mg(ClO4)·xH2O would form, but the change in mass is due to the water. So 3.60 grams of H2O were present in the gas.

Then the gas goes into Ca(OH)2 solution. But since the weight didn't change, it implies that no gas reacted with the solution. Wait, but Ca(OH)2 is a strong base. If the gas had CO2, for example, it would react and form CaCO3, releasing water. But if the weight didn't change, that suggests that no CO2 was present. Because if CO2 was present, it would have reacted, and the solution's mass would increase.

Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't have any acidic gases like CO2 or HCl. So the only gas that passed through the second tube and didn't react is probably a neutral gas, like NH3 maybe? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: the presence of NH3 could cause the solution to gain mass. But wait, if NH3 is present, it would react with Ca(OH)2. Wait, no, Ca(OH)2 is a base, and NH3 is a base too. They wouldn't react. Or maybe if NH3 is in the gas, it would dissolve in water to form NH4OH, but if it's in a solution of Ca(OH)2, perhaps no reaction occurs. Alternatively, maybe
