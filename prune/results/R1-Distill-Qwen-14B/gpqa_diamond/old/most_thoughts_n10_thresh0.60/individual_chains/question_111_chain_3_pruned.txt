Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I'll tackle them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. So this sounds like a Claisen or perhaps an aldol addition? Wait, no, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So maybe it's a Michael addition or some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, but the starting material is a ketone. So maybe it's a Michael addition between the ketone and the acrylate. But wait, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexanone has substituents at positions 2 and 6 as ethyl and methyl, respectively. Wait, no, the numbering: 2-ethyl and 6-dimethyl? Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So position 1 is the ketone, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl substituent (since 2,6-dimethyl: so position 2 has a methyl and position 6 has a methyl as well? Or wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl. So position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl? Because 2-ethyl would be one substituent, and 2,6-dimethyl would have methyl groups at 2 and 6. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the formula is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. At position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group. And at position 6, a methyl group. So positions 2 and 6 each have a methyl, and position 2 also has an ethyl. So the structure is a bit crowded at position 2.

So when this reacts with ethyl acrylate (
