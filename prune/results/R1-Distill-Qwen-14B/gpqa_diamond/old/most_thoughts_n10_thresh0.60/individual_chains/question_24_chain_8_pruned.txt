Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question talks about two mixtures, X and Y, and a substance Z. Let me see what each part means.

So, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water usually indicates the presence of alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated compounds. Because alkenes can undergo addition reactions with bromine, causing the decolorization. But wait, the question also says that mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds. So maybe X contains something like isolated alkenes, not conjugated ones.

Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids that don't decolorize bromine water. Oh, so Y doesn't have any unsaturated bonds anymore? Because if they don't react with bromine, they probably don't have double bonds. So maybe X is a diene or something that, upon some reaction, becomes alkanes or something else.

Wait, the reaction uses platinum as a catalyst, and heating is involved. Oh, that's hydrogenation conditions. So, X, which has double bonds, is hydrogenated to form Y. But wait, the question says that Y is formed via a disproportionation reaction. Hmm, that's interesting. Disproportionation implies that one element is both oxidized and reduced. So maybe one component in X is being hydrogenated, and another is undergoing some other process.

Wait, but if X is a diene, hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bonds, turning them into single bonds. So if X is a mixture of two alkenes, maybe each with different structures, then Y would be the corresponding alkanes. But why would that be a disproportionation reaction?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. So mixture X is treated with H2 and Pt, heated, leading to Y. But Y is a result of a disproportionation. Hmm, perhaps the reaction isn't simple hydrogenation but a more complex one. Oh, wait, maybe one of the components of X is something that can undergo both addition and another reaction, like a peroxide or something. Or maybe it's a diene that can do something else besides
