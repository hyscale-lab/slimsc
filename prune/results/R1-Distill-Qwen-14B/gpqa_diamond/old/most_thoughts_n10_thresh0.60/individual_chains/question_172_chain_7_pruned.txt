Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 have twice as many excited atoms in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, no, wait, it says the atoms are twice as excited. Wait, does that mean the number of excited atoms is twice, or the excitation energy is twice? No, the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh right, that's the delta E.

In LTE (local thermal equilibrium), the distribution of particles in energy levels is given by the Boltzmann distribution. So the population ratio between two energy levels is inversely proportional to the Boltzmann factor. 

The formula I remember is (n_upper)/(n_lower) = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-Î”E/(k*T)), where g's are the statistical weights. But wait, in this case, since the two stars are being compared, maybe I can set up a ratio between them.

So, for star_1, the excitation level is twice that of star_2. Let me think, the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2. Or wait, the problem says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited". So maybe the excitation level per atom is twice as much? Or perhaps the ratio of the populations is 2:1.

Wait, perhaps the number of atoms
