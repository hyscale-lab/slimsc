Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its NMR data and predicting its product after a series of reactions. Hmm, a bit tricky, but I'll give it a go.

First, let's look at the molecular formula given: C8H9NO. Wait, so that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Hmm, what kind of compounds fit that? Maybe amines? Or something with an aromatic ring and a substituent. Oh, wait, the NMR data might help. Let me check that.

The 1H NMR data is as follows:
- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, okay. So the triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm as singlets or triplets if coupled with adjacent protons. Wait, but here it's a triplet. Oh, maybe it's adjacent to a CH2 group. Or perhaps it's a conjugated aldehyde.

Looking next, there are two doublets around 6.98 and 6.51. These are in the aromatic region, so probably part of a benzene ring. Let's think about coupling between aromatic protons. 6.98 is a doublet, so maybe it's a para-substituted ring with two substituents? Wait, but the two protons are in a doublet. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta-substituted ring? But wait, the integration is 2H each, so perhaps two equivalent protons each from two different aromatic groups.

Wait, the 6.27 ppm is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. Broad signals are often from exchangeable protons, like those adjacent to an electronegative atom, or maybe OH groups. But wait, 2H as a singlet. Maybe it's another set of aromatic protons, but not in a very symmetrical position.
