Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about gravitational interactions or anything like that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, and the answer should be in Joules, correct to three decimals.

Hmm. So I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system of point charges is given by the formula involving Coulomb's law. The potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But wait, when there are multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. Since all the charges are identical, this should simplify things.

Wait, but since the system is isolated, and we're dealing with potential energy, which is a state function, the minimum energy would be the configuration where the system is as stable as possible. I think for charges, the potential energy would be minimized when the charges are as close as possible, but in this case, 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P. The 13th is fixed at P. So I guess each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th.

But wait, what about the potential energy between each of the 12 charges and the 13th? And also, do the 12 charges interact with each other? Because if they're all at the same point, their mutual repulsion would require energy, but since they're constrained, maybe their positions are fixed relative to each other. Oh wait, the question says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So each of the 12 is at a distance of 2m from P, which is where the 13th charge is.

But wait, what's the arrangement of the 12 charges? Are they all at the same point (which would be impossible because they're identical charges and would repel each other), or are they arranged in a sphere around P? Probably, the problem is
