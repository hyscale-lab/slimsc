Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me go through it step by step.

The question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions. The reaction scheme involves several steps, and there are some hints given. I'll need to break down each step and see how the compounds transform.

First, let me outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

Let me start by analyzing the IR data. A strong peak at 1750 cm^-1 likely indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). E's peak at 1715 cm^-1 is also a carbonyl, but maybe a ketone because that's around where ketones absorb. Wait, wait, aldehydes have higher wavenumbers, so 1715 is more in the range for a ketone. So A might be an ester or a ketone, but since after reactions, E is a ketone (since the options are all ketones), perhaps A is a carbonyl-containing compound that becomes a ketone later.

Looking at the reaction steps:

Step 1: A + HCN â†’ B. This is a nucleophilic addition maybe. Like if A is a ketone, HCN might add to it. But wait, wait, HCN typically adds to ketones in a nucleophilic addition, forming a cyanohydrin. So if A is a ketone, then B would have an -OH and a -CN group adjacent.

Wait, but then step 2 is a reduction of B with H2 and Pd. H2 and Pd sounds like hydrogenation. So maybe B has a triple bond or a double bond that gets hydrogenated. Wait, but B is the product of A and HCN. If A is a ketone, adding HCN would give a cyanohydrin. But then in the next step, B is reduced. Let's think: what functional groups would B have? If A is a cycloketone, adding HCN would form a secondary alcohol and a nitrile? Or perhaps a primary alcohol?

Alternatively, maybe A is an ester. HCN could add to esters, but I'm not too sure about that. Or perhaps A is a ketone, and the HCN adds to form a cyanohydrin. Then, B would have an alcohol and a cyano group. But when B is hydrogenated, maybe the nitrile group is reduced. Wait, nitriles (CN) are reduced to amines (CH2NH2?), but under hydrogenation with Pd, maybe it becomes CH2
