Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. Hmm, I remember that p orbitals have angular momentum quantum number l=1. So each electron has l1=1 and l2=1. The problem says to ignore their spin angular momentum, so we're only dealing with the orbital part here.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, I thought that when combining angular momenta, the total l is the sum l1 + l2, but that's maximum. Oh right, when you couple two angular momenta, l can range from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2, in integer steps. So l1=1, l2=1, so possible l's are 0,1,2. So the state here is l=2, which is the maximum. So the state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z. We need the joint probability of both measurements giving -침. So each Lz should be -침 for each electron.

Wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum quantum number is l=1. So for each, Lz can be -침, 0, or +침. Because m can be -1, 0, +1 when l=1.

But the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. So m is the total m, which is m1 + m2. In this case, m=-1, so m1 + m2 = -1.

Wait, the state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, so m is -1. So the total magnetic quantum number is -1. But we're measuring each individual m1 and m2.

So, what's the possible way m1 and m2 can add up to -1? Let's list the possibilities:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Same for m2.

m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible combinations:

(-1,0): (-1) + 0 = -1.

(0,-1): 0 + (-1) =-1.

Wait, are there any others? What about (1, -2
