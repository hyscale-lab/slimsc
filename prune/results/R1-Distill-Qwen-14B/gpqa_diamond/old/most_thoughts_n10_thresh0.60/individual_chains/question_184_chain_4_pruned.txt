Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about determining the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of steps, and I need to figure out which one is the right order.

Hmm, let's break down the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The numbering is such that the tert-butyl is at position 2, ethoxy at 1, and nitro at 3. Wait, actually, wait. Wait, benzene rings are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So the positions are 1, 2, 3. Let me visualize the structure: the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. So, 1 is ethoxy, 2 is tert-butyl, 3 is nitro.

Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so the numbering might not be as straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are arranged in a meta fashion. But I think the key here is figuring out the order of the directing groups and the possible reactions.

So, starting with benzene, we'll need to introduce substituents. The nitro group is a meta-directing group. The tert-butyl is a bulky group and a strong activating group (since it's an alkyl group). But wait, actually, t-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl, so it's ortho/para directing. The ethoxy group is also activating and ortho/para directing.

Wait, but the nitro group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. So when nitrating, the position matters based on the existing substituents.

But wait, let's think about the synthesis steps. The target has three substituents. So we need to add them in an order that allows for proper directing.

Let me think. One method is to introduce the groups in a way that each new substituent is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones. Nitration is a common reaction, but it's often harder to control when multiple substituents are present.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a
