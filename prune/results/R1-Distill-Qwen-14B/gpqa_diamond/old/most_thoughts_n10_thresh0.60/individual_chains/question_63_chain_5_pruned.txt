Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules can be modeled as a rigid rotor and a harmonic oscillator. But wait, the question says it's using the non-rigid rotor model, so maybe that's a bit different. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Let me think about what that means.

First, I think the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state. When a photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next higher energy state. But what's the next state? For a diatomic molecule modeled as a rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized.

Wait, the problem is about the rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. Oh right, the quantum mechanical model for diatomic molecules combines both rotational and vibrational energies.

The molecule is currently in the fundamental state, which I think is the first vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (probably J=0 or J=1, depending on if it's a rigid rotor). Wait, no, for diatomic molecules, the ground state is usually the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). But when you consider the rotation-vibration model, the energy transitions can be a combination of these.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy.
