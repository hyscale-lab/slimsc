Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology techniques, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question involves creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. The setup is that they introduced a coding sequence with a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They used Lipofectamine to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed as expected.

The problem is they're looking for why the overexpression isn't happening. The possible options are A to D.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, it's the plus strand. Let's try to figure out if there's something wrong with it.

First, I remember that the DNA is read in the 5' to 3' direction, and the mRNA is complementary to the DNA. The coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. So let's see if the sequence starts with ATG.

Looking at the beginning: 5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the first part is ATG TAC CCATACGATGTT... Wait, the start codon is ATG, which is correct. Then the next codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. But the HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the HA sequence must be right after the start codon.

Wait, the HA tag (hemagglutinin) is a specific sequence. The HA tag is usually from the influenza virus and is about 11 amino acids long. The coding sequence for HA is after the start codon. Let me think, the HA tag's DNA sequence is something like ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT... Wait, the provided sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT...

Hmm, wait a second. The HA tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus, so the first part of the coding sequence should be the HA sequence. The HA tag's DNA sequence is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GGT TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTC CGC GGC CAG GAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC A... (I think the HA tag is about this long). So the sequence provided starts with that.

But wait, the question is about why the protein isn't overexpressed. Maybe there
