Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is to identify a compound given its IR and 1H NMR data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. X (halogens) is zero. Plugging in the numbers: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2=9/2=4.5. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. So: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2=9/2=4.5. Hmm, that's a fractional degree. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. Wait, formula is C9H11NO2. 

Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So:

DoU = (2*9 +2 - 11 - 0 +1)/2 = (20-11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. Oh right, okay, that makes more sense. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. Each degree can be a ring or a double bond. So perhaps a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU, since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds), plus maybe an ester group (which has a carbonyl, so another DoU), and perhaps an amide or something else.

Now looking at the IR data. The IR shows strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are likely N-H stretches. Strong N-H would suggest either an amide or an amine. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. Esters typically show around 1720-1740 cm-1, while amides are a bit lower, maybe around 1680-1700. The 1720 suggests it might be an ester.

Wait, but the other possibility is a conjugated carbonyl, like in an aromatic system. So maybe it's an ester group attached to a benzene ring.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. So the peaks are at:

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's a typical ethyl group, probably connected to an oxygen, like an ethoxy group. The triplet for the CH2CH3. So maybe like OCH2CH3.

Then, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. That could be an NH2 group, but it's a broad signal. Wait, but the IR had two N-H stretches, which might be from an amide (which has two N-Hs in the case of a secondary amide). Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group or something else. Wait, 4.0 ppm is a bit downfield for CH2. Broad singlet could be an NH group. But wait, in the 1H NMR, if it's a singlet with 2H, maybe it's a methylene adjacent to an electronegative atom, like an oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's an N-linked group.

Then, 4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with a triplet (so maybe neighboring a CH2 group). So perhaps this is an oxygen-linked CH2, such as OCH
