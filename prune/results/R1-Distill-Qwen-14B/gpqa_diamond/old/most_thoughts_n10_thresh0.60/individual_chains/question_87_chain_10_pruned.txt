Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to identify the correct 1H NMR data from the options given.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. A 6-membered aromatic ring is like benzene, right? Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. And the total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, no, the total is 8, so including the ring. So the substituents should have 2 carbons in total.

Wait, substituents on benzene are typically like -X, -OCH3, etc., but if each substituent is more complicated, maybe they have carbons. Let me think. If the ring has 6 carbons, and the substituents add up to 2, then each substituent could be one carbon each, like two methyl groups, but that would be two substituents each with one carbon. Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has none? No, it's di-substituted, so two substituents.

Wait, but wait another thought. The ring is 6 carbons. The substituents: each substituent is a group attached to the ring. So the substituent groups' carbons count towards the total. So the substituents contribute 2 carbons, making the total 6 + 2 =8.

So the substituents are either two groups each with one carbon (like two methyl groups), or maybe one substituent with two carbons and the other with none. But it's di-substituted, so two substituents, each with one carbon? Or one substituent with two and the other with one, but that would make 3, so 6+3=9, which is more than 8. So probably, the substituents are two groups each with one carbon. But wait, that would be 6 + 2 =8. So each substituent has one carbon.

But wait, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group. Because the IR shows a carbonyl. Oh right, the FTIR has a peak for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the substituents are possibly a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but if each substituent is one carbon, then one substituent could be a carbonyl, like a ketone or aldehyde or something, but that might require more carbons. Alternatively, maybe one substituent is a halogen (Cl, Br) which is one atom, no carbons, and the other substituent is a carbonyl group attached with one carbon, like an acyl group. Hmm.

Wait, the IR has a carbonyl, so there's a C=O group. And a halogen in the aromatic ring, so an -X group attached (like Cl, Br, etc.) So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen. But wait, that would mean each substituent is a single atom (like Cl) and a carbonyl group. But wait, a carbonyl group is O=C-R, where R could be another group. So the substituent would be like an acyl group, maybe.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl and a halogen. So the ring is substituted with a -CO- group? Let me think about the possible structures.

Wait, but a di-substituted benzene with a halogen and a carbonyl group. So, the ring has two substituents: one is O=C-something and the other is a halogen.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. So the benzene has 6, so the substituents add 2 carbons. So one substituent might be a Cl (0 carbons), and the other substituent is a carbonyl group
