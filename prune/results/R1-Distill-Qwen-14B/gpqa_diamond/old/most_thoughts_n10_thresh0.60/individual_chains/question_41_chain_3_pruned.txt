Okay, so I have this physics problem here about light moving through glass when the glass itself is moving. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when objects move, it affects how light behaves. I think it's related to the Doppler effect or maybe something with relative motion in physics.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. Oh wait, the speed of light in a vacuum is taken as 1 here, so c=1.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. The speed of light in a medium is generally c/n, right? So in this glass, the speed should be 1/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the glass. But the glass is moving. Does that affect the observed speed?

Hmm, I think this might have to do with the addition of velocities in special relativity. Because if the glass is moving and the light is moving with it, the observer's frame would see the light's speed differently.

Wait, no, the problem says the glass is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. Wait, same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So the beam is going in the direction the glass is moving, but the glass is moving towards the observer. So the beam is moving towards the observer as well? Or is the beam moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, which is towards the observer?

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the setup. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and towards the observer. So the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's velocity, which is towards the observer. Wait, that doesn't make much sense. If the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is in the same direction (towards the observer), then the beam is moving towards the observer as well. But if the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer, that doesn't change much. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam's propagation. So the beam is moving through the glass, which is itself moving in the same direction, towards the observer. So the beam's speed in the
