Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I need to figure out what compound X is. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given. I need to find out what X is from the options provided.

Hmm, wait. Oh right! 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the formation of epoxides. It's a catalyst in the epoxidation of alkenes, especially using peracids. So I think the reaction here is probably epoxidation of a double bond in compound X. So the product would be an epoxide.

Looking at the options, all of them end with "oxirane" which is another name for an epoxide. So the product is an epoxide. But the question is about the starting material, compound X, before epoxidation. So X must be an alkene, and the product is its epoxide.

Wait, no. Wait, the reaction is between compound X and the diazabicyclooctane. Oh wait, no, wait. The problem says Compound X was subjected to a reaction with that reagent. Oh, wait no, I'm a bit confused. Epoxidation is typically done with a peracid and a catalyst. Alternatively, sometimes other methods like using an electrophilic reagent. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a base, often used in epoxide ring-opening reactions. Or is it used in forming epoxides?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. I think the reagent is actually used in the formation of epoxides. For example, in the Prilezhaev oxidation, which converts alkenes to epoxides using a peracid and a base. Oh wait, no, Prilezhaev is more for ketones. Alternatively, the Sharpless epoxidation uses different conditions. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the reagent itself isn't the oxidizing agent. Oh, wait, the reaction setup: the reagent is 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K. 403 K is around 130Â°C, which is pretty hot. So perhaps the solvent is something like dichloromethane or another nonpolar solvent, and maybe the reagent is part of a peracid system? Or perhaps it's a base used in a different epoxidation method.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is an acid-catalyzed ring-opening of an epoxide, but that doesn't seem to fit here because the product's NMR shows an epoxide. Wait, no. Wait, the product's NMR is of the resulting compound after reaction. So if X is an alkene, and it's reacted with something to form an epoxide, then the product is an epoxide, and X is the starting alkene.

Wait, but wait, the options are all epoxides. So that can't be right. Wait, the options are all oxirane derivatives
