Okay, so I've got this problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the question is about finding the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The energy for each particle in a 1D infinite well is given by the formula E_n = (n² * pi² * ħ²) / (2mL²), and they've defined E as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So each n² multiplied by E gives the energy for that state.

But wait, the particles are spin-1/2, which means they're fermions, right? So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means each quantum state can hold only two particles, one with spin up and one with spin down. So each energy level can have a maximum of two particles.

Now, the system is four particles. So I need to figure out how their states are filled based on the Pauli exclusion.

In a one-dimensional well, the quantum numbers are n=1,2,3,... Each level n can hold 2 particles (because spin up and down). So let's think about how the particles fill up the lowest energy states.

The ground state is the lowest energy state. Since each level can hold two, for four particles, the first two will go into n=1, and the next two into n=2.

Wait, no. Wait, each n level can hold 2 particles since they have two different spins. So for four particles, two in n=1 and two in n=2. But wait, no. Because each level can hold only two different particles. So for the first two, n=1, spin up and down. Then the next two go into n=2, spin up and down. So the total energy for the ground state would be the sum of four particles: two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait, each particle is in a different state. So the ground state would have the lowest possible n's filled up as much as possible, considering the spin.

So let's model it. Each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, but in a 1D well, the quantum number is just n, and spin. So for each n, you can have two particles: one with spin up, one with spin down.

So the four particles would fill the lowest two levels
