Okay, so I have this physics problem about nuclear fission and the kinetic energy of the fragments. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments, and nothing else. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. 

Wait, let me jot down the given data:

- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV. So the rest energy E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission:
- Two fragments, let's call their rest masses m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2.
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Wait wait, M is the initial mass. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. But M = m_initial, which is the initial rest mass. Hmm, but the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So the rest energy after fission would be (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 * M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, the total energy before fission is 300 GeV. After, the rest mass energy is 297 GeV, so the energy released must be 3 GeV, which goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments and possibly binding energy, but the problem says "nothing else", so I think we can assume all the rest is KE.

Wait, but the problem says the sum of rest masses is 99% of the initial mass. So initial mass M is such that M c² = 300 GeV. So yes, m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

Since m1 is twice m2, m1 = 2 m2, so 2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = 0.33 M, m1 = 0.66 M.

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass. So the rest energy of the two fragments is 0.99 M c² = 297 GeV, as I said before.

So the initial energy is 300 GeV, and after the fission, the rest energy is 297 GeV, so the total kinetic energy (K) of the two fragments should be 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. So K_total = 3 GeV.

Now, the two fragments fly apart. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum must be zero in the center-of-momentum frame. So the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momentum vectors. So, their velocities are such that their momenta cancel out. 

Wait, but in the frame of the original nucleus, which is at rest, which is the same as the center-of-momentum
