Okay, so I have this NMR question in front of me, and I need to figure out which compound it corresponds to. The options are four different propenyl and butenyl acetates, both cis and trans. Hmm, I remember that the NMR can give me information about the structure, especially the coupling patterns and the integration of the signals.

Let me look at the data again. The 1H NMR shows four signals. The first is at 7.0 ppm, a doublet with J=16.0 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. I think that's indicative of a trans coupling in an alkene, maybe. The second is at 5.5 ppm, a doublet of quadruplets? Wait, no, the description says 'dq'. I'm not sure what that stands for. Maybe doublet of quartets? Or perhaps it's a typo and it's a doublet that's also split into a quartet? Alternatively, maybe it's a doublet of doublets. Hmm. Then there's a singlet at 2.1 ppm integrating to 3H, which is probably an acetate group's methyl. And a double at 1.6 ppm, integrating to 3H, which is likely a CH3 group attached to something else, maybe a CH2 group.

Wait, acetates have the structure OAc-O-R, right? So the R group is an alkyl or alkenyl group. Let's think about the possible structures.

The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, and whether they're cis or trans.

Let me recall the structures. For propenyl acetate, the R group is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait. Propenyl would be CH2CHCH2 or something like that. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or wait, no, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify: propenyl would be CH2=CHCH2-, but that's allyl. Wait, no, perhaps propenyl is CH2CH2CH3 but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the structure.

Wait, acetate esters. So the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Acetate is OAc-O
