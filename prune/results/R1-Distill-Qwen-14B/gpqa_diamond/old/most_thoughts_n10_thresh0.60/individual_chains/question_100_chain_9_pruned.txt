Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, I remember that C3H6 is propene. Right, because the formula for propene is C3H6—alkene with one double bond.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Oh wait, that's a typical bromination of an alkene. So propene (A) reacts with bromine (Br2) in CCl4. That should form 1,2-dibromopropane, which is compound B. Because when an alkene reacts with bromine, it adds across the double bond, adding two Br atoms—so for propene, that would be BrCH2CHBrCH3? No, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would lead to the dibromide. Let me think: adding Br across the double bond would give CH2Br-CHBr-CH3, which is 1,2-dibromopropane. So B is that.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So B is a vicinal dihalide (two adjacent Br atoms). When a vicinal dihalide reacts with alcoholic KOH, it undergoes an E2 elimination, forming an alkene. So the reaction should form propene again? Wait, because B is 1,2-dibromopropane, so when it eliminates, it would lose HBr twice, forming CH2=CHCH3, which is propene. So compound C is propene again? That seems a bit circular, but okay.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's a different elimination. Let me think again. Vicinal dihalide with KOH in alcohol: it's dehydrohalogenation, which gives an alkene. So yes, the product should be propene. So C is propene.

Then, when C is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it produces compound D. Red-hot iron is usually used in catalytic reactions. Oh, like the catalytic cracking or perhaps dehydrogenation? Wait, propene (C) is CH2=CHCH3. Passing it through a red-hot iron tube—does that cause dehydrogenation? Like forming an alkene with
