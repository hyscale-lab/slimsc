Okay, I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read through the question again and think about each part step by step.

The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products from each. Then, I'll match them with the options provided.

First, reaction A: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, often used in Grignard reactions. KH is potassium hydride, a strong base, but wait, in this context, what does it do?

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a deprotonation followed by something else. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, I've heard that when an alcohol is treated with a strong base like KH, it can form an alkoxide. But then, the presence of H+ at the end—could this be a workup step?

The starting material is a spiro compound. Spiro compounds have two rings joined by a single atom, which in this case is the spiro alcohol. The structure of 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol suggests a spiro system where one ring is a 5-membered and the other a 7-membered? Or wait, no: the [3.5] indicates the two bridge lengths, so the non part is 9 carbons, but in a spiro arrangement, it's split into 3 and 5. So, the molecule has a bridgehead with a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) attached.

So, when you have an alcohol treated with a strong base like KH, it can deprotonate to form an alkoxide. But then, the H+ is added later. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a more specific reaction. I remember something about Cope rearrangement or Claisen rearrangement, but those are usually for enol ethers or similar structures. Alternatively, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed cyclization?

Wait, another approach: The starting material is a spiro alcohol with a double bond. Perhaps the reaction is a pinacol-like rearrangement? Or perhaps it's an elimination followed by a cyclization. Or, since there's a strong base, maybe an E2 elimination is happening, but then what cyclizes?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the reaction conditions. THF is a polar aprotic solvent. KH is a strong base, so it's likely deprotonating something. The starting alcohol is a spiro compound with an enol group. When an alcohol is treated with a strong base, maybe it deprotonates to form an enolate. But in this case, the structure is a spiro, so maybe the enolate can undergo a ring-opening or a cyclization.

Wait a second, I think this is a case of a Claisen rearrangement. The Claisen rearrangement involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging to gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But wait, what's the structure here?

The starting compound is a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group. So, maybe under basic conditions, the hydroxyl group is deprotonated, forming an alkoxide. Then, perhaps the vinyl group and the adjacent structure can form some kind of conjugated base
