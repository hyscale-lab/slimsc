Okay, so I've got this question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology. It's a multiple-choice question, and I need to find the incorrect statement. Hmm, let's think through each option step by step.

The question says all statements are correct except one. So I need to find the incorrect one. Let's go option by option.

Option A: SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 binds to nsp10, making an active exonuclease complex that prevents dsRNA breakdown. Wait, I remember that SARS-CoV-2 has some exonuclease activity. The nsp10 and nsp14 proteins form a heterodimer, right? Nsp14 has an exonuclease domain. Oh wait, but wait. I think the ExoN domain is involved in proofreading, but I'm a bit fuzzy. Also, the statement says it prevents breakdown of dsRNA. Oh wait, no, exonucleases would break down RNA, not prevent it. Or maybe the complex is involved in RNA repair? Or perhaps it's a correction mechanism. I'm a bit confused. I'll need to come back to this.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8 activation, doesn't affect Bcl-2. Caspase-8 is part of the extrinsic pathway, Bcl-2 is intrinsic (mitochondrial). So the statement says ORF3a uses extrinsic pathway. I've read that SARS-CoV-2 can induce apoptosis. Caspase-8 activation is indeed extrinsic. But does ORF3a affect Bcl-2 levels? I'm not sure. Some studies suggest that ORF3a might disrupt mitochondrial function, possibly affecting Bcl-2, but if this option says it doesn't affect Bcl-2, then the mechanism would be extrinsic. Alternatively, maybe ORF3a does both, but this option is saying it doesn't affect Bcl-2, which would make the apoptosis via extrinsic. I'm not certain, but I'll hold onto this thought.

Option C: Frameshifting rate is linear with conformation numbers. Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
