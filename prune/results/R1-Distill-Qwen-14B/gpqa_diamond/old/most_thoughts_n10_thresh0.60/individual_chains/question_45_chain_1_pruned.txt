Okay, so I have this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says the well has a length L, and the particles are spin-1/2, which I think means electrons or something similar. The question is about finding the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies of the system. And the options are given in terms of E, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²). I remember that E is the ground state energy for a single particle in such a well, right?

So each particle's energy levels in the well are quantized and given by E_n = (n²)E, where n is the principal quantum number. But wait, since these are fermions (spin-1/2), they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle has to have a unique set of quantum numbers, but in a 1D box, the quantum state is mainly determined by the principal quantum number n. But wait, spin is also a factor. Since they are spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So in a 1D box, the quantum numbers for each particle would be (n, s), where s is ±1/2. So each n can hold two particles with opposite spins.

Hmm, so for four particles, I need to fill the lowest energy levels, each with up to two particles. Let me think about the possible states.

The ground state would be the lowest possible energies filled with the particles. So each energy level can hold two particles. Let's list the possible n's and their energies:

n=1 → E_1 = 1²E = E
n=2 → E_2 = 4E
n=3 → E_3 = 9E
n=4 → E_4 = 16E
Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, no. E is the base energy. So the first level is E_1 = 1²E = E. But wait, in the options, the energies are 4E, 10E, etc. So maybe each E in the options is different. Wait, no, the problem says E = (pi²ħ²)/(2mL²), so E is the ground state energy of one particle. So each particle in n=
