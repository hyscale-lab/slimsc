Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Alright, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are typically represented as column vectors with complex numbers, right? Hmm, maybe these numbers are just real for simplicity here.

The operators for P and Q are given as square matrices. Let me write them out. 

Operator P's matrix looks like this:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Operator Q's matrix is:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

The question is asking for the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q, but it specifies that Q is measured after P. Wait, no, the phrasing is a bit different. "If someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?" So the order is: first measure P, then measure Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and then -1 for Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable,
