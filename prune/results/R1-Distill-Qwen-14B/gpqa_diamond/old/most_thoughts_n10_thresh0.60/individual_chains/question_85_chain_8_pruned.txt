Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me read through it again to make sure I get all the details.

So, there's a star with 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Two planets are orbiting it. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and radius 1.3 Earth. Both orbits are circular.

They detected the planets using transit and radial velocity methods. The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are A to D.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. Oh, because the star's flux decreases with the square of the distance, and planets reflect some of it based on albedo.

But wait, the albedos are the same for both planets, so that part cancels out, right? So the ratio should not depend on albedo.

So the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt(a2 / a1 ), because R_star cancels out, and 2 is in both denominators.

Wait, let me get the exact formula straight. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

T_planet = T_star * ( (R
