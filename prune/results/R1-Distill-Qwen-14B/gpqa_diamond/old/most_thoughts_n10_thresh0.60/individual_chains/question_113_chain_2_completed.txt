Okay, so I have this problem here about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best to think it through.

First, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the options given: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O.

Let's look at each piece of data one by one and see what they tell me.

Starting with the FTIR spectrum. The very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1 usually indicates O-H stretching. Broad peaks in that region are typical for alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. But wait, another strong peak at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Hmm. Let me think about what those could be. 1700 is a strong absorption—I remember that's around where carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) show up. The 1650 peak is a bit lower. Could that be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe something like an ester or an amide? Or perhaps it's a C=C (olefinic) stretch. Wait, but conjugated carbonyls are lower than 1700. Or maybe that's an aromatic ring with some sort of substituent.

Then the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that suggests there's a double bond in the compound. So I'm thinking maybe the compound has an alkene group and a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the Mass Spectrometry data. The fragment peak at m/z 45. What's that? I remember that m/z 45 is a common fragment for an aldehyde group. Because the aldehyde (CHO) has a molecular weight of 30 (12+1+16), but wait, 45 doesn't quite fit. Oh wait, maybe it's the tropylium ion or something else. Alternatively, 45 could be a fragment from an ester or another functional group. Let me think: 45 is the molecular weight of (CH3)2C=O, which is 45 (because 2*12 + 6 + 16 = 30? Wait, no. Let me calculate: (CH3)2C=O is acetone. Acetone's molecular weight is (12*3) + (6*1) +16 = 36 +16 =52. No, that's not right. Hmm. Another approach: common fragments. A fragment of 45 could be from a ketone or an ester. Wait, maybe a CH2CH2O group? No, not sure. Wait, perhaps the m/z 45 is C3H7O? That would be 3*12 +7*1 +16 =36+7+16=59. No, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2O group, which is formaldehyde. But formaldehyde's molecular weight is 30. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ethylene oxide group (but that's 44). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Another thought: in mass spec, the base peak for ethyl groups or something else. Alternatively, a fragment like CH2CH2O- might not be right. Maybe it's a loss of something? Wait, perhaps 45 is the molecular ion of a smaller molecule. Like maybe the compound lost a larger fragment, leaving a smaller one. Let me think about possible molecular formulas.

The options are:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

So each has a different number of carbons, hydrogens, and oxygens.

I'll try to think about each possible formula and see which one fits the data.

First, the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests O-H, so the compound has an -OH group. So the formula must have at least one O. Looking at the options, all except B and D have at least two oxygens. Wait no: option B is C6H10O, so one O. Option D is C6H12O, one O. So that would mean either an alcohol or maybe a carbonyl with a hydroxyl group.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which are in an alkene. So the compound has a double bond. Let's think about functional groups.

The IR has peaks at 1700 and 1650. So maybe two carbonyl groups? Or one carbonyl and something else. Wait, another possibility is that the 1650 is an aromatic ring (C=C stretch). But if the compound is an ester, for example, the carbonyl is around 1700. So maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring. Or an conjugated carbonyl.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which are on a double bond. So if the IR has a strong peak at 1700, that's a carbonyl, perhaps an ester or ketone. The 1650 could be another carbonyl or maybe a conjugated C=C. Wait, but alkenes (C=C) have stretching around 1650 cm^-1. So maybe the 1650 is the alkene's C=C stretch.

Wait, wait, but the FTIR shows two strong peaks: 1700 and 1650. So 1700 is a carbonyl, and 1650 is an alkene. That would make sense. So the compound has both a carbonyl group and a double bond.

So, the functional groups are probably a carbonyl (like ester, ketone, aldehyde) and a double bond (alkene). Also, the broad peak at 3000 cm^-1 suggests an O-H group. So perhaps it's a compound with an alcohol and an ester, or maybe a ketone and an alcohol. Or maybe a carboxylic acid, but that usually has a broader O-H peak.

Wait, but a carboxylic acid's O-H is very broad, but the other peak (1700) would be the carbonyl. But the problem says the peaks at 1700 and 1650 are strong. Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a strong carbonyl around 1700, but the O-H is very broad. So the broad peak at 3000 could be due to an alcohol's O-H. So maybe the compound is an ester with an alcohol group, but that's not possible unless it's an acid or something else.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a ketone and an alcohol. But then would the carbonyl be around 1700. So, let's think about possible structures.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let's consider the Mass Spec. The fragment at m/z 45. What could that be? 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me see, for example, if the compound is an ester, perhaps the loss of a fragment like CH2CH2O or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a small carbonyl-containing fragment. Let me think: what molecules have a molecular weight of 45? Let's see, 45 is 45 g/mol. The molecular formula for 45 would be C3H7O? Because 3*12=36, 7*1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=59. No, that's too high. Wait, maybe another approach: 45=16 (O) + 29 (C2H5Cl? No, Cl is 35.5). Alternatively, perhaps 45 is a fragment from a larger molecule. For example, the loss of a larger group could leave a smaller fragment. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 45. But the molecular formula options are all C6, so the molecular weight would be higher. Let's calculate the molecular weights:

Option A: C6H12O2 → (6×12) + (12×1) + (2×16) =72+12+32=116.

Option B: C6H10O →72 +10 +16=98.

Option C: C6H10O2→72 +10 +32=114.

Option D: C6H12O →72 +12 +16=100.

So the molecular weights are 116, 98, 114, 100, respectively. So if the mass spec has a peak at 45, that's a fragment, not the molecular ion. So to find a fragment of 45.

Hmm. 45 is 45 amu. So possible fragments could be a CH2CH2O group? Wait, CH2CH2O would be (12×2)+(1×4)+16 =24 +4 +16=44. Close, but not 45. So maybe a CH2CH2O plus a hydroxyl? No, wait.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone group. The molecular ion for acetone is 58, but maybe a fragment. Alternatively, the fragment could be CH3CO (which is 43). But 45 is a bit higher. Alternatively, maybe a CH2CO group. Let's see: CH2CO has 12×2 +1×2 +16=24+2+16=42. Not 45. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. The molecular formula for fragment 45 would have a molecular weight of 45. So the possible formula could be C3H7O (45), because 3×12=36, 7×1=7, 16=16. 36+7+16=59. No, that's 59. So that's not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is C2H5O2. C=24, H=10, O=32. 24+10+32=66. No, that's not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a smaller group. Let's think about possible functional groups. A methyl ester group would be O-CO-OCH3? No, that's part of the larger molecule.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is an ethyl group (29) plus something else. 29 +16=45. So OCH2CH3 (O with ethyl group) would be 45? Let me calculate: O (16) + CH2CH3 (12×2 +1×5=24 +5=29). 16+29=45. So the fragment could be OCH2CH3, which is an ethoxy group. So in mass spec, maybe the compound lost a larger part, leaving the ethoxy group as the fragment. That would make sense. So if the compound has an ester group, the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) would have a molecular weight of 45.

So if the fragment is 45, that suggests the presence of an ethoxy group. So the compound might be an ester.

Now, putting this together with the other data.

FTIR: O-H (broad at 3000), C=O (1700), and C=C (1650). So maybe the compound is an ester with an alcohol group and a double bond.

Wait, but if it's an ester, the functional group would be O-CO-O-R. So the ester carbonyl (around 1700) would explain that. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond, perhaps. But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond.

So, for the structure, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. Maybe something like methyl acrylate, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a cyclohexene derivative with an ester.

But the options don't have that much detail; they're just formulas. So let's think about molecular formulas.

If the compound has an ester group (O-CO-O), the formula would have two oxygen atoms. So in the options, which ones have two O's? Options A (C6H12O2), C (C6H10O2). So B and D have one O each.

But wait, the IR has a broad peak at 3000, which is O-H. If the compound has both an ester (which has two O's) and an alcohol (which has one O), that would give a total of three O's. But the options don't have three O's. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the O-H is part of the ester? Like, perhaps it's a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from another group.

Wait, maybe the compound is a ketone with an alcohol. Then the formula would have two O's: one for the ketone (O) and one for the alcohol (O), but that would make three O's, which isn't in the options. Wait, no, because the formula counts all O's. So if the compound is a diol, but that's not likely with the IR and NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a carboxylic acid. But then we would have a COOH group, which has two O's. So the formula would have two O's, matching options A or C.

Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad O-H around 3000, and a strong carbonyl around 1700. But then what about the 1650 peak? Could that be an alkene? So the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond.

But then the NMR would show both the O-H (broad) and the vinyl H's. But the NMR data just says that it has peaks for vinyl H's. So maybe that's possible.

But then the mass spec fragment at 45. If the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, could the fragment be a carboxylic acid group? No, because the molecular weight of a carboxylic acid group (COOH) is 60 (12+16×2 + 1), wait, no: COOH is -COOH, so molecular weight is 12 +16×2 +1= 45. Wait, that's right! Because 12 (C) + 16 +16 (O's) + 1 (H)= 45. So a COOH group would have a molecular weight of 45. So if the compound loses the rest of the molecule, leaving the COOH group as a fragment, that would explain the m/z=45.

Wait, but wait: the COOH group has a molecular weight of 45? Let me calculate: COOH is C=12, O=16×2=32, H=1. So 12 +32 +1=45. Yes. So that would explain the fragment at 45.

But wait, if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the IR would show a broad peak around 3000 for the O-H, and a strong peak around 1700 for the carbonyl. The 1650 peak would be from the C=C (the alkene). So that fits.

So the compound could be a carboxylic acid with a double bond. Let's see what the formula would be. If it's a carboxylic acid, the formula would have a COOH group: which is -COOH, so adding up to 2 O's. Wait, but the formula would be RCOOH, so for a six-carbon molecule, perhaps. Let's see.

But the options are C6H12O2, etc. Let me think: the molecular formula for a six-carbon carboxylic acid would be C6H12O2. Because the formula for a carboxylic acid is CnH2nO2. Wait, n=6 would be C6H12O2. Which is option A. So that fits.

But wait, the mass spec fragment is 45, which is the COOH group. So the molecule would lose the rest, leaving COOH as a fragment. But wait, the molecular weight of COOH is 45, but the molecular weight of the entire compound is 116 (for option A). So the molecule would lose 71 (116-45=71) to leave the COOH group as a fragment. But does that make sense? Because in mass spectrometry, it's more common for the molecule to break in a way that forms stable fragments. So perhaps the loss of a larger group.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is something else. Wait, let me think again. If the molecule is a diol ester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the NMR has peaks for vinyl hydrogens. So the compound has a double bond. So the structure must include an alkene. If it's a carboxylic acid, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that the FTIR shows peaks at 1700 and 1650. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700, and the 1650 would be the C=C. So that matches.

Then the Mass Spec: m/z=45 would correspond to the COOH group. So the molecular formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, another possibility: what if the compound is an ester with an alcohol group? Let's say, for example, methyl propenoate. That would be an ester: R-O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, the structure of an ester is RCOOR'. So the oxygen count is two. So the formula would be CnH2nO2. But for a six-carbon ester, suppose the formula is C6H12O2. Which is option A.

So the IR would show:

- O-H (the alcohol) broad at ~3300, but in the problem, it's at 3000. Wait, maybe it's an ester without an alcohol. Hmm, but then where is the O-H? Because the broad peak at 3000 suggests an O-H. So maybe the O-H is from another group.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a ketone? No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's an ether? No, ether's O-H is not that. So perhaps the O-H is from a hydroxyl group in the molecule. So the compound must have an -OH group and a carbonyl group, and a double bond.

Let me think about the options again. So the possible formulas are A, B, C, D. Among these, only A and C have two O's. So if the compound has two O's, then it's either an ester (two O's) or a ketone plus an alcohol (but that would require three O's, which isn't an option). So the only possibility with two O's is an ester. So the formula would have two O's, and an -OH group. Wait, but that would require three O's. Unless the -OH is part of the ester group. No, because esters don't have -OH groups. Esters have OR and COOR groups. So that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a diol ester, but that's more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is not from an alcohol, but from something else. Wait, the broad peak at 3000 could also be from an amine, but the problem doesn't mention any amines. So probably not.

Wait, another thought: maybe the O-H is from a phenol group. But then the IR would also show a ring C=C around 1600 cm^-1, but in the data, the peaks are at 1700 and 1650. So maybe that's not the case.

Hmm. Let's circle back to the Mass Spec. If the fragment is 45, which could be the COOH group, then the molecular formula must have a COOH, which would be option A (C6H12O2). But then, is the O-H in the IR from the COOH group? That makes sense. So the O-H is from the carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is from the COOH (around 1700), and the 1650 is from the double bond. So that fits.

Then, the 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens, so the compound has a double bond. So the structure could be a substituted acrylic acid or similar.

So putting it all together, the formula would be C6H12O2, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. What about the ester scenario? Suppose the compound is an ester with an alcohol group. Wait, but that would require three O's, which isn't an option. So that can't be.

Alternatively, the O-H could be part of another functional group. For example, maybe the compound is an aldehyde. But then the O-H wouldn't be present. Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester, like a lactone. In that case, the functional group would be an ester, so O's would be two. The O-H would not be present, though. So the broad peak at 3000 would have to be something else, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of a hemiacetal or acetal. But that's more complicated, and the IR might show different peaks.

I think the most plausible scenario is that the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, making the formula C6H12O2. So the answer would be option A.


To identify the unknown compound, we analyze the spectroscopic data provided:

### FTIR Analysis:
- A **broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹** indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from an alcohol or carboxylic acid.
- A **strong absorption peak at 1700 cm⁻¹** suggests the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O), typical of esters, ketones, or carboxylic acids.
- A **strong absorption peak at 1650 cm⁻¹** could correspond to a conjugated carbonyl or an alkene (C=C) stretch.

### ¹H NMR Analysis:
- Peaks corresponding to **vinyl hydrogens** indicate the presence of a double bond (C=C) in the compound.

### Mass Spectrometry:
- A fragment peak at **m/z = 45** suggests the presence of a functional group with a molecular weight of 45. This is consistent with a **carboxylic acid (-COOH)** group, as its molecular weight is 45 (12 for C, 16×2 for O, and 1 for H).

### Integration of Data:
1. The **FTIR data** suggests the compound contains both a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ and the strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ align with a carboxylic acid.
2. The **¹H NMR data** indicates the presence of a double bond, which could be conjugated with the carbonyl group.
3. The **Mass Spectrometry data** supports the presence of a carboxylic acid group, as the m/z = 45 fragment matches the molecular weight of -COOH.

### Formula Analysis:
- The molecular formula must include **two oxygen atoms** (from the carboxylic acid group) and a double bond (from the vinyl hydrogens). This narrows the options to **C₆H₁₂O₂** (Option A) and **C₆H₁₀O₂** (Option C).
- **C₆H₁₂O₂** has the correct molecular weight (116 g/mol) and fits the spectroscopic data, including the presence of a carboxylic acid group and a double bond.

### Conclusion:
The unknown compound is most consistent with the formula **C₆H₁₂O₂**, corresponding to **Option A**.
