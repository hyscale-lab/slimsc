Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many stereoisomers the given compound has. Let me think through this step by step.

The compound is 6-chloro-9-ethyl-2-methylundeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down. First, let me try to visualize the structure.

So, undeca means 11 carbons. The main chain is 11 carbons long. The substituents are at positions 2, 6, 9, and 5. Wait, wait. Let me count the positions properly. The numbering starts from the end that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. I guess in this case, the double bonds are at 3 and 7 positions, so they help in the numbering.

So the structure would be: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-... Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure. Let's see: the main chain is 11 carbons. The double bonds are between carbons 3-4 and 7-8. So it's undeca-3,7-dien-5-ol. The hydroxyl group is at position 5. Then, at position 2 is a methyl group, at 6 is a chlorine, and at 9 is an ethyl.

Wait, the structure would be something like:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10 11
R   -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3?

Wait, maybe not. Let me try again. Let me think about the structure. The main chain is 11 carbons. So positions 3 and 7 are double bonds. So the structure is:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
At position 2: methyl (CH(CH3))
At position 5: OH (CH(OH))
At position 6: Cl (Cl attached)
At position 9: ethyl (CH2CH2CH3?)

Wait, no. Wait, the substituents are 6-chloro, 9
