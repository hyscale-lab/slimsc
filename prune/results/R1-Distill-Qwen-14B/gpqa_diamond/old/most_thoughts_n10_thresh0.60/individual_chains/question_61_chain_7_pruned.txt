Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with benzene and going through several transformations to form a final product. I need to figure out which option (A, B, C, or D) is correct.

First, I'll read the question carefully. Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, which I know is a nitration reaction. So product 1 would be nitrobenzene, right? Because nitration typically adds a nitro group to benzene. Wait, but where does it attach? Nitration is a meta-directing group, so the nitro group would go into the meta position if another substituent is present. But wait, in the first step, benzene is just getting nitrated, so it's nitrobenzene—so the nitro group is at position 1, but since benzene is symmetric, it's just a single substituent.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh, that's a bromination reaction. Iron and bromine usually do a substitution. But wait, wait—nitro is a meta director. So when nitrobenzene undergoes bromination, the Br would add in the meta position relative to the nitro group. Hmm, so if nitro is at position 1, the Br would go to position 3. So product 2 would be 3-bromonitrobenzene? Or wait,
