Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's try to think this through.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of these.

Let me read the options again:

a) Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So, same as Earth. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So this would have that density.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, that's interesting because the density is the same as Earth's. So if the density is same, higher mass would mean a larger radius maybe? Or wait, wait, the mass is 2 Earth masses but the density is same as Earth. So perhaps the radius would be bigger. Because density is mass/volume. So if mass increases but density remains same, volume must increase. Since volume is (4/3)πr³, so a larger radius. So this planet would be bigger than Earth but same density, so same density as a.

c) A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So same composition implies same density? Because composition determines density. So Earth's density is about 5.5, so this planet would have same density. But wait, let me make sure. If same composition, then yes, same density. Because density depends on the materials. So, 5 Earth masses but same density as Earth. But wait, the question is about which has the highest density. So all the same as Earth except for a and b.

Wait, no. Wait, option a is same mass and radius as Earth, so density is same as Earth. Option b is same density, but more mass. Option c: same composition, same density, but higher mass. Option d: same composition, same density, but less mass. So all of them except a and b have same density as Earth?

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Option d says same composition as Earth, same as c. So same density. So planets c and d have same density as Earth, same as a. So their densities are 5.5.

But what about option b? It says the planet has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. So same density as
