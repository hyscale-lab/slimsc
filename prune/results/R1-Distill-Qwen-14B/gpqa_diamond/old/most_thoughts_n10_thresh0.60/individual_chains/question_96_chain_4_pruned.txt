Okay, so I've got this problem about black holes and entropy. Hmm. Let me read through it again. The question is about finding the order of magnitude of the entropy of a supermassive black hole. The given data includes the distance to the galaxy, d=10^10 parsecs, and the angular size of the event horizon, theta=10^-17 degrees. The options are A to D, each a different order of magnitude.

Wait, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant.

First, I need to find the area of the event horizon. The event horizon is a sphere, so the area is 4πr². But to find r, the radius, I can use the angular size and the distance. The angular size θ is given in degrees, so I think I should convert that to radians because the formula might use radians.

Wait, the formula for the angular size is θ ≈ (diameter of the object) / distance. Oh, wait, the formula is θ (in radians) ≈ (diameter)/(distance). Since the event horizon is a sphere, the diameter is 2r. So, θ (radians) = (2r)/d. Therefore, solving for r: r = (θ * d) / 2.

Wait, but
