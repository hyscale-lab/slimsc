Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The question gives a reaction scheme with compounds A to E. Let me list out the steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form B.
2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C.
3. C reacts with HNO2 to form D.
4. D eliminates an inert gas to form E.

And there are some hints provided. Let me read those first.

Hint a: Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Wait, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So A is probably a carbonyl compound because it reacts with a Wittig reagent.

Hint b: The IR of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm-1. That's indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O). So A is an aldehyde or ketone.

Looking at the options, all the compounds E are cyclic ketones because their IR is around 1715 cm^-1, which is also a carbonyl, but probably a ketone. So E is a ketone.

Let me try to reconstruct the structures.

Starting with compound A. From the reaction with HCN to form B. HCN adds to carbonyls to form cyanohydrins. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin, a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group.

But wait, the next step is reduction of B with H2 and Pd to form C. So B is a cyanohydrin. Reducing a cyanohydrin would probably reduce both the alcohol and the nitrile. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let's think: H2 and Pd is usually for hydrogenation, like reducing triple bonds to single, or alkenes to alkanes. But for cyanohydrins, which are R2C(OH)CN, perhaps the Pd/H2 would reduce the nitrile group to an amine? Wait, no, reducing nitriles usually gives amines, but I'm not certain. Or maybe in this case, the nitrile is converted to an amine, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the Pd is a catalyst for something else.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction steps again.

1. A (probably a ketone) reacts with HCN to form a cyanohydrin B. So B would have an alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon. So if A is a cyclopentanone, for instance, then B would be a cyclopentane ring with an OH and CN on adjacent carbons. Then, when B is hydrogenated with H2 and Pd, what happens? The OH and CN groupsâ€”maybe the hydrogenation reduces the nitrile to an amine? Wait,
