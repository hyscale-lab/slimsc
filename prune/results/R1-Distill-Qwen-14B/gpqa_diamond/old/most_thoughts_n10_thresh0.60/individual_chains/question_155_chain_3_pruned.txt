Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through the question carefully.

Alright, the setup is that we have an operator P with components Px, Py, and Pz. The matrices for each are given. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz. The system is in an eigenstate of Px with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The question is asking for the uncertainty ΔPz of the operator Pz.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty ΔA of an operator A is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt⟨A²⟩ − ⟨A⟩². So, I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩ and ⟨Pz²⟩, then take the square root of their difference.

Wait, but wait. The state is given as an eigenstate of Px, not Pz. So, in the basis of Pz's eigenvectors, this state is a linear combination. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, the matrix Pz is diagonal in this basis. So, each basis vector corresponds to a particular eigenvalue of Pz.

Let me think about the setup. The state is a column vector ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ), which I'll denote as |ψ⟩. Since the basis is the eigenbasis of Pz, the matrix Pz is diagonal. So, when I operate Pz on any basis vector |k⟩, I get p_zk |k⟩, where p_zk are the eigenvalues.

Wait, looking at the matrix given for Pz, it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that out:

Pz matrix:
Row 1: [ħ, 0, 0]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ]

So, the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. That means the eigenvalues of Pz are ħ, 0, and -ħ. The corresponding eigenvectors must be the standard basis vectors. So, the first basis vector is |+⟩ (eigenvalue ħ), the second is |0⟩ (eigenvalue 0), and the third is |−⟩ (eigenvalue -ħ).

Wait, but the given state |ψ⟩ is in terms of these basis vectors. So, the state is expressed as a linear combination of these. So, |ψ⟩ = a|+⟩ + b|0⟩ + c|−⟩, where a, b, c are the components of the vector.

Looking at the vector given, it's ( -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ). So, a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2. Let me confirm that these coefficients are correct. Wait, the vector is a column, so it's three components. So, yeah, a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Now, to compute ⟨Pz⟩, it's the expectation value of Pz in state |ψ⟩. Since Pz is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the square of their coefficients.

So, ⟨Pz⟩ = (a)^2 * ħ + (b)^2 * 0 + (c)^2 * (-ħ)
= ( (-1/2)^2 ) * ħ + ( (1/√2)^2 ) * 0 + ( (-1/2)^2 ) * (-ħ)
= (1/4) ħ + 0 + (1/4)(-ħ)
= (1/4) ħ - (1/4) ħ
= 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So the expectation value of Pz is zero?

Now, I need to compute ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is
