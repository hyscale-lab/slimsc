Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

So, the experiment is about three genes: G1, G2, and G3. They made knock-out mutants (g1, g2, g3) and double mutants (g1g2, g1g3, g2g3). The resistance levels are given, and the question is about the interactions among these genes.

The results show:
- g1: 75% resistance (so less than wild type, which is 100%)
- g2: 0% resistance (so completely susceptible)
- g3: 50% resistance
- g1g3: 10% (very low)
- g2g3: 0%
- g1g2: 0% 

The question states that at least one gene is a transcription factor acting upstream. So, transcription factors usually regulate other genes. So, maybe one of these genes activates others.

Looking at the options, the answer must involve determining which gene is the transcription factor and how the others interact.

First, let's think about the individual mutants. The plant with g2 has 0% resistance, which is the worst. That suggests G2 might be a key gene in the resistance pathway. If it's a transcription factor, knocking it out would disable the pathway entirely.

Now, looking at the double mutants. The g1g2 and g2g3 double mutants both have 0% resistance. That's interesting. So when g2 is knocked out, the double mutant with g1 or g3 is as bad as g2 alone. That suggests that perhaps G2 is epistatic to G1 and G3. Wait, what's epistasis? Oh right, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So if G2 is epistatic, then its function might be upstream of G1 and G3.

Alternatively, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. But in the single mutants, g2 is 0%, but g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So without G2, the other genes don't contribute, meaning G2 is upstream.

Wait, but if G2 is a transcription factor, then knocking it out would prevent the expression of its target genes. So perhaps G2 activates G1 or G3, or both.

Looking at the double mutants again:

g1g2: 0% resistance. So even when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, the resistance is 0. But the single g2 is also 0. So does that mean that G1 isn't doing anything in the absence of G2? Because when G2 is gone, G1's function doesn't matter. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2.

Similarly, looking at g2g3: 0% as well. So without G2, even without G3, no effect
