Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The given phase shifts are delta0 to delta4, and the rest are ignored. The energy is 50 MeV. 

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ, ϕ) for spin-0 particles or when considering the total cross-section. But wait, electrons are spin-1/2 particles. But maybe for this problem, we're considering the spin-averaged case or perhaps the total cross-section approach.

The general formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is something like f(s,θ,ϕ) = (1/(2m)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (2l+1) exp(iδ_l - δ_l^0) ) * [ ... something ].

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Another approach: the scattering amplitude can be expressed using the partial waves. The total cross-section is related to the sum over l of (2l+1)|f_l|^2, but that's for the total cross-section.

Wait, the problem is about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the beam direction (θ=0) would be... I think there's a specific formula for that.

Wait, when θ is zero, the direction is along the beam. The scattering amplitude f(θ=0
