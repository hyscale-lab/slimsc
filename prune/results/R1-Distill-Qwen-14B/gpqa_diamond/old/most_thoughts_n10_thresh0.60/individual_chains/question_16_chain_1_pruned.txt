Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through each compound one by one. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which happens when there's chiralityâ€”that is, the molecule isn't superimposable on its mirror image. Chirality usually comes from having a chiral center, which is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many are optically active. Let me go through each one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**: The name is a bit confusing. Wait, but-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2. C2 has a methyl group and maybe another substituent. Let me draw it out. Structure would be Cl-C=CH2. Wait, wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but here it's 1-chloro-2-methyl. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)), and then maybe another substituent. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 2-methyl would make it CH2=C(CH2CH3)CH3? Hmm, no, wait. No, I think it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH2CH3? Wait, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is four carbons. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and double bond from C1 to C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Or wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So if it's 2-methyl, then the C2 is CH(CH3). So the structure would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)) and another CH2CH3? Wait no, but but-1-ene is four carbons: C1=C2-C3-C4. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the structure is Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.
