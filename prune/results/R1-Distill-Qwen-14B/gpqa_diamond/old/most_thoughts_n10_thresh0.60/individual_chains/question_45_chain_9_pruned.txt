Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I'm supposed to find the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state energies. Hmm, let's think this through.

First, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), or something like that. The question gives E as equal to that expression, so E = (π² ħ²)/(2mL²). So each energy level is a multiple of E. So for a single particle, the ground state is n=1, so E_1 = E. The first excited state would be n=2, which is 4E, and second excited is n=3, 9E, but wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terminology. Wait, ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=1. The first excited state is the next one, so n=2, and the second excited state is n=3. So for a single particle, those would be E, 4E, 9E.

But wait, this problem is about four identical spin-1/2 particles. So we have to consider their quantum states, including spin. Since they're identical fermions, they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

In this case, the particles are in a 1D well, so their spatial wavefunction is described by their quantum number n. Each particle also has a spin quantum number, which for spin-1/2 is either up or down. So each state is a combination of spatial and spin parts.

But wait, wait, because in 1D, the spin doesn't contribute to the spatial part of the wavefunction. So each particle can have a spatial quantum number n and a spin state (up or down). So for identical fermions, each unique combination of (n, spin) can have only one fermion.

Wait, but wait, the spin is a separate quantum number. So for each spatial state n, there can be up to two fermions: one with spin up and one with spin down. Because each spatial state can accommodate two particles due to spin.

Ah, right! So each n can have two particles with opposite spins. So the maximum number of particles with the same n
