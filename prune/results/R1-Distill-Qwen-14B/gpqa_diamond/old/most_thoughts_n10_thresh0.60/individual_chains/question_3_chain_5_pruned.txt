Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of its spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the sigma_z operator. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, right. I remember expectation values involve taking the state, applying the operator, and then calculating the average.

First, I should probably find the expectation value of σz and σx separately and then combine them with their coefficients.

Wait, the state is given as a linear combination. Let me write it down: ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. I think I should compute the expectation value of each Pauli matrix and then plug into the operator expression.

The expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So for σz, it's ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩, and similarly for σx.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, their expectation values are easy. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So let me compute ⟨σz⟩ first. The state ψ is a linear combination, so when I compute ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩, each term will involve the coefficients and the eigenvalues.

Breaking it down, ψ has components a = 0.5 and b = sqrt(3)/2. Wait, let me compute |a|^2 and |b|^2. |0.5|^2 is 0.25, and |sqrt(3)/2|^2 is (3/4), since (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4. So the probabilities sum to 1, which makes sense.

So the expectation value of σz is |a|^2*(+1) + |b|^2*(-1). Let me calculate that.

|a|^2 is 0.25, times +1 gives 0.25. |b|^2 is 0.75, times -1 gives -0.75. So 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

Now, the operator in the problem is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. I have ⟨σz⟩, but I need ⟨σx⟩.

Calculating ⟨σx⟩ is a bit trickier because σx is not diagonal in the σz basis. The eigenstates of σx are |+⟩ and |−⟩, which are different from |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So when I compute ⟨σx⟩, I should express ψ in terms of the σx eigenstates or use matrix representation.

Alternatively, I can compute it using the components. The Pauli X matrix (σx) is [[0
