Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with the movement of pi bonds. The classic examples are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements. These reactions are usually thermally induced and are often considered to be thermodynamically favorable.

The question has three parts, each involving a different reaction, and I need to determine the products A, B, and C. Then, based on the options provided, choose the correct set.

Let me break down each reaction one by one.

First, Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let me draw its structure. It's ethanamine (NH2CH2CH2NH2?), no wait, wait. No, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. But this is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So the structure is (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no, the ethan-1-amine is CH2CH2NH2? No, ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2? Wait, no, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So 1,1-dimethoxy would replace two Hs on the first carbon. So it's (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH2NH2-CH3? No, wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again: ethan-1-amine is CH2CH3NH2 â€” the amine is on the first carbon (the end). So 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be the structure where the ethanamine's first carbon (the one attached to NH2) has two methoxy groups. So the structure would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2. So the first carbon is the CH2 attached to NH2.
