Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy of a nucleus moving at a certain speed. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking for the energy of the nucleus X when its speed is 0.96c. X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So Li typically has 3 protons. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6 because 3 protons +3 neutrons =6 nucleons. So the nucleus is lithium-6.

So, to find the energy, I think I need to use the relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a moving object is given by gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

First, I need to calculate gamma when v is 0.96c. Let me plug that into the formula. 

v = 0.96c, so v² = (0.96)^2 c². 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714. Wait, let me calculate more accurately. 0.0784 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28 exactly. So yeah, gamma is 1/0.28 = 3.57142857... Hmm, but I should double-check that calculation. Oh wait, 0.28 squared is 0.0784, so yeah, correct.

Next, I need the rest mass of the lithium nucleus. Since it's Li-6, the mass would be approximately the mass number times the mass of a nucleon. But wait, the mass of a nucleus is slightly less than the sum of the individual nucleons due to binding energy. But since we're dealing with heavy ions, perhaps I can approximate the rest mass as the mass number times the proton mass, but wait, that might not be precise. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the atomic mass. Let me think.

Wait, the mass of a nucleus can be calculated using the atomic mass of the element. Lithium-6 has an atomic mass. Let me recall that the atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.0141 g/mol. Wait, but to get the mass of a single nucleus, I need to divide by Avogadro's number. Alternatively, I can use the mass of a nucleon. Because each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a mass of about 938 MeV/c². So for Li-6, which has 6 nucleons, the approximate rest mass energy would be 6 * 938 MeV ≈ 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But wait, this
