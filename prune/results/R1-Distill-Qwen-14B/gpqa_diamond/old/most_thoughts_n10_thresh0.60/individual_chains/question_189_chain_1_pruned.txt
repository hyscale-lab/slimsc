Okay, so I've got this question about particles and symmetries. Hmm, symmetries and particles... I remember from my studies that when a symmetry is broken spontaneously, certain particles appear. Let me think.

The question is asking which particle isn't associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are Phonon, Skyrmion, Magnon, and Pion. I need to go through each one.

First, what's spontaneous symmetry breaking? Oh right, it's when the underlying laws have a symmetry, but the system as a whole doesn't exhibit that symmetry because the state it's in breaks the symmetry. Like how a pencil balanced on its tip is symmetric, but when it falls, it points in a specific direction, breaking the symmetry.

Particles that arise from this are called 'would-be' Goldstone bosons, but sometimes they get masses due to other effects. Goldstone's theorem says that for continuous symmetries broken spontaneously, massless bosons (Goldstone bosons) appear. But in some cases, these bosons gain mass.

Let's look at each option:

A) Phonon: Phonons are quantized sound waves in a crystal lattice. I think they arise from the breaking of translational symmetry. Wait, but translational symmetry isn't usually broken in a perfect crystal, but in solid-state physics, phonons come from the vibrations of atoms. Wait, maybe phonons are related to broken symmetry. Or is it more about the lattice structure and vibrations? I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Alternatively, maybe phonons are related to the breaking of a continuous symmetry when the material crystallizes. Or perhaps phonons emerge from the spontaneously broken symmetry
