Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds. Let's break down the information given.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%. Then there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, that might indicate some kind of isotopic peak. Wait, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5, so maybe the molecular formula includes a chlorine atom. Because if the molecular weight is 156, and considering possible isotopes, the 158 peak could be due to a Cl isotope. Chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the molecular ion would have a certain ratio based on that. The molecular ion at 156 and a peak at 158 suggests that the molecule has one chlorine atom. Because the molecular weight is 156, and Cl is 35, so the formula would be something like C8H5ClO2 or similar? Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me calculate its formula. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and another O (because of the hydroxyl?), Wait, 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde would be C7H5ClO2. So the molecular weight would be (7*12)+(5*1)+(35.5)+(2*16) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32=156.5. That's close. So m/z 156 would be the main peak, and 158 would be the Cl-37 isotope. That makes sense.

Option B:4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Same as option A, same molecular weight. So the same m/z 156 and 158.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Hmm, chloroformate is OCl-CO-O-. Wait, phenyl chloroformate would be Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5
