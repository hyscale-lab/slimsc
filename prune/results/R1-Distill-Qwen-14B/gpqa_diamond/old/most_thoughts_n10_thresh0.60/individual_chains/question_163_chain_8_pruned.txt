Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that when you add an acid to a hydroxide, they should react to form a salt and water.

Alright, the problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we're adding it to 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve all of it. Then, we also have to find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D, each with a pH and volume.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The formula mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So each OH- is 17 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 has one Fe, three O, and three H. Wait, let me compute that:

Fe: 55.85
O: 3 *16 = 48
H:3 *1 =3
Total: 55.85 +48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles, or about 9.36e-4 mol.

Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid. Since the acid is monobasic, like HCl, the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, let me write the balanced equation. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. To dissolve it, we need to add H+ ions to neutralize the OH-.

So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl.

So moles of HCl needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

Moles of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. So HCl needed is 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

The acid solution is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration. 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but wait, the options have C as 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's the volume needed. But looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm
