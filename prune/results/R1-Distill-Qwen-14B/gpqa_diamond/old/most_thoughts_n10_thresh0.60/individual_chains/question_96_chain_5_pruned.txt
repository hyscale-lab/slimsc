Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area, specifically the area of the event horizon. The formula I think is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are Planck's h-bar, gravitational constant G, and Boltzmann's constant k_B. Oh wait, or was it S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G)? I think that's right.

So, the question gives me the angular size θ, which is 10^-17 degrees, and the distance d is 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. 

First, I should find the radius of the event horizon. The angular size θ (in radians) relates to the actual size r via the formula θ = r/d. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I need to convert that to radians first. To convert degrees to radians, I multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180).

Let me calculate that: θ_rad = 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. 

Wait, no, 1 degree is π/180 radians, which is approximately 0.0174533 radians. So yeah, 1e-17 degrees is about 1.74533e-19 radians.

The formula θ = r/d => r = θ * d. So r = (1.745e-19 radians) * (1e10 parsecs). 

But wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. I think parsecs can be converted into meters. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d is 1e10 parsecs, which is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So r = θ_rad * d = (1.745e-19) * (3.086e26 m) ≈
