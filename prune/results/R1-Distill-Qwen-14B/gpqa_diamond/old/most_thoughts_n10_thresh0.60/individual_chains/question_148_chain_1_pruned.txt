Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky for me. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. There are five such compounds. Let's parse the information given.

Substance A1 is bright red and decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 20°C). When it decomposes, it forms A2 and fluorine gas. The oF (I think this stands for oxidation state or maybe something else, but probably oxidation state) of fluorine in A2 is 31.96%. Wait, 31.96% sounds familiar. Fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 g/mol. So if something is 31.96% fluorine by mass, that might give a clue about the molecular formula.

Let me calculate that. Suppose a compound has molar mass M, and the mass of F is 19 * x, where x is the number of F atoms. So (19x)/M = 0.3196. Let's say M is 19x / 0.3196. Let me try to see if that gives a whole number. Let's pick x=1: 19/0.3196 ≈ 59.3. Hmm, not a whole number. x=2: 38/0.3196 ≈ 118.7, which is close to 119. 119 is maybe around there. Wait, but 119 is close to 120. What if the compound is YF3 or something else? Alternatively, maybe it's a diatomic molecule like F2, but that doesn't fit here.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about possible fluorine compounds. A1 is bright red and decomposes into A2 and F2. I remember that KClO3 decomposes into KCl and O2, but that's not with F. Oh wait, maybe it's a fluorine oxide? Or perhaps a fluorine compound with another element.

Another thought: Sodium chlorate decomposes into NaCl and O2, but again, that's not with fluorine. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is a compound like ClF3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says
