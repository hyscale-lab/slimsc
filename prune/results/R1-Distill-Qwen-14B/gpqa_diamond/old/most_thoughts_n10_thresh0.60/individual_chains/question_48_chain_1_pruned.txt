Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step because I'm a bit new to this. Let me read the question again.

The problem starts with cyclohexanone. Then, it undergoes a series of reactions, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Alright, let's break down each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine, forming product 1. Hmm, I remember that ketones can undergo some kind of addition reactions. Oh wait, when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a bromination. But wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Bromine might add across the carbonyl. Oh, right! It's a diaddition because the carbonyl is a good electrophile. So, cyclohexanone (which is a six-membered ring with a ketone) would react with Br2 in a way that adds two bromine atoms. Wait, no, maybe it's more like the enolate formation. Alternatively, maybe it's the bromination of the ketone via the enol intermediate. Oh wait, another possibility: cyclohexanone could undergo the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for alpha bromination. Oh wait, no, that reaction is for alpha positions, but it's a different catalyst. Alternatively, perhaps it's the addition of bromine across the carbonyl, but I think in the presence of a base, that could happen.

Wait, no, cyclohexanone and bromine (Br2) — I think that's a nucleophilic attack. The ketone's carbonyl is attacked by Br-? Or wait, Br2 is a dienophile? Or perhaps it's the addition of bromine to the double bond if the starting material was an alkene. But the starting material is cyclohexanone, an aromatic ring with a ketone group. Oh wait, no, cyclohexanone is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone substituent, so it's a cyclic ketone.

Wait, maybe it's the addition of bromine to the carbonyl group. The carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group. So, the mechanism would be the base (maybe from the presence of something else) deprotonates the alpha carbon, forming an enolate, which then attacks Br
