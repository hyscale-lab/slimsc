Okay, so I've got this question about a ribonucleoprotein particle and a nascent chain meeting. I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through. 

Alright, let me read the question again. The ribonucleoprotein says, "Oh, I know you," to the chain. Then it tells the chain to pause and says, "you really need some sugar." The chain replies that it's rough and it's time to say goodbye, heading on its way. Hmm.

Wait, ribonucleoprotein particles... Oh, like maybe the ribosome is involved because it's made of RNA and proteins. The nascent chain is probably a polypeptide being synthesized. So the ribosome is where proteins are made. 

The line about needing some sugar makes me think about glycosylation, where sugars are added to the protein. I remember that in protein synthesis, after the ribosome makes the protein chain, certain modifications happen. One of those is the addition of sugar molecules, which is done by enzymes in the Golgi apparatus. 

So the ribonucleoprotein particle might be the ribosome, and the nascent chain is the new protein. The ribosome is attached to the rough ER, right? Once the chain is made, it goes into the ER, then through the Golgi. So the ribosome (particle) would be on the ER, and the chain would move from there. 

Wait, the question is where did they meet and where is the chain going. The meeting point is probably the ribosome. Because that's where the protein is being synthesized. Then the chain is heading somewhere else.

Looking at the options, option B is ribosome to the proteasome. The proteasome degrades proteins, so that doesn't make sense if the chain is being sent for modification. Option A is cytosol to extracellular, but that's more about secretion. Option D is Golgi to mitochondrion, which also doesn't fit. Option C is membrane to nucleus, not sure about that. 

Wait, when the chain is being made, it starts in the ribosome attached to the rough ER. So the chain would go into the ER, then to the Golgi. The ribosome is the meeting point. So the chain starts at the ribosome, then goes into the ER, then Golgi. So the ribosome is telling the chain to pauseâ€”maybe after synthesis, the ribosome detaches, and the chain is sent to the ER. 

Wait, the
