Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see, the question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction produces gas W, precipitate G, and eventually releases B when heated. There's also some stuff about atomic masses and isotopes. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by going through the information piece by piece. First, Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. I'm thinking that might mean it's an isotope with a higher atomic number or a higher mass number. Maybe it's something like Cl-35 versus Cl-37? Or perhaps another element that has common isotopes.

The reaction with liquid Y is violent and releases gas W. W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, the same number? So for each molecule, the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. Let me think about possible gases. Hmmm. If the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, maybe it's something like H2O? No, because H has 1 proton, O has 8, but that's not equal. Wait, maybe CH4? No, that's four H and one C. Wait, perhaps something like NH3? No, that's 1 N and 3 H. Hmmm. Maybe O2? No, O has 8 protons, each O in O2 has 8 neutrons (if it's the common isotope O-16, which has 8 protons and 8 neutrons). So O2 would have 16 protons (8 each) and 16 neutrons (8 each). Oh wait, but each molecule of O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons, so the number is equal. So W could be O2? Or perhaps H2O is not, but wait, each H2O has 2*(1p) + 8p = 10p, and 2*(0n) + 8n = 8n. Not equal. So maybe O2 is the gas.

Wait, wait another thought. Another possibility is CO2. Each CO2 molecule has 6 protons (C) + 16 (O*2) = 22 protons. Each O has 8 neutrons, so 16 neutrons in CO2.
