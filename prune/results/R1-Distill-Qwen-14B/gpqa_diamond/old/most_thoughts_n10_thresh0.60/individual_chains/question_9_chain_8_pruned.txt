Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about molecular symmetry, specifically C3h symmetry. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my symmetry groups, but let me think this through.

The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The options are four different molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two other compounds with long IUPAC names. The options are labeled A, B, C, D.

First, I need to remember what C3h symmetry entails. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (σh). So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around the C3 axis and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal, meaning the molecule is symmetric when reflected along that plane.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. Triisopropyl borate has the structure B(OCH(CH2CH3)2)3. Wait, each isopropyl group is a substituent on the boron. Boron usually has a trigonal planar geometry. Each isopropyl group is bulky and symmetric. So the molecule is symmetric because all three substituents are the same. So, what symmetry does that give? Well, if each substituent is identical and arranged symmetrically around the central atom, then the molecule would have C3 symmetry. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane?

Wait, the molecule is trigonal planar. The three isopropyl groups are arranged in a plane, so the central B is in the center. If I imagine a horizontal plane cutting through the boron, would the mirror image match? Well, the mirror plane would have to be perpendicular to the C3 axis. For C3h symmetry, the σh plane is perpendicular to the C3 axis and includes it. So in this case, if the molecule has a C3 axis (say, through the boron atom and perpendicular to the plane), then a horizontal mirror plane would lie in that same plane. But I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a C3 axis and a mirror plane that passes through each substituent, but I'm not sure about the horizontal aspect.

Alternatively, triisopropyl borate might have C3
