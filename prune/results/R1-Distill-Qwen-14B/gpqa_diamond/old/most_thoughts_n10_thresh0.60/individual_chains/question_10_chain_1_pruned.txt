Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options a to d has the highest density. The options are A to D, each corresponding to a choice a to d. So I need to figure out the densities of each a, b, c, d and see which is the highest.

Wait, what do I remember about density? Density is mass divided by volume. Oh right, formula is density = mass/volume. So for each planet, I'll calculate or compare their densities.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, right? So I think this planet's density would be the same as Earth's. So option a is 5.5.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and density approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, wait, the question states the planet's density is 5.5. So if it's given, we can take that as is. So its density is 5.5. Same as Earth. Hmm, but wait, the question is about which has the highest, so maybe others have higher.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. Hmm. Since it's the same composition, same density? Because density is mass/volume. If the composition is same, then the density should be same, right? Because density depends on the material. So Earth's density is about 5.5. So this planet's density should also be 5.5. Oh wait, but wait, mass and radius change. Wait, no—same composition implies same average density. Because density is mass/volume, and if it's same composition, the mass scales with volume, which is radius cubed. Let's think: if you have a planet with same composition, then density is same. Because if you double the radius, volume goes up 8 times, and mass would go up 8 times because density is same. So for option c, it's 5 times Earth's mass. Wait, but same composition.

Wait, Earth's mass is M, radius R. So volume is (4/3)πR³. So density is M / [(4/3)π R³]. Now, if a planet has same composition, so same density
