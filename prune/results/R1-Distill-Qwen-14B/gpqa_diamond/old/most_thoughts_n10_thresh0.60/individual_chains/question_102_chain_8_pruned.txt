Okay, I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step. 

So, the question is about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. The researcher is using a bicistronic vector with some specific elements, and after some experiments, there's no green signal observed. I need to figure out why.

First, the setup: the vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two open reading frames (ORFs). The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Both are under certain promoters and have stop cassettes with loxP sites.

The ligand's ORF is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, meaning the receptor might be expressed as a separate protein from the ligand. But I'm not entirely sure how the promoters and IRES work here.

The stop cassettes: between ligand and mCherry is a loxP-stop-loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP is a lox2272-stop-lox2272. So, without Cre, the stop cassette would prevent expression of the downstream genes. Cre would excise the stop, allowing expression.

The antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins. After transfecting into primary astrocyte cultures, Western blot showed signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins are being expressed and detected.

Then, the mouse model was made homozygous in the wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre mice. The idea is that SOX10-Cre would excise the stop cassettes in certain tissues. But when they looked under the confocal, there was no green signal from eGFP.

Hmm. The question is why no green. Let's think about each option.

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cells. If the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, they would be autocrine. If they're in paracrine, perhaps one is produced by one cell and acts on another. But why would that affect the expression of eGFP? Not sure. Maybe the construct wouldn't be expressed unless in the right cell type.

Option B: The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. That would mean it doesn't reach the cell surface, and so you wouldn't see eGFP fluorescence. But why would the stop cassette affect that? Or is there an issue with the construct?

Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing. If the promoters aren't active, the proteins wouldn't be expressed. But wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which should be strong. The receptor uses the IRES, which relies on the upstream ORF's promoter. So if the construct isn't being expressed, maybe the promoter isn't active, or the IRES isn't working. But the Western blot did show expression, so the proteins are made. So probably not C.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, the eGFP is at the C-terminus of the receptor. If the stop cassette isn't excised, then the receptor would have a stop before eGFP. But the stop is in a lox2272 cassette. Did Cre correctly recombine? If the stop is still present, the receptor might be truncated, not expressed as a fusion with eGFP. But the problem is in the mouse after crossing with SOX10-Cre. So, if the Cre isn't active in the cells where the receptor is expressed, the stop would remain. Or maybe the Cre isn't working, so the stop isn't excised.

Wait, the mouse model is homozygous for the construct. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is a transgenic line that expresses Cre under the control of the SOX10 promoter. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells and their derivatives, like astrocytes. So the Cre would be active in those cells, excising the lox2272 stop cassette. So the receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the experiment, they don't see green. So why no eGFP? Let's think about the construct structure again.

The bicistronic vector has ligand (CBA promoter) and receptor (after IRES). Each has a stop cassette. The ligand is fused to mCherry, but the stop is before mCherry. So, without Cre, ligand is expressed, but mCherry is not. With Cre, the stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed. Similarly, the receptor has a stop before eGFP, which is after the IRES. So with Cre, the stop is removed, allowing eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but in the mouse, they are using SOX10-Cre. So in neural crest-derived cells, Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing both mCherry and eGFP to be expressed. But the question says they don't see green. So why?

Another possibility: maybe the IRES isn't working. The IRES is supposed to allow the receptor to be expressed as a separate ORF, but if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor might not be expressed. But the Western blot showed expression, so probably not.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after IRES, so the same
