Okay, so I have this chemistry question here about optical isomerism, and I need to figure out which of the given compounds exhibit it. Hmm, optical isomerism, that's when a compound has chiral centers, right? Chiral centers have four different groups attached, making the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. So the compound would have enantiomers, which are optical isomers.

Let me go through each of the options one by one.

Option 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl rings connected at positions 1 and 1', and substituents at 2,2',6,6'. Wait, I think biphenyls can have stereoisomerism if the rings are connected in a way that allows for different configurations. Oh wait, but for biphenyls, the substituents on each ring can cause the molecule to have a plane of symmetry or not. In this case, the substituents are at 2 and 2', and 6 and 6'. Let me visualize this. The two phenyl rings are connected at the first position. So the positions 2 and 6 on each ring are ortho and para to the connecting bond. With substituents at 2 and 2' positions, maybe the molecule is symmetric. But wait, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the overall molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it might have stereoisomers. Alternatively,
