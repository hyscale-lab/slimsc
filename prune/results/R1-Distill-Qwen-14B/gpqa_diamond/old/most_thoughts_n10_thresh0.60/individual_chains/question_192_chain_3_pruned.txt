Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about electric fields and conductors. Alright, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and there's a small spherical cavity inside. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is less than R. Then, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Both L and l are greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

The options given are A to D, each with a different expression. I'm supposed to pick the correct one.

Alright, so I remember from my studies that conductors have some properties when it comes to electric fields. Conductors are equipotential, and the charges reside on the surface. Also, Gauss's Law is probably going to come into play here since we're dealing with electric fields and charge distributions.

Wait, but this conductor is initially uncharged. Then, inside the cavity, a charge +q is placed. Oh right, since the conductor was neutral before, but now it's got an induced charge. How does that work?

When a charge is placed inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces charges on the inner and outer surfaces. The inner surface will have an induced charge equal and opposite to the charge inside, right? So the inner surface would have -q because the charge inside is +q. But since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q to balance it out. Wait, no, the conductor was uncharged. So the total charge of the conductor is zero. So if the inner surface has -q, the outer surface must have +q.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The conductor is neutral, so the sum of all charges on it must be zero. The inner surface will have a charge of -q because it's induced by the +q inside the cavity. So the remaining charge on the conductor (the outer surface) must be +q, because -q (inner) + outer charge = 0 â†’ outer charge is +q. So the
