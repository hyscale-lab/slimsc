Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the solution step by step. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's going on.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. The total mass is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases is formed. Without cooling, these gases pass through three tubes: first, anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and finally red-hot copper.

The results are:
- Tube 1 (Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 grams.
- Tube 3 (copper) gains 0.80 grams, forming CuO.
- Tube 2 (Ca(OH)2) doesn't change.
- Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Hmm. Let's break this down. First, the heating of salts A and B to 200°C without air probably leads to thermal decomposition. Since it's an equimolar mixture, maybe each salt decomposes to form gases.

The gases pass through three tubes. Let's think about each step.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous. It probably absorbs water. Because when Mg(ClO4)2 is exposed to water, it forms Mg(ClO4)2·8H2O or something like that. So the gain in weight (3.60g) would be the mass of water that reacted.

So, the gas passing through must have been water vapor. But wait, no—Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant. It would absorb water from the gas mixture. So the weight gain is the mass of water in the gas.

So the first gas is H2O.

Then, the gas moves to tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. But the weight of tube 2 didn't change. Ca(OH)2 is a base; it would react with acidic gases. If no change, maybe the gas was not acidic. Or perhaps the gas didn't react with Ca(OH)2. So perhaps the gas was neutral, like CO2? No, wait, CO2 would form a precipitate with Ca(OH)2. Wait, but if the gas didn't react, maybe it's non-reactive, like an inert gas, or maybe the gas was something that didn't dissolve in water or react with Ca(OH)2.

But wait, maybe the gas is nitrogen or something else, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the gas is CO2, but wouldn't the solution react? Unless the Ca(OH)2 was in excess or something. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the second tube is for absorbing CO2, but if it didn't change, maybe there was no CO2.

Wait, but the third tube is red-hot copper. Copper at high temperatures can react with certain gases. For example, sulfur dioxide (SO2) can be oxidized by copper at high temperatures. Or maybe carbon monoxide (CO) reacts with
