Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: We want to dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of total volume. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to prepare this solution, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D.

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. It's a weak base, I think. To dissolve it, we probably need an acid. Strong acid, monobasic—like HCl, HNO3, etc. Monobasic means it donates one proton per molecule.

So, the reaction would be Fe(OH)3 reacting with the strong acid. Let's write the reaction equation. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, it should produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and Cl^- ions. The reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

Wait, wait, that's right. The acid provides H+ ions. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve.

First, I need to find the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams. Moles = mass/molar mass = 0.1 / 106.85.

Let me calculate that. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.000936 moles, or 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = ~0.000936 mol.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ (from the acid) to dissolve. So total H+ needed is 0.000936 * 3 = 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M (molarity) monobasic. So each liter (1000 cm³) of acid solution provides 0.1 moles of H+. We need 0.002808 mol.

The volume (V) can be found using M = moles / volume (in liters). Rearranged, volume = moles / M.

So V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but wait. Since the total solution volume is 100 cm³, and we're adding the acid to that, do I need to account for dilution? Or is the 100 cm³ the total after adding the acid?

Hmm, the question says "100 cm³ total volume." So I think the 100 cm³ is the final volume. So perhaps the initial volume is less, and the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3 solution to reach 100 cm³. Or maybe the 100 cm³ is just the volume after adding the acid, which might not be the case. Oh, wait, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the volume after dissolving is 100 cm³. So the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, which is in a certain volume, and the total comes to 100 cm³.

Wait, but wait. The initial state is that Fe(OH)3 is a solid. To dissolve it, you add acid. So let's think: the Fe(OH)3 is in some solution, perhaps in water. But the problem states the total volume after dissolving is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, the total becomes 100 cm³. So the acid's volume plus the solution's volume (from Fe(OH)3 and water) equals 100 cm³. But perhaps it's simpler to assume that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in some minimal volume of water, and then the acid is added to make the total volume 100 cm³. But maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the acid is simply added, and the total volume is 100 cm³, so the volume of acid is 100 cm³ minus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution. Hmm, but I don't know the volume of Fe(OH)3 solution. Maybe I can ignore it, assuming that the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in negligible volume compared to 100 cm³.

Wait, but that may not be correct. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the acid is added to the Fe(OH)3, and the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid is V, and when added to the Fe(OH)3 (which is in some minimal volume), the total is 100 cm³. But without knowing the initial volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution, perhaps the assumption is that the volume of the Fe(OH)3 in solution is negligible, so the volume of the acid is approximately 100 cm³. But that can't be, because adding 100 cm³ of acid would give a much higher amount than needed.

Wait, perhaps I should not worry about the volume change and just calculate the moles of H+ needed, then find the volume of 0.1 M acid required to provide that. Then, the resulting solution's pH can be calculated based on the concentration of H+ and the dilution.

So, back to the calculation. Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 9.36e-4 mol.

Moles of H+ needed = 3 * 9.36e-4 = 2.808e-3 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume V = 2.808e-3 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

So the minimum volume is approx 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is close. So the first part is about 28 cm³.

Now, the pH part. After dissolving the Fe(OH)3, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions and excess H+ from the acid, depending on whether all the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved.

Wait, because we're adding just enough acid to dissolve the Fe(OH)3, there should be no excess H+ from the acid beyond what's needed for the reaction. Wait, no, because in reality, when you add strong acid, it dissociates completely, so the H+ from the acid will react with Fe(OH)3. But wait, the reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So all the Fe(OH)3 will react with the H+ from the acid, and assuming we have exactly the required moles, there would be no excess H+ left. But wait, in reality, perhaps some H+ remains. Wait, let's think. The moles of H+ required are exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. If we add exactly that amount, then all Fe(OH)3 will dissolve, and the H+ will be consumed. So the solution would have Fe^3+ ions and any H+ from water, but in reality, if the solution is neutral, but since Fe^3+ is a weak acid (it can hydrolyze in water), it might make the solution acidic.

Wait, so after reacting, the solution contains Fe^3+ ions, and the solution's pH will depend on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's consider that the strong acid provides H+ which reacts with Fe(OH)3. Let's calculate the concentration of Fe^3+ and determine if any H+ is left over.

Wait, but let me proceed step by step.

First, the moles of Fe^3+ produced will be 0.000936 mol, as each Fe(OH)3 gives one Fe^3+.

The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is moles / volume = 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.

Now, Fe^3+ in water undergoes hydrolysis: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

So the Fe^3+ will act as an acid, producing H+ ions. The solution will be acidic because of this.

So the pH will be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. To find the pH, I can calculate the concentration of H+ from this hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. Let's assume that x is the concentration of H+ produced per liter.

The expression for K for the reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

Wait, but wait, I think the correct expression for the hydrolysis equilibrium is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 (aq) + 3 H+.

So K (hydrolysis) is equal to [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't remember the exact value of K for this reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the hydrolysis in terms of the acid dissociation. The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a weak acid. The hydrolysis constant, K_h, can be related to the K_a of Fe(OH)3, which is a base. Since Fe(OH)3 is a base, Kb = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3]. Then, Kw = Ka * Kb, so Ka = Kw / Kb.

But I don't remember the exact K value for Fe(OH)3. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the concentration of Fe^3+ and its hydrolysis.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. For a salt of a weak acid and strong base, like Fe^3+ from a strong acid (like HCl), the solution will be acidic. The pH can be calculated using the formula for a weak acid.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ 3 H+ + Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but more accurately, each Fe^3+ can produce 3 H+ because of the hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps an approximation can be made.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. Let's assume that x is the concentration of H+ produced. Then, according to the reaction, [H+] = 3x.

The expression would be:

K = (3x)^3 * [Fe(OH)3] / (0.00936 - x).

But without K, it's hard to proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis can be considered as a stepwise process, but perhaps it's easier to use the approximation that x is much smaller than the initial concentration of Fe^3+.

Wait, but if the concentration is low (0.00936 M), the hydrolysis might produce a significant amount of H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a salt of a weak acid. The pH can be found using the formula:

pH = (pKa + pKb)/2, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, I can consider that Fe^3+ hydrolyzes according to:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Assuming that the hydrolysis is complete enough that the solution is acidic, but I don't have the K value, so perhaps I can look for an alternative approach.

Wait, maybe I can calculate the pH by considering the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis.

Another approach: For a solution of Fe^3+ with concentration c, the pH can be found using the formula:

pH = (pKw - pKa) / 2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the hydrolysis expression.

Wait, let's think about the hydrolysis of Fe^3+. The reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But without knowing K, this approach may not work. Alternatively, perhaps I can find K using the solubility product of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the solubility product (Ksp) of Fe(OH)3 is known. Let me recall. I think Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-38, but I'm not certain. Let me check my memory. Yes, I think it's around 1e-37 to 1e-38. So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH-]^3.

But wait, for the hydrolysis reaction, perhaps it's better to write it in terms of K. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the K for the hydrolysis using Ksp and Kw.

Wait, the hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K_h = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so its base dissociation is:

Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

The base dissociation constant is Kb = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3].

The Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3, so Ksp = Kb * [Fe(OH)3].

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3, which is the same as the expression for Kb when [Fe^3+] and [OH^-]^3 are in solution.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Ksp and the hydrolysis.

Another approach: The solution after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in strong acid will contain Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but no, because the acid added is just enough to react with Fe(OH)3. So all H+ from the acid is used up in the reaction, leaving no excess. Therefore, the H+ in the solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think. The acid added is HCl (as an example). When HCl is added, it dissociates completely: H+ and Cl^-.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So the moles of H+ added exactly equal 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction, leaving no excess H+ from the acid. Therefore, the H+ in the solution comes solely from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. Now, let's model the hydrolysis.

Assume that the hydrolysis produces x amount of H+ per Fe^3+ ion. So each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ because of the 3 H+ in the reaction. Wait, no, the reaction is 1 Fe^3+ → 3 H+. So the concentration of H+ from hydrolysis would be 3x, where x is the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts.

But wait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps a better approach is to use the approximation that the hydrolysis produces a concentration of H+ such that [H+] = sqrt(3*Kw / [Fe^3+]).

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the pH can be found using the formula for a weak acid derived from the hydrolysis.

Let me think of Fe^3+ as a weak acid. The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions. The concentration of H+ can be found using the hydrolysis equilibrium.

The reaction is: Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+.

Wait, no, the correct hydrolysis steps may involve multiple steps, but perhaps for simplicity, I can consider the overall reaction as producing H+ and use the formula for a weak acid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid. The solution will be acidic because Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to produce H+.

The formula for pH in such cases is:

pH = ½ (pKa + pC), where C is the concentration of the salt.

Wait, no, that's for when the salt is from a strong base and a weak acid. For example, for a salt BA, where B is the conjugate base of a weak acid HA. Then, the pH can be found using:

pH = pKa + log([B]/[HA]).

But in this case, Fe^3+ is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3. So perhaps the pH can be found using the hydrolysis constant.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the hydrolysis equation as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But without knowing K, I can't proceed directly. So perhaps I can look up the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps I can find the K using the solubility product of Fe(OH)3. Because Fe(OH)3 is sparingly soluble, its Ksp is known.

The Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is approximately 6 × 10^-38. But how does that help with the hydrolysis?

Well, the solubility product is given by:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

In pure water, Fe(OH)3 would dissociate into Fe^3+ and OH^- ions. But when Fe^3+ is in solution, it can hydrolyze to produce H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the K for the hydrolysis can be found using Kw.

Wait, let's consider that the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But another approach is to relate K to the base dissociation constant of Fe(OH)3.

The base dissociation of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

The base dissociation constant is Kb = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 / [Fe(OH)3].

We know that Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So, Ksp = Kb * [Fe(OH)3].

Wait, but without knowing Kb, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the hydrolysis constant using Kw.

Wait, the hydrolysis reaction produces H+, so if I can find the K for that, I can relate it to Kw.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way.

Wait, perhaps if I assume that the solution is so dilute that the hydrolysis is significant, and the pH is determined by the hydrolysis. Let's calculate the concentration of H+ from Fe^3+.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me let x be the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts. Then, [Fe(OH)3] = x, and [H+] = 3x.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = (x)( (3x)^3 ) / (0.00936 - x).

But without knowing K, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can look up the value of K for this hydrolysis reaction. Alternatively, perhaps I can find that the pH is around 2.04, as one of the options suggests. Option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an assumption that the solution is 0.00936 M Fe^3+ and that the pH is determined by the hydrolysis. Let's say that each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+ ions, leading to [H+] = sqrt(3*Kw/[Fe^3+}).

Wait, that might not be correct, but perhaps I can approximate. Let's try.

Assuming that the hydrolysis produces H+ as per the reaction, but perhaps it's better to model it as a weak acid.

Another approach: Since Fe^3+ is a weak acid, the pH can be found using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( (3 * c) * K )

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps use the approximation for a weak acid where [H+] = sqrt( (3 * c) * K ), but I'm not certain about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I can simplify by assuming that the hydrolysis is complete enough that the concentration of H+ is significant.

But without the K value, this is challenging. Let me think about another approach. Maybe the solution is to find the pH based on the excess H+ from the acid, but earlier I thought that the H+ from the acid is completely consumed in the reaction. So the H+ comes only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is wrong. Maybe some H+ remains because the acid is in excess. Let me re-examine the stoichiometry.

The moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.000936 mol. Each needs 3 H+ → 0.002808 mol H+.

The acid is 0.1 M, so if we add V liters, the moles of H+ provided are 0.1 * V.

But wait, the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So the H+ from the acid is exactly used up if V*0.1 = 0.002808 → V=0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³.

So in this case, all the H+ from the acid is consumed, leaving no excess. Therefore, the H+ in solution comes only from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So the [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M.

Now, to find the pH due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Another approach: The hydrolysis can be modeled as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But without K, I can't proceed. So perhaps I should look up the value of K for this reaction.

After a quick search in my memory, I recall that the K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is about 1e-34 or something similar. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 to find the pH.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6 × 10^-38 at 25°C.

Fe(OH)3 dissociates as Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

In the solution, [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M.

So, 0.00936 * [OH^-]^3 = 6e-38 → [OH^-]^3 = 6e-38 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.41e-35 → [OH^-] ≈ cube root of 6.41e-35 ≈ 4.01e-12 M.

pOH = -log(4.01e-12) ≈ 11.398 → pH = 14 - 11.398 ≈ 2.602.

Wait, that would give a pH of about 2.6. Looking at the options, option B has pH 2.69 and option C has pH 2.04. Hmm, this is in the ballpark.

But wait, wait. Let me redo the calculation.

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

Ksp = 6e-38 = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = 6e-38 / 0.00936 = approx 6.41e-36 → [OH^-] = cube root (6.41e-36) ≈ 4.01e-12 M.

pOH = -log(4.01e-12) ≈ 11.398 → pH = 14 - 11.398 ≈ 2.602.

So pH ≈ 2.6. Looking at the options, option B is pH 2.69, which is close.

Wait, but wait. I think I made a mistake here. Because Fe(OH)3 dissociates into Fe^3+ and 3 OH^-.

So, [OH^-] = 3 * sqrt(Ksp / [Fe^3+} )^(1/3).

Wait, let me correct that. Solving for [OH^-]:

[OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+] → [OH^-] = cube_root( Ksp / [Fe^3+] )

Which is cube_root(6e-38 / 0.00936) → cube_root(6.41e-36) ≈ 4.01e-12 M.

So pOH = 11.398 → pH = 2.602.

So pH is approximately 2.6, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69.

Wait, but option C is pH 2.04, which is lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that all H+ from the acid is consumed. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, the acid is 0.1 M, and I calculated the required volume as 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's volume. But option C's pH is 2.04, which is much lower than the 2.6 I calculated.

So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution also contains the Cl^- ions from the acid, which are spectator ions and don't affect the pH.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the solution isn't just the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Because when the strong acid is added, it provides H+ which may leave some excess H+ if the stoichiometry is not exact.

Wait, let me double-check the stoichiometry. Each Fe(OH)3 needs 3 H+.

Moles of Fe(OH)3: 0.000936 mol.

Moles of H+ needed: 0.002808 mol.

Moles of H+ provided by the acid: 0.1 M * V (in liters) = 0.1 V.

So, if 0.1 V = 0.002808 → V=28.08 cm³.

So, all H+ is used up, no excess. So the only H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Thus, the pH should be around 2.6, matching option B's pH of 2.69. But wait, my calculation gave 2.60, which is close to 2.69.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recalculate the Ksp calculation.

Ksp = 6e-38.

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

[OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+] = 6e-38 / 0.00936.

6e-38 / 0.00936 = 6 / 0.00936 * 1e-38 = approx 641.025 * 1e-38 = 6.41025e-36.

Cube root of 6.41025e-36 is (6.41025)^(1/3) * 1e-12.

Cube root of 6.41 is approximately 1.857, because 1.857^3 ≈ 6.4.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.857e-12 M.

pOH = -log(1.857e-12) ≈ 11.73 → pH = 14 - 11.73 = 2.27.

Wait, that's around 2.27. Hmm, that's lower than my previous calculation. Did I make a mistake in the cube root?

Wait, 1.857^3 = 1.857 * 1.857 = approx 3.449, then *1.857 → approx 6.4. So yes, cube root of 6.4 is ~1.857.

So [OH^-] is 1.857e-12 → pOH is about 11.73 → pH is 2.27, which is around 2.27.

But none of the options have 2.27. Looking at the options:

A) 3.16

B) 2.69

C) 2.04

D)4.94

So 2.27 is closest to option C's 2.04 or B's 2.69. Hmm, but it's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the pH more accurately.

Let me compute [OH^-] = cube_root(6e-38 / 0.00936) exactly.

Compute 6e-38 / 0.00936 = 6e-38 / 9.36e-3 = 6/(9.36e2) * 1e-35 → 6/(936) = approx 0.0064102564 → 0.0064102564e-35 = 6.4102564e-36.

Cube root of 6.4102564e-36 is (6.4102564)^(1/3) * (1e-36)^(1/3) → 1.857 * 1e-12 → 1.857e-12 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.857e-12 → pOH = -log(1.857e-12).

Calculating log(1.857e-12) = log(1.857) + log(1e-12) → 0.2688 -12 → -11.7312.

So pOH = 11.7312 → pH = 14 - 11.7312 = 2.2688 → approximately 2.27.

But none of the options exactly match this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps another factor is that the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes in steps, each producing H+.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution contains both Fe^3+ and H+ from the strong acid. Wait, no, because all the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the concentration of H+ from both the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and any excess H+ from the acid. But earlier, I thought there's no excess.

Wait, perhaps the acid added is more than needed, providing excess H+. Let me re-examine the stoichiometry.

Wait, no. The moles of H+ added are exactly 0.002808 mol, which is exactly what's needed for the reaction. So no excess H+; all is consumed.

So the only H+ comes from the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Thus, the pH should be about 2.27, which isn't exactly any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps the options are approximations. Option C has pH 2.04, which is lower than 2.27, and option B has 2.69, which is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the Fe(OH)3 may not completely dissolve, but the question asks for the minimum volume needed to dissolve it, so all Fe(OH)3 is reacted.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the solution volume is 100 cm³, so when the acid is added, the concentration of H+ is higher, but considering the dilution.

Wait, no, because the acid volume is being added to make the total volume 100 cm³. So the [H+] from the acid before reacting is 0.1 M * (V_acid) / 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to model the situation where the H+ from the acid is in excess, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis, but I'm missing a factor of 3 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: The Fe^3+ ion can hydrolyze in three steps, each producing H+.

But perhaps I should model it as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But without K, perhaps I can relate it to the Ksp.

Wait, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

From the hydrolysis reaction, [H+] = 3x, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express K in terms of Kw.

Wait, K for the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But [Fe(OH)3] is present in solution and can be expressed in terms of Ksp.

Alternatively, perhaps I can substitute [Fe(OH)3] from the Ksp expression.

From Ksp: [Fe(OH)3] = Ksp / [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

Wait, I'm getting stuck.

Another approach: Let me calculate the pH using the hydrolysis and the concentration of Fe^3+.

The concentration is 0.00936 M. The pH is determined by the H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Assuming that the hydrolysis produces H+ such that:

[H+] = (3 * [Fe^3+])^(1/2) * K.

Wait, perhaps using the formula for a weak acid where the concentration is c and the degree of ionization is x, leading to [H+] = 3x.

But without K, I can't proceed.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate that the hydrolysis is complete, but that may not be the case.

Another idea: Fe^3+ is a weak acid, and the pH can be found using the formula for a weak acid where [H+] is given by sqrt(ka * c), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should search for the Ka of Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Suppose the Ka is known.

Wait, I think the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is about 6e-3 (but I'm not certain). Wait, that would give a pH around 2.2, which aligns with the earlier calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which has pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³. Because the volume matches, and the pH is close to 2.27, but perhaps due to rounding, it's 2.04.

Wait, but 2.04 is quite a bit lower than 2.27. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp calculation. Let me double-check.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38. So [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

[OH^-]^3 = 6e-38 / 0.00936 = 6.410256e-36 → [OH^-] = cube root of 6.410256e-36 → approx 4.01e-12 M.

pOH = -log(4.01e-12) → approx 11.398 → pH = 2.602.

Wait, that's about 2.6, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me compute the cube root of 6.41e-36 more accurately.

Compute 6.41e-36^(1/3):

6.41e-36 = 6.41 × 10^-36.

The cube root of 6.41 is approximately 1.857, and the cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12. So cube root is 1.857e-12.

So [OH^-] = 1.857e-12 M → pOH = -log(1.857e-12) = ?

Log(1.857e-12) = log(1.857) + log(1e-12) → 0.2688 -12 → -11.7312 → pOH = 11.7312 → pH = 2.2688 → approximately 2.27.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match, but option B is 2.69, which is higher than this, and option C is 2.04, which is lower. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the solution contains H+ from both the acid and the hydrolysis.

Wait, but earlier assumption was that the acid's H+ is completely consumed. So only H+ from hydrolysis remains.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps I should consider that when the strong acid is added, it not only reacts with Fe(OH)3 but also contributes to the H+ concentration, which affects the pH.

Wait, but in that case, the [H+] would be higher than just from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Wait, perhaps the pH should be calculated considering both the H+ from the acid (excess) and the hydrolysis.

Wait, but in the reaction, the acid provides exactly 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3, so all H+ is consumed, leaving none. So the only H+ comes from Fe^3+.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis.

But I'm stuck between options B and C. The calculated pH is around 2.27, which is closer to option C's 2.04 or B's 2.69.

Wait, perhaps the actual K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is different. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correct K value for the hydrolysis. Let me see if I can find it.

Upon checking, the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is approximately 6.8e-3 (source: some chemistry references). Wait, if Ka is 6.8e-3, then pH can be calculated as:

For a weak acid with Ka and concentration c, the pH is given by:

pH = ½ (pKa - log c )

Wait, that's one of the approximations for weak acids when c >> sqrt(Ka * c).

Wait, but let's calculate it more accurately.

Ka = 6.8e-3.

Concentration c = 0.00936 M.

The H+ concentration can be found using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( Ka * c )

So [H+] = sqrt(6.8e-3 * 0.00936) → sqrt(6.8e-3 * 9.36e-3) → sqrt(6.3648e-5) → approx 0.007978 M.

pH = -log(0.007978) ≈ 2.096 → approximately 2.10.

This would round to 2.10, which is closer to option C's pH of 2.04. But I'm not sure if the Ka I used is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ka value is different. Another source might give a different Ka.

Wait, perhaps the correct Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is around 5.6e-3. Let's try that.

Ka = 5.6e-3.

[H+] = sqrt(5.6e-3 * 0.00936) = sqrt(5.2416e-5) → approx 0.00724 M.

pH = -log(0.00724) → 2.14.

Hmm, that's closer to option C's 2.04, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct Ka is 1.1e-3, which would give:

[H+] = sqrt(1.1e-3 * 0.00936) → sqrt(1.0296e-5) → approx 0.003209 M.

pH = -log(0.003209) → approx 2.506.

Hmm, that's closer to option B's pH of 2.69.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, given that the volume matches, but the pH is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the options have rounded the numbers, and the correct pH is around 2.27, which is not listed exactly, but perhaps option B is the closest.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me think again: I used Ksp to find [OH^-], which gave me pH ~2.27. But perhaps the Ksp is given as 6e-38, which I might have wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ksp is 1e-37 or 1e-38. Let me verify.

Upon checking, Fe(OH)3's Ksp is indeed around 6e-38 at 25°C.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values.

Let me recalculate the [OH^-]:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

Ksp = 6e-38 = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = (6e-38) / 0.00936 → 6e-38 / 9.36e-3 → 6.4102564e-36.

Cube root of 6.4102564e-36:

Compute 6.4102564e-36 = 6.4102564 × 10^-36.

Cube root of 6.4102564 is approximately 1.857.

Cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12.

So [OH^-] = 1.857e-12 M.

pOH = -log(1.857e-12) → log(1.857) is approx 0.2688 → pOH = 11.7312 → pH = 2.2688.

So pH is approximately 2.27.

Looking at the options, none match exactly, but the closest is option B (2.69) and option C (2.04). But 2.27 is closer to option C than to B.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the acid provides some excess H+ beyond what is needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3.

Wait, no, because the moles of H+ added are exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, so no excess.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, with pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³. Because the volume matches, and perhaps the pH is due to a more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the hydrolysis and should calculate the pH using the correct approach.

Wait, another approach: The solution after adding the acid and dissolving Fe(OH)3 will have Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. The Cl^- is a spectator ion, so it doesn't affect pH. The Fe^3+ hydrolyzes as follows:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Let me denote x as the concentration of Fe^3+ that reacts. So, [Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (if x is small).

The H+ concentration is 3x.

The K for the reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I don't know K. So perhaps I can express K in terms of Kw and Ksp.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 dissociates into Fe^3+ and OH^-: Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

The Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

The base dissociation constant Kb is Ksp / [Fe(OH)3].

But for the hydrolysis reaction, K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I'm not making progress without knowing K.

Perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the given options. The volume of 28.08 cm³ matches option C, and the pH is around 2.27, which is not an option. But perhaps the closest is option B or C.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.

The question asks for the pH of the resulting solution. The solution contains Fe^3+ ions, which are weak acids, so the solution will be acidic.

The calculated pH is approximately 2.27. The options are:

A) 3.16

B) 2.69

C) 2.04

D)4.94

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the solution is more acidic, hence the pH closer to 2.04.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct pH is calculated using the formula for the hydrolysis, taking into account that [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M and K is 6e-38, leading to [OH^-] = cube_root(6e-38 / 0.00936) = cube_root(6.41e-36) = 4.01e-12 M.

pOH = 11.398 → pH = 2.602.

So pH is approximately 2.6, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69.

But wait, option B's pH is 2.69, and my calculation gives 2.60, which is about 2.6. So perhaps option B is the intended answer.

Wait, but the volume found was 28.08 cm³, which matches option C (28.05 cm³). So option C has a pH of 2.04, which is lower than my calculation.

This is confusing. Perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, let me recheck the stoichiometry. Fe(OH)3 requires 3 H+ per formula unit. So moles of H+ needed = 3 × 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³. So the correct volume is 28.08 cm³, matching option C's 28.05 cm³.

So volume-wise, option C is correct.

But the pH calculation is giving me around 2.27, which is not exactly any of the options. But perhaps the intended pH is 2.04, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Ksp value. If the Ksp were higher, the pH would be lower.

Wait, if Ksp were 6e-37 instead of 6e-38, then [OH^-]^3 = 6e-37 / 0.00936 = 6.41e-35 → [OH^-] = cube_root(6.41e-35) ≈ 4.0e-12 M → same pOH as before, pH 2.6.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, even though the pH doesn't exactly match my calculation. Alternatively, perhaps another factor is at play.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid, but that would require that the acid is in excess. But in this case, the acid is added exactly to neutralize Fe(OH)3, so no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps I should think that when the acid is added, the solution becomes more acidic, but that's not the case because all H+ is consumed.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the [H+] from water autoionization, but that's negligible.

I'm stuck between options B and C. The volume clearly matches option C. The pH calculation from Ksp gives 2.60, which is close to option B's 2.69. So perhaps option B is the intended correct answer, with pH 2.69 and volume 30.09 cm³. But wait, that volume doesn't match.

Wait, wait, option B's volume is 30.09 cm³, which is higher than our calculated 28.08. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check the number of moles again.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So:

Fe: 55.85

O: 3 × 16 = 48 → 55.85 + 48 = 103.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the molar mass earlier. I thought Fe(OH)3 is 106.85 g/mol, but let me recalculate.

Fe(OH)3: Fe is 55.85, each OH- is 17 (16+1), so three OH- is 51. So total is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Ah, no, I was correct. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol = 0.0009358 mol.

Moles of H+ needed: 3 × 0.0009358 = 0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M acid: 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.

So the volume is definitely 28.07 cm³, matching option C's 28.05 cm³.

So the pH part must be option C's 2.04. How?

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution's H+ comes from both Fe^3+ hydrolysis and the strong acid. But no, the strong acid's H+ is consumed.

Alternative approach: Perhaps the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid after the reaction. But earlier calculation said there's no excess.

Wait, perhaps I should recount:

Moles of H+ added = 0.1 M × V.

Moles of H+ needed = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3 → 0.002808 mol.

So, if the acid added provides exactly 0.002808 mol, all H+ is consumed.

Therefore, the H+ in solution comes only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So, pH should be around 2.27, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option C, with pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct pH is 2.04, calculated differently.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that Fe^3+ hydrolyzes to produce H+ in a 3:1 ratio, leading to a higher [H+].

But I'm not getting anywhere. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, as the volume matches.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the following steps are considered:

### Step 1: Moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)₃} = 55.85 + 3(16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The number of moles of Fe(OH)₃ is:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)₃} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of H⁺ Required
The reaction of Fe(OH)₃ with a strong acid is:
\[
\text{Fe(OH)₃} + 3 \text{H⁺} \rightarrow \text{Fe³⁺} + 3 \text{H₂O}.
\]
From the stoichiometry, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ requires 3 moles of H⁺. Thus, the moles of H⁺ required are:
\[
\text{Moles of H⁺} = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Volume of Acid Required
The acid is 0.1 M (moles per liter). The volume of acid required to provide 0.002808 moles of H⁺ is:
\[
\text{Volume of acid} = \frac{\text{Moles of H⁺}}{\text{Molarity of acid}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

### Step 4: pH of the Resulting Solution
After dissolving Fe(OH)₃, the solution contains Fe³⁺ ions, which hydrolyze in water:
\[
\text{Fe³⁺} + 3 \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)₃} + 3 \text{H⁺}.
\]
The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:
\[
[\text{Fe³⁺}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe³⁺}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.000936}{0.1} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]
The solubility product constant (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃ is \(6 \times 10^{-38}\). Using the relationship:
\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe³⁺}][\text{OH}^-]^3,
\]
\[
[\text{OH}^-]^3 = \frac{K_{sp}}{[\text{Fe³⁺}]} = \frac{6 \times 10^{-38}}{0.00936} \approx 6.41 \times 10^{-36}.
\]
Taking the cube root:
\[
[\text{OH}^-] \approx \sqrt[3]{6.41 \times 10^{-36}} \approx 4.01 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pOH is:
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(4.01 \times 10^{-12})} \approx 11.398.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 11.398 \approx 2.602.
\]
This calculated pH is approximately 2.6, which is close to option B's pH of 2.69.

### Step 5: Matching with Options
- **Volume**: The calculated volume of acid required is \(28.08 \, \text{cm³}\), which matches option C's \(28.05 \, \text{cm³}\).
- **pH**: The calculated pH is approximately \(2.6\), which is closest to option B's pH of \(2.69\).

However, since the volume matches option C, and the pH calculation may involve approximations, the best match is:

ANSWER: C
