Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about planets transiting and occulting each other, and finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet. 

First, let me read the problem again carefully. So, there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. It has an impact parameter of 0.2 when it transits, and it's around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period is 3 days. Now, a second planet, bigger—2.5 Earth radii—is also in the same system. We need to find the maximum period of this second planet so that both transit and occultation events happen. 

Wait, transit and occultation. Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the star blocks it. For both of these to happen, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the second planet passes in front of and behind the first planet from our perspective.

But wait, no, I think the scenario is that the second planet's orbit must be such that it transits the star (so we see it in front) and also that the first planet can sometimes be behind the star from our view (occultation). Or maybe the question is that both planets transit each other? Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think.

Wait, the question says the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. Oh, wait, no
