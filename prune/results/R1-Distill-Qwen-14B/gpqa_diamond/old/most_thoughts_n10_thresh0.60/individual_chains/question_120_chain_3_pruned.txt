Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution based on parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in astronomy. Parallax is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is that the distance d (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of the parallax plx (in arcseconds), so d = 1/plx. Yeah, that makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Wait, uniform distribution in space might imply that the number of stars doesn't change with distance, but here the question is about how the number per unit range of parallax changes with plx. So, I think it's about the density of stars in terms of parallax.

Let me think. If stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means their number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. So, in a given volume, the number of stars is the same regardless of where you look. But parallax depends on distance, so we need to consider how the number of stars per unit change in parallax (like plx) changes as plx varies.

So, the problem is to find how N(plx) dplx relates to plx. N(plx) is the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, I need to find how N depends on plx.

Since distance d = 1/plx, if we think in terms of distance shells, each shell at distance d has a thickness of dd. The volume of a thin spherical shell is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in a shell would be the number density n multiplied by the volume: n * 4πd² dd.

But wait, the question is about the number per unit plx. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Let's express everything in terms of plx.

First, express dd in terms of dplx. Since d = 1/plx, dd = -1/(plx)^2 dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're considering the magnitude, we can ignore the negative for now. So, dd = 1/(plx²) dplx.

Now, substituting into the number of stars in a shell: n * 4π d² dd. Let's plug in d = 1/plx and dd = dplx/(plx²).

So, number of stars = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx / plx²) )
Simplify that: n * 4π * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = n * 4π * (1/plx^4) dplx.

So, the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is proportional to 1/(plx^4). But wait, let me double-check that.

Alternatively, we can model the distribution in terms of parallax. The number of stars in a range plx to plx + dplx would be the number density multiplied by the volume between those two distances.

But another approach: think about the volume element in terms of parallax. Since d = 1/plx, the volume element in terms of parallax would involve the derivative of d with respect to
