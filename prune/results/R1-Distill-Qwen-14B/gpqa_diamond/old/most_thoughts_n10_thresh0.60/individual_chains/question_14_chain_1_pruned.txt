Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I need to figure out why some peaks disappeared when using a different fixation method. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that ChIP-seq is a method used to determine the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. It involves crosslinking proteins to DNA, shearing the DNA, using an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the bound DNA, and then sequencing those fragments.

The question mentions two different fixation methods: one uses PFA (paraformaldehyde) alone, and the other uses PFA combined with DSG (dithiothreitol). Wait, I think PFA is a common crosslinker that formaldehyde-based, which crosslinks proteins to DNA and each other. But why would they add DSG in the other case?

DSG is a reducing agent. Oh right! Sometimes, when you fix with formaldehyde (like in PFA), the proteins can form disulfide bonds with each other. DSG is used to break those disulfide bonds. This usually results in a more efficient crosslinking because without DSG, proteins might be stuck together, making it harder to shear the DNA or isolate the regions you're interested in.

So the experiment here used PFA alone in one case and PFA+DSG in another. The peaks (indicating binding sites) disappeared with the latter. That suggests that the PFA+DSG treatment somehow removed the signals that were present when only PFA was used.

Wait, why would that happen? Maybe the PFA without DSG allowed some proteins to crosslink in a way that made them more accessible for the antibody. Or perhaps when DSG is used, it breaks certain crosslinks that are important for the antibody to recognize the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the regions where the peaks were called are more prone to losing crosslinking efficiency when DSG is added. Let me think about where IKAROS binds. IKAROS is a transcription factor, so it should bind to regulatory regions like promoters and enhancers. Those regions are usually active and have specific histone modifications, like open chromatin.

Hmm, but why would the peaks vanish? Maybe the crosslinking in the PFA+DSG method doesn't capture those regions as effectively. Or perhaps, without DSG, certain regions are more efficiently crosslinked, making them easier to pull down. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the process again.

In ChIP, you fix the cells
