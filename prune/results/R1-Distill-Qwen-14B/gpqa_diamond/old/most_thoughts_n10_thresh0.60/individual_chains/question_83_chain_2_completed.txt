Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water, then titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A to D. The Ka of acetic acid is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think I need to figure out what's happening during the titration. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When you titrate them, they neutralize each other to form acetate ions and water.

Let me break this down into parts. First, what's the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution?

So, initially, we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. When we dilute it with 20 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the new concentration can be calculated using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) / 40 = 0.025 M. Okay, so the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, during titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid initially.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: volume is 40 cm³ or 0.04 L. So moles = concentration * volume = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. So the equivalence point requires 0.001 moles of NaOH. Since the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So at equivalence point, 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

Now, the question is about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence. Let's take each point.

First, 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is 2.5 cm³ (since equivalence is 10 cm³). So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

Moles of NaOH added: 0.0025 L * 0.1 M = 0.00025 moles. Since the acetic acid is 0.001 moles, so NaOH neutralizes 0.00025 moles of it. So the moles of acetic acid left are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. The moles of acetate (CH3COO^-) formed will be 0.00025 moles.

The total solution volume after adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

The pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me calculate that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so pKa is 4.733 (since 1e-5 is 5, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, no, wait: 1.85e-5 has log(1.85) ≈ 0.267, so pKa = 4.733? Because 1e-5 is 5, 1.85e-5 is 5 - 0.267 = 4.733? Wait, actually no. Because log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

So pH = 4.733 + log([0.005882]/[0.017647]).

Calculate the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333.

Log(0.3333) is approximately -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256.

Hmm, looking at the options, option A is 4.26; that's close. Option D is 4.57. So option A's first value is 4.26, which matches.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made an error in the ratio.

Wait, [A^-] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M. [HA] is 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

So the ratio is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333, which is about 1/3. Log(1/3) is log(0.333) ≈ -0.477. So yes, pH is 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So approximately 4.26. That's the first part.

Now, the equivalence point. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Since sodium is a strong acid, it will dissociate completely, and the solution will contain CH3COO^- and Na+.

The concentration of acetate: The moles of acetate at equivalence are 0.001 moles (from the original acetic acid). The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

So [CH3COO^-] = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid. In water, it will hydrolyze according to:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14, Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) ≈ 5.4054e-10.

Now, to find the pH, we can use the formula for a weak base:

pOH = (pKb + log C)/2, but wait, that's an approximation when C >> Kb. Let me check the concentration and Kb.

C is 0.02 M, Kb is 5.4e-10. 0.02 is much larger than 5.4e-10, so the approximation should be okay.

So pOH = (pKb + log C) / 2.

Wait, wait, no. The formula for a weak base is:

For a base B: B + H2O ↔ BH+ + OH^-.

The expression is Kb = [BH+][OH^-]/[B].

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced, then Kb ≈ x² / C, so x ≈ sqrt(Kb * C).

But when Kb is very small compared to C, this approximation holds.

So let's compute [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt(5.4054e-10 * 0.02).

Let me compute that:

5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

Square root of that is sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. Wait, log(1e-5)=5, log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)=5.017. So pOH is approximately 4.983.

Then, pH = 14 - pOH ≈ 14 -4.983 ≈ 9.017.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, because none of the options have equivalence point pH around 9. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the Kb is 5.4054e-10, correct. The concentration is 0.02 M.

So Kb = 5.4054e-10 = (x^2) / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is so small, x is much less than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02.

So x^2 ≈ 5.4054e-10 * 0.02 = 1.08108e-11.

So x = sqrt(1.08108e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5. Then pOH = 4.98.

pH = 14 -4.98 ≈ 9.02.

But the options for equivalence points are 8.52 (A), 6.73 (B), 7.00 (C), 6.92 (D). None of these are near 9. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, wait, sodium acetate would produce a basic solution. So why are all the options' equivalence points lower than 7? That can't be right. Unless I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I messed up the Kb. Let me check again.

Ka of acetic acid is 1.85e-5. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = 5.405e-10. That's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps when calculating the concentration after dilution, I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, when the solution is titrated, what's the volume at equivalence? The original solution is 40 cm³, we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, so 50 cm³ total.

Wait, let me recalculate the concentration of acetate. Moles are 0.001, volume 0.05 L.

So 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. That's right.

Wait, perhaps the Kb is calculated wrong, but no, 1e-14 /1.85e-5 is indeed ~5.4e-10.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating the pH. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, [OH-] = 1.04e-5. pOH is -log(1.04e-5).

Log(1.04)=0.017, so log(1.04e-5)=5.017. So pOH=4.983, pH=9.017.

Wait, but the options don't have anything near that. So I'm either making a mistake here or perhaps the question is considering that acetate is a weak base and not accounting for activity coefficients. Or maybe I messed up the initial steps.

Wait, wait, wait a minute. Oh! I think I see my mistake. Wait, at equivalence, the solution is sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base. Sodium comes from NaOH, which is a strong base, so the solution should be basic. So the pH should be above 7. But all the options have equivalence pH below 7. That can't be right. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial calculation of moles. Let me double-check that.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 40 cm³ (0.04 L) of 0.025 M. So 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Correct.

At equivalence, all of that is converted to acetate. So that's correct.

So the calculation seems right. Hmm. So why are all the options giving equivalence pH below 7? That must mean I made a mistake somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the Kb incorrectly. Maybe I should have used the formula for a weak base with [OH-] = sqrt(Kb * C). But let me think again.

Wait, for a weak base, the formula is Kb = [OH-]^2 / [B], assuming [OH-] = x and [B] ≈ C - x ≈ C. So x = sqrt(Kb * C).

Wait, that's correct. So x ≈ 1.04e-5, which is [OH-] = 1.04e-5.

pOH is 4.98, pH is 9.02. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, wait, perhaps I forgot that sodium acetate is a salt and perhaps the hydrolysis is different. Wait, no, sodium acetate dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Maybe I should have used the Ka instead of Kb.

Wait, no, because acetate is a base, so Kb is correct. Let me double-check the Kb. 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = 5.405e-10. Correct.

Hmm, maybe the mistake is elsewhere. Let me think about the volume again. At equivalence, adding 10 cm³ of NaOH to 40 cm³ of solution: 50 cm³ total. So the concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the pH more accurately without approximations.

So let's set up the equation without approximation.

The hydrolysis of acetate is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

Let the concentration of OH^- be x. Then, [CH3COOH] is x, and [CH3COO^-] is 0.02 - x.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) = 5.405e-10.

Assuming x is very small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02, so x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5. So same as before.

But perhaps the approximation isn't good enough. Let's check the value.

x is about 1.04e-5, which is 1e-5. 0.02 is 2e-2. So 1e-5 is much smaller than 2e-2, so the approximation holds. Hence, the pH should be around 9.02.

But none of the options match this. So I'm definitely missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the half-equivalence point or something else. Wait, no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is that I diluted the acetic acid first, and the initial dilution affects the solution. Maybe I made a mistake in the dilution calculation.

Wait, original solution: 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Diluted to 40 cm³.

So moles of acetic acid after dilution: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct.

Ah! Wait a minute, perhaps after adding NaOH, the solution is not just acetate ions. Oh, wait, NaOH is a strong base; it dissociates completely, so the Na+ doesn't affect pH. So the acetate is the only thing influencing pH.

Wait, unless I'm missing the fact that the solution now has Na+ and CH3COO^- in solution, and perhaps the activity coefficients are considered, but I think that's beyond the scope here.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the concentration of acetate is 0.02 M, which is correct. So I don't see the mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [OH^-]. Let me recalculate that.

Kb = 5.405e-10.

So Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) ≈ x² / 0.02 = 5.405e-10.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) = approx 3.288e-6. Wait, wait! Wait, that's different from before. Wait, 1.081e-11 is 1.081 * 1e-11. Square root of 1e-11 is 1e-5.5=3.16e-6. Square root of 1.081 is about 1.04, so 1.04 * 3.16e-6=3.28e-6. Wait, wait, no: 3.16e-6 is sqrt(1e-11). So sqrt(1.081e-11) = sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11) ≈ 1.04 * 3.16e-6 = 3.28e-6.

Wait, so [OH^-] is approximately 3.28e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.28e-6) ≈ 5.48.

pH = 14 -5.48=8.52.

Ah! So that's 8.52. Option A has pH 8.52 at equivalence. So that would make sense.

Wait, wait, so why did I get a different value earlier? Oh! Because I must have made a calculation mistake earlier.

Wait, let me recompute. 5.405e-10 * 0.02 is 1.081e-11. The square root of 1.081e-11 is sqrt(1.081) * sqrt(1e-11). sqrt(1e-11) is 1e-5.5 which is 3.16e-6. sqrt(1.081)= approx 1.04.

So 3.16e-6 * 1.04 = 3.28e-6. So [OH^-] is 3.28e-6. So pOH is -log(3.28e-6).

Log(3.28e-6) = log(3.28) + log(1e-6) = 0.5158 -6 = -5.484.

So pOH=5.484. pH=14-5.484=8.516, approximately 8.52.

So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52. Which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I computed [OH^-] as 1.04e-5, that would give pOH=4.98, which would give pH=9.02. But that was a mistake. So where did I go wrong the first time?

Ah! Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the square root. Let me compute 1.081e-11.

Wait, 1.081e-11 is 10.81e-12. The square root of 10.81e-12 is sqrt(10.81)*1e-6. sqrt(10.81)=3.287, so 3.287e-6. Yes. So [OH^-]=3.287e-6. So pOH=5.48, pH=8.52. So that's where the 8.52 comes from.

So now, summary:

At 25% titration, the pH is approximately 4.26.

At equivalence, pH is approximately 8.52.

Looking at the options, option A is (4.26; 8.52). So that's the correct choice.

But wait, why earlier when I first calculated [OH^-], I thought it was 1.04e-5? Oh, I think I confused the exponents. I think I multiplied 1e-5 by 1.04e-5, which is incorrect. No, wait, no, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, Kb=5.405e-10 = x² / 0.02.

So x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11)= approximately 3.287e-6.

So [OH-]=3.287e-6.

pOH= -log(3.287e-6) = 5.48.

pH=14-5.48=8.52.

Yes, that's correct.

So the equivalence point pH is 8.52, and the 25% titration pH is 4.26. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the 25% pH calculation.

Let me double-check the 25% titration.

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (10 cm³) is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Moles of NaOH added: 2.5 cm³ * 0.1 M = 0.25 mmol.

Original moles of acetic acid were 1 mmol (0.001 mol).

After reaction, moles of acetic acid = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 mmol.

Moles of acetate formed = 0.25 mmol.

Total volume = 40 +2.5 =42.5 cm³ = 42.5 mL =0.0425 L.

Concentrations:

[CH3COOH] = 0.75 /42.5 = 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.25 /42.5 = 0.005882 M.

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA]).

pKa is 4.733.

Log(0.005882/0.017647) = log(0.3333) = -0.477.

So pH =4.733 -0.477≈4.256. So about 4.26.

So that's correct. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking back, option D is 4.57; maybe I did something wrong in the log calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute the exact value.

The ratio is 0.25/0.75 = 1/3.

So log(1/3) = log(0.333333...)= -0.4771.

So pH =4.733 -0.4771=4.2559, which is approximately 4.26.

So yes, correct.

So the correct options are 4.26 (25%) and 8.52 (equivalence). So option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution. Initially, 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid is diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water, resulting in a total volume of 40.00 cm³. Using the dilution formula \( M_1V_1 = M_2V_2 \), the new concentration is:

\[
M_2 = \frac{M_1V_1}{V_2} = \frac{0.05 \times 20}{40} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.025 \, \text{M} \times 0.04 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
\]

During titration with 0.1 M NaOH, the equivalence point occurs when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Since the moles of NaOH required are equal to the moles of acetic acid, the equivalence point volume of NaOH is:

\[
V_{\text{NaOH}} = \frac{\text{Moles of NaOH}}{\text{Concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.001}{0.1} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm³}.
\]

At the equivalence point, the solution contains 0.001 moles of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) in a total volume of \( 40.00 + 10.00 = 50.00 \, \text{cm³} \). The concentration of acetate is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{\text{Moles of acetate}}{\text{Volume of solution}} = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

The acetate ion acts as a weak base, hydrolyzing in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate is calculated using \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} \), where \( K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14} \) and \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
K_b = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} = 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b = \frac{x^2}{C} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \) and \( C = 0.02 \, \text{M} \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot C = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.28 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(3.28 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.48.
\]

The pH at the equivalence point is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.48 = 8.52.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence volume (2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH) has been added. The moles of NaOH added are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The moles of acetate formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate} = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 + 2.50 = 42.50 \, \text{cm³} = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.017647 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.005882 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log{\frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]}}.
\]

The \( \text{p}K_a \) is:

\[
\text{p}K_a = -\log{(1.85 \times 10^{-5})} \approx 4.733.
\]

Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log{\frac{0.005882}{0.017647}} = 4.733 + \log{(0.333)} \approx 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26.

### Final Answer:
The pH at 25% titration is 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is 8.52. Therefore, the correct option is:

**Answer: A**
