Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, they annihilate and produce two photons. The photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, right, so when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since they're annihilating, their rest mass energy contributes to the photons' energy. But wait, the electron and positron are moving, so their kinetic energy plus rest mass energy will be converted into the photons' energies.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. For the electron, gamma is 4. For the positron, it's 2. Because the positron is moving from the right, opposite to the electron.

Wait, but when they collide, their velocities are in opposite directions. So, the electron is moving to the right (since it's from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). So, their velocities are opposite in direction.

I remember that in annihilation, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. So, the initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron. Similarly, the momentum must add up too.

Since they annihilate into two photons, which have energy and momentum. The two photons' momenta must add up to the initial total momentum, and their energies must add up to the initial total energy.

Wait, but the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So, E1 = E2 = E_photon.

Also, the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So, each photon is moving at an angle from the horizontal axis; one is above, one is below.

I think the key here is to use conservation of momentum and energy. Let me think about how to set this up.

First, let's compute the initial energy and momentum of the electron and positron.

The rest mass energy of an electron (or positron) is m c², which is about 0.511 MeV. But since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, their total energies will be gamma multiplied by m c².

So, for the electron (gamma_e =4), energy E_e = gamma_e * m c² = 4 * 0.511 MeV = 2.044 MeV.

Similarly, the positron has gamma_p =2, so E_p = 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV.

So, total initial energy E_total = E_e + E_p = 2.044 + 1.022 = 3.066 MeV.

The photons' total energy should be E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2 * E_photon (since they have same energy). So, 2 E_photon = 3.066 MeV. Therefore, each photon has E_photon = 3.066 / 2 = 1.533 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. When a particle and antiparticle annihilate, the rest mass energy is 2 * 0.511 MeV, because each contributes 0.511 MeV. But in this case, since they're moving, their total energy is more than that. So, the photons' energies are higher than just the rest mass.

But since the problem states that the photons have the same energy, that's a key point. So each photon's energy is (E_e + E_p)/2.

Now, the momentum. Let's compute the initial momentum of each particle.

Momentum p is gamma * m * v. Wait, or in terms of gamma, since p = gamma m v, and v = beta c. So, p = gamma m beta c.

Alternatively, since E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2, so p = gamma m v / c. Wait, perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, since E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v, and v = beta c. So, p = gamma m beta c.

But perhaps it's easier to express p in terms of gamma and beta. Let's compute beta for each particle.

For the electron, gamma_e =4. So, gamma_e = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e²) => 4 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_e²). Squaring both sides, 16 = 1/(1 - beta_e²) → 1 - beta_e² = 1/16 → beta_e² = 15/16 → beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872,
