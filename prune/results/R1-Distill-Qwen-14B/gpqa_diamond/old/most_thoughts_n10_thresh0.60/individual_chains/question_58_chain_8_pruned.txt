Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about different physical theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, what's regularization? From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergencesâ€”like infinite terms that pop up in calculations. These infinities aren't physical and need to be handled, so regularization is a way to make the math manageable by introducing a temporary assumption that you can later remove. But wait, isn't regularization different from renormalization? Oh right, renormalization deals with the divergences after regularization. So, the question is about which theory doesn't need any regularization, meaning it's free from such divergences even at high energies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Superstring Theory. Superstring theory is a type of string theory, which I think is a candidate for a theory of everything. It includes gravity and is supposed to be a quantum theory of gravity. But wait, string theories usually require a lot of mathematical machinery, including dealing with higher dimensions and things like supersymmetry. Do they have divergences? I'm not sure. But I remember that in some contexts, string theories don't have the same kind of divergences as other quantum field theories because they're background-independent. Maybe they don't require regularization? Or maybe they do because they're still dealing with loop integrals and such. Hmm, not too sure about that.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with the gauge group SU(3). I know that QCD has something called asymptotic freedom, which means that the force between quarks becomes weaker at high energies (or short distances). But wait, when you do perturbative calculations in QCD, especially at higher loop orders, you get divergences. So regularization is needed here. For example, using methods like lattice regularization or dimensional regularization. So QCD requires regularization. So B is not the answer.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism, dealing with electrons and photons. It's a U(1) gauge theory. I remember that QED has issues with divergences when you calculate loop diagrams, like the electron self-energy. Without regularization, these divergences make the theory blow up. But the key thing is that QED is renormalizable.
