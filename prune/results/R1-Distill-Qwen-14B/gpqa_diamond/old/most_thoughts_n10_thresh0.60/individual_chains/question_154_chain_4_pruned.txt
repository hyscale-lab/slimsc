Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what this unknown white solid is based on the spectral data provided. Let's see, the options are A, B, C, D. I'll need to break down each piece of data and see how they fit.

First, the mass spec. The molecular ion is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, so the molecular weight is probably around 156. The 158 peak is about 32%, which is a relative abundance. The molecular ion is the highest, so 156 is the molecular weight. Wait, but 158 is higher than 156, so maybe it's a fragment with added something, like a chlorine? Or possibly an isotopic peak. Let me think about the options to see what their molecular weights would be.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl (35.5), another O (16 for the hydroxy), so total would be 7*12 + 6*1 + 35.5 + 16 + 1 (for the OH) + 1 (from the aldehyde?) Wait, maybe better to count each part:

Benzaldehyde is C6H5CHO. So for 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, structure is Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde at 1? Or wait, numbering may vary, but structure-wise, it's an aromatic ring with Cl, OH, and aldehyde group. Let's count atoms:

Carbon: 7 (6 from benzene, one from aldehyde)
Hydrogen: Let's see, benzene ring with substituents. Benzaldehyde has 5 H on the ring (since one is replaced by CHO). Adding Cl and OH, which are two substituents. So positions would be 2 (OH) and 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the ring has 3 substituents. So the formula would be C7H5ClO2? Let's compute: (7×12) = 84, H5 is 5, Cl is ~35.5, O2 is 32. So total is 84+5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. Oh wait, the molecular ion is 156, which is close but maybe due to rounding. So molecular weight around 156, so this matches.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl on the benzene ring at position 4, and a COOH group. So formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A? Wait, yes, because benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with Cl replacing a H. So molecular weight would be 7×12=84, H5 is 5, Cl 35.5, O2 32. Total 84+5=89+35.5=124.5
