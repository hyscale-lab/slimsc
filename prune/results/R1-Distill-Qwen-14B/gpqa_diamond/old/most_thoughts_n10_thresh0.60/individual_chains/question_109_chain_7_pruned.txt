Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles they emit. Hmm, I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed based on the given conditions. Let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

The question involves two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics come into play, so I need to consider isospin, angular momentum, and spin. The equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum.

In the final state, T(NN) is 0. I'm supposed to find which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial 1S0 state to a different state plus a particle (like p, s, etc.)

First, let's break down the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). Wait, no—wait, wait. The problem says that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), but that might not directly apply here. Wait, the 1S0 state: S is the total spin. Oh, wait, the S in 1S0 is the spin, so S=0 because it's an S state. Because S is the spin quantum number, right? So for S=0, the multiplicity is 2S+1 = 1, hence 1S0.

So the initial state is two nucleons with total spin S=0, orbital angular momentum L=0 (since it's S, so L=0), and total angular momentum J=0 (from 1S0). Because for two particles, the total angular momentum J is the sum of their orbital angular momentum (L) and their spin (S). So in the initial state, L=0, S=0, so J=0.

Now, when they emit a particle X, the system's state changes. Let's denote the initial as NN + X → NN' + X? Wait, no, the initial is NN in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state is NN' (maybe) plus X. Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering the transition in terms of the NN system changing into a different state, and emitting X. So the NN system goes from 1S0 to another state, and X is emitted.

The problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So the isospin T of the NN system is 0. The Pauli equation given is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T is 0. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2. Which implies S + L must be 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

Now, the system emits a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So parity is a multiplicative quantum number. The parity of the initial state is important. For the initial state, the parity is computed as (-1)^L, since parity for orbital angular momentum L is (-1)^L. The
