Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an aromatic compound mixture, right? The molecular formula is C10H14, and it's a 1:1 mixture of two compounds. The NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Wait, and there are three signals around 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

First, I'll think about the molecular formula. C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C is 10, H is14. X and N are zero here. So it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be one ring (benzene, which is 3 double bonds or one ring plus some double bonds) and maybe some substituents. Alternatively, more rings or double bonds. But wait, the compounds are aromatic, so probably a benzene ring with substituents.

Looking at the options, all the given compounds are tetramethylbenzenes except for option C, which includes 1,4-diethylbenzene. Let me see:

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: That's four methyl groups on the benzene ring at positions 1,2,4,5.

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: Methyl groups at 1,2,3,4.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: Methyl at 1,2,3,5.

1,4-diethylbenzene: Two ethyl groups at positions 1 and 4.

Wait, but the molecular formula for each compound should be C10H14. Let me check each.

For tetramethylbenzenes: Benzene has 6 C, each methyl is 1 C. So four methyl groups would make 6 +4=10 C. So each of these is C10H12? Because each methyl adds a methyl group: each CH3 adds 3 H. Benzene has 3 H normally. If the benzene is para-substituted, each substituent causes the ring to lose one H. Wait, but substituents can affect how many H's are on the ring. But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the molecular formula for each compound.

Wait, let me think. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl group is -CH3, which adds a carbon and three hydrogens. So adding four methyl groups to benzene would give C6+4=10 C, and H: 6 (from benzene) - 4 (each substituent replaces one H) + 4*3 (each methyl adds three H) → 6-4=2, plus 12 → 14 H. So each of the tetramethylbenzenes would have the
