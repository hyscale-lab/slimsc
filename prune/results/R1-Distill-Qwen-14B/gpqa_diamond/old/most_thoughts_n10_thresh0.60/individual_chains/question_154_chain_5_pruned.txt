Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot. Let me read through the question again.

So, the chemist found a white solid with some spectral data. I need to figure out which structure it is among the options A to D. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and another peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Hmm, that's interesting. The IR shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. The 1H NMR has signals at 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H), 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H), and 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H).

Let me break this down step by step.

First, molecular ion at 156. So the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The other peak at 158 is 32% abundanceâ€”so maybe an isotope? Chlorine has isotopes, right? Cl-35 and Cl-37. So if the molecular formula includes Cl, then the molecular ion would have peaks at m/z = 156 and 158, corresponding to Cl-35 and Cl-37. Let me check the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl (about 35), and a hydroxyl group (adds 17, since O is 16 and H is 1). Wait, wait, calculating the formula: C7H5ClO2? Let me count: benzaldehyde has C7H6O (but with a Cl substitution and a hydroxyl group? Wait, structure is Ph-CHO with Cl and OH. Wait, 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde. The formula would be C7H5ClO2.

The molecular weight would be (7*12) + (5*1) + 35 + (2*16) = 84 +5 +35 +32 = 156. That matches the molecular ion. So the molecular ion is at 156, and the Cl causes the 158 peak. So that fits.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl attached to benzene ring, and a COOH group. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A? Wait, wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with a Cl substitution. So same molecular formula: C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight 156. So this would also have peaks at 156 and 158.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's ClCO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2ClCO2? Wait, more accurately, phenyl chloroformate is ClCO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5Cl
