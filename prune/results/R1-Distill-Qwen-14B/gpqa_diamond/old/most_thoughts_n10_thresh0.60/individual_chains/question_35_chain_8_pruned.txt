Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to wrap my head around it. Hmm, the question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator is represented by a 2x2 matrix Ay. The setup says that Ay equals c multiplied by S, where c is h over 4π, and S is a given matrix.

Wait, let me jot down what I know. So, the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So S looks like this:

[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And c is h/(4π), so Ay is c times S. So putting that together, Ay would be:

[ 0     -i*c ]
[ i*c    0 ]

But wait, c is h/(4π), so substituting that in, Ay becomes:

[ 0     -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π))    0 ]

Now, the question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So the first step is to find the eigenvalues of Ay. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ.

But wait, since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, maybe I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix (Ay -a I) would be:

[ -a     -i*c   ]
