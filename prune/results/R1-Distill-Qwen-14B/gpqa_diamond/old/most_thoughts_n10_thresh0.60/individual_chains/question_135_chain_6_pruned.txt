Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the allowed decay channels for this boson X. The question gives me the Lagrangian which is L(y) = -λf ψ̄f (y)(υ + X(y))ψf(y). Hmm, wait, I think I might have misread that. Oh right, maybe it's supposed to be L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe λ is a coupling constant, f is a fermion index? I'm a bit confused, but I think the key point is the interaction term between the boson X and the fermions.

From what I remember, the Lagrangian term would look something like L ∝ X ψ ψ, which implies that the boson X is coupling to a fermion-antifermion pair. So this suggests that X can decay into any fermion and its antiparticle. But wait, the mass of X is 6 GeV, right? So we have to consider the rest mass of the fermion pairs.

Wait, the allowed decays are those where the mass of X is greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion. Because for a particle to decay into two particles, its mass must be at least the sum of their masses. Since X is 6 GeV, each fermion in the pair must have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV.

So I need to list all the fermions whose mass is less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let's think about the known fermions and their masses.

Quarks: up (u), down (d), strange (s), charm (c), bottom (b), top (t). Wait, but the top quark is really heavy, around 173 GeV, so that's way above 3 GeV. The bottom quark is about 4.5 GeV, which is above 3, so X can't decay into b bbar. Charm is about 1.5 GeV, so that's okay. Strange is around 100 MeV, up and down are even lighter, so they're all fine.

Leptons: electron (0.5 MeV), muon (~105 MeV), tau is about 1.78 GeV. So tau is
