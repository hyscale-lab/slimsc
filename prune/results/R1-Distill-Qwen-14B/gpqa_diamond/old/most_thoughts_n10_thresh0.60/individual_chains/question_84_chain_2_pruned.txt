Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one for solving higher-dimensional heat equations. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question is about the key factor in converting a sequential algorithm to parallel when using higher order finite differences and parallel splitting. The options are A to D. 

I remember that when solving heat equations, especially in higher dimensions, the matrix exponential often comes into play. Matrix exponentials are used in methods like the exponential time differencing. But wait, the question mentions that the matrix exponential is approximated by a fractional approximation. So, they're using some fractional method here.

Parallel splitting, or splitting methods, are techniques to make algorithms run faster by breaking them into parts that can be processed in parallel. For example, the method of lines where you split the problem into spatial and temporal parts. But I'm not sure how that directly relates to the options.

Looking at the options:

A) Stability analysis: That's important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate. But is it the key factor for making it parallel? Maybe not directly. Stability is more about the method's correctness over time.

B) Existence of nonlocal boundary conditions: Nonlocal BCs are when the boundary depends on values from other parts of the domain. Not sure how that ties into parallelism. Maybe if the BCs are nonlocal, it complicates the algorithm, but I'm not seeing the direct link to parallel conversion.

C) Complex roots of fractional approximation: Fractional approximations might involve polynomials or rational functions approximating the exponential. If the approximation has complex roots, that could affect the splitting. Wait, in parallel splitting, you often look for ways to decompose the solution into parts that can be handled independently, perhaps based on eigenvalues or roots. If the approximation has complex roots, maybe that affects how you split the problem. Or perhaps the roots influence the stability or convergence rate of each split part.

D) Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation: Partial fraction decomposition is a way to break down complex fractions into simpler parts. In the context of matrix functions, maybe this allows the matrix to be split into terms that can be computed in parallel. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of simpler matrices, each part could be handled by a different processor. So this might be the key factor — the ability to split the function into parts that can be computed independently.

Wait, another angle: the method used to approximate the matrix exponential. For example, using a Padé approximation, which is a rational function. Padé approximants can sometimes be split into partial fractions. If the approximation can be expressed as a sum of terms that each can be computed separately, that would allow parallel computation.

So, for a fractional approximation, if it can be linearly decomposed into partial fractions, each part can be applied in parallel. That would make the algorithm parallel. So option D, linear partial fraction, seems relevant.

Alternatively, complex roots (option C) might affect the convergence or stability but not directly the parallelism. The key for parallelism is being able to split the operations into independent parts, which a linear partial fraction decomposition would enable. So each term in
