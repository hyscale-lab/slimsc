Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments involving mice. Hmm, I need to figure out what process is happening here. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that they tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid. I remember that the stomach has a lot of acid, so that probably breaks down some of the proteins. But some made it through and got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Oh right, secondary lymphoid organs include things like Peyer's patches, which are in the intestines.

They isolated the fluorescent Peyer patches and looked at the proliferating cells. Then they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that something is causing changes in the B cell receptors, right? Because each B cell has a unique receptor.

So what processes change the variable regions? I think there's somatic hypermutation and VDJ recombination. Wait, wait. VDJ happens during the generation of the initial B cell receptor in the bone marrow, right? It's the process where V, D, and J segments are joined to create diversity. But somatic hypermutation (A) occurs later, during the maturation of B cells in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues. This process introduces more mutations into the variable regions, increasing diversity.

In this scenario, the GFP-tagged proteins from rotavirus are making it to the Peyer's patches. Peyer's patches are sites where immune cells, like B cells, reside. The cells that are proliferating there are likely activated B cells undergoing hypermutation. So when they sequence the variable genes and see high variability, that points to somatic hypermutation. 

Other options: Complement activation (B) is part of the immune response but doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. Class switching (C) changes the type of antibody produced (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't affect the variable regions as much. VDJ recombination (D) is about initial diversity during B cell development, but that's already been done before the immune response is triggered.

So the process here is A) somatic hypermutation because that's when the B cells are diversifying their receptors to respond better to the antigen, which in this case is the rotavirus proteins.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Fluorescence from these proteins is observed in the Peyer's patches, which are secondary lymphoid organs in the intestines. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population isolated from these patches suggests a process that increases diversity in B cell receptors.

Among the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, introducing mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors to increase diversity. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the immune response but does not directly cause variability in the variable regions of B cell receptors.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not significantly alter the variable regions.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This generates initial diversity during B cell development in the bone marrow but occurs before the immune response is triggered.

Given the context of the experiment and the observed high variability in the variable regions, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
