Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to move. The bigger the Doppler shift, the higher the velocity of the star, right?

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So, the two stars are identical in mass, and the planets have similar masses. 

The RV method detects the change in the star's velocity. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but I thought the RV method measures velocity, not wavelength shift directly. Oh, right, the Doppler shift relates to velocity through the formula. The formula I think is something like delta lambda over lambda equals v over c, where delta lambda is the change in wavelength, and v is the velocity. So, the shift in wavelength is proportional to the velocity.

Since both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), the main difference would come from their orbital parameters. The RV method is sensitive to the mass of the planet and the inclination of the orbit (but they probably assume similar inclinations here, maybe edge-on for both), but the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we can ignore that and focus on the velocity.

Wait, the velocity amplitude (K) in the RV method is given by the formula K = (v * sin i) where v is the actual velocity of the star. But since both planets are detected, the sin i must be such that the shifts are observed, but perhaps they have the same inclination, or we can treat sin i as a constant for both, so the ratio of K's would relate to the ratio of velocity shifts.

But the question says the shifts are 5 and 7 milliangstrom. So the velocity of the star is proportional to the shift. So, if the shift is larger for Planet #2, that means the star's velocity is higher because of Planet #2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no. For the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star. So, a larger K means the star is moving more due to the planet. So, K is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of the star's mass, I think. But wait, the stars are same mass, so K is proportional to the planet's mass. But both planets have similar masses (like Neptune), so why are the K's different?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. The formula for K is:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 AU) )^(1/3) ) * (1 year)^(-1/3) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, a simplified version for small planet masses (so M_p << M_*) is:

K ≈ ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i
