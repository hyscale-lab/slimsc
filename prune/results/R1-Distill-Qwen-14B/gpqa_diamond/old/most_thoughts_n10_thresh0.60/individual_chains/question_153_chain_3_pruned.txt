Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three parts, each a Michael addition reaction. I need to find out the reactants and major products for each, then match them with the options given. 

Let me start with the first reaction: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). The product is labeled A.

Wait, what's the Michael addition about again? Oh right, it's a conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion.

Dimethyl malonate is a diester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(COOEt)2. The enolate would form when deprotonated, right? The enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon, adjacent to the carbonyl.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OEt, with the E configuration. Wait, but the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, with the substituents on the double bond being a methyl group (from the acrylate) and the p-tolyl group. So the structure is CH2=C(C6H4-p-tolyl)-COOEt? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-CO-OEt with a p-tolyl group on the third carbon. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOEt? Wait, that doesn't make sense because acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So the third carbon would be the one after the double bond. Oh, wait, maybe it's
