Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, rhombohedral... Right, that's one of the crystal systems. I remember that in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Interesting.

The question is asking about the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice. I think the formula for calculating that is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + ... something with the angles. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh right! The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_hkl = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, but wait, no. I think I might be mixing something up. Another approach is the use of the structure factor, but maybe that's not relevant here. Alternatively, for a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but rhombohedral is a bit more complex.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal lattice is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}

Wait, no, wait. I think I need to get the correct formula here. Oh wait, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system. I recall that in a rhombohedral crystal, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which is like a cube that's been skewed.

The interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha) } }

Wait, but wait. I'm getting a bit confused. Another way is to think about the Miller indices and the relation to the lattice parameters. 

Wait, I also remember that for a rhombohedral system, the formula is a bit similar to the cubic case but includes the angles. So the denominator is the square root of (h² + k² + l²) plus some terms involving the cosines of the angles between the lattice vectors.

Wait, here's the correct formula: 

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h² + k² + l² + 2(hk \cos \gamma + hl \cos \beta + kl \cos \alpha)}}}

Wait, but wait. Oh no, wait. I think I might have the signs wrong. Because in the cubic case, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²), but when the angles aren't 90 degrees, the formula includes the angles. So I think another way is:

d = (a) / [ sqrt( (h² +k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) ]

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c and angles alpha, beta, gamma, the interplanar distance is calculated using a formula that includes the dot product of the reciprocal lattice vectors or something like that. But perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the relation between the interplanar distance and the unit cell parameters. Another method is to calculate the reciprocal of the interplanar distance squared, which is equal to the sum of (h²/a²) + (k²/b²) + (l²/c²) plus some terms involving the angles. But wait, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, so that simplifies things.

Wait, in this problem, a = b = c = 10 Angstrom, right? Because the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom, and in a rhombohedral crystal, each edge has the same length. Wait, interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a in this case, because it's a simple cubic-like structure. Or is that correct? Wait, no, not necessarily. Because in a rhombohedral system, the atoms are at the corners of the rhombohedron, so the interatomic distance (the distance between adjacent atoms) is equal to 'a'. So yes, a =10 Angstrom.

Wait, so given that a =10, and the angles are alpha = beta = gamma =30 degrees. And we're looking for the (111) plane.

So, plugging into the formula. Let's get the formula right.

The correct formula for the interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{
