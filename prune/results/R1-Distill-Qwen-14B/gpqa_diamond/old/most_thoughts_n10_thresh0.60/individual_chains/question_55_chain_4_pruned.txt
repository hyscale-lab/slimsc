Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The compound is an unknown organic, and the options are various propenyl or butenyl acetates. The NMR data given is:

1H NMR (ppm):
7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 (1H, dq)
2.1 (3H, s)
1.6 (3H, d)

I remember that in NMR, the splitting patterns and chemical shifts can give a lot of information about the structure. Let's break this down.

First, looking at the 2.1 ppm singlet integrating for 3H. That's usually a methyl group attached to something deshielded. In acetates, like ethyl acetate, the acetyl group is the OAc- part. So 2.1 ppm, singlet for 3H would likely be the methyl in the acetate group. So the compound is an acetate, which matches the options given.

Next, the 1.6 ppm doublet integrating for 3H. A doublet suggests it's next to one proton. So probably a CH2 adjacent to another CH group. Wait, but wait, this is 3H, which is a triplet? No, wait, no, the integral is 3H, so it's a methyl group. So if it's a methyl group as a doublet, it must be attached to a CH group. Like maybe (CH2CH3) or something. Wait, no, because a methyl as a doublet would be if it's attached to a CH that has two neighboring protons. Wait, maybe it's a geminal group?

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. The options are propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but I think the structure is CH2CH2-OAc, but wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- maybe). Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me sketch possible structures.

The options are Cis and Trans for propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let me think about what each structure would look like.

Propenyl acetate: The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. But wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CH2CH2-? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- (but that can't be, since that's 3 carbons). Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So, the structure would be acetate (OAc) attached to the propenyl group.

But wait, another possibility is that the propenyl is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure more carefully.

Wait, propenyl group can be either CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, I think propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (but that's perhaps not correct). Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, acetate is an ester, so it's R-O-CO-OAc. Wait, no, acetate is an ester group, so the general formula is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkoxy group. So for propenyl acetate, R would be propenyl (like CH2=CHCH2-), so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, acetate is OAc, so it's CH3COO-. So for propenyl acetate, it's (propenyl) ester of acetic acid, so structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl group. So R is the propenyl, which is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps butenyl is similar but with four carbons. Let me think about the structures.

Now, the NMR signals: the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests a double bond. So for a trans coupling, the J is typically around 15-18 Hz, while cis might be lower, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl proton next to another.

Wait, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, with J=16. That's a big coupling, so likely a trans double bond. Because in trans alkenes, the coupling between the two protons on the double bond is larger than cis, which can have smaller coupling.

So, looking at the options, the structures with double bonds would have protons in the aromatic region, but wait, the compound is an acetate, so maybe the pro
