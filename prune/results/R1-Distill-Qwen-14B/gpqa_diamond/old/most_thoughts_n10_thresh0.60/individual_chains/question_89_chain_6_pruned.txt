Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what's going on.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Okay, I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid, kind of like a cage structure. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane must have bromine atoms on two of the bridgehead positions.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240Â°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. Hmm, KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking elimination or perhaps dehydrohalogenation. But wait, when dibromides react with bases, especially in such conditions, they often undergo elimination. Let me think about the possible products.

In a dibromide, especially vicinal (like 1,2-dibromo), elimination would form an alkene. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not vicinal. Oh wait, maybe it undergoes a different kind of elimination. Alternatively, maybe it's a double dehydrohalogenation, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation but in a different way. Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with a strong base like KOH, could eliminate twice, forming a diene. Or perhaps a single elimination forms a vinyl bromide, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's an elimination where the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, but 1 and 3 are not adjacent in adamantane. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, adamantane has a structure where each bridgehead is connected to two other bridgeheads. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Br on two bridgeheads that are separated by one bridge. So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br leaves, but how? Alternatively, maybe the base abstracts a beta hydrogen, leading to formation of a double bond. Wait, but the positions are 1 and 3, which are not adjacent, so perhaps each Br is eliminated with a hydrogen from a different position.

Wait, perhaps it's an E2 elimination. Both bromines could leave, each taking a hydrogen from adjacent carbons. But I'm not sure. Alternatively
