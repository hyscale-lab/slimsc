Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar physics, but I'll try to think it through.

Let me start by recalling what the pp-III branch is. I remember that the proton-proton chain is the main fusion process in the Sun, producing helium from hydrogen. The pp-I branch involves two protons fusing into deuterium and then reacting with another proton to form helium-3. The pp-II and pp-III branches are about different pathways for the next steps. Oh wait, pp-III is when a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-3 nucleus to make boron-8, right?

So the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stops. All other reactions continue as usual. What does that mean for neutrino production? Well, I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing a certain amount of high-energy neutrinos, maybe the 7 Be neutrinos or something like that. Because when boron-8 decays, it emits neutrinos, right?

Wait, but neutrinos are also produced in other parts of the pp chain. Like, the main pp-I and pp-II would still be active, so they'd produce neutrinos as usual. Oh, but pp-III is a specific branch that leads to 7Be, which then becomes 8B and emits neutrinos. So if pp-III stops, then the production of 8B would stop, meaning fewer of those neutrinos would be emitted.

But the question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands. So band 1 is 700-800 keV, and band 2 is 800-900 keV. Hmm, I think the 8B neutrinos have a higher energy than the others. Because I remember that the 8B neutrinos are about 15-19 MeV, which is way higher than the keV range. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing something up. Or maybe there are other neutrinos in the keV range.

Wait, the Sun emits several types of neutrinos. The most abundant are the electron neutrinos from the pp chain. The main neutrinos come from the decay of boron-8, which is part of the pp-III branch. But I'm thinking about the energies. Boron-8 decays into lithium-8 and emits positrons and neutrinos. But wait, the neutrinos from 8B are high-energy, like around 15 MeV, not keV. So in the question, the bands are in the keV range. That must mean we're talking about lower-energy neutrinos, maybe from other processes.

Another source of solar neutrinos is the CNO cycle, but I think that produces lower-energy neutrinos. Or perhaps the pep (proton-electron-proton) branch, which is a minor part of the pp chain. The pep reaction also produces neutrinos, but at lower energies than the 8B neutrinos.

Wait, but the question is about neutrino flux in the 700-800 and 800-900 keV bands. So if the pp-III stops, which neutrinos' production is affected?

Wait, maybe the pp-III branch is a
