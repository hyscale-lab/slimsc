Okay, I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given NMR data. Let me start by recalling what each part of the NMR tells us.

The question gives four options, all are propenyl or butenyl acetates. The options are Cis or Trans for both propenyl and butenyl acetates. So, I should think about the structure of each and how they would appear in the NMR.

Looking at the NMR data:
1. 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz)
2. 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
3. 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
4. 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm, let's break this down. The singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H is likely the methyl group attached to the oxygen in an ester (like the acetate group, OAc). So that's probably the acetate's methyl.

Now, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with a large coupling constant J=16 Hz. That's a big coupling, which usually suggests a trans coupling in a double bond. So maybe this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another double bond proton.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Wait, a doublet of quartets? Or perhaps a doublet that's coupled to two different protons? Hmm. Alternatively, it could be a triplet if it's coupling with two equivalent protons, but that's not what's written here. So maybe the 5.5 peak is a proton that's adjacent to another set of protons with different coupling.

Wait, let me think about the structure. If the compound is an acetate, the structure would be something like CH2CH2COOCH3, but wait, that's not precise. Let me think about the possible structures.

But wait, the options are propenyl or butenyl. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH3, but more accurately, the propenyl group is CH2CHCH2-OAc? Or wait, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2, but with a double bond.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-; but in acetates, the structure is usually R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no. Acetate est
