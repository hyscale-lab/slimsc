Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound E is formed in the reaction sequence. Let me start by breaking down each step and the given hints.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints provided are:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

Hmm, I remember that phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with an aldehyde or ketone. So if the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane, that suggests that compound A is a ketone. Because the Wittig reagent (ylide) adds to the carbonyl group, forming an alkene. The structure given has a cyclopentane ring with substituents, and a propan-2-ylidene group attached. Wait, propan-2-ylidene would be like a CH2-C= group, right?

Wait, so in the product, the substituent is (propan-2-ylidene), which is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the ylide must have attacked a carbonyl group in compound A. So, the Wittig reaction would take a ketone (since aldehydes give alkenes with different regiochemistry, but here it's a cyclopentane ring, so maybe it's a cyclic ketone) and form an alkene.

Wait, but looking at the product structure: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me think about that. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 (methyl groups), and at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. So, the structure would be cyclopentane with two methyl groups adjacent, and a substituent that's a CH2-C(CH3) group, but as a ylidene, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= which is a double bond.

Wait, no, the substituent is propan-2-ylidene. Propane is CH3-CH2-CH3. Propan-2-ylidene would be the group where the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, but wait, propane has three carbons. Oh wait, wait, the ylidene is the substituent. Propan-2-ylidene would be the group where the double bond is between C2 and C3 of propane, so it's CH2-C(CH3)= as a substituent.

Wait, but the product is 4-(propan-2-ylidene), which would mean that the cyclopentane ring has a substituent at position 4 which is a propan-2-ylid
