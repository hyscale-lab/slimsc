Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to unpack what's going on.

The question is about the fission of an atomic nucleus. So, the nucleus is initially at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it splits into two fragments. The problem gives a few specifics: one fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of their rest masses. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

The question is about calculating the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, but comparing the correct relativistic value with the classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, varying in MeV.

Hmm. Let me jot down the given data:

- Initial mass M, rest mass energy = 300 GeV.
- After fission, two fragments: let's call them m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2 (since one is twice as massive as the other).
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 * M. Because the sum is 99% of M.

So first, I should find the rest masses of the two fragments. Because if m1 is twice m2, then m1 = 2m2. Adding them gives m1 + m2 = 3m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3, and m1 = 2*(0.99 M)/3 = (1.98 M)/3.

Wait, but M is the initial mass. But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So E_initial = M c^2 = 300 GeV.

But when the nucleus splits, the rest mass of the fragments is less than the initial massâ€”so some energy is released as kinetic energy. That makes sense.

Wait, but let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum. Since the initial nucleus is at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

So the momentum of m1 and m2 must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2. But wait, since they are moving in opposite directions, perhaps one velocity is positive and the other negative.

But wait,
