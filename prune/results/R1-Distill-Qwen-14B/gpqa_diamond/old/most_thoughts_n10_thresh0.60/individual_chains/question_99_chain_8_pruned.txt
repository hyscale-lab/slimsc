Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and understand all the details.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 and a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1. The NMR spectrum has several peaks, but none are vinyl hydrogens, which means there are no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. Also, there are some complex splitting patterns in the NMR.

The options provided are four different structures, all of which seem to have a carboxylic acid group because I see COOH at the end. So that's a clue. Let's break down the IR and NMR information.

First, the FTIR. A broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 typically indicates O-H stretching. But wait, the peak is very broad, which makes me think it's from an -OH group. Carboxylic acids have broad O-H stretches because they're hydrogen-bonded. The strong absorption at 1700 cm^-1 is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. Carboxylic acids usually have a carbonyl peak around 1700 cm^-1, so that fits.

Now the 1H NMR data. There are no vinyl hydrogens, so structures with double bonds are out. But all the options here don't have double bonds, so that doesn't narrow it down further.

Looking at the NMR splitting patterns: one signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm. That sounds complicated. Let me think about what kinds of splitting would lead to such complex patterns.

In NMR, each split arises from coupling with neighboring equivalent sets of protons. So, a doublet of triplets suggests two different coupling constants. For example, a proton coupled to two different sets of protons each with a different J value, leading to a triplet for each, but then combining into a doublet of triplets.

Wait, but the first complex pattern is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's three layers of splitting. How does that happen? Let's think. Each time a proton is next to a set of n equivalent protons, it splits into n+1 peaks. So a quartet would come from coupling with a set of 3 equivalent protons. Then, if that quartet is split again by another set, each peak in the quartet would split into, say, 2 or 3 peaks, leading to a more complex pattern.

Wait, maybe it's a vicinal coupling scenario. Suppose a proton is adjacent to a CH group that's next to another CH group. So, each coupling could come from adjacent CHs. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching point where each adjacent group has multiple protons leading to multiple couplings.

Looking at the options, let's sketch their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. Hmm, wait, that would be (CH3)(C2H5)C-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH? Wait no, I think I misread. Let's parse it correctly.

Each option is written as a chain. Let me write their structures:

Option A: CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So the backbone is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. The central carbons each have a CH group with substituents. So like, the two middle carbons each have a CH attached to CH3 and C2H5 groups.

Option B: CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So the chain is CH2CH3 connected to a CH group that's attached to another CH group and then COOH.

Option C: CH3-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-CH2-COOH. So the middle carbons each have a CH attached to two CH3 groups.

Option D: CH3CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH. So the chain is CH2CH3, then a CH attached to CH3, another CH attached to CH3, and then COOH.

Wait, all the options have a COOH group, so they are all carboxylic acids. 

In the NMR, the absence of vinyl hydrogens suggests no double bonds, which is consistent as all options are saturated.

The broad FTIR peak at 3000 is the O-H stretch, and 1700 is the C=O of the carboxylic acid.

Now, the NMR splitting. Let's think about each option's structure and the possible proton environments.

The key is to look for the splitting patterns. The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's a lot of splitting, so perhaps it's a proton that's coupled to three different sets of protons.

Wait, perhaps the splitting arises from a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons, each with different coupling constants. Let's think.

Another possibility is that the proton is in a -CH2- group next to a branching point. For example, in a structure like (CH2)2C-CH2-, the central CH2 might couple with adjacent protons on the branching point.

Alternatively, looking at the options, perhaps the splitting comes from the CH groups attached to substituents. For example, in option A, the central CH groups are each attached to a CH3
