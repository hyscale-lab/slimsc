Okay, so I've got this question here about large clouds of neutral hydrogen and their detection using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs certain wavelengths, right? The question mentions the Lyman alpha wavelength, which I think is around 1216 Angstroms. Wait, I should probably double-check that. Oh yeah, Lyman alpha is the transition in hydrogen where an electron moves from the second to the first energy level, emitting a photon in the ultraviolet range, specifically about 121.6 nanometers, which is 1216 Angstroms.

So the problem is about these clouds absorbing light from background quasars at this wavelength. But the key point is estimating the lower redshift limit for these objects so that they can be detected with optical telescopes. Wait, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere blocks it, right? So if the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen at 1216 Angstroms, but ground-based optical telescopes can't observe that wavelength, how does this work?

Oh, right! Redshift. The observed wavelength depends on the redshift of the cloud. If the cloud is moving away (or the universe is expanding), the wavelength of the absorbed light would be stretched. So if the original absorption is at 1216 Angstroms (far UV), for it to be in the optical range, which is longer wavelengths, the redshift must be such that 1216 Angstroms is shifted into the optical.

Wait, the optical range is roughly 400-700 nm
