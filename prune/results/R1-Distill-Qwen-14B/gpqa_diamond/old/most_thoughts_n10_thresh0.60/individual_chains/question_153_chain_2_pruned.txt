Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking a beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound, leading to a conjugate addition. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C). I need to find the major products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with part (A): The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) in EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. I think dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a diester and can act as a Michael donor. The other compound is the acceptor, the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

In the Michael addition, the nucleophile (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. Wait, no, the correct structure for (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3, or maybe methyl 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, with the p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. So when the nucleophile (like the enolate from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta position (the CH2=CH- part), it adds across the double bond.

Wait, dimethyl malonate is CH2(CO2Me)2. When it acts as a donor, the enolate would form, attacking the acceptor. The product would be a new carbon-carbon bond between the alpha of the donor and the beta of the acceptor.

So in this case, the donor's enolate attacks the beta carbon of the acceptor. The structure after addition would add the malonate part to the alpha position of the acrylate. Let me draw it out mentally. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O)OMe, but wait, no, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(O-p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or maybe I'm getting that wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH2-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, maybe it's (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which would be CH2=CH-C(O)OCH2-C6H4-4-CH3? No, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)=O, esterified with methyl. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way. Wait, the correct structure is probably CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH2
