Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid with an IR absorbance at 1720 cm-1. Hmm, 1720 is a strong carbonyl peak, probably an ester or ketone. Since KOH is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination reaction? Wait, but dibromides reacting with KOH usually lead to elimination reactions, forming alkenes. Alternatively, if it's a vicinal dihalide, like 1,2-dibromide, KOH would cause elimination to form an alkene. But this is 1,3-dibromo, which might not be vicinal. Oh wait, adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have the two bromines on adjacent carbons in the structure. So when KOH is added, it could dehydrohalogenate to form an alkene. But wait, the product after KOH has a carbonyl group. So maybe it's a substitution reaction instead?

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's a Hofmann elimination scenario, but that typically requires a quaternary ammonium compound, which isn't the case here. Alternatively, if we have a dihalide, perhaps heating with a strong base like KOH could lead to elimination of two equivalents
