Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about the Michael addition reaction, which I'm a bit rusty on, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the attack of a nucleophile on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile usually comes from a base, like an enolate, which then adds to the beta position of the carbonyl, creating a new carbon-carbon bond. The product is a conjugate addition, right?

Looking at the problem, there are three parts, A, B, and C. Each part is a different Michael addition reaction. I'll take them one at a time.

Starting with part A: The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions.

Wait, what's dimethyl malonate? Oh right, it's a diester of malonic acid. Its structure is CH2(CO2Me)2. Now, when this reacts under basic conditions like NaOEt, it should form the enolate. The enolate is a strong nucleophile. The other component is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, which is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. Its structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but wait, no, the p-tolyl is at position 3. So the structure is (p-tolyl) attached to the acrylate. Let me draw that. The acrylate is CH2=CH-C(O-OCH3), but wait, no. Wait, the correct structure would be CH2=CH-CH(C6H4-4-CH3)-COOEt? No, wait, perhaps I got the substituents wrong. Let me think. The formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt, but if the substituent is at the 3 position, that's the third carbon? Wait, the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OEt. So the 3 position is the CH2 group. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-C(=O)-OEt, but with a p-tolyl group on the double bond. Wait, no, that's not right. Oh, wait, the correct structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt, but with the E configuration. So the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3, with the p-tolyl at C2. So the structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)-COOEt, but with E geometry.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more accurately (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate methyl ester. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the p-tolyl is on C3. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2
