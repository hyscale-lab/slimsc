Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to pick the correct one based on the spectral data provided.

Let's start by looking at the FTIR data. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So, that suggests the compound has either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid group. But wait, carboxylic acids typically have a very broad and strong O-H stretch, maybe even a peak around 2500-3300 that's very broad. So, an alcohol would have a broad peak as well. But the presence of a peak at 3000 could also be from alkenyl (vinyl) C-H stretches. Wait, no, the very broad peak at 3000 is more likely from O-H. Because alkenyl C-H are usually less intense and maybe a bit lower in wavenumber? Or maybe the broadness comes from something else.

Then, there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. Those are significant. The 1700 is a strong peak that often corresponds to carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, or maybe carboxylic acids. The 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with some substitution, like an aromatic ketone or an ester. Alternatively, maybe an amide? But wait, the options don't have nitrogen, so probably not. So, considering the two peaks: 1700 and 1650. Maybe one is a carbonyl and the other is something else. For example, maybe the 1700 is a ketone or ester, and the 1650 is an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or perhaps an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Moving on to the 1H NMR. It says there are several peaks, including some that correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene. So, the presence of vinyl hydrogens means there's an alkene group in the molecule. That would also affect the IR, maybe? The absence of a very strong peak around 1640 would suggest that the alkene's C=C isn't saturated, but the IR here has a peak at 1650. Wait, the 1650 could be either the carbonyl of a conjugated system or the C=C in the alkene. But wait, the C=C in an alkene usually shows a peak in IR around 1640-1680 cm^-1. So, that 1650 peak might be the alkene's stretching. Alternatively, if the carbonyl is conjugated with the alkene, that could shift the carbonyl peak. For example, in an alpha, beta-unsaturated
