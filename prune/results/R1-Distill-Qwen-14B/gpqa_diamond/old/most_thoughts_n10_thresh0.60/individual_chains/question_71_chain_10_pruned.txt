Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets with circular orbits discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. They're in orbital resonance, and their orbital periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, that means each planet's period is a multiple of the first one's period. Like, Planet_2 has a period twice that of Planet_1, Planet_3 is 2.5 times, and so on.

The question is asking about the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so that shouldn't affect the calculation. Equilibrium temperature... right, that's when the planet's incoming energy from the star balances the outgoing infrared radiation. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (A * (1 - a)) )^(1/4) ), but wait, no, maybe it's more about the distance from the star.

Wait, no, the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_eff * (R_star / (2a)) )^(1/2), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R_star is its radius, and 'a' is the planet's orbital distance. But since all the planets are orbiting the same star, T_eff and R_star would be the same for all, so they'll cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. So T ∝ 1/√a.

But wait, the periods are given, not the distances. So I need to relate the periods to the distances using Kepler's third law. Kepler's law says that the square of the period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a), so P² ∝ a³. Since all orbits are circular, a is just the radius.

So Kepler's law gives us P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. Which means a³ ∝ P². Therefore, a ∝ P^(2/3).

But since I'm taking the ratio of the distances, that should be a4 / a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So let's compute P4 and P2. The ratios are given as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 for the periods. So Planet_1 has P1, Planet_2 P2 = 2*P1, Planet_4 P4 =3.5 *P1.

Wait, but for the ratio a4/a2, it's (P4/P2)^(2/3). So (3.5/2)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

3.5 divided by 2 is 1.75. So (1.75)^(2/3). Hmm, what's that approximately?

I know that 1.75 is 7/4, which is 1.75. Let me think about exponents. Let me think of numbers raised to the 1/3 and then squared.

Alternatively, taking the cube root first. Cube root of 1.75 is about 1.2, I
