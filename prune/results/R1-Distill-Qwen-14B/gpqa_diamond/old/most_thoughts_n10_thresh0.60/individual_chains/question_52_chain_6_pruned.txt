Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem talks about a star with certain parameters. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main point of the question is about the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Without spots, the ratio is some value, and when spots are present, this ratio decreases. The question asks by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. They also mention that the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Ã…, and that LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is assumed.

Hmm, okay, so first, I think this has to do with the Saha equation and the Boltzmann equation because we're dealing with ionization and excitation states of atoms in the star's atmosphere.

Wait, wait. The ratio is about the number of atoms in two energy levels, so it's about the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann factor relates the populations of two energy levels in a gas in thermal equilibrium.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j) / (k T) )

But wait, the problem is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, the ratio is (n1 / n2) when there are no spots and when there are spots.

Let me think. When the star has spots, the effective temperature decreases. So, the Teff is lower in the spotted case (5500 K) compared to when it's not spotted (6000 K). But wait, how does the presence of spots affect the overall photosphere's effective temperature? Oh, right, the spots are cooler regions, so when they cover part of the surface, the overall average temperature goes down. So, I guess the photospheric temperature when spotted is lower.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, the ratio
