Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all the cobalt species.

Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands, right? So the complex would be Co(SCN)_2^2+. But how does that fit into the overall picture? And what are the stability constants for? Oh right, stability constants (formation constants) tell us about the stability of the complex ions. The higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the problem is about the distribution of different cobalt complexes in solution. The various β values correspond to different complexes. Let me think: β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, β3 for Co(SCN)3, and β4 for Co(SCN)4? Or wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, sometimes the stability constants are given for stepwise formation. Oh, wait, no—I think each β represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- ions. So β1 is the formation constant for Co(SCN), β2 for Co(SCN)2, etc.

But wait, some sources define βn as the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So, for example, β1 would be the formation constant for CoSCN^+, β2 for Co(SCN)_2^2+ (dithiocyanato), β3 for Co(SCN)_3^3+, and β4 for Co(SCN)_4^4-.

So the question asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which I think is the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. So that corresponds to β2=40.

Hmm, wait, but the options are A to D, and I need to calculate the fraction of Co(SC
