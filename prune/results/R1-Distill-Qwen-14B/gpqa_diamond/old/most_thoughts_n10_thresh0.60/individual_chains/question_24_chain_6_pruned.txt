Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about a mixture X which, when treated with platinum and heated, forms a mixture Y. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y gives a single substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, and it's a widely used solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's probably fully saturated—like an alkane.

So, first, I need to figure out what Z is. The hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula. Let's assume the molecular weight is M. Hydrogen's mass is 14.28% of M, so:

Hydrogen mass = (14.28/100) * M
Hydrogen contributes 2 atoms in each molecule (assuming Z is a hydrocarbon, probably CnH2n+2 because it's an alkane).

Let me calculate the molecular formula. Let's let the formula be CnH2n+2.

The molar mass is (12n) + (2n+2)(1) = 14n + 2.

Hydrogen's mass fraction is [2n * 1] / (14n +2) = 14.28% or 0.1428.

So, 2n / (14n +2) = 0.1428.

Let me solve this equation:

2n = 0.1428*(14n +2)
Multiply both sides by 1000 to get rid of decimals:
2000n = 142.8*(14n +2)
Wait, maybe better to just compute 2n / (14n +2) = 0.1428.

Multiply both sides by denominator: 2n = 0.1428*(14n +2)
Expand right side: 0.1428*14n + 0.1428*2
0.1428 *14 is approximately 2. So 2n = 2n + 0.2856

Wait, that's 2n = 2n + 0.2856. Hmm, that can't be right. Subtract 2n from both sides: 0 = 0.2856, which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.1428 as a fraction. 14.28% is roughly 1/7, since 1/7 is about 14.29%. So 1/7 is approximately 0.1428.

So:

2n / (14n +2) = 1/7

Cross multiplying: 14n = 14n +2 → 14n -14n = 2 → 0=2. That can't be right either. Hmm, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the formula.

Wait, maybe Z is a different hydrocarbon.
