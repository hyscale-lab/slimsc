Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativistic mechanics, but I'll give it a shot. Let's read the question carefully.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. Nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, wait, Li is lithium. I remember that lithium has an atomic number of 3, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6 because the atomic number is 3 (protons) and 3 neutrons, so 3+3=6. So the mass number is 6.

Wait, but I should double-check the isotopes. Lithium usually has isotopes like Li-6 and Li-7, so yeah, 3 protons and 3 neutrons would be Li-6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 nucleus.

Now, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96c, and we're to find the energy of the ion in the collider. I remember that in relativity, the energy of a particle isn't just (1/2)mv² like in classical mechanics. It's got to be the total energy, which includes rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

So first, I need to find the total energy, which is gamma times the rest energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). Since v is 0.96c, let's compute gamma.

Let me calculate gamma step by step. v = 0.96c, so v²/c² is 0.96² = 0.9216. Then 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, right? Because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 ≈ 3.5714.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.0784 under the square root: let's see, 0.28^2 is 0.0784 exactly. So yes, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. So gamma is 1/0.28 ≈ 3.57142857. Hmm, but maybe I should carry more decimal places to be precise because the options are given to 4 decimal places.

So gamma is approximately 3.57142857. Now, the total energy is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy E_rest is m*c². So I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, the nucleus's mass. I'm a bit rusty here. The mass of a nucleus can be found using the mass of its constituent protons and neutrons, but I'm not sure about the exact values. Alternatively, I can look up the atomic mass of Li-6.

Wait, I think the mass of a Li-6 nucleus is approximately 6 atomic mass
