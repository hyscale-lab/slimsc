Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait—ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag? Or is it fainter? Wait, no, the question says it can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. Wait, no, wait, no—apparent magnitude is how bright they appear from Earth. Oh, but wait, the lower the magnitude, the brighter the star. So, for example, a star with apparent magnitude 10 is brighter than a star with magnitude 15.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says: with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed. So that means stars with V ≤17 mag can be seen by ESPRESSO. Because anything brighter (lower magnitude) is okay. For HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed. So, stars with V ≤16 mag can be detected by HIRES.

So a star that's brighter than 17 mag (V ≤17) can be observed by ESPRESSO, and brighter than 16 (V ≤16) by HIRES. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have V ≤16 mag. Because
