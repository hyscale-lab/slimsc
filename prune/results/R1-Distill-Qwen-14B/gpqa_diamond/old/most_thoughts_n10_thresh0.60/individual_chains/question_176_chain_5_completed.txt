Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait—matrices usually have elements between 0 and 1, but those numbers are bigger. Oh wait, maybe it's just a state vector with those components, perhaps not normalized. I'll have to check if it's normalized first.

Then there are two observables, P and Q, each represented by their respective matrices. The task is to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring them in sequence—first P, then Q.

I remember that when measuring an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator. So I need to find the eigenvalues of P and Q to see what possible results we can get.

Let me start by writing down the matrices for P and Q.

Matrix P:
First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Matrix Q:
First row: 1, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -1

Wait, Q looks like a diagonal matrix. So its eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: 1, 0, -1. So possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

For P, since it's not diagonal, I need to find its eigenvalues. Let's try to compute them. The eigenvalues of a matrix are the solutions to the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

But maybe there's a smarter way. Let me look at matrix P. It's a 3x3 matrix with some symmetry. Let me write it out:

Row 1: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]

Hmm, this seems like a matrix that might have eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0. Because looking at it, maybe it's a symmetric matrix (yes, it is symmetric because the element (i,j) equals (j,i)), so it should have real eigenvalues. Alternatively, perhaps it's a permutation matrix scaled by 1/sqrt(2). Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the matrix P is a spin operator or something similar, but perhaps it's constructed from permutation matrices. Let's see. The matrix has 1/sqrt(2) in positions (1,2), (2,1), (2,3), and (3,2), and zeros elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps P is a combination of Pauli matrices, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation.

The characteristic equation for P would be:

|P - λ I| = 0

So the determinant of:

[ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

[1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

[ 0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Let me compute this determinant.

Expanding the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] - (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding along the first row.

The determinant is:

-λ * det[ [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ], [1/sqrt(2), -λ ] ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * det[ [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ], [0, -λ ] ]
+ 0 * ... (since third element is zero)

So calculating each minor.

First minor: [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]
            [1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

The determinant is (λ^2) - (1/2), since (1/sqrt(2))^2 is 1/2.

So first term is -λ (λ^2 - 1/2)

Second minor: [1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2) ]
             [0, -λ ]

Determinant is (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))*0 = -λ / sqrt(2)

Second term is - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-lambda / sqrt(2)) ) = (lambda) / (2)

So overall equation:

-λ (λ^2 - 1/2) + (lambda/2) = 0

Let me factor this:

[ -λ^3 + (λ/2) ] + (lambda/2) = 0

Wait, no, expanding the first term:

-λ (λ^2 - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ)(1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ/2)

Then the second term is (lambda/2). So adding them:

(-λ^3 + λ/2) + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ

So the equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor this as λ (-λ^2 + 1) ) = 0.

So the solutions are λ = 0, and -λ^2 +1 =0 → λ^2=1 → λ=1 and λ=-1.

So eigenvalues of P are 1, -1, 0.

Ah, that's convenient! So possible outcomes for P are 1, 0, -1.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So, the steps are:

1. Measure P. If P=0, the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector of P.

2. Then, measure Q on this new state, and find the probability of getting Q=-1.

The overall probability is the product of the probability of P=0 and, given that, the probability of Q=-1 in the new state.

Alternatively, perhaps the state after measuring P=0 is an eigenstate of P, and then we compute the probability for Q in that state.

Wait, but another approach: Since the measurements are sequential, first P then Q, the state after measuring P affects the state for Q's measurement.

But perhaps there's a more straightforward way. Let me think.

The initial state vector is given as (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but this is a column vector. Let me check if it's normalized.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized, which is a bit of a problem. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors. So perhaps the given state is actually |ψ> = 1/sqrt(6) * (-1, 2, 1)^T. Because otherwise, the probabilities wouldn't sum to 1.

So I'll proceed under the assumption that the state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

Now, I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0 and measuring Q gives -1.

First, find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to each eigenvalue.

Earlier, I found that P's eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

Let me find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

Starting with eigenvalue λ=0.

Solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0 → P |v> = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 → 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 =0 → v2=0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) → (1/sqrt(2)) v1 +0*v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 =0.

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0 → 0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3=0 → v2=0.

So from row 1 and 3, v2=0.

From row 2: (1/sqrt(2))(v1 + v3) )=0 → v1 + v3 =0 → v3 = -v1.

So eigenvectors for λ=0 are of the form [v1, 0, -v1]^T.

Let me choose v1=1, so the eigenvector is (1, 0, -1)^T. But it's not normalized yet. The norm is sqrt(1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

Wait, but wait, because when I wrote v3=-v1, so for v1=1, v3=-1, so the vector is (1,0,-1). Normalizing gives 1/sqrt(2) each for the first and third components.

Similarly, perhaps other eigenvectors, but let's just proceed.

So the eigenvector for P=0 is |0_P> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Wait, no. Let me double-check. Because when I set v1=1, v3=-1, so the vector is (1,0,-1). So normalized, it's (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, the initial state |ψ> is (-1, 2, 1)^T / sqrt(6).

I need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. That is the square of the amplitude of the component of |ψ> in the direction of |0_P>.

The amplitude is the inner product <0_P | ψ>.

Compute this:

<0_P | ψ> = [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)] * [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]

= (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + (-1/sqrt(2))*(1/sqrt(6)).

= [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

= [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ] + [ -1/(sqrt(12)) ]

= -2/(sqrt(12)) = -2/(2*sqrt(3)) ) = -1/sqrt(3).

The square of the absolute value is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting P=0 is 1/3.

After measuring P=0, the state collapses to |0_P> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

Now, we need to measure Q. The matrix for Q is diagonal with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The eigenvectors for Q can be read from the matrix:

For Q, each basis vector is an eigenvector.

Because Q is diagonal, the eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

So eigenstates:

For Q=1 → |1_Q> = (1, 0, 0)^T.

For Q=0 → |0_Q> = (0, 1, 0)^T.

For Q=-1 → |-1_Q> = (0,0,1)^T.

These are already orthonormal.

Now, the state after P=0 is |0_P> = (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2).

We need to find the probability of measuring Q=-1.

Which is the square of the amplitude of |0_P> in the direction of |-1_Q>.

The amplitude is < -1_Q | 0_P >.

Which is (0, 0, 1) * (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2))^T.

= (0)(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*0 + 1*(-1/sqrt(2)) ) = -1/sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

So the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because for the state |0_P>, which is (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2), the components are along the first and third basis vectors.

But when measuring Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. The probability for Q=-1 is the square of the amplitude of the third component.

Because the eigenstate for Q=-1 is (0,0,1). So the inner product is (0,0,1) · (1,0,-1)/sqrt(2) → (-1)/sqrt(2). So the amplitude is -1/sqrt(2), magnitude squared is 1/2.

So the probability is 1/2.

So the overall probability is the product of the two probabilities: (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Wait, but wait a minute. Because when you measure P first and get 0, the state collapses to |0_P>, which is an eigenstate of P but not necessarily of Q. So when measuring Q, the probabilities are determined by the expansion of |0_P> in terms of Q's eigenstates.

Wait, but in this case, |0_P> is (1, 0, -1)/sqrt(2). So when written in terms of Q's eigenstates, the third component is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability for Q=-1 is | -1/sqrt(2) |^2 = 1/2.

So the total probability is (probability P=0) * (probability Q=-1 | P=0) ) = (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1/6. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me recheck. Another approach: perhaps the combined probability is the modulus squared of the inner product between the initial state and the tensor product of the eigenstates.

But I think the way I did it is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the joint probability using projectors.

The state |ψ> is (-1,2,1)/sqrt(6).

The probability to get P=0 is | <0_P | ψ> |^2 = 1/3.

After that, the state is |0_P>. The probability to get Q=-1 is | < -1_Q | 0_P > |^2 = 1/2.

Multiply them: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6. So the answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the sequential measurements of observables \( P \) and \( Q \) on the given quantum state. The initial state is \( |\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), and the operators \( P \) and \( Q \) are represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to find the probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in the respective measurements.

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix for \( P \) is:
\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( P \) are determined by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The eigenvalues are found to be \( \lambda = 1, -1, 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is \( |0_P\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 2: Probability of \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the amplitude of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |0_P\rangle \):
\[
P(P=0) = |\langle 0_P | \psi \rangle|^2.
\]
Computing the inner product:
\[
\langle 0_P | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 3: State after \( P = 0 \)
If \( P = 0 \) is measured, the state collapses to \( |0_P\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 4: Probability of \( Q = -1 \) after \( P = 0 \)
The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal:
\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), and the eigenstate corresponding to \( Q = -1 \) is \( |-1_Q\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the amplitude of the projection of \( |0_P\rangle \) onto \( |-1_Q\rangle \):
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = |\langle -1_Q | 0_P \rangle|^2.
\]
Computing the inner product:
\[
\langle -1_Q | 0_P \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
The probability is:
\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Total probability
The total probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:
\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The probability of obtaining \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) in the respective measurements is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Answer: D
