Okay, I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident in stoichiometry and enthalpy calculations. But I'll give it a shot. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three solutions are mixed: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. The options are given as A to D, with some values in kcal and others in kJ. Hmm, I wonder if the units will affect the answer. Well, I'll proceed step by step.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The reaction is usually exothermic, so the enthalpy change should be negative, which matches the options given.

I think the first step is to figure out how much acid and base we have in terms of moles. Because when they mix, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid and it's diprotic, so each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well; each molecule has two OH- ions.

So, let me calculate the moles for each solution.

For HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL (which is 0.5 L). Moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole of H+.

For H2SO4: Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL (0.3 L). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of H2SO4 gives two H+ ions, so total H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

For Ba(OH)2: Molarity 0.5 M, volume 200 mL (0.2 L). Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, so total OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Now, I need to find out the total H+ and OH-. 

Total H+ = HCl's H+ + H2SO4's H+ = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = Ba(OH)2's OH- = 0.2 moles.

So when they react, the H+ and OH- will combine to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. Since H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2, the OH- is the limiting reagent here. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles of H+ will remain.

Wait, but wait a second. The neutralization reaction might not just be simple combination. I think the overall reaction needs to balance all the components. Let me think about how these acids and bases react.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. H2SO4 is also a strong acid, but since it's diprotic, the second H+ is also strong. So both will dissociate completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and will dissociate into Ba²+ and 2OH-.

So when mixed, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4, and the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

The reaction will combine H+ and OH- to form water. Let's write the net ionic equation:

H+ (from acids) + OH- (from base) → H2O

The total moles of H+ available are 0.28, and OH- is 0.2. So all OH- will react, and some H+ will remain.

But wait, what about the stoichiometry if the acids have more H+? So the neutralization will only proceed until the OH- is consumed. The excess H+ will remain in solution, making the solution acidic.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically calculated per mole of H+ reacting with OH-. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ/mol (or -13.6 kcal/mol) per mole of H+ neutralized. But wait, I need to double-check that value. I remember that the enthalpy for a strong acid and strong base is around -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So, since 0.2 moles of OH- are reacting, each OH- combines with an H+ to form water. So each mole of H+ and OH- reaction releases about 57 kJ (exothermic, so negative).

So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57,300 J/mol) because 57.3 kJ is 57300 J. Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me calculate in both units to see which option matches.

Alternatively, I remember that 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ, so 57.3 kJ is roughly 13.66 kcal per mole of H+.

Wait, so for each mole of H+ neutralized, the enthalpy change is -57.3 kJ or about -13.6 kcal. Let's proceed.

In this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are reacting with OH-.

So, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57,300 J) = -11,460 J, which is -11.46 kJ. Alternatively, in kcal, 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal and option B is -11.42 kJ. So if the question is asking for the total enthalpy, which is either in kcal or kJ, then I have two possibilities.

But wait, the question says "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when... are mixed."

Wait, sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of reaction, like per mole of H+ or per mole of acid. So I need to clarify.

Wait, the problem could be that the neutralization is considering all the H+ and OH- that can react. So, the OH- is 0.2 moles, so the neutralization releases 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's negative. Or in kcal, 0.2 * 13.6 kcal = 2.72, so negative.

Looking at the options:

A) -2.72 kcal → which is 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72, so negative.

B) -11.42 kJ → which is 0.2 * 57.3 ≈ 11.46, so negative.

So the answer would be either A or B, depending on the units. But the options have both. So which one is correct?

Wait, the options are presented as A to D, with D in kJ. So perhaps I need to check the question again. Oh wait, the question says "Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when...", which is usually per mole of H+ or per mole of reaction. But in this case, the problem is mixing three solutions, so the total enthalpy would be based on moles of reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- and find the heat released.

Wait, but enthalpy of neutralization is typically defined per mole of reaction. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The total moles of H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. Since OH- is less, only 0.2 moles of H+ will react with OH-.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ, which is around -11.46 kJ, so option B is -11.42 kJ, which is very close.

Alternatively, if we use the kcal approach: 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So now I'm a bit confused because both options A and B are possible answers based on unit conversions. But the problem is that the question is giving two different units. So perhaps the correct way is to compute in kJ or kcal.

Wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is given as about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-), so the total would be 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, negative. So the correct answer would be around -11.46 kJ, which is option B (-11.42 kJ). But wait, the option is -11.42, which is pretty close.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in kcal. Let me compute 0.2 * 13.6 kcal: 0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72, so -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So which unit should I use? The options include both. The question doesn't specify. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the molarity and volumes are given in mL, but the units of enthalpy are given in kcal and kJ. So, perhaps the correct way is to use the standard enthalpy per mole of H+.

Wait, but let me think if there's another approach. Maybe the problem is that I'm mixing three solutions, so perhaps the Ba(OH)2 has a higher concentration of OH- and the other acids contribute H+.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider the equivalents.

Wait, equivalents are moles of H+ or OH- available for reaction. So, for HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 equivalents (since each HCl gives one H+).

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4 → each gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 equivalents.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 → each gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 equivalents.

So total equivalents of acid: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total equivalents of base: 0.2.

So the neutralization will proceed until the base is exhausted. So 0.2 equivalents of OH- will react with 0.2 equivalents of H+.

So the moles of H+ reacting are 0.2, and moles of OH- reacting are 0.2.

So, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at option B: -11.42 kJ. That's very close, so that's likely the correct answer.

But wait, why is option A present? Because if I calculate using kcal, 0.2 * (-13.6 kcal) = -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

So the problem now is the units. The question says "calculate the enthalpy of neutralization", and the options have two units. So perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, so option B would be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard enthalpy is given per mole of H+ as -13.6 kcal, so for 0.2 moles, it's -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what's the standard way. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often given as -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH-). So, if 0.2 moles of H+ react, the heat released is 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ, but since it's exothermic, it's negative, so -11.46 kJ, which is closest to option B (-11.42 kJ).

So why is option A even an option? Because maybe they're using the kcal value. Let me compute 57.3 kJ to kcal:

57.3 kJ = 57,300 J. Since 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 57,300 / 4184 ≈ 13.66 kcal. So per mole of H+, it's about -13.66 kcal.

So for 0.2 moles, it's 0.2 * 13.66 = 2.732 kcal. Hmm, but option A is -2.72, which is close but not exact. But perhaps the question uses an approximation, like 13.6 kcal per mole.

0.2 * 13.6 = 2.72, so option A is exactly that. But why would the units be in kcal? Because some textbooks use kcal for such calculations, especially in biological contexts. But in general chemistry, kJ is more common.

The options are a mix of kcal and kJ. The correct approach would be to figure out the unit the question expects.

Wait, looking back at the question, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kJ

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So options A and C are in kcal, B and D in kJ. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles calculation.

Let me double-check the moles calculations:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol of OH-.

So total H+ is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- is 0.2 mol.

So all OH- will react, using up 0.2 mol H+. So the neutralization reaction is 0.2 mol. So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * delta H per mole.

Now, the delta H per mole is either -57.3 kJ or -13.6 kcal.

So, either way, the answer is either -11.46 kJ or -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, both are present. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be in kJ, so B is correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's in kcal, so A is correct. But the options include both, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the enthalpy change in the reaction, not per mole. So the total would be 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ (negative), so option B.

Alternatively, the question might expect per mole of reaction, but that's not applicable here because the reaction's extent is 0.2 moles.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to calculate the total heat released when all possible H+ and OH- react.

So, I think Option B is the correct answer in the context of the given options because it's the right number in kJ. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, in some cases, the enthalpy of neutralization is given as per mole of acid. For example, HCl is a monoprotic acid, so each mole gives one mole of H+. H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives two. But when mixed with a base, the reaction is between H+ and OH-.

So, perhaps the enthalpy is calculated based on the moles of H+ and OH- reacting.

So, the total moles of H+ reacting is 0.2. So the total enthalpy change is 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ, which is option B (-11.42 kJ). That's very close, so I think that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, if I use 57.3 kJ per mole of H+:

0.2 moles → 0.2 * 57.3 = 11.46 kJ. So the answer is approximately -11.46 kJ. Option B is -11.42 kJ, which is the closest.

So I think the correct answer is B.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **HCl (monoprotic acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so total H⁺ = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic acid):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so total H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so total OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine limiting reagent:**
   - Total H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).  
   - Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
   Since OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ will react with OH⁻.

3. **Calculate enthalpy change:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for each mole of H⁺ reacting with OH⁻ is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) or \( -13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol} \).  
   - For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacting:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
     In kcal:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \times (-13.6 \, \text{kcal/mol}) = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

4. **Compare with options:**
   - Option A: \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) matches the calculation in kcal.  
   - Option B: \( -11.42 \, \text{kJ} \) matches the calculation in kJ.  
   - Options C and D are incorrect based on the calculations.

5. **Final decision:**
   Since the question provides options in both kJ and kcal, and the standard enthalpy of neutralization is commonly expressed in kJ, the most appropriate answer is \( -11.42 \, \text{kJ} \).

Answer: B
