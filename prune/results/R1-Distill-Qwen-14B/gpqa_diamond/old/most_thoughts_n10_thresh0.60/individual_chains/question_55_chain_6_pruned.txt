Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The question is asking me to identify an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are four different acetates: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. Hmm, I remember that the structure of these compounds will affect the NMR signals, especially the protons near double bonds, which are usually deshielded and show up in the aromatic region or around it.

Looking at the NMR data provided:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, doublet, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, doublet of quadruplets)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, singlet)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, doublet)

Alright, let's break this down. I think about the structures of each option. Acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are organic groups. So in this case, the ester is either propenyl or butenyl.

First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm, integrating for 3H. That's probably the methyl group (OAc group) because in acetates, the OAc is a methyl group attached to the oxygen. The singlet suggests it's not split by any neighboring protons, which aligns with the methyl group since there are no adjacent protons.

Next, the doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz. That seems like a proton coupled with another, perhaps in a trans configuration because the coupling constant can be higher. Wait, but wait, higher coupling constants (like ~16 Hz) are typical for double bonds since that's a conjugated system. So this could be a vinyl proton. The doublet (d) suggests each of these protons has one neighboring proton, so maybe it's a trans double bond with two sets of protons.

Then, the 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets (dq). That's a bit more complex. A doublet of quadruplets would imply that this proton is coupling with two different sets of protons, each with their own coupling constants. Or maybe it's a quartet and a doublet? Alternatively, perhaps this is a proton that's adjacent to two different environments, like being next to a double bond and another substituent.

Looking at the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H). That's another set of three protons as a doublet. Probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH2 or CH group. Wait, but 3H suggests it's a CH3 group. So perhaps it's a methyl group next to a double bond. Like in a propenyl group, the CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but in propenyl groups, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-O-... or similar.

Wait, let's think about the structures of the options:

1. Cis-propenyl acetate: Structure would be CH₂=CH-CH₂-OAc. But wait, propenyl is CH₂CH₂CH3 with
