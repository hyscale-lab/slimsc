Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But the main focus is on two parts: A and B. 

Part A asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The options given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Part B is about which of the two compounds (methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate) shows optical isomerism.

Hmm, I need to tackle each part separately.

Starting with part A: Tautomerism is when a compound can shift between different tautomeric forms, usually through the movement of a hydrogen and the rearrangement of double bonds. For example, in keto-enol tautomerism, a ketone can tautomerize to an enol and vice versa.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which I think has two carbonyl groups. Wait, benzoquinone is benzene with two ketone groups opposite each other. But wait, benzoquinone is actually a di-ketone. Wait, does it have any acidic hydrogens that can tautomerize? The carbonyl groups are in a conjugated system, so maybe there's some resonance, but I'm not sure if it can tautomerize. Alternatively, maybe it's more about whether the structure allows for keto-enol tautomerism.

Wait, wait. Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups. Does it have any adjacent hydrogens that can cause tautomerism? Alternatively, I'm thinking about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, three carbonyl groups. Could this compound undergo tautomerism?

Wait, in a cyclic structure with multiple ketones, maybe tautomerism isn't possible. For tautomerism, you typically need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's think: Benzoquinone has two carbonyl groups, but each is on a benzene ring, which doesn't have adjacent hydrogens. Wait, wait,
