Okay, let me try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on titrations, but I'll think it through step by step.

So the problem says we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is being diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I'll outline what I remember about titrations. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. The reaction between them will produce acetate ions and water. The equivalence point is where moles of acid equal moles of base.

Wait, but before that, I need to find the concentration of the diluted acetic acid solution. Because when you mix two volumes, the concentration changes. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ and concentration 0.05 M. Then adding 20 cm³ of water, so total volume is 40 cm³.

Molarity is moles per liter. So moles of acetic acid initially would be Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Then, the diluted volume is 0.04 L, so the new concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So after dilution, the concentration is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks for pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point.

Wait, 25% of what? I think it refers to 25% of the volume required to reach the equivalence point. Or maybe 25% of the moles? Oh, I think it's based on the volume. Let me think: the equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid.

Moles of acetic acid after dilution is 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait, because the initial moles were
