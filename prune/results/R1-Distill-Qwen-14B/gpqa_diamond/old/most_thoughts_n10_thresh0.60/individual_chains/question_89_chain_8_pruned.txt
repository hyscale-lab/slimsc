Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question involves reactions starting from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and going through several steps to form product 3. Then, I need to determine the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, let me read the question carefully. The starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH at 240°C, creating a light yellow solid product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 has peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR shows an absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which I think is a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester).

So, step one: reaction with KOH. Since it's dibromide, and in the presence of a strong base like KOH, I think an elimination reaction is happening. Wait, but wait, it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If both bromines are on adjacent carbons in some structure, perhaps the base would abstract a β hydrogen, leading to the formation of an alkene.

Wait, but adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, right? So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on opposite faces, perhaps. So when heated with KOH, which is a strong base, it undergoes dehydrohalogenation. Two eliminations would occur? Or maybe it's a di-elimination leading to an allene or a diene.

Wait, but the product after KOH is a solid with an IR peak at 1720, which is a strong carbonyl. So maybe it's not elimination but rather a nucleophilic substitution that forms a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility is that KOH could cause a substitution reaction. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane might undergo a double elimination. Let me think: Each Br is on adjacent carbons (since it's 1,3, but in adamantane, the positions might be on adjacent carbons in some ring structure). So when KOH is added, perhaps each Br is removed, and each elimination forms a double bond.
