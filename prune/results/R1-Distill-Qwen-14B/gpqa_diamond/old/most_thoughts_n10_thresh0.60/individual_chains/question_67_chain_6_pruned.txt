Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Oh wait, p orbitals have l=1, right? So each electron has its own orbital angular momentum quantum number, l1 and l2. The problem gives the state as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, that's |l1, l2, l, m>. Oh, right, so l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is its z-component.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L1z and L2z for each electron. We need to find the probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -침.

Wait, what do I remember about Lz eigenvalues? For a single particle, the eigenvalue is m침, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So for each electron, L1z has eigenvalues m1 * 침, and L2z has m2 * 침.

In the state given, each electron is in a p orbital, so l1 = l2 =1. The total angular momentum is l=2, and m=-1.

Wait, but the state is a coupled angular momentum state. I remember that when you combine two angular momenta, you can have states that are eigenstates of the total L^2 and L_z. So the state |l1, l2, l, m> is an eigenstate of L^
