Okay, let's try to figure out this quantum mechanics problem. So, the question is about the decay of a hydrogen atom state from |3,0,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in hydrogen atom transitions, electrons change energy levels through emission or absorption of photons, and dipole transitions involve changes in the angular momentum.

Wait, dipole transitions are governed by certain selection rules. Oh right, the selection rules for electric dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the orbital angular momentum l can change by 1, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩. So n=3, l=0 (s orbital), m=0. It decays to |1,0,0⟩, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. So from l=0 to l=0? That doesn't seem right because l has to change by ±1 for a dipole transition. Wait, but the decay is via two steps. So each step must follow the selection rules.

Let me think. The first transition must go from l=0 to l=1 because you can't have l=0 → l=0. So from |3,0,0⟩, the possible next states are where l=1. So the next state would have l=1, and m can be -1, 0, +1. But wait, the initial m is 0, so the possible m after first transition would be m = 0-1, 0, or 0+1 → m = -1, 0, +1.

So first transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1, m where m is -1,0, +1. Because during the first dipole transition, n decreases by 1? Or can it change by more? Wait, the selection rules for n are Δn = ±1, but wait, no, actually for dipole transitions, the Δn can be ±1, but the exact change depends on the transition.

Wait, no, wait. The standard selection rules for electric dipole (which is what the question is about since it says dipole transition) are: Δl = ±1 and Δn = any, but actually, no
