Okay, so I have this problem about stellar abundances and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, let me read through the question again and jot down the details.

The stars are Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass. But wait, the problem says to use the EW method and LTE assumption, so maybe the masses aren't directly relevant for the calculations here. The key data are the elemental abundances given by their logarithmic ratios.

Let me list the given data:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

Wait, what do these [X/Y] mean? Oh right, the brackets denote logarithmic abundance ratios relative to hydrogen. [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Or alternatively, [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

Actually, I think the correct formula is [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, minus the same ratio for the Sun.

So, for Star_1, [
