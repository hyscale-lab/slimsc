Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of titration calculations. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct pair.

First, I think I should figure out what's happening in each part of the process. Let's break it down.

So, when we mix equal volumes of acetic acid and water, the concentration of the acetic acid will be halved because the volume doubles. Wait, no, because dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, making 40 cm³ total. So the concentration after dilution would be (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (0.05*20)/40 = 1/4 M? Wait, 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 is 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Wait, but wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't completely dissociate. But for the initial calculations, perhaps I'll first find the initial concentration after dilution.

Next, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH, which will form the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) and water. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid present initially in the diluted solution.

Wait, but let's think about the equivalence point first because that might be easier. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to form acetate ions. The solution would then be a solution of sodium acetate, which is a salt of a weak acid and a strong base,
