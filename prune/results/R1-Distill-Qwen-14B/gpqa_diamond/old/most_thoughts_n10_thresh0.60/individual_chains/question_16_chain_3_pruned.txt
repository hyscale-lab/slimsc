Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about optical activity in organic chemistry. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through step by step. The question lists several compounds, and I need to determine how many of them are optically active. The options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

First, I remember that a compound is optically active if it has chiral centers, meaning the compound isn't superimposable on its mirror image. But wait, there's more to it. Some compounds might have symmetry or other factors that make them achiral despite having stereocenters. Also, meso compounds are a thing. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral because there's a plane or center of symmetry in the molecule.

Okay, let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, this is a diene with a chlorine on the first carbon. Wait, but for a molecule to have chirality, it needs four different groups attached to a carbon. Let me look at the structure.

   The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, wait, no, wait: 2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Or wait, but the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, but wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, wait, no: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So in this case, the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, that canâ€™t be right because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So where is the methyl?

   Let me draw it: the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure
