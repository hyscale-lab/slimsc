Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid. Hmm, I think I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react in a neutralization reaction.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³, right? Because 20 plus 20 is 40. So the concentration of the diluted acetic acid would be half the original concentration, because the volume doubles. So 0.05 M divided by 2 is 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh no, no. The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and the volume is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So the new concentration is (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Oh right, that's 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Then we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, let me tackle the equivalence point. At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid before dilution. Wait, no: the diluted solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M. So moles of acetic acid is 0.025 mol/L * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. Because 40 cm³ is 0.04 L. So moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 moles.

NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed to reach equivalence is moles / concentration. So V = 0.001 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.01 L = 10 cm
