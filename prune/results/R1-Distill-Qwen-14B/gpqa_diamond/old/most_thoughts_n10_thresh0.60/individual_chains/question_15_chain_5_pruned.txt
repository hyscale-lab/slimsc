Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in the star's brightness. The probability of a planet transiting depends on the size of the planet and the star, and the orientation of the orbit.

The question says that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, so Planet_1 is closer to its star since a shorter orbital period usually means a smaller orbit, right? Because according to Kepler's third law, the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. So if the period is shorter, the planet is closer in.

Now, the host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Oh, that's interesting because usually, more massive stars are larger, but here they've evolved to the same size. So, the radius of the stars is the same. 

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of transit depends on the relative size of the planet to the star and the alignment of the orbit. The formula I remember for transit probability is roughly (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else... Wait, actually, I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is edge-on to our line of sight. But the exact probability calculation... I think it's based on the geometry of the system.

Wait, the formula for the probability P that a planet transits its star is given by:

P = (R_star + R_planet) / a * (1 / (1 - (R_star/a)^2)) )

Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, the probability is approximately (R_planet / R_star)² divided by (some factor involving the orbital distance), but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is proportional to (R_star)² / (a² (1 - e²)^½), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so it simplifies. Wait, but I think the exact formula might be more involved. 

Wait, I've read that the probability can be approximated as (R_planet / R_star)² * (
