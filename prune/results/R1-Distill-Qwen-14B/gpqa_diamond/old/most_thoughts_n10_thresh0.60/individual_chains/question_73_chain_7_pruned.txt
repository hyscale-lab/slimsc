Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to think it through.

First, let's read the question again. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a possible relative speed and energy.

Wait, so relative speed in relativity doesn't work the same as classical mechanics. Oh right! Because when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just subtract their velocities. I remember the formula for adding velocities in special relativity. Oh, right, the formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(cÂ²)). 

But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut 1 is moving at 0.6c, astronaut 2 at 0.5c. So from astronaut 1's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 2? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, the relative speed would be how fast astronaut 1 sees astronaut 2 moving. Since they're both moving in the positive x, astronaut 2 is moving slower than astronaut 1. So from astronaut 1's frame, astronaut 2's speed is v2' = (v2 - v
