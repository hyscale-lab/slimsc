Okay, I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of a specific state via dipole transitions. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

So, the problem states that the |3,0,0> state decays to |1,0,0> through two dipole transitions. I need to find the transition route and the corresponding probability from the given options.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by the selection rules. For electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1 (change in angular momentum), and Δm = 0, ±1 (change in magnetic quantum number). Also, the transition is allowed only if there's a change in the principal quantum number n, but since this is a two-step process, I think each step must follow the selection rules.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. The final state is |1,0,0>. So, the principal quantum number decreases from 3 to 1. But because each transition can only change n by 1 (since the selection rule for dipole is Δn = ±1?), wait, no, wait. Wait, I think the selection rule for electric dipole transitions is Δn can be any except 0, but in this case, the transition is happening in two steps, so each step would have to change n by 1, right?

So, starting from n=3, the first transition would have to go to n=2 or n=4. But since the final state is n=1, the second transition must take n=2 to n=1. So, the first step is 3→2, and the second is 2→1.

Now, for each transition, the angular momentum l must change by ±1. So, the initial state is l=0. So, the first transition must go to l=1 (since l can't be negative; l starts at 0 and goes up). So, after the first transition, l becomes 1, and m can change by 0 or ±1.

Wait, the first transition is from |3,0,0> to a state with l=1. So, possible states are |2,1,m>, where m can be -1, 0, +1. So, the possible intermediate states are |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,+1>.

Then, from there, the next transition must go to the final state |1,0,0>. So, the second transition must change l=1 to l=0 because the final state has l=0. So, the second transition must be from l=1 to l=0, which is allowed.

Now, what about m? For the first transition, from m=0 in |3,0,0>, the possible m values in the first excited state would be -1, 0, +1. Then, for the second transition, m can change by 0, ±1. But the final state has m=0.

So, let's see. The first transition takes m from 0 to some m', and the second transition must take m' to 0.

So, options for first step:

If first transition goes to m'=0 (so |2,1,0>), then the second transition must have m'=0 → m''=0 (allowed, since Δm can be 0). So, that's possible.

Alternatively, if first step goes to m' =1, then the second step must change m from 1 to 0 or 1 or 2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, for the second transition, the initial m is 1 (from the first step). So, the allowed m changes are 0, ±1. So, from m=1, the next m can be 0, 1, or 2. Wait, but the final state has m=0, so that's allowed. So, that's possible.

Similarly, if the first transition goes to m=-
