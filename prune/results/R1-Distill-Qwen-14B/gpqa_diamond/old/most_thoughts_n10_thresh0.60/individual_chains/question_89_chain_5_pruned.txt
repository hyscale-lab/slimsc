Okay, so I'm faced with this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and breaking it down.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The first step is heating it with excess KOH to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to get product 2. After that, ozone is bubbled through product 2 at -78°C, followed by adding dimethylsulfide to form product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's 1H NMR spectrum.

Let me try to outline each step and see what's happening.

First reaction: 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH. I remember that KOH can be a strong base. Since the compound is dibrominated, perhaps it's undergoing elimination? But wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is a bridged bicyclic compound, so elimination might not be straightforward. Alternatively, it could be an E2 elimination, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. But wait, KOH in a high temperature—maybe it's a Hofmann elimination? But Hofmann usually involves amines. Alternatively, since adamantane is a highly substituted structure, perhaps the KOH is causing the bromides to leave, leading to some kind of ring opening or formation of alkenes.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has an absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That suggests the product is an epoxide or possibly a ketone. Wait, 1720 is around the region for a ketone or an ester. But wait, if it's an epoxide, the carbonyl is part of a ring, but epoxides usually have lower wavenumbers, like around 1200-1300. Hmm, maybe I was wrong. Alternatively, wait, 1720 is probably a ketone
