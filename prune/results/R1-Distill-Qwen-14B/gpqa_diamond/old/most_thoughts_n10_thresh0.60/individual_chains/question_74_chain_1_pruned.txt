Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let me try to think through it. 

The question says that we have an atom which has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% probability it has decayed. Wait, no, actually, wait. No, I think that's not the right way to look at it. Because radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? The probability of decay isn't just additive. So, the 32% is the probability that the atom decays within that 100 minutes. 

So, the problem is, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm. Wait, 150 minutes from now, or a total of 150 minutes since the start? Because 50 minutes have passed, so the next 150 would make it 200 total. Or is it 150 minutes starting now, so the total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes? Wait, the question says, "in the next 150 minutes." So the total time from the initial monitoring is 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. 

But wait, the initial decay probability given is for 100 minutes. So I need to model this using the decay equation. Let me recall. The decay follows a certain probability over time. The probability that a nucleus hasn't decayed after time t is given by P(t) = e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. So, the probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). 

Given that, the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). 

I can solve for λ here. Let me rearrange that. e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

Wait, ln(0.68) is a negative number
