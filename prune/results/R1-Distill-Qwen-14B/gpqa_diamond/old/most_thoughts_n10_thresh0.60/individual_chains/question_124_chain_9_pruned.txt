Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles produce new types that travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20 on average. One third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so initially, at a gamma of 20, only one third make it. We need to find a gamma where two-thirds make it. So the gamma must be higher, because a higher Lorentz factor means higher speed, right? So the particles would travel further before decaying, meaning more of them reach the detector walls.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about how their lifetime and speed relate. Because particles that decay quickly (shorter lifetime) might not reach the detector if they don't travel far enough. But relativistic effects come into play here. The proper lifetime (tau) is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame, and the observed lifetime (t) is gamma times tau. So the particles' lifetime as seen by the detector is longer, allowing them to travel further.

So the distance a particle travels before decaying is velocity times the lifetime. The velocity is approximately the speed of light for ultra-relativistic particles, so we can take v ≈ c. So the distance is c multiplied by gamma tau.

The particles are produced at the center of the sphere, which has a radius of 30 meters. For a particle to reach the inner walls, the distance it needs to travel is 30 meters. So when the particles have a gamma such that gamma tau c is equal to or greater than 30 meters, the particle will reach the wall.

Wait, but in the initial case, gamma is 20 and one third reach the wall. Hmm. So let me model this.

Let me think about the fraction of particles that reach the wall. The particles are produced at the center, so the maximum distance they need to travel is R =30 m. The particles' proper lifetime is tau. So the time they have to reach the wall is t. But in the lab frame, their lifetime is gamma tau. So the time it takes for them to reach the wall is t = R / v. Since v ≈ c, t ≈ R/(c). So for them to reach the wall, their lifetime must be at least t, so gamma tau >= t= R/c.

Wait, no. Because the actual time in the lab frame is gamma tau. So the time available for the particle to reach the wall is t = R/v. So the condition is that the particle's lifetime (gamma tau) must be >= t. So gamma tau >= R/(v). But since v is approximately c, gamma tau >= R/(c).

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the particle is created at the center, it's moving towards the wall. The time it takes to reach the wall is R/(v). If the particle's lifetime (gamma tau) is longer than that time, then it will reach the wall.

So the fraction of particles that reach the wall depends on whether gamma tau is greater than R/(v). But since the particles are ultra-relativistic, v ≈ c, so R/(v) ≈ R/c.

So the condition is gamma tau >= R/(c). So the probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its lifetime (in lab frame) is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall.

But wait, particles are produced, and their decay is a Poisson process. So the probability that a particle decays before traveling a certain distance is given by the exponential decay law.

The probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance x is P = 1 - exp(-x/(v gamma tau)).

Alternatively, since the mean lifetime is gamma tau, the decay probability is P = 1 - exp(-x/(v gamma tau)).

Wait, let me think again. The mean lifetime is gamma tau, so the
