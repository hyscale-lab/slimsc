Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember that elemental abundances are often discussed in terms of logarithmic scales, like those [X/Y] notation. Let me think about what each part means.

So the question gives me data for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a mass of 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. But wait, I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant unless it affects the abundance somehow. I'll put that thought aside for now.

The data given:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, but how does that help? I'm trying to find the ratio of silicon in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres. So [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] are given, which relate the abundance of those elements.

Let me recall how these abundance ratios work. The notation [X/Y] = log10(n_X / n_Y) - log10(n_X / n_Y)_sun. So it's the logarithm of the ratio relative to the Sun.

So for Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_star1 / log10(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3.

Wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/Y] is the difference between the star's log ratio and the Sun's log ratio. So [X/Y] = log( (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun )

Alternatively, another way: (n_X/n_Y)_star = (n_X/n_Y)_sun * 10^{[X/Y]}.

But wait, I think the definition is [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X^sun / n_Y^sun) ) ) → so it
