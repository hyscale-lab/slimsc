Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question has two parts, A and B, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out the major products for each and then match them to the options given.

Let's start with reaction A. The starting material is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, and the reagent is ethyl acrylate with t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so it's likely involved in some kind of elimination or maybe a substitution reaction. But wait, the starting material is a ketone, so maybe it's a Claisen or some kind of aldol addition? Or perhaps a Michael addition?

Wait, ethyl acrylate is a conjugated dienophile? Or maybe it's acting as a nucleophile here? Oh wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. So in the presence of a base, perhaps it's undergoing a conjugate addition. Or maybe it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that would require a diene and a dienophile. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the starting material is a cyclohexanone. The structure is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, numbering the cyclohexane ring, the ketone is at position
