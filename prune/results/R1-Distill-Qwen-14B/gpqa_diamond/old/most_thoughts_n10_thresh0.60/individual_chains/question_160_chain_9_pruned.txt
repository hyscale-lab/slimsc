Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. Hmm, all apothems are the same length a, and a monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining on it. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh right, and we can use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Wait, I remember that when the aperture becomes infinitely large in the number of sides, it's like a circular aperture. Because a polygon with infinite sides approximates a circle. So maybe the problem is similar to the single-slit diffraction but circular instead of rectangular.

In single-slit diffraction, the minima occur at angles where a sinθ = mλ, with m being integers. But wait, that's for a slit with width a. But here, the problem is about a polygon turning into a circle—so it's more like a circular aperture.

Wait, no, the single-slit diffraction is for a rectangular slit, while the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is different. Oh right, I think the minima for a circular aperture occur when the path difference leads to destructive interference. But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has rings, and the first minimum is at a certain angle. Oh, right! The formula I remember is sinθ = λ / (π a), but wait, that might be for the first minimum. Or was it something else? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, perhaps I
