Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the probability of them transiting in front of their host stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

So the setup is that there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both are Earth-like, and they've been detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method gives us their minimum masses and orbital periods. But the question is about their transit probabilities. The researchers want to observe the one with the highest probability of transiting because they have limited time.

Wait, transiting is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, right? And the probability of that happening depends on the size of the star and the planet's orbit. Oh right, the transit probability is higher if the star is smaller because there's a higher chance that the planet's path aligns with our line of sight.

The planets have the same mass, so their radii are probably similar. Because Earth-like, I'd assume their radii are about the same. So the key factors are the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

The question says both have circular orbits. So, the orbital period of Planet_1 is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Wait, shorter period means it's closer to its star, right? Because Kepler's third law says that the period squared is proportional to the semi-major axis cubed. So if P1 is three times smaller, a1 is cube root of (P1² / P2²) or something like that. Wait, let me think: if P1 = (1/3) P2, then (a1^3)/(a2^3) = (P1^2)/(P2^2) * (M_star1 / M_star2), because Kepler's law in terms of the star's mass is P² = (4π²/G(M+Ms)) a³. Since the planet masses are much smaller than stars, we can approximate M + m ≈ M. So P² = (4π²/GM) a³. So a³ is proportional to P² * M. 

Wait, so for each planet, a is proportional to cube root( P² * M ). So for Planet_1: a1 ~ sqrt( (P1^2 * M1) )^(1/3). Hmm, maybe I should write it more clearly.

Let me denote the period of Planet_1 as P1, Planet_2 as P2. So P1 = (1/3) P2.

So, M1 is twice M2. Because the first star has twice the mass of the second.

So the ratio of their semi-major axes would be a1/a2 = cube_root( (P1² * M1) / (P2² * M2) )

Substituting P1 = P2/3, and M1=2 M2:

a1/a2 = cube_root( ( ( (P2/3)^2 ) * 2 M2 ) / ( P2² * M2 ) )

Simplify numerator inside cube root:

( (P2²)/(9) ) * 2 M2 ) / (P2² M2) ) = ( 2/9 ) * ( P2² M2 ) / (P2² M2) ) = 2/9.

So a1/a2 = cube_root(2/9) ≈ cube_root(0.222) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is about 0.606 times a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

Wait, but the transit probability is the ratio of the star's radius to the semi-major axis. Because the planet has to pass within the star's apparent size. So the probability is roughly (R_star / a)², but wait, not exactly. I think the actual formula is (R*/a)^2, where R* is the star's radius.

Wait, no, I think the probability is more accurately the area of the star's disk divided by the area of the planet's orbital path, which is (π R*²) / (π a²) ) = (R* / a)^2.

But wait, another factor is the inclination. Oh, right, the transit probability is also dependent on the angle between the orbital plane and our line of sight. The probability of the inclination being just right for a transit is approximately (R* / a)². So higher probability when R* is bigger or a is smaller.

In this problem, the stars have the same radius. So R1 = R2. So the probability for each planet is proportional to (R*/a)^2. Since R* is same, it's (1/a)^2. So the planet with smaller a will have a higher probability because 1/a is bigger, so (1/a)^2 is bigger.

So, from earlier, a1 is about 0.606 a2. So a1 is smaller than a2. So (1/a1) is larger than (1/a2). So the probability for Planet_1 is (1/a1)^2, which is higher than (1/a2)^2.

Wait, but the actual probability for transit is ( R* / a )^2. Since R* is same for both, it's just (1/a)^2.

So let's compute the ratio of their probabilities. P1_prob / P2_prob = ( (1/a1)^2 ) / ( (1/a2)^2 ) ) = (a2/a1)^2.

We found that a1 = 0.606 a2, so a2/a1 = 1/0.606 ≈1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So the probability for Planet_1's transit is about 2.72 times higher than Planet_2's. So which planet has higher probability? Planet_1.

Wait, but wait, the options are about which one is preferred. So the researchers should observe the one with higher probability, which is Planet_1.

Looking at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to 1.65 times higher probability. But wait, according to our calculation, the ratio is around 2.7 times, which matches option D.

Wait, let me check.

Wait, because a1 is 0.606 a2, so a2 is about 1.65 a1. So a2/a1 is 1.65. So (a2/a1)^2 is (1.65)^2 = 2.7225, which is approximately 2.7 times. So Planet_1's probability is 2.7 times higher than Planet_2's.

So the correct choice would be D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

Wait, but wait, in the options, the probabilities are about which planet is higher.

Wait, the transit probability is P = (R*/a)^2 * (something else?), but another factor is (sine i), which relates to the inclination. No, I think for a random orientation, the probability is (R*/a)^2. So yes, our calculation is correct.

So the transit probability for Planet_1 is higher than Planet_2 by a factor of about (a2/a1)^2, which is (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.7. So the researchers should prefer Planet_1, which is option D.


To determine which planet has a higher probability of transiting, we analyze the transit probability formula, which is approximately proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\), where \(R_*\) is the star's radius and \(a\) is the planet's semi-major axis. Since both stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2\)), the probability depends on the inverse square of the semi-major axis (\(1/a^2\)).

### Key Information:
1. **Orbital Periods**: Planet_1 has an orbital period (\(P_1\)) three times shorter than Planet_2 (\(P_2\)), i.e., \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\).
2. **Star Masses**: The star hosting Planet_1 has twice the mass of the star hosting Planet_2, i.e., \(M_1 = 2M_2\).
3. **Star Radii**: Both stars have the same radius (\(R_1 = R_2\)).

### Step 1: Relating Semi-Major Axes
Using Kepler's third law, \(P^2 \propto a^3 / M\), we calculate the ratio of the semi-major axes:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{P_1^2 M_1}{P_2^2 M_2}}
\]
Substituting \(P_1 = \frac{1}{3}P_2\) and \(M_1 = 2M_2\):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{\left(\frac{P_2}{3}\right)^2 \cdot 2M_2}{P_2^2 \cdot M_2}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{2}{9}} \approx 0.606
\]
Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
The transit probability is proportional to \((R_*/a)^2\). Since \(R_1 = R_2\), the probability ratio is:
\[
\frac{P_{\text{Planet}_1}}{P_{\text{Planet}_2}} = \frac{(R_*/a_1)^2}{(R_*/a_2)^2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]
Substituting \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\):
\[
\frac{P_{\text{Planet}_1}}{P_{\text{Planet}_2}} = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx 1.65^2 \approx 2.7
\]
Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times higher transit probability than Planet_2.

### Conclusion:
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher transit probability.
