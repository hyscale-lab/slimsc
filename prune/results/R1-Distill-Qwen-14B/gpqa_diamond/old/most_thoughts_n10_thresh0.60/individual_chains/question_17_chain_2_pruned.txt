Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out what the concentration of calcium ions is in a solution. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says: What is the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex? They also mention that the pH is ideal and the temperature is 25°C, with the K for the Ca-EDTA complex being 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) is a ligand that forms complexes with metal ions. The Ca-EDTA complex is probably CaY²- where Y is the EDTA. The K given is the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is.

Wait, the formation constant Kf is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. And Kf is [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). Right.

But wait, another thing comes to mind. EDTA exists in different protonated forms depending on the pH. Oh, right, the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I can probably assume that EDTA is in its Y^4- form. That would be the deprotonated version, which is the one that complexes with Ca²+.

So the concentration given is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. Let's denote that as [CaY²-] = 0.02 M. Since the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-, but at such a high Kf value, the dissociation should be minimal. Because a big K means the complex is stable, so very little Ca²+ should be present.

So the problem is to find [Ca²+]. Let me write the K expression again. Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in a solution where only CaY²- is present, it can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. So the initial concentration is all CaY²-: 0.02 M. Let’s say that the dissociation is x. So the concentrations at equilibrium would be:

[CaY²-] = 0.
