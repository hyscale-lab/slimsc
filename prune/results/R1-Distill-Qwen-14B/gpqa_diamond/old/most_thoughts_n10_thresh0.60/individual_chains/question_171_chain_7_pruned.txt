Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the order of substances 1 to 6 based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer they form when reacted with excess bromine. Right, electrophilic substitution means the bromine is acting as an electrophile and substitutes a hydrogen on the benzene ring, probably in a specific position based on directing groups.

Wait, the question says it's an excess of bromine, so we can assume that each reaction goes to completion, but each only forms one monobromo derivative. So each substituent directs the bromine to specific positions, and for each, we need to determine whether the para position is major or minor, or if it's the only possible position.

Let me list the substituents first:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene, a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So when bromine substitutes, the bromine can go into ortho, para positions, but since it's an activating group, the substitution is more likely in those positions. Wait, but if it's para, how much is that?

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's benzoyloxy ethyl group? Or wait, wait, the structure is benzene with a COOEt group. Oh wait, no, wait, C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. So that's a benzoyloxy ethyl group? Wait, no,
