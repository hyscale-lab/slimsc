Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, so the question is about finding the probability of getting specific outcomes when measuring two observables, P and Q, in sequence. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you measure an observable, the system collapses into one of the eigenstates of that operator. And the probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is determined by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

So, the initial state of the system is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually normalized. Let me check if this vector is normalized. The components are -1, 2, 1. The square of each component is 1, 4, and 1. Adding them gives 6. So the norm is sqrt(6). I think I need to normalize this state because probabilities depend on normalized states.

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, maybe it's not necessary to normalize because perhaps the state is already given without requiring normalization? Or maybe the vectors are just part of the problem regardless of their norm. Hmm, but for calculating probabilities, the state should be normalized. Because otherwise, the probabilities might not sum to 1. Let me think. Oh, right, in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector. So I should first normalize the given state.

The given state is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4+1=6. So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

So the first step is to write the state as |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) (-i, 2, i)^T ? Wait, no, the numbers given are real, so the state is real. So the normalized state is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Wait, but the initial state given is (-1,2,1), which is a real vector. So when I normalize, I divide each component by sqrt(6).

Now, first, we measure P. The operator P is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write down matrix P:
