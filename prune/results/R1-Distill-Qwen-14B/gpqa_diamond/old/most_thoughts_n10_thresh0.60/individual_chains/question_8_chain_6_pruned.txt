Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's see what it's about. I remember that when dealing with knockouts and their phenotypes, we can figure out gene interactions by looking at how the mutants and double mutants perform.

The setup is that three genes, G1, G2, G3, were knocked out, and we have their resistance levels. The wild-type has 100% resistance. The mutants: G1 has 75%, G2 has 0%, G3 has 50%. The double mutants: g1g3 is 10%, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%.

Wait, the question states that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of another. So, maybe one of them is a regulatory gene that affects the others.

The problem is asking which conclusion we can draw about the genes' interactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each suggesting different things about which is the transcription factor and the relationships between the genes.

I remember that in gene interaction, if a double mutant has a more severe phenotype than either single mutant, it might suggest epistasis. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if the double mutant's phenotype is the same as one of the single mutants, that suggests that the other gene is epistatic.

Looking at the data:

- g2 alone gives 0% resistance. That's really bad, worse than any other single mutant. G1 gives 75%, which is a 25% reduction from control. G3 is at 50%, so 50% reduction.

Wait, but how does that relate to their functions? If G2 is a transcription factor upstream, perhaps it activates the other genes. So if G2 is knocked out, maybe the downstream genes can't be expressed, leading to no resistance.

Let's look at the double mutants:

g1g3: 10% resistance. Both g1 and g3 have some resistance on their own (75% and 50%), but together, it's worse than either. So maybe they contribute additive effects, but their combined loss makes it even worse. Or perhaps they're in parallel pathways.

g2g3: 0% resistance. So even though g3 alone gives 50%, when combined with g2 knockout, it's 0. That suggests that g2 knockout is masking the effect of g3. Because when both are knocked out, it's as bad as g2 alone.

g1g2: 0% resistance. Similarly, when both are knocked out, it's as bad as g2 alone. So when you add g1 knockout to g2, it doesn't get any worse than g2. Which implies that g2 is downstream of g1, or that g2 is epistatic to g1.

Wait, or maybe the other way around. If g2 is a transcription factor, then it's upstream. So without g2, the
