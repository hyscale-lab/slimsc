Okay, so I have this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at about 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. At shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops significantly. I remember that in quasars, there's something called the Lyman-alpha forest, which is related to absorption lines. Oh wait, the Lyman-alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet, but when we observe quasars at high redshifts, that line can shift into the optical or near infrared because of the expansion of the universe.

So, the peak at 790 nm probably corresponds to the rest wavelength of a certain emission line. The Lyman-alpha line in hydrogen has a rest wavelength of about 121.6 nm. If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer. So the redshift z would be calculated as (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) minus 1. So z = 790 / 121.6 - 1. Let me compute that.

Wait 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5, so z is about 5.5. That's a pretty high redshift. So the quasar is at z ≈5.5.

Now the question is about the comoving distance to the quasar. The comoving distance is the distance we would measure if we could somehow place a ruler between us and the object, accounting for the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance depends on the cosmological parameters given: Hubble constant H0, matter density Ω_m, dark energy Ω_Λ, and the curvature (which is flat, so Ω_k is zero).

The parameters given are H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_Λ=0.7, and flat universe. So I need to calculate the comoving distance at redshift z=5.5 under these parameters.

The comoving distance, D_C, is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_Λ + Ω_m*(1+z)^3). Because the universe is flat, Ω_Λ + Ω_m(1+z)^3 + Ω_k(1+z)^2 =1, but since Ω_k is zero, E(z) is as I wrote.

So the integral becomes D_C = (c/H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(0.7 + 0.3*(1+z')^3)] dz'

Hmm, but solving this integral analytically might be tough. I think I need to approximate it or use some known values or a table. I remember that for various z and cosmological parameters, the comoving distance can be looked up or estimated using standard methods.

Wait, I recall that for a flat universe dominated by dark energy (like the given Ω_Λ=0.7), the comoving distance increases with redshift, but the expansion starts to accelerate, which affects the integral.

Alternatively, I can think about approximate values. For example, at z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 Gpc for H0=70. But at higher z, like z=2, it's around 6 Gpc. Wait, but our z is 5.5, which is higher. So how does that scale?

Wait, wait. Let me think of another approach. There's also the concept of the luminosity distance, but the question is about comoving distance. The comoving distance is related to the proper distance at the time of emission but scaled by the expansion. Alternatively, the distance is integrated over the expansion from now to then.

But perhaps I can use an approximation formula or recall some standard values. Let me see. I think that for a flat universe with Ω_m=0.3 and Ω_Λ=0.7, the comoving distance to z=5 is roughly around 10 Gpc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait
