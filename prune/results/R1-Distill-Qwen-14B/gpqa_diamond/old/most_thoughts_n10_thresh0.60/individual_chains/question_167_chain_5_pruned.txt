Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy for a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. And N is the normalization constant sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²)). So first things first, I need to figure out what the density matrix rho looks like for this state.

Wait, a density matrix is just |psi><psi|, right? So rho would be the outer product of this state with itself. But since it's a pure state, rho is a projector, and the von Neumann entropy would involve the eigenvalues of rho. But wait, the relative entropy is comparing rho and tau, where tau is a Gaussian state.

But the options are given, and I have specific values for phi and alpha. Phi is -pi/4, and alpha is 0.5. Let me plug those in.

First, calculate N. Let's compute sin(2*phi) and exp(-2*alpha²). Phi is -pi/4, so 2*phi is -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2*phi) = -1. Then exp(-2*(0.5)^2) is exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So sin(2*phi)*exp(-2*alpha²) is (-1)*0.6065 ≈ -0.6065.

So N squared is 1 + (-0.6065) = 0.3935, so N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

Now, the state |psi> is (cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5>)/N. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, same as sin(pi/4), but wait, no, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So the state is (0.7071|0.5> - 0.7071| -0.5>)/0.6275.

Wait, maybe I should write the state as [ |alpha> - | -alpha> ] / sqrt(2) when phi is -pi/4? Because cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes [ |alpha> - | -alpha> ] / N * sqrt(2)/sqrt(2) ? Hmm, maybe not, I think I need to proceed more carefully.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So with phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7
