Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty on my aromatic compounds, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm. So, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's check each option's molecular formula. Each compound is a substituted benzene with four methyl groups, right? Or wait, for the diethylbenzene, the substituents would be two ethyl groups, so that's different.

Wait, for the options:
Option C has 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene. Wait, the diethyl would mean two ethyl groups on benzene. Let's check the molecular formula. Benzene has 6 C, each ethyl is 2 C, so 6 + 4 (two ethyls) = 10? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1,4-diethylbenzene: benzene (6 C) plus two ethyl groups (each CH2CH3, so 2*2=4 C), total 6+4 = 10 C. So that's correct. So the diethylbenzene has molecular formula C8H10? Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would be 2*(2 C) = 4 C and 2*(5 H) =10 H. So benzene (6 C, 6 H) plus two ethyls (4 C, 10 H): total 10 C and 16 H. Wait, but the problem states the molecular formula is C10H14. So something's wrong here. Wait, no, wait. Let me calculate again. Benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyls would add 4 C and 10 H
