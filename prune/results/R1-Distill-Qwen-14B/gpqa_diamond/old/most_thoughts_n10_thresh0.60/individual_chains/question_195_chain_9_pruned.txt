Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the setup is that there are two planets in the same star system. The first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius and orbits a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days, and it transits with an impact parameter of 0.2. The second planet has a radius 2.5 times Earth's. The question is asking for the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm. I remember that transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods and the size of the orbits. Oh wait, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet moves behind the star, so we lose its light. Both events require that the planet's orbit is aligned such that we can observe these events.

Wait, but why would the second planet have a longer period? I think I need to relate the orbital periods and sizes.

I remember Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius. Kepler's law in this context is (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G(M + m)), but since the planets' mass is negligible compared to the star, it's roughly P² proportional to a³/(M_star), where M_star is the mass of the host star.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact form. Oh right, the formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, but when using astronomical units and solar masses, it's often expressed as P² = a³ / (M_star), but wait no, when using the correct units, with P in years, a in AU, and M in solar masses, it's a bit different. Alternatively, I think the version is P² = (a³) / (M_star), but I might be mixing up some constants here.

Wait another approach: For the same star, the ratio of the periods depends on the cube of the ratio of their semi-major axes. So if planet A has period P1 and semi-major axis a1, and planet B has period P2 and semi-major axis a2, then (P2
