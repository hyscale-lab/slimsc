Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break it down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. That's a mouthful. Let me draw the structure in my head. So, it looks like there's a cyclohexane ring, and at the 1-position (which is the same as the position where the substituent is attached), there's a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl group, and a carbonyl group (since it's an aldehyde). Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the main chain is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, meaning the aldehyde is attached to the cyclohexane ring. Then at the same carbon where the aldehyde is, there's a cyclohexyl and a hydroxymethyl group attached.

Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think again. The formula is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the cyclohexanecarbaldehyde part would be a cyclohexane ring with a CH2CHO group attached. But wait, no, the aldehyde is directly on the cyclohexane? No, wait, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde would be a cyclohexane with a
