Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. I remember that when a dicarboxylic acid loses water, it forms an anhydride. The structure probably has two carboxylic acid groups connected by a chain, maybe with a double bondâ€”since it's a cis-alkene. Dehydration would typically form an anhydride, which is a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups connected by an oxygen.

The anhydride's NMR data is given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. Wait, 7 ppm is usually where aromatic protons or maybe some sort of conjugated system protons appear. But since it's a single peak, maybe it's a triplet or some symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinylic proton, but cis-... Oh wait, the starting material had a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates, the alkene becomes part of the anhydride structure. So the anhydride would have a bridge, perhaps. 

Wait, the 1H NMR has only one peak. That suggests all equivalent protons in the molecule. So maybe the anhydride has some symmetry. An example is maleic anhydride, which has two double bonds. But wait, in the case of the problem, the starting material is a cis-alkene. So maybe the anhydride is such that the two carbonyl groups are attached to a bridge with a double bond. Let me think: if the original structure is a cis-diacid, dehydration would form an anhydride where the two carbonyls are connected by a bridge with a double bond. So maybe the structure is something like a bicyclic anhydride with a double bond, making the protons on that double bond equivalent. Oh wait, but in that case, the protons would be trans or cis. If it's a bridge, the structure might have symmetry, making all the non-carbonyl protons equivalent, leading to a singlet.

Wait, the 13C NMR of
