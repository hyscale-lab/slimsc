Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and we need to find the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. Hmm. The astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a different relative speed and total energy.

First, I remember that when dealing with relative speeds in relativity, you can't just subtract them like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. Because at speeds approaching the speed of light, the classical approach doesn't hold.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv)/c²). But wait, which direction? Since both are moving in the positive x-direction, from the perspective of one astronaut, the other is moving at (u - v) in classical terms. But relativity changes that.

So, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. Let's say we want the speed of B as seen from A's frame. So u would be 0.5c (the speed of B in the lab frame), and v is 0.6c (the speed of A). Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. No, I think I got that backwards. Because when you're in A's frame, and want to find the speed of B, which is moving slower than A in the same direction. So u is the speed of B in the lab frame, v is the speed of A. Wait, no, no, the formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, no, the formula is for when you have two frames, S and S', where S' is moving at speed v relative to S. So if an object has speed u in S, its speed u' in S' is given by (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So in this case
