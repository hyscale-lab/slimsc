Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions between different compounds labeled A, B, C, D, etc. The key here is probably to figure out what each of these substances are. Once I know what E is, I can determine its molecular symmetry group.

Let me break down the information given.

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, I know that when metals react with certain gases, they can form compounds. The bright red product makes me think of something like copper(II) oxide, which is black, but wait, that's not red. Alternatively, maybe lead(IV) oxide is red, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something like a transition metal oxide that's red. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's a reaction involving sulfur? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, 8 equivalents suggests a molar ratio of 1:8. So A + 8 B → C. That's a high ratio. For a metal reacting with a diatomic gas like O₂ or Cl₂, the ratio could be significant. For instance, sulfur (S) reacting with oxygen might form SO₃, but that's a solid. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction like copper reacting with chlorine gas. Wait, but copper reacts with Cl₂ in a 1:1 ratio when it's hot, forming CuCl. But that's not 8 equivalents. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where a metal reacts with multiple molecules of a gas to form an oxide.

Wait, another angle: maybe the product C is a complex ion or a coordination compound. But the bright red color is a big clue. Let me think about red solids. I recall that lead dioxide, PbO₂, is dark brown, not red. Hmm. Wait, maybe it's a sulfide? No, sulfides are usually black or another color. Oh, perhaps it's a nitride? Or maybe it's something like Fe3O4, which is black. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but chromium(VI) compounds are usually orange or yellow. Alternatively, maybe it's a manganese compound. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfur-containing compound. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is between a metal and chlorine gas.

Wait, let's think about
