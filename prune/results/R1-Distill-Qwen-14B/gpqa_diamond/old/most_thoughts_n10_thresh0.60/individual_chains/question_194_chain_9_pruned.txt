Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. Hmm, I need to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because each state contributes exp(-βE) to Z. So β is 1/(kT), but for the purposes of calculation, I just treat it as a variable.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to consider all these states and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-βE) for each state.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to do this without enumerating all 8 states. Let's think about it. The energy expression can be broken down into terms involving pairs: S1S2, S1S3, S2S3. Each term is either +1 or -1, because each spin is ±1.

Wait, wait. Let me think: S_i * S_j for i≠j. If S_i = S_j, then their product is +1. If opposite, it's -1. So each of the three terms in E is either +1 or -1. So each term contributes either +1 or -1.

Wait no, wait. Let me compute each term. For each pair, like S1S2, it's either +1 or -1. So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 is the sum of three terms, each either +1 or -1. So the sum can vary from 3 (if all three terms are +1) down to -3 (if all terms are -1), but wait, no. Let me think: the maximum sum is 3*1=3, the minimum is 3*(-1)=-3. But wait, no, because each of the three terms is each either +1 or -1. So their sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3... Wait, let's think: each term adds either +1 or -1. So the sum can be 3 (if all three are +1), 1 (if two +1, one -1), -1 (if two
