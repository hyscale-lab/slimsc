Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the eGFP isn't showing up when they look under the confocal microscope. Let's go through the setup step by step.

So the question is about a bicistronic vector they created. Bicistronic means it has two genes in one construct. The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Both have stop cassettes with loxP sites. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES element.

Wait, I remember that IRES elements allow for internal ribosome entry sites, which can lead to the translation of the second gene without needing a separate promoter. So in this case, the CBA promoter drives the ligand, and the IRES probably drives the receptor's expression. But wait, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after an IRES. That might mean that the receptor is being expressed under a different promoter, but I'm not sure.

They transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. They saw a signal proportional to actin on the Western blot, so the proteins are being expressed and detected. So the construct is working in culture.

But when they breed the mice and cross them with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see green. The SOX10-Cre is likely used to conditionally express the Cre recombinase, which would delete the stop cassettes so that the eGFP and mCherry can be expressed.

Wait, the vector has two stop cassettes. The ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP cassette between the ligand ORF and mCherry. The receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between the receptor and eGFP. Oh, and Cre is used to excise these stops. But wait, regular Cre (loxP) and lox2272 are different. lox2272 is a variant that is only cut by Cre, but the recognition sites are different. Or wait, no, they usually use loxP and lox2272 for different purposes because they are recognized by
