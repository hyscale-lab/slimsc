Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out what the unknown compound is. Let's see what the question says. So, the person has an unknown compound and used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to identify it. The options are four different formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O. I need to pick the right one based on the spectra data.

Hmm, let's start with the FTIR. The broad peak at 3000 cm-1 probably indicates an -OH group because O-H stretches are usually in that region and they are broad. So that suggests the compound has an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid, or something with an -OH. Then there are strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those are in the region where carbonyl groups (like C=O) appear. 1700 is typical for a ketone or maybe an ester, while 1650 might be a conjugated carbonyl, maybe an acid? Wait, but a carboxylic acid usually has a broad O-H peak and a strong C=O around 1700. But if it's an ester, maybe the C=O is a bit lower? Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone with something else attached.

Wait, but wait. The NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means double bond, so we have a structure with a double bond. So maybe an ester with a double bond nearby? Or maybe a ketone with a double bond. Let me think.

The mass spectrum has a fragment at m/z=45. What's that? Common fragments... 45 is a common mass for a ketene group or maybe a (CH3)2CO fragment, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps it's (CH3)2O, which is 45. Or maybe CH2O plus something? Hmm, another possibility is that 45 is the mass of a methyl group attached to an oxygen, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a tropylium ion or something else.

Let me break down each part.

First, the IR: broad peak at 3000 cm-1 suggests an -OH group. Then, the peaks at 17
