Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says that there's an electron described by the state |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. So, first, I think I need to normalize this state because it's given as proportional, meaning we have to find the normalization constant.

Wait, the matrix representation is given for another operator. A_ij is hbar/2 if i is not equal to j, and zero otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix, scaled perhaps. Because the Pauli X has 0 on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal, but here the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So that operator must be sigma_x multiplied by hbar/2.

So the operator in question is (hbar/2) times sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the X operator, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>. So to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of this new operator.

But wait, maybe I should first compute the probabilities in the original basis (z-basis) and then switch to the x-basis.

Wait, no, the question says calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator whose matrix is A_ij. So the operator's eigenstates are the ones we need to project onto.

So first, perhaps I should find the eigenstates of the operator A. Since A is (hbar/2) times sigma_x, its eigenstates are the same as sigma_x's, which are the eigenstates of spin in the x-direction. Let me recall that the eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, multiplied by hbar/2.

Wait, actually, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues Â±1, so the operator A would have eigenvalues (hbar/2)(1) and (hbar/2)(-1), right? So the eigenstates are |+x> and
