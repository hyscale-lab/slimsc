Okay, I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me see what the question says.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data given is:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each of these signals represents.

First, let's consider the possible structures. Acetates have an ester group, so the structure would be something like R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, no. Wait, acetate esters are R-O-CO-O-R', but wait, I think I might be mixing up the structure. Acetate esters are R-O-CO-O-R'? Wait, no. Wait, acetate is the acetate ion, so the ester would be like R-O-CO-O-R. Or wait, no, the ester structure is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are different. So, for example, ethyl acetate is CH3CO-OCH2CH3.

In this case, the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. So the acetate part is the ester group, and the R group is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So, the structures would be something like CH2=CHCH2O-CO-O-R? Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally.

Wait, no. Wait, acetate esters have the structure R-O-CO-O-R'. Wait, no, acetate is an ester where the acyl part is acetyl (CH3CO-). So the structure is R-O-CO-O-R', where one R is the acetyl part? No, wait. No, acetate is OAc, so when it's an ester, it's R-O-CO-O-R', but in this case, it's more likely that the ester is the acetyl group linked via the oxygen to an alkyl group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Acetate esters are typically like CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

So, the compound is an acetate ester, so the structure is CH3CO-O-R, where R is either propenyl or butenyl, and in either cis or trans configuration.

So, let's think about the possible structures for each option.

Option C is Cis-propenyl acetate. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but wait, propenyl has three carbons and a double bond. Wait, I think propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-O-? Wait, but the position of the double bond depends on where the substituents are.

Wait, wait. Let's clarify: propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- but as an est
