Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states: We have a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, F = -kx. We need to find the maximum speed, v_max. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, first, I should recall what a harmonic oscillator is. In classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. The force is F = -kx, which gives simple harmonic motion. The maximum speed occurs when the oscillator passes through the equilibrium position (x=0), right?

But wait, this is a relativistic harmonic oscillator. So I guess I can't use the classical formulas directly because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant. Oh right, in relativity, the mass increases with velocity because of the Lorentz factor gamma. So kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

Wait, the potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx². So at maximum displacement (x = A), all the energy is potential. As it moves towards equilibrium, potential energy converts into kinetic. But in relativistic cases, the total energy includes rest mass energy, kinetic energy, etc.

Let me think about the energy conservation. The total energy E is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in relativistic terms, the total energy is gamma*m*c², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)*m*c². But maybe a better approach is to consider the conservation of mechanical energy, but including relativistic effects.

Wait, in the classical case, the total energy (non-relativistic) is (1/2)kA². But when considering relativity, the energy expressions change. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, for a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is different. The kinetic energy in relativity is (gamma - 1)mc². So the total energy would be (gamma - 1)mc² + (1/2)kx². But wait, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement A, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy at that point is just
