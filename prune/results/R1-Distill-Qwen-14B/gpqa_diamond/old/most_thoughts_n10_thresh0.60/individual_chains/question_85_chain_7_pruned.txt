Okay, so I've got this problem here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question gives me a lot of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Both planets are detected using transit and radial velocity methods, so that's about their discovery methods, but I'm not sure if that's relevant for calculating their temperatures.

Planet1 has a mass of 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which is good because that means I don't have to factor in different reflectivity. Oh, and their orbits are circular, which probably simplifies the calculations.

The problem mentions the Doppler shifts they induce on the [OI] forbidden line at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, while Planet2 causes 0.04 Å. Wait, how does that relate to their orbital velocities or distances from the star?

I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement caused by the planet's gravity. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by some equation... I think it's K = ( (G * (M_p) * sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + (M_p/M_*)) )^(1/3) ) * (1/ (P)^(1/3)) ) ... Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_*^{2/3} (1 + M_p/M_*)^{-1/3}) ) ), but since M_p is much smaller than M_*, it approximates to K ≈ (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

But wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the velocity shift. The Doppler shift is related to the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, but wait, wait—no, actually, the Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, but in this case, the units are in Ångströms. Alternatively, there's another approach.

Wait, the problem says that the forbidden line is at 6300 Å, and the shifts are 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å for Planets 1 and 2, respectively. So the Doppler shift is delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda.

Wait, no, the Doppler shift formula is:

delta_lambda / lambda = v / c

But wait, another version is delta_lambda = (lambda) * (v/c). So the shift is in the same unit as lambda. So to find the velocity of the star, I can compute v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

But wait, the problem gives delta_lambda as 0.03 and 0.04 Å. Oh, the original line is at 6300 Å, so for Planet1: delta_lambda is 0.03. So v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2, v2 = (0.04/6300) * c.

But wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude K (the velocity of the star) is the same as these velocities, so K1 = 0.03/6300 * c, and K2 = 0.04/6300 * c. Wait, but maybe I should compute the velocities to find the orbital periods or distances.

Alternatively, since the problem says both planets are in circular orbits, and we need their equilibrium temperatures. The equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( R_star / (2 a) )^(1/2) * ( (1 - albedo) / (1 + e) )^(1/2) ), but since e=0 for circular orbits, it's T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) )

But since the albedo is the same for both planets, (1 - albedo) is a constant, so it cancels out when taking the ratio. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1)) / (R_star/(2 a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2a
