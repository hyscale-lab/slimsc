Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Let me try to think through this step by step. Hmm, the question says that stars are uniformly distributed in the sky, and we need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. The options are various inverse powers of plx.

First, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/distance, which means that a higher parallax means a closer star. So, plx is like 1/d.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit of parallax. So, if I imagine a range of parallax values, say from plx to plx + dplx, how many stars are there in that range?

Since the stars are uniformly distributed, that probably means that their distances are uniformly distributed in space. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says they're uniformly distributed in the sky. I'm a bit confused. Uniformly distributed in the skyâ€”so does that mean uniformly in terms of solid angle? Because the sky is a sphere, solid angle is measured in steradians.

Wait, but parallax is about distance. So, if the stars are uniformly distributed in space, their number per volume would be constant. But I think the question isn't about volume but about the distribution on the celestial sphere, so maybe it's about how many stars you observe at a certain distance.

Wait, another thought: the number of stars per unit volume in space is
