Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. 

The question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The options are various lengths, so the answer is about the minimum distance or something related to the decay path.

Wait, I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. Oh right, the formula for that is τ = γτ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So first, I need to calculate γ. The Lorentz factor is γ = E/mc², right? Or wait, since we're dealing with particles where E is much larger than mc², maybe E ≈ pc for high energies. Hmm, but let's see. The energy E is given as 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. So E is more than 7 times the mass. That's a high-energy situation but not necessarily ultrarelativistic. Wait, in any case, for the Lorentz factor, γ = E/(m c²) because E includes rest mass energy. So E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since E and m are given in GeV, and c is in m/s, but maybe I can compute it without getting into units because the mass and energy are in same units.

Wait, let me think again. The units for E and m are both in GeV, but to compute γ, which is dimensionless, I need to make sure the units are consistent. The actual formula is γ = (E²) / ( (pc)² + (m c²)² ). So if I have E = 27 GeV, and m =3.41 GeV, but I'm not sure about p, the momentum. Alternatively, for a particle moving at relativistic speeds, E ≈ pc, so p ≈ E/c. Hmm, but perhaps a better approach is to
