Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some immunology processes. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus were given to mice via oral gavage. Then, some of the fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got stuck in the intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They ended up finding fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. The question is asking which process is happening.

Hmm, so first, let's think about what each part means. Rotavirus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. The inner capsid proteins are probably part of the viral structure, maybe the core. They tagged them with GFP, which is a fluorescent marker, so they can track where these proteins go in the mouse.

When they delivered them via oral gavage, that means they were given to the mice through the stomach. So the first thing that might happen is the stomach acid. Stomach acid is harsh, so some of the GFP fluorescence was destroyed. That makes sense because stomach acid can break down proteins, so maybe some of the tagged proteins didn't survive, which explains why some fluorescence was lost.

The rest of the proteins had to navigate through the intestinal mucus. Intestinal mucus is sticky, so some got entangled there. But eventually, they reached the secondary lymphoid organs. Secondary lymphoid organs include things like Peyer patches, which are located in the intestinal wall. Peyer patches are sites where immune cells, like lymphocytes, can sample antigens from the gut.

In the Peyer patches, they isolated the proliferating cell population. These cells are likely B cells because when an antigen is present, B cells get activated and start proliferating. Then, they looked at the variable heavy chain genes of these cells and saw high variability. High variability in the variable regions suggests that some diversification process is happening.

Now, the options given are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

Let's think about each process.

Option A: Somatic hypermutation occurs during the immune response, especially in B cells, to increase the diversity of the antibody variable regions. This happens after the initial recognition of an antigen, leading to more specific and stronger immune responses. It's a process that occurs in mature B cells once they're activated.

Option B: Complement activation is part of the immune system's response, especially the innate immune system. It's involved in targeting pathogens for destruction and enhancing phagocytosis. It doesn't directly cause variability in the variable heavy chains.

Option C: Class switching recombination is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), but this doesn't affect the variability of the variable regions themselves. So it's more about the type of antibody produced rather than the diversity.

Option D: VDJ recombination is a process that happens during the development of B and T cells in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. It's how the variable regions of antibodies and T cell receptors are created, providing the initial diversity by shuffling different gene segments. But this occurs during the maturation of the cells, not after they've encountered an antigen.

In this scenario, the cells are already in the Peyer patches and have started proliferating after the GFP-tagged proteins (antigens) were introduced. So the process that would create variability in the variable heavy chains after the initial exposure would be somatic hypermutation. Because when B cells are activated by an antigen, they undergo this process to diversify their antibodies, allowing for a more tailored immune response. 

VDJ is more about the initial setup of the variable regions, not the subsequent diversification. Class switching doesn't affect the variable regions' variability. Complement activation isn't about generating variability in the genes.

So putting it all together, the high variability in the variable heavy chains after antigen exposure suggests that somatic hypermutation is taking place. That's because the B cells are diversifying their antibodies to better recognize and respond to the specific antigen they've encountered.


The question involves tracking GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus in mice and observing the fate of these proteins in the immune system. After oral gavage, some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some proteins were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs like Peyer patches. In these patches, proliferating cells were isolated, and sequencing their variable heavy chain genes revealed high variability. This suggests a process that diversifies the variable regions of antibodies.

- **Option A: Somatic hypermutation** is a process that occurs in activated B cells after antigen exposure, leading to increased diversity in the variable regions of antibodies. This matches the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Option B: Complement activation** is part of the innate immune response and does not involve diversification of the variable heavy chain regions.
- **Option C: Class switching recombination** changes the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not affect the variability of the variable regions themselves.
- **Option D: VDJ recombination** generates initial diversity during B cell development but occurs before antigen exposure, not in response to it.

Given that the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes occurred after antigen exposure, the most likely process is **somatic hypermutation**, which diversifies antibodies in response to specific antigens.

Answer: A
