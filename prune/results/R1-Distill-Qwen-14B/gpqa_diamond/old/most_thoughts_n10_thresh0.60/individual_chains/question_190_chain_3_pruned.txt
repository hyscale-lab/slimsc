Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see, the question is asking me to arrange the given nucleophiles from the most reactive to the least reactive.

The nucleophiles given are:
1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide (OH⁻)
3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻)
4. Methanol (CH3OH)
5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻ or maybe CH2CH2S⁻? Wait, no, ethanethiolate would be CH3CH2S⁻, right?)

Hmm. So I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on the solvent because in a polar protic solvent, the more polarizable and less solvated the nucleophile is, the more reactive it will be. Since the question says aqueous solution, that's definitely a polar protic solvent, so I should think about that.

In polar protic solvents, the order of nucleophilicity is generally: weaker bases are better nucleophiles because they're less solvated. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, in polar protic, the solvent can stabilize the charge of the nucleophile, but the more polarizable the nucleophile, the better it can attack.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me think again. In a polar protic solvent, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the basicity because stronger bases are more solvated
