Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves several reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone group.

The first step is treating cyclohexanone with bromine, which forms product 1. I think bromine adds to the double bond in alkenes, but wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another possibility is that the ketone undergoes some kind of bromination. Hmm, another thought: maybe it's a cyclohexanone ring undergoing some kind of addition. Wait, no, cyclohexanone is a saturated ring with a ketone. Oh wait, bromine could be adding in an enol formation. Or perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction? No, that requires a diene and a dienophile. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: cyclohexanone can undergo nucleophilic attack. Oh, but bromine (Br2) is a dienophile sometimes. Oh wait, maybe it's an epoxidation. No, that's with peracids. Maybe it's a bromohydrin formation? No, that's when you have a double bond and add Br and OH. Wait, cyclohexanone has
