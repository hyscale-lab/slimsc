Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We have a system with a Hamiltonian operator H equal to ε times the dot product of σ and n. Here, n is an arbitrary unit vector, ε is an energy constant, and σ has components which are the Pauli spin matrices. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

Hmm, the Pauli matrices. I remember that the Pauli matrices are a set of three 2x2 matrices, usually denoted as σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of them has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but wait, that's when they're acting on their own. But when they are combined in a dot product with some vector, like n, the situation might be different.

Wait, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So this is like a vector of Pauli matrices dotted with a unit vector n. So σ · n would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. Each of these Pauli matrices is multiplied by the corresponding component of n, which is a unit vector, so n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1.

I think that the eigenvalues of such a Hamiltonian can be found by looking at the properties of the Pauli matrices. Since σ · n is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices, maybe I can find its eigenvalues by knowing something about its trace and determinant, or perhaps by recalling a property of spin operators.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, right? Because their eigenvalues are real. So σ · n is also Hermitian because it's a linear combination with real coefficients (since n is a real vector). So the Hamiltonian H is Hermitian, which makes sense because it's an observable.

Now, the eigenvalues of a 2x2 Hermitian matrix can be found using the characteristic equation. Alternatively, maybe there's a shortcut here. I remember that for a spin in a magnetic field in the direction of n, the energy eigenvalues are ± (ħ/2) times the magnetic field strength, but wait, in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as ε times the dot product of σ and n. So perhaps I need to figure out what the eigenvalues are for this expression.

Let me think about the trace. The trace of H would be ε times the trace of σ · n. The trace of each Pauli matrix is zero because, for example, σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so the trace is 0. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. So the trace of σ · n is zero, which means the trace of H is ε * 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues of H is zero. That suggests the eigenvalues are symmetric around zero.

What about the determinant of H? The determinant of σ · n: since σ · n is a 2x2 matrix, its determinant is the product of its eigenvalues. But wait, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but σ · n is a combination of them. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (σ · n)^2.

Let me compute (σ · n)^2. That would be (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is the identity matrix times 1, because each Pauli matrix squares to I. So σ_i^2 = I. So when you expand (σ · n)^2, you get n_x² σ_x² + n_y^2 σ_y² + n_z^2 σ_z² + cross terms. The cross terms involve σ_i σ_j for i ≠ j.

Wait, the cross terms are 2n_i n_j σ_i σ_j. Because when you expand (a + b + c)^2, you get a² + b² + c² + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc.

So each σ_i σ_j for i≠j is equal to i ε_ijk σ_k, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. But wait, the square of σ · n is then:

n_x² I + n_y² I + n_z² I + 2(n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z )

But σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, σ_x σ_z = -i σ_y, σ_y σ_z = i σ_x. So substituting these in:

= (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I + 2i [n_x n_y σ_z + n_x n_z (-i σ_y) + n_y n_z (i σ_x) ]

Wait, let me compute the cross terms: each term is 2n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

So σ_x σ_y = i σ_z,
σ_x σ_z = -i σ_y,
σ_y σ_z = i σ_x.

So:

2n_x n_y (i σ_z) + 2n_x n_z (-i σ_y) + 2n_y n_z (i σ_x )

Factor out the 2i:

= 2i [ n_x n_y σ_z - n_x n_z σ_y + n_y n_z σ_x ]

Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps another approach. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1. So the terms without the cross terms are I.

Wait, I think there's a more straightforward way. I remember that for any unit vector n, (σ · n)^2 = I, because when you expand it, you get σ_x² n_x² + σ_y² n_y² + σ_z² n_z² + cross terms. But each σ_i² is I, so that part is (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I = I. The cross terms, when you sum them, would involve terms like σ_i σ_j, but when you have (σ · n)^2, it's actually equal to I + something. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's see:

Wait, let me think again. Let me compute (σ · n)^2.

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z )

Multiply each term:

= n_x² σ_x² + n_y² σ_y² + n_z² σ_z² + n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + n_y n_z σ_y σ_z + n_y n_x σ_y σ_x + n_z n_x σ_z σ_x + n_z n_y σ_z σ_y.

Wait, that's 9 terms. The diagonal terms are n_x² σ_x², etc., which are each n_i^2 I.

The off-diagonal terms: for example, n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x ) = n_x n_y (2 δ_{xy} I )? Wait, no, because σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, and σ_y σ_x = -i σ_z. So σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x = 0. Similarly for the other off-diagonal terms.

So all the cross terms, when summed, are zero. Therefore, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I = I.

Because n is a unit vector, the sum of squares is 1, so (σ · n)^2 = I.

So that tells us that (σ · n)^2 = I. So the eigenvalues of σ · n must satisfy λ^2 = 1, since when you square the matrix, its eigenvalues are the squares of the original's eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues of σ · n are λ = ±1.

Wait, but wait. What's the trace of σ · n? Each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so σ · n has trace zero. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues must be +1 and -1. Because they are the roots of λ^2 - Tr(M) λ + Det(M) = 0, which in this case would be λ^2 -0 λ +1 =0 → λ=±1.

So the eigenvalues of σ · n are +1 and -1. Then, the Hamiltonian H is ε times that. So H = ε (σ · n) → the eigenvalues of H are ε*(+1) and ε*(-1), so ±ε.

So looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think about the units. The Hamiltonian has units of energy. ε is given as an energy constant. And the Pauli matrices are dimensionless. So yes, the eigenvalues would be ±ε. So option B.

So the conclusion is that the eigenvalues are plus and minus epsilon.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. To determine the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the properties of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices: \( \sigma_x n_x + \sigma_y n_y + \sigma_z n_z \). Each Pauli matrix (\( \sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z \)) has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \), and their linear combination \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is Hermitian because \( \vec{n} \) is a real unit vector. The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) can be determined by noting that \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = \vec{n} \cdot \vec{n} I = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This implies that the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \).

Since the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is proportional to \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \). This conclusion is consistent with the fact that \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant and the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \).

Among the given options, the correct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \), which corresponds to option **B**.
