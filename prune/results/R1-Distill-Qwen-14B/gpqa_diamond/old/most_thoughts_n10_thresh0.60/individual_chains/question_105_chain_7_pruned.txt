Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read through it again and understand what's being asked.

So, the scenario is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K. The star is observed over time, and because of the spots, the brightness changes as it rotates, which can mimic the presence of an exoplanet.

The question is asking, if the star didn't have those spots, what would be the radius of an exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation (amplitude) in the light curve? So, we're comparing the signal caused by the spots to what a planet would produce.

Hmm. I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for that is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, in this case, the star has spots. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us, the star appears a bit dimmer than when the unspotted areas are facing us. The brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view.

So, the way this works is that the spots cause the star's brightness to vary as the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. Since the star's brightness is modulated by the spots, the overall change in brightness would be a function of the area of the spots and the temperature difference.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the star's brightness variation due to the spots is being compared to the variation caused by a planet. So, we have two scenarios: one where the spots cause a certain change in brightness, and another where a planet transiting would cause a similar change. We're to find the planet radius that would match the amplitude of the spot-induced variation.

So, first, I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness caused by the spots. Then, compare that to the fractional change caused by a planet transit, which is (Rp/Rstar)^2. Then, solve for Rp.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the change in brightness due to the spots.
2. Set that equal to the change caused by a planet transit.
3. Solve for Rp.

Okay, but how exactly do the spots affect the brightness?

The star's total luminosity is the sum of the luminosity from the spotted regions and the unspotted regions. When the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible changes, which affects the observed brightness.

Wait, but the problem says that the spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. So, the total area covered by spots on the star is 20% of half the star's surface.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR². Each hemisphere is 2πR². So, 20% of one hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

Wait, no,
