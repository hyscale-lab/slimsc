Okay, so I've got this question here about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but let me think this through. The question says the dye has extensively conjugated pi-electrons, and it emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I need to figure out what color it absorbs.

Wait, I remember that when a substance emits light, it's after it has absorbed some energy, right? Oh right, the complementary color theory. So the color emitted is the one that's not absorbed. Or wait, no, wait. No, the color of the light absorbed is what determines which color is emitted. Because when something absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects or emits others.

So, the energy of the emitted light is given as 2.3393 eV. But wait, how does that relate to the absorbed energy? Oh, right, in photochemistry, the energy absorbed is higher than the energy emitted. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon. But the emitted photon has lower energy than the absorbed one because some energy is lost as heat or other processes.

Wait, but the question is about which color is absorbed, not emitted. So the absorbed light's energy relates to the transition of electrons. Because the dye has conjugated pi-electrons, that probably means it's a conjugated system, like in dyes or pigments where electrons can delocalize over several atoms, leading to lower energy gaps. So the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied (LUMO) is smaller for larger conjugated systems.

The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Hmm, but wait, what determines the color absorbed? The energy corresponds to the wavelength absorbed, right? The energy E is related to wavelength 位 by E = hc/位, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

So, first, I should convert the energy from eV to wavelength to find the color. Let me jot down the equation: 位 = hc/E.

The constants: Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J路s, speed of light c is 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. But wait, the energy E is in electron volts. Oh right, 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-19 jou
