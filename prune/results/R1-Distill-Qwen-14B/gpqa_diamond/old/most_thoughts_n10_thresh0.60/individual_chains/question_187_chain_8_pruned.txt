Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars would be detectable. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. The question is about the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The requirement is S/N of at least 10.

Let me think about the factors that affect the S/N. I think it's mainly the brightness of the star because a brighter star (lower magnitude) would provide a higher S/N. Also, the distance of the star matters because farther stars are dimmer. Oh right, the magnitude scale is a bit tricky. Lower magnitudes mean brighter objects.

The formula I remember for calculating the flux from a star is something involving the distance modulus. The formula is: m = M + 5 log₁₀(d/10), where m is apparent magnitude, M is absolute magnitude, and d is distance in parsecs. So, I can calculate the apparent magnitude for each star and see which ones are bright enough.

ESPRESSO's performance depends on the S/N. Wait, I think the V band is the one they're using, which corresponds to the magnitude scale. So each option's apparent magnitude will determine whether the S/N is achieved.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option a) Canopus. I remember that Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky. Its apparent magnitude is around -0.7, which is very bright. So this should be easily detectable.

Option b) Polaris. Polaris is the North Star, and I think its apparent magnitude is about 1.97. That's still quite bright, so S/N should be high enough.

Option c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, absolute V mag 15, distance 10 pc. Let's compute its apparent magnitude. Using m = M + 5 log(d/10). M is 15, d is 10. So log(10/10)=log(1)=0. So m =15 +0=15. But wait, that's 15 mag. Wait, the Sun is about V mag 4.8, so 15 is way dimmer. Would that be detectable? I'm not sure. I think stars with higher magnitudes (like 15) are much fainter, but perhaps ESPRESSO can detect them in an hour?

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact numbers. I think that for ground-based telescopes, even a V magnitude of 20 is about the limit for some instruments. But this is a spectrograph with high efficiency, perhaps. Let me think about the SNR formula.

The signal (S) is proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the flux. The noise (N) generally scales with the square root of the exposure time as well, but for S/N, the ratio depends on the flux and the instrument's efficiency.

Wait, I might need to recall the relation between magnitude, flux, and S/N. The flux F from a star is proportional to 10^(-0.4*(m - m_zero)), where m_zero is some reference
