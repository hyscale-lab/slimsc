Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it. The problem involves spin states and operators, so I remember some linear algebra and quantum concepts.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Hmm, I think I should normalize this state first because probabilities are involved.

Wait, what's the normalization factor? I remember that the state vector needs to have a norm of 1. So the inner product of |alpha> with itself should be 1. Let me calculate that.

The state is (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The inner product would be the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the coefficients. So for |up>, the coefficient is (1+i), its magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2. For |down>, the coefficient is (2 - i). The magnitude squared is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 =4 +1=5. So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is sqrt(7), right? So |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ] / sqrt(7). Got it.

Next part: the operator whose matrix representation is Aij. The operator is defined such that Aij = hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. So this is a 2x2 matrix because it's spin-1/2, with states up and down.

Wait, the matrix would be:
[ 0   hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0 ]

Because off-diagonal elements are hbar/2, and diagonals are zero. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices are [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively. So if I'm to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of A, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, since the
