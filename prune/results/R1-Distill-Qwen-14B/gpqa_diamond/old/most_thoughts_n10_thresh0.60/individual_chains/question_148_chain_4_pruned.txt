Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question and think about what each part means.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds, and we're given information about substances A1 to A5. The goal is to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Let me break down the information given:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe formula? Wait, probably the oxidation state, like the valence of F in A2 is 31.96%. Hmm, wait, 31.96% seems more like a percentage composition. Oh, wait, oF probably stands for the mass percent of oxygen or something else? Wait, no—wait, OxF maybe? Oh, maybe it's the oxidation state, but 31.96% sounds like a mass percentage. Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%". Oh, maybe that's the atomic percent of fluorine in A2. Or perhaps the molar percent. Hmm, not entirely clear, but perhaps the mole percent of F in A2 is 31.96%. Alternatively, maybe it's the mass percentage. Wait, but let's think about possible compounds.

A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So,
