Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state via two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Dipole transitions specifically are the most common type, so I should focus on those selection rules.

Hmm, selection rules for dipole transitions... I think the main ones are for the quantum numbers n, l, and m. Let me recall: for electric dipole transitions, the selection rules are Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1. And the radial selection rule is Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but that's not as strict as the angular momentum ones. Wait, but wait, no, the n can change by any integer, but the l and m have specific constraints.

Wait, so for a dipole transition, the change in l (Δl) must be ±1. So from an s orbital (l=0), you can only go to p (l=1), and from p to s or d. Similarly, for the m quantum number, it can change by 0, +1, or -1. So from m=0, it can go to m=0, +1, or -1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>, which is an s orbital (since l=0), and it decays to |1,0,0>, another s orbital. Oh wait, but wait, to get from l=0 to another l=0, that would require Δl=0, which isn't allowed for a dipole transition. Because dipole transitions require Δl=±1. So that can't happen in a single step. Therefore, it must go through an intermediate state where l changes by ±1.

So, the process must involve two transitions. First from |3,0,0> to some |n', l', m'> state, and then from there to |1,0,0>.

Let me think about possible steps. The initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. The first transition must go to a state where l'=1 because Δl=±1, and from l=0, only l=1 is possible (since l can't be negative). So the first transition will be to a p orbital (l=1) with possible m values of -1, 0, +1.

After that, the second transition must bring us to |1,0,0>, which has l=0. So the second transition must have Δl= -1 (since from l=1 to l=0). So the second transition must come from a state with l=1 and go to l=0. Also, the m quantum number can change by 0, ±1 in each transition.

So let's outline the possible paths.

First, from |3,0,0> (n=3, l=0, m=0), the first transition can go to states |n', 1, m'> where m' can be -1, 0, +1, and n' must be either 2 or 4 because the energy levels of hydrogen depend on n, and for n=3, the next possible n for a dipole transition is n=2 or n=4? Wait, but the energy levels are E_n proportional to -1/n². So for a transition from n=3 to n=2, the energy change would be E_3 - E_2 = (-1/9 + 1/4) * something. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, but the problem says it's a two-step decay. So the first step could be 3 → 2, then 2 →1, because 3→1 isn't allowed in a single dipole transition (since Δl would have to change by 0, which isn't allowed). Alternatively, could the first step go to n=4? Wait, but from n=3, you can go to n=4 since Δn can be any integer except 0. But wait, in reality, the dipole selection rule for n is Δn = ±1, but I think that's not exactly correct. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, for the dipole transitions, the selection rule is usually Δn ≠ 0, but that's for the radial part. The l selection is more restrictive. So when you have a dipole transition, the l must change by ±1, and n can change by any integer, but in practice, the electric dipole transitions are only possible when Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but I think that's more a matter of the transition's dipole moment being non-zero
