Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in various compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, like a chiral center or some kind of asymmetry that makes it non-superimposable on its mirror image. Let me go through each compound one by one.

First compound: (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. Wait, but-1-ene is a double bond at position 1, and chloro at position 1. Structure would be Cl-C=C-CH2-CH3. Wait, but wait, in but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (CH(CH3)). So the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait no, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. The second carbon has a methyl group. So structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Let me think again. But-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2.
