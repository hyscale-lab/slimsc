Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the uncertainty in P_z given the state of the system. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

Alright, the setup is that we have an operator P with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these has a given matrix form. The basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the operators are expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. Oh, right, because when the basis is the eigenvectors of an operator, the matrix is diagonal for that operator.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the question is about the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the standard deviation formula. So the formula for uncertainty ΔA is the square root of the expectation of A squared minus the square of the expectation of A. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But wait, since P_z is the operator in its own eigenbasis, the matrix is diagonal. So calculating expectation values might be easier here.

Let me write down the state vector. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I should check if this is normalized. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values.

(-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1. Okay, so the state is normalized, which is good.

Now, the operator P_z is given as a diagonal matrix with entries [ ħ, 0, -ħ ] in the first, second, and third rows, respectively. So the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues corresponding to each basis state.

Wait, the basis is the eigenvectors of P_z, so each basis vector |k⟩ corresponds to P_z |k⟩ = p_k |k⟩, where p_k is
