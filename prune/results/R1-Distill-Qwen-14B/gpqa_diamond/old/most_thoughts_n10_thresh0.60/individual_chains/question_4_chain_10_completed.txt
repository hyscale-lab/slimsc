Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Maxwell's equations question. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. So in our real world, magnets always have both poles—like how you can't have a single pole isolated, right? But in this scenario, they can have isolated poles, so that must change some of Maxwell's equations.

I remember Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me list them out as I remember them:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: The divergence of E equals rho over epsilon zero. So ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. This deals with electric charge distribution.

2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: The divergence of B is zero. So ∇·B = 0. This is the one that says there are no isolated magnetic monopoles because the divergence is zero, meaning no sources or sinks for the B field.

3. Faraday's Law: The curl of E is equal to the negative rate of change of B. So ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. This has to do with induced electric fields from changing magnetic fields.

4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: The curl of B is mu zero times J plus mu zero epsilon zero times the partial of E over partial t. So ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. This one includes the displacement current.

In our universe, equation 2 says that divergence of B is zero. So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would imply that equation 2 changes. Because if there are isolated magnetic monopoles, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero. Instead, it would be something like the magnetic charge density, similar to how Gauss's law for E relates to electric charge.

So in this other universe, equation 2 would become ∇·B = rho_magnetic / some constant, probably. So that equation definitely changes.

Now, what about the other equations? Do any of them change because of the existence of isolated poles? Let me think. For Faraday's law, equation 3, I don't think the form changes. It still deals with the induced electric fields from changing B. Unless the fact that B can have sources affects something else. Wait, but Faraday's law is about the curl of E, so if B's sources change, maybe the equation remains the same.

Ampère's law, equation 4, is about the curl of B. I don't think the form of that equation changes because it's more about how current and changing E fields create B fields. So equation 4 would stay the same.

Then what about equation 1? Gauss's law for E? That deals with electric charges, and the presence of magnetic monopoles shouldn't affect that equation. So equation 1 remains the same.

So only equation 2 changes. Wait, but looking at the options, let me see:

Option A: The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equation 2. So A says that equation changes.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So this would involve equations 3 and 2. But I only thought equation 2 changes. So why would equation 3 change? Because equation 3 is Faraday's law. If the magnetic field can have sources (monopoles), maybe Faraday's law also gets a term? Or does it not?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's think more. In our current equations, equation 2 is ∇·B =0. If a universe allows magnetic monopoles, then equation 2 becomes ∇·B = something like rho_m. So that equation definitely changes.

But what about equation 3, Faraday's law? In the standard form, it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. Does having a magnetic charge affect this? Hmm. I think in the presence of magnetic charges, the Faraday law would get an additional term. Because if you have a magnetic charge density, then when you take the divergence of both sides of Faraday's equation, you need to account for that.

Wait, let me do this. Take equation 3: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If I take the divergence of both sides, the left side is ∇·(∇×E) which is zero because the divergence of a curl is zero. So right side, divergence of (-∂B/∂t) is -∂/∂t (∇·B). In our current universe, ∇·B is zero, so that term is zero. So 0 = 0, which is fine.

But in the universe with monopoles, ∇·B = rho_m / something. So ∂/∂t (∇·B) would be ∂(rho_m)/∂t / something. Then, the equation after taking divergence is 0 = - ∂(∇·B)/∂t. Which would imply ∇·B is a constant in time? Or perhaps not, but wait, maybe the equation would have to change if magnetic charges can vary over time.

Wait, perhaps in this universe, the Faraday's law equation would have an extra term. Let me think, in some scenarios, when magnetic charges exist, you get an additional term in Faraday's law. Let me recall: In a theory that includes magnetic monopoles, the Maxwell equations are modified. Specifically, you add terms for magnetic current and magnetic charge.

I think the modified equations are:

∇·E = rho_e / epsilon_0

∇·B = rho_m / some constant

∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - J_m / some constant

∇×B = μ_0 epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t + μ_0 J_e

Wait, so that would mean that Faraday's law (∇×E) now has an additional term, the magnetic current density J_m. So equation 3 changes. So equation 3 would now include a term for the magnetic current. So both equation 2 and equation 3 change.

Oh, right! So previously, equations 2 and 3 would change. So when you have magnetic monopoles, both the divergence of B (equation 2) and the curl of E (equation 3) are modified.

Wait, but wait, the question is which of Maxwell's equations are different. So in the parallel universe, which equations would look different from our current ones?

So in our universe:

Equation 2: ∇·B = 0

Equation 3: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t

In the parallel universe with monopoles:

Equation 2: ∇·B = (some constant) * rho_m

Equation 3: ∇×E = - ∂B/∂t - (some constant) * J_m

So both equations 2 and 3 are modified.

So which option corresponds to this? Let's look at the options again.

Option D: The ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field.

Wait, no. Because equation 2 is the divergence of B, and equation 3 is the curl of E. So wait, equation 3 is about the electric field's curl, not the magnetic field's curl.

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option C: The one related to the circulation of the magnetic field and the flux of the electric field.

Wait, circulation is curl. So this option is about ∇×B and ∇·E? Not sure.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.

So equation 3 (curl of E) and equation 2 (div of B) are modified. So option B says the ones related to the circulation of E (equation 3) and divergence of B (equation 2) are different. That would be correct.

Option D says the ones related to the divergence and the curl of the magnetic field. So equation 2 (div B) and equation 4 (curl B) are modified. But in our analysis, equation 4 remains the same because curl B is about current and displacement current. So equation 4 doesn't change. Only equation 2 and 3 change.

So, looking again:

Which equations are different?

Equation 2 (div B) and equation 3 (curl E) are different.

So which option corresponds to that? Let me read the options again.

Option B: The ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.

Yes, exactly. So equations 2 and 3 change. So option B is correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that both equations 2 and 3 are modified. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, another way to think: In the real world, Maxwell's equations have:

∇·B = 0 (equation 2)

∇×E = -∂B/∂t (equation 3)

In the universe with monopoles, equation 2 becomes non-zero, and equation 3 gains a term.

So both equations 2 and 3 are different from the real-world equations. So the question is asking which equations are different—so both equation 2 and 3.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ones related to the circulation (curl) of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field. So that's equations 2 and 3.

So according to this, the correct answer should be option B.


In a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles, Maxwell’s equations would differ from our familiar ones. Specifically, the presence of magnetic monopoles implies changes to two of the equations:

1. **Gauss's Law for Magnetism (∇·B = 0):** In our universe, this equation reflects the absence of isolated magnetic monopoles, as the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, this equation would change to ∇·B = ρ_m / some constant, where ρ_m represents the magnetic charge density.

2. **Faraday's Law (∇×E = -∂B/∂t):** In our universe, this equation describes the induced electric field due to a time-varying magnetic field. In a universe with magnetic monopoles, an additional term would appear in this equation to account for magnetic currents. Specifically, it would become ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m / some constant, where J_m is the magnetic current density.

The other two equations, **Gauss's Law for Electricity (∇·E = ρ/ε₀)** and **Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition (∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t)**, remain unchanged because they pertain to electric charge and current, and the magnetic field's curl, respectively, which are not directly affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

Thus, the two modified equations are related to the **divergence of the magnetic field** (equation 2) and the **circulation of the electric field** (equation 3). This corresponds to **Option B**.

Answer: B
