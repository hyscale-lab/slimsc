Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is given as |ψ> = (cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α> ) / N. N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). 

The non-Gaussianity measure used is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Here, rho is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

The question gives phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to find the non-Gaussianity nG for these values.

Hmm. I remember that Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, etc., and non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian Wigner functions. The Schrödinger cat state is a typical example of a non-Gaussian state, being a superposition of two coherent states.

Wait, but the problem is about using relative entropy. Relative entropy measures how different two probability distributions are. In quantum information theory, the quantum relative entropy between two states rho and sigma is defined as S(rho || sigma) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln sigma). But in this case, the formula given is trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau), which would be S(rho || tau) - S(tau || tau) = S(rho || tau) - 0, because any state's entropy when compared to itself is zero. Wait, no, the formula is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So that would be S(rho, tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau), but in this case, del_b is S(rho, rho) - S(tau, tau), which isn't the same. Wait, wait. Maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Oh, wait! The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho || tau) = trace(rho log rho) - trace(rho log tau). But the given del_b is trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau) = [S(rho) - S(tau) + something? Not exactly. Wait, perhaps it's the relative entropy between rho and tau, but expressed as S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(tau), assuming that S(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(tau), but that's not correct in general. Because S(rho || tau) isn't equal to S(rho) - S(tau), but actually S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the entropy between them. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps this is a typo or a specific definition. The problem states that the relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is the same as S(rho) - S(tau). So this would be the difference in the von Neumann entropies of rho
