Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The problem is about the stability of cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes. We have a solution where the total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)2²+ complex (maybe that's the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ ion?) among all the cobalt species.

Wait, but what's the blue one? I remember that different Co(SCN)_n complexes have different colors. For example, [Co(SCN)_4]^3- is blue. Oh wait, no, maybe [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ is blue. Wait, I'm a bit confused. But the question asks about dithiocyanato, which is two SCN- ions. So the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+. Hmm. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact formula, but perhaps that's not the main issue here.

The key concepts here are the stability constants and how they relate to the distribution of the different complexes. Stability constants (formation constants) tell us how much a complex will form compared to others. Higher beta means more stable complex.

So the general approach is to consider all possible complexes of Co(II) with thiocyanate. The possible complexes are:

1. Co²+ (free ion)
2. Co(SCN)²+ (monothiocyanato)
3. Co(SCN)_2^0 (dithiocyanato, but wait, what's the charge? Let me think. Co²+ has a +2 charge, each SCN- is -1. So for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(charge). So for n=1: +2 -1 = +1 → [CoSCN]^+.
n=2: +2 -2 = 0 → Co(SCN)_2.
n=3: +2 -3 = -1 → [Co(SCN)_3]^-
n=4: +2 -4 = -2 → [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

Wait, but the stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4. So each β represents the formation from the previous complex. Hmm, perhaps β1 is the formation of the first complex, then β2 for the second, etc. Or maybe each β represents the stepwise addition of SCN-.

Wait, stability constants can be cumulative (overall) or stepwise (each step). Let me think: for a complex that forms stepwise, each β is the constant for adding one more ligand. So, for example:

β1 = [CoSCN^+]/( [Co^2+][SCN^-] )

β2 = [Co(SCN)_2]/( [CoSCN^+][SCN^-] )

β3 = [Co(SCN)_3^-]/( [Co(SCN)_2][SCN^-
