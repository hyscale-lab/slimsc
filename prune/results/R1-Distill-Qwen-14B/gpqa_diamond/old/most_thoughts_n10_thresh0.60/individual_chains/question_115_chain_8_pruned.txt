Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron and a positron annihilating each other and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they usually produce gamma-ray photons. But I'm a bit rusty on the exact details. Let's think this through.

The setup: an electron is moving to the right (left to right along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving to the left (right to left) with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. The photons have the same energy and their directions are in the upper-right and lower-right directions. I need to find the angle between these two photons.

Wait, Lorentz factors are gamma, right? So gamma for the electron is 4, and for the positron it's 2. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, maybe we need to consider their momenta as vectors.

I remember that in annihilation, the total momentum must be conserved. So the electron and positron's momenta must sum up to the sum of the photons' momenta. Since the photons are moving in opposite directions but same energy, their momenta vectors would be opposite. Wait, no, their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So they are both moving to the right, but one upwards and the other downwards. That means their momenta vectors form some angle relative to each other.

Wait, let me get this straight. The electrons and positrons are moving along the horizontal axis. So their momenta are along the x-axis. The photons, though, are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, so their directions are in the first and fourth quadrants relative to the x-axis.

So, the initial system's momentum is the sum of the electron and positron's momenta. Since they're moving in opposite directions, I need to compute each's momentum vector.

Electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But wait, gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is already given. So the momentum can be calculated as p = gamma * m_e * c * beta, where beta is v/c. But maybe I can find the total momentum in terms of gamma factors.

Wait, no, the momentum of each particle is their relativistic momentum. So for the electron, moving to the right, its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly,
