Okay, so I have this science question here about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are different inverse power laws, like 1 over plx squared, cubed, etc.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of the distance in parsecs. So, plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit parallax. I think I need to consider how the number of stars depends on distance. If stars are uniformly distributed, that means the number density of stars is the same throughout space, right? So the number of stars in a certain volume would depend on the volume of that space.

Let me visualize this. Imagine a sphere with radius d. The volume V is (4/3)πd³. Now, if the number of stars per unit volume is n (constant), then the number of stars within that sphere is N = n * V = n*(4/3)πd³.

But how does this connect to parallax? Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. Substituting that into the equation, N = n*(4/3)π (1/plx)^3. So N is proportional to 1/plx³. Wait, but that's the total number within a sphere of radius d.

But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. That unit range is like a thin shell in terms of parallax. So instead of a cumulative number, we're looking at the differential: how many stars are there for a small change in plx, say dplx.

Let me think. The number of stars with parallax between plx and plx + dplx would be the number of stars in a thin spherical shell with inner radius d and outer radius d + dd. Wait, no, because plx increases as distance decreases. So a small change in plx (dplx) would correspond to a change in distance dd. Let's get the relation between d and plx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. The derivative dd/dplx is -1/(plx²). So dd = - dplx / (plx²). The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, distance decreases, but for the purpose of counting stars, I think the magnitude is what matters.

So the volume of the thin shell (like a spherical shell) at distance d with thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. Because the volume of a thin shell is surface area (4πd²) multiplied by thickness dd.

The number of stars in that shell would be N = n * (4πd² dd). Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = dplx/(plx²) (taking the magnitude for counting), then:

N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx/(plx²)) )

Simplify that: 4π n * (1/plx²) * (1/plx²) dplx = 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

So the number per unit parallax range (dplx) is N/dplx = 4π n (1/plx^4). Oh wait, no, because dplx is the range, so the number per unit plx is N/dplx, which is (4π n / plx^4). So the number density in terms of plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So if we have a small range dplx, the number of stars in that range is proportional to 1/plx^4 times dplx. But the question is about per unit plx, so it's the coefficient, which would be 1/plx^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4, option B is 1/plx², etc. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but I'm a little confused. Because sometimes when you change variables, like from distance to parallax, the distribution can change. Let me think again. If we have uniform distribution in space, the number of stars in a volume element dV is proportional to dV. So dN = n dV.

But dV in terms of distance is 4πd² dd. When we express dV in terms of parallax, since d = 1/plx, dd = -dplx/(plx²). So the volume element dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (dplx)/(plx^2) ) = 4 π dplx (1/plx^4). So dN = n * 4 π dplx (1/plx^4). So the number of stars per unit plx (dplx) is dN/dplx = 4 π n (1/plx^4). So yeah, it's proportional to 1/plx^4. So the number per unit range of plx decreases as plx increases, and it's inversely proportional to plx^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax is inversely related to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. Assuming stars are uniformly distributed in space, the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant. The number of stars within a spherical volume of radius \( d \) is proportional to the volume of the sphere, which is \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi d^3 \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \), the total number of stars within this volume becomes proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \).

However, the question asks about the number of stars per unit range of parallax, which corresponds to a thin spherical shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \). The volume of this shell is \( 4 \pi d^2 dd \). Substituting \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \) and \( dd = -\frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} \) (taking the magnitude for counting stars), the volume of the shell becomes:

\[
dV = 4 \pi \left(\frac{1}{\text{plx}}\right)^2 \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^2} = 4 \pi \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars in this shell is then:

\[
dN = n \cdot dV = n \cdot 4 \pi \frac{d\text{plx}}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is the coefficient of \( d\text{plx} \), which is proportional to \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \text{plx}^4 \).

From the given options:
- **A)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \) matches the derived result.
- **B)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) is incorrect.
- **C)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \) is incorrect.
- **D)** \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \) is incorrect.

The correct answer is **A**.
