Okay, so I have this question about organic chemistry, specifically dealing with Grubbs catalyst and racemic compounds. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible products are formed when racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. The options are A to D, with numbers ranging from 2 to 8. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I should recall what Grubbs catalyst does. From what I remember, Grubbs is a type of transition metal catalyst, typically used for alkene metathesis reactions. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. It can cause ring-closing metathesis, ring-opening metathesis, or cross metathesis, depending on the starting materials. 

In this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw the structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But wait, 3-methyl would make it CH2=CH-C(CH3)H-CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me count the carbons.

Pentene has five carbons. 3-methylpent-1-ene: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and a methyl branch is on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula for pentene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CHCH(CH3)2? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, wait, maybe I should write it as CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would imply a methyl group on carbon 3. So, carbon 1: CH2=, carbon 2: CH-, carbon 3: CH(CH3), and then the rest. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, but that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, but wait, let me count the carbons. Carbon
