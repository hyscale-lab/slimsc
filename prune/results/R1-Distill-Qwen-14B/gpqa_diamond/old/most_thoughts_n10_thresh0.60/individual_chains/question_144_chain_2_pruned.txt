Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. I need to find the mean decay distance. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters, all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime. The formula I think I need is the mean proper lifetime, which is the width divided by the rest mass energy. Wait, no, wait. The mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / (Γ), where Γ is the total decay width. But wait, Γ is the width, which is the total decay rate. Oh right, but when you have a resonance, the width is related to the lifetime. So τ = ħ / (Γ). 

Wait, actually, the formula I think is τ = ħ * (m_X) / (Γ_X * something?), no wait, no. Because Γ is the decay width, and it's related to the lifetime. The relation between the width and lifetime is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But I need to make sure about the units.

Once I have the lifetime, I can calculate the decay distance using the velocity times the lifetime. Because the particle will travel
