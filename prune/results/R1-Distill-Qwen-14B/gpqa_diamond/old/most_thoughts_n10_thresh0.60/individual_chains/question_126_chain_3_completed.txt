Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that an organic chemist performs two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II. Each reaction starts with a different compound and uses different reagents. After both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is asking how many peaks the chemist will observe in each of these chromatograms.

Hmm, I need to figure out the products of each reaction first. Let's tackle Reaction I.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. Typically, LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the starting material is a ketone at position 3, so the structure is a six-carbon chain with a methoxy group on the fifth carbon and a ketone on the third. 

So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it out more clearly. Let's see:

The compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The hexan-3-one part means a six-carbon chain with the ketone on C3. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right. Let me count. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3. So:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is O=C(CH2)3CH2CH2? Let me think again. Hexan means six carbons. 3-one is the ketone on C3. So numbering from left to right:

1 2 3 4 5 6.

So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Let me count the carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons after the ketone. No, wait, hexan-3-one is:

(CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3. So positions 1 and 2 are CH2, position 3 is carbonyl, and positions 4,5,6 are CH2 each. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, but the starting molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So substituting on the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, let's confirm the numbering. So, the carbonyl is on C3. Then C4 is next to it. So the substituents would be on C4 and C5? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Let me think again. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, that's 3-ketohexane, which is a 6-carbon chain with the ketone on C3.

So in this case, the compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So on C5, there's a methoxy group. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's seven carbons. Oh wait, no. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let's count: hexan-3-one is six carbons, so positions 1 through 6. The ketone is on C3, so:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O
4: CH2-
5: CH2-
6: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

Structure: (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3. So positions 1,2,3 carbons are before the ketone, and 4,5,6 after. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3. No, that's seven carbons. Wait, maybe it's:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. That's five carbons, so that can't be. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try another approach.

The IUPAC name is hexan-3-one. So six carbons, ketone on C3. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's too long. Wait, no. Let's count again. Hexan-3-one: positions 1 to 6.

Positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Ketone is on C3, so:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in total. Oh wait, no, that's correct? Let me see:

Wait, that would be pentan-3-one if it's five carbons. Wait, hexan-3-one must be six carbons.

Ah, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, because the ketone is on C3, so the chain is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. That can't be right because that would be seven carbons. Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that has six carbons in total? Let me count:

C1: CH2-

C2: CH2-

C3: C(=O)-

C4: CH2-

C5: CH2-

C6: CH3.

Yes, that's correct. So the structure is: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Now, the substituent is a methoxy group on C5.

So in the starting material (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but since the chain is hexan-3-one, the carbonyl is on C3, and the substituent is on C5. So the structure is:

Positions:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: C(=O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH2-

Wait, no. Wait, the substituent is on C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So, yeah.

When LAH is used to reduce this, the ketone (position 3) would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product from Reaction I would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, but wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, so it would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, but what about the configuration?

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When the ketone is at C3, reducing it would form an alcohol at C3. So the product would be 3-hexanol with a substituent on C5. But wait, the starting compound's configuration is S at C5, so after reduction, would that affect the configuration elsewhere?

Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. When we reduce the ketone at C3, that's a different carbon. So the configuration at C5 (S) would remain unchanged because the reduction is at C3. So the product would have the same configuration at C5 as before. So after Reaction I, we get 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with the same configuration at C5, which is S.

Wait, but wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, you get a secondary alcohol. So the product would be (3R or 3S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But the original configuration at C5 was S. Now, wait, but the reaction is done with LAH, which is a strong reducing agent. Does it change the configuration at C5? Or does it only affect the carbonyl group at C3?

Hmm, no, because the reduction at C3 doesn't affect the stereocenter at C5. So the configuration at C5 remains S. So the product is (3R or 3S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but the configuration at C5 is still S.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The starting material is (S) at C5. The reduction is at C3, which adds two hydrogens. The configuration at C5 won't be affected because the reaction doesn't touch that carbon. So yes, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with the same configuration at C5.

Now, moving on to Reaction II.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? No, wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3?

Wait, no, wait. Pentane has five carbons. So positions 1,2,3,4,5.

So 2 and 4 are ketones. So structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me draw it as:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. So that's two ketone groups on positions 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain. So 2,4-pentanedione.

When NaBH4 is used to reduce this, but wait, NaBH4 is a weaker reducing agent compared to LAH. But in this case, NaBH4 can reduce ketones, but it doesn't typically reduce esters or amides. However, in this case, we have two ketone groups.

Wait, but NaBH4 is not strong enough to reduce esters or amides, but it can reduce ketones. So when you have a diketone like 2,4-pentanedione, what happens when you treat it with NaBH4?

Wait, but in this case, the reaction is performed with excess NaBH4, so perhaps both ketones are reduced. Each ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, but wait: 2,4-pentanedione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, the correct structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione has five carbons. So it's:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Oh wait, that would be 2,4-pentanedione. So structure is: O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is:

1   2      3   4      5

So carbons 2 and 4 are carbonyls. So the structure is:

CH2(CO)-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons: 1 is CH3, 2 is C=O, 3 is CH2, 4 is C=O, 5 is CH3? No, that can't be because 2 and 4 are in a five-carbon chain.

Ah, wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3.

Wait, no, that's six carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)2COCH2COCH3?

Wait, no, that's more than five carbons. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3, but that's six carbons as well. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's just proceed.

So, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione, which is (CH3)2COCH2COCH3? No, that's not correct. Wait, another approach: the IUPAC name is pentane-2,4-dione. So, it's a five-carbon chain with ketones on C2 and C4.

So the structure is: 

CH2(C=O)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons in a row: positions 1, 2, 3,4,5.

So, position 2 is a carbonyl (C=O), and position 4 is also a carbonyl. So structure is:

CH2(C=O)-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, that makes a five-carbon chain with two ketone groups.

Now, when you treat this with NaBH4. NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce ketones, but it won't reduce esters or amides. So each ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So each of the ketones (positions 2 and 4) would be reduced.

So, the product would be 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, each ketone is a separate site. So 2-pentanone becomes 2-pentanol, and 4-pentanone becomes 4-pentanol. But in this case, the starting material has both ketones, so after reduction, would both be alcohols.

Wait, but when you reduce both ketones, you end up with two secondary alcohols. So the product would be a diol: 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two carbonyl groups. Let me think about the actual structure again. It's O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. So the molecule is (CH3)CO-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's not possible because that would require more than five carbons. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)2-CO-CH2-CO-CH3? No, that's seven carbons.

Wait, perhaps I should move forward because this is taking too much time, and maybe I can figure out the products.

So, Reaction I gives a single product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, actually, the starting material is (S) configuration at C5, so the product would retain that configuration. So the product is (3R or 3S) 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but the configuration at C5 is S.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the reduction. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The ketone is at C3. When reduced by LAH, the ketone becomes an alcohol, so the product is 3-hexanol with a methoxy group on C5 and same configuration at C5.

Wait, so the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Now, is this molecule chiral? Let's check. The molecule has two potential chiral centers: C3 and C5.

At C3, after reduction, the structure becomes CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So the groups around C3 are: two CH2 groups, a OH, and a CH2 group attached to C4. Wait, no, let me see:

Wait, the structure is CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one before reduction is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

After reduction, the ketone (C=O) becomes an alcohol (-OH). So the structure becomes:

CH2CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

So at C3, the groups are:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C4)
- A OH group
- A CH2 group leading to C4.

Wait, no. Let me draw this more accurately.

In hexan-3-one, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's seven carbons. No, that's impossible. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. The correct structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

The molecule is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons in total:

1: CH2-

2: CH2-

3: C(=O)-

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's seven carbons. I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without it.

So, after reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4.

Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups. When treated with NaBH4, which is a strong reducing agent for ketones, each ketone would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would be 2,4-pentanediol.

But wait, each reduction is on a different carbon, so the product would have two alcohol groups on C2 and C4.

So, the product of Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol.

Now, the products from both reactions are combined. So, Reaction I gives one product, and Reaction II gives another product. But wait, are there any other products?

Wait, in Reaction II, after NaBH4 reduction, could there be any other products? Well, if the starting material is a diketone, and NaBH4 is in excess, both ketones would be reduced, giving a single product: 2,4-pentanediol.

So, the combined products from both reactions are:

1. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (from Reaction I)
2. 2,4-pentanediol (from Reaction II)

Wait, but let me think again. Could Reaction II give more than one product?

Ah, wait, when you have a diketone and reduce it, the two ketones are in different positions. So when both are reduced, you get a diol. But are both ketones in the same molecule? So the product is a single compound, 2,4-pentanediol.

So, in total, the combined products are two different compounds.

But wait, could Reaction I give more than one product? Let me think.

In Reaction I, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, it becomes (3R or 3S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, but the configuration at C5 (the methoxy group) remains S. So the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, right? Because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction doesn't change the configuration at C5.

Wait, no, wait. The configuration at C3 could be a new stereocenter. Wait, the original starting material has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration). The ketone at C3 is not a chiral center because it's planar. After reduction, the C3 becomes a chiral center because it's now a secondary alcohol.

So, the product from Reaction I would be a single enantiomer at C3, but wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent and can cause racemization? Or does it retain the configuration?

Wait, no, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol using LAH, the configuration at the new chiral center depends on the mechanism. LAH typically does a complete reduction, adding H- from the hydride and then another H from the counterion. But in a ketone, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the proton comes from the workup (acidic or basic). So for a prochiral ketone, the reduction would lead to a racemic mixture unless the starting material is chiral.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material isn't chiral at C3. The starting material is (S) at C5. So when the ketone at C3 is reduced, a new chiral center is formed at C3. LAH would reduce the ketone to an alcohol, and since the starting material is not chiral at C3, the reduction would result in a racemic mixture at C3, but wait, no. Wait, LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it could cause some rearrangement.

Wait, actually, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, if there's no existing chiral center adjacent, the product will have a new chiral center. But whether it's R or S depends on the approach of the hydride. In the case of a symmetrical ketone, you'd get a racemic mixture, but in an unsymmetrical case, you'd get a specific configuration.

Wait, but in this case, the ketone is at C3 of a six-carbon chain with a methoxy group at C5. So the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

When this is treated with LAH, the hydride would attack the carbonyl carbon (C3), which is attached to two different groups: the left side is CH2CH2- and the right side is CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So the hydride would attack from the less hindered side, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, would that influence the configuration?

Wait, no, because the starting material's configuration is at C5, not C3. So when the ketone is reduced, the new chiral center at C3 would form with a specific configuration based on the attack of the hydride. But since the starting material isn't chiral at C3, the attack could come from either side, leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is (S) at C5, which is a stereocenter. The C3 is adjacent to the C4, which is connected to C5. So perhaps the steric environment around C3 is influenced by the configuration at C5.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to assume that the reduction at C3 leads to a racemic mixture of the alcohol, but wait, the starting material isn't a chiral center at C3, so the product would be a racemic mixture at C3. But wait, no, in reality, LAH would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol, and the configuration at C3 would be determined by the approach of the hydride. In an unsymmetrical ketone, you can get a specific configuration, but if the ketone isn't symmetric, you can get a major product.

Alternatively, perhaps the product would be a single enantiomer because the reducing agent approaches from a specific face. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is (S) at C5. Could that influence the configuration at C3? It's possible because the spatial arrangement around C5 could influence the approach of the hydride at C3.

But perhaps for the sake of this problem, it's better to assume that the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture. But maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer because the reaction is stereospecific.

Wait, but the question is about the number of peaks in the HPLC. So perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and from Reaction II is another single compound. So in total, two products.

But wait, let me think again. Reaction I's product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The starting material is (S) at C5. After reduction, does it form a new chiral center at C3, and what is its configuration?

Ah, perhaps the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So, at C3, the configuration is determined by the reduction. But since the starting material is (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 is influenced by the structure around C5, perhaps the product has two chiral centers, but perhaps only one is affected by the reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has only one chiral center, C3, because C5's configuration remains S. But wait, no, the product would have two chiral centers: C3 (new) and C5 (existing).

Wait, wait, no. The starting material has a chiral center at C5. After reduction, the C5 remains a chiral center (since it's attached to four different groups: the methoxy group, two CH2 groups, and the adjacent C4). So the product from Reaction I would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

So, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with configurations at C3 and C5. Since the starting material was (S) at C5, and the reduction at C3 would create a new chiral center, the product would have two stereocenters. 

Now, the question is whether the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture, or something else.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. When you reduce the ketone, you're adding a new chiral center at C3. The configuration at C3 would depend on the approach of the hydride. But because the starting material is a single enantiomer, it's possible that the product has a specific diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, meaning a single stereoisomer. Because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3 and C5.

Alternatively, perhaps the product at C3 could be a racemic mixture, but that would complicate things.

But I'm not entirely confident. Let's proceed with the assumption that the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So, the product is (3R,5S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol or (3S,5S), depending on the reaction.

But perhaps the key point is whether the product is a single compound or a mixture. If the product is a single compound, then Reaction I gives one product, and Reaction II gives another product, leading to two products in total.

So, combining the two reaction products, we have two different compounds: the diol from Reaction II and the alcohol from Reaction I.

But wait, let's think about the HPLC analysis. The question asks how many peaks are observed in the chiral HPLC and the normal-phase HPLC.

In normal-phase HPLC, the stationary phase is polar, and the mobile phase is non-polar. It separates compounds based on polarity. If the two products are different in polarity, they would elute at different times, giving two peaks.

In the chiral HPLC, the stationary phase is a chiral column, which separates enantiomers or diastereomers. So if any of the products have chiral centers, they might show multiple peaks.

So, the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers. So, how many stereoisomers are possible?

The product from Reaction I is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has chiral centers at C3 and C5. So the maximum number of stereoisomers is 2^2=4. But since the starting material was (S) at C5, and the reduction didn't change that, the product has a fixed configuration at C5.

Wait, no. The starting material's configuration at C5 is S. After reduction, the product has a new chiral center at C3. So, the product has two chiral centers, but the configuration at C5 is still S. So the product would have two stereoisomers: (3R,5S) and (3S,5S). So, if the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, the product would be a mixture of these two isomers.

But wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so would the product be a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture?

Hmm. Let's think again. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. When reduced, the ketone at C3 becomes an alcohol. The configuration at C3 would be determined by the approach of the hydride. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single diastereomer.

Wait, no, because the reduction introduces a new chiral center, and the starting material's configuration doesn't necessarily dictate the new one. So perhaps the product would have two possible configurations at C3, each leading to a diastereomer. But if the reduction is stereospecific, maybe only one diastereomer is formed.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture at C3, but since the configuration at C5 is fixed, the product would have two enantiomers.

Wait, but wait, the product has two chiral centers. So, for each configuration at C3 (R or S), combined with the fixed S at C5, we get two possible stereoisomers: (3R,5S) and (3S,5S). So, if the reduction at C3 leads to both R and S configurations, the product would be a mixture of these two, which are diastereomers.

But wait, would the reduction lead to both isomers, or just one?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's think about the outcome of the reaction. If the reduction of the ketone creates a new chiral center, and the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have two stereocenters, and thus multiple stereoisomers.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, meaning that only one stereoisomer is formed. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer because the reaction is stereoselective, leading to only one configuration at C3. This could happen if the hydride approaches from a specific face due to the steric environment.

But without more information, perhaps it's better to assume that the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer. So, it would have two chiral centers, but no symmetry, leading to a single diastereomer.

Wait, but that's not possible because adding a new chiral center to a molecule with an existing chiral center would create a diastereomer if the new center has a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, so it's a single compound.

Then, the product from Reaction II is 2,4-pentanediol. This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C4), each in a diol configuration. Now, pentane-2,4-dione, upon reduction with excess NaBH4, would become 2,4-pentanediol.

But how many stereoisomers does 2,4-pentanediol have? Let's see: each of the two OH groups is on a chiral center. So, for each OH, there are two possibilities (R or S). So maximum 4 stereoisomers. However, due to the structure, some of them might be identical.

Wait, the structure is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. So, the two OHs are on C2 and C4.

Wait, no, 2,4-pentanediol would have OHs on C2 and C4. So the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that's 2 and 4 positions. So it's:

CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. No, that's 2 and 4.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. So, the molecule is HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

Each OH is on a different carbon, and each of those carbons is a chiral center. So, each OH can be R or S.

So, the maximum number of stereoisomers is 2^2=4. But wait, let's see if any of them are meso compounds.

In 2,4-pentanediol, if the two OHs are in the same configuration (both R or both S), the molecule could be a meso compound due to a plane of symmetry. Let me check. If the configurations are (2R,4R) or (2S,4S), would that molecule be meso?

No, because for a meso compound, there must be a plane of symmetry. In this case, the molecule is symmetric if the two OHs are on carbons 2 and 4, which are symmetric around the center. So, if the configurations are the same (both R or both S), the molecule would be a meso compound.

Wait, let's imagine the structure:

HO-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3.

If the OHs are both on the same side, would the molecule have a plane of symmetry between C3 and C4?

Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule would have a center of symmetry if the configurations are the same.

Wait, for a meso compound, the molecule must have an internal plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure:

If the two CH2 groups between the OHs are symmetric. So, if the two OHs are on C2 and C4, and their configurations are such that they mirror each other, the molecule could be meso.

So, if both OHs are R, would that make the molecule meso?

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of specific examples. Take tartaric acid as a meso compound: it has two stereocenters and is a meso compound because of a plane of symmetry.

In the case of 2,4-pentanediol, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C3 and C4 if the configurations are the same on both ends. So, when OH groups are on C2 and C4, and their configurations are the same (both R or both S), the molecule would be a meso compound. Otherwise, they are enantiomers.

So, the possible stereoisomers are:

1. (2R,4R) – meso

2. (2S,4S) – meso

3. (2R,4S) – enantiomer of (2S,4R)

4. (2S,4R) – enantiomer of (2R,4S)

Wait, but wait, when the configurations are opposite (like R and S), are they enantiomers or diastereomers?

In any case, the total number of stereoisomers for 2,4-pentanediol would be 3: two meso forms and two enantiomeric pairs. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me correct that.

Wait, no. The molecule has two stereocenters, so maximum four stereoisomers. Some of these could be meso.

If the two stereocenters are in a symmetric position, such that the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, then two of the stereoisomers would be meso, and the other two would be enantiomers.

Wait, no, that's not right. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, there are two stereocenters, and it's a meso compound. The other two stereoisomers are enantiomers. So, total three stereoisomers: one meso and two enantiomers.

Wait, but in our case, 2,4-pentanediol: if both OHs are in the same configuration (R,R or S,S), then the molecule is meso. If they're in opposite configurations (R,S or S,R), then they form enantiomeric pairs. So, there are two meso forms (R,R and S,S) and two enantiomeric pairs. But wait, no, because R,R and S,S are the same due to the symmetry, so they're actually the same compound.

Wait, no. Let me clarify: for tartaric acid, (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, but the meso form is when the configuration is (R,S). But wait, no, in tartaric acid, the meso form is when one is R and the other S, but due to the symmetry, it's a single compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In 2,4-pentanediol, the two OHs are on C2 and C4. The molecule has a plane of symmetry through C3 if the configurations at C2 and C4 are mirror images. So, for example, if C2 is R and C4 is S, or vice versa, the molecule would be a meso compound.

Alternatively, if both C2 and C4 are R, there's no plane of symmetry, so the molecule is chiral and would have an enantiomer where both are S.

Wait, no. Let me consider the actual structure. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3.

If both OHs are on the same face (both R or both S), then the molecule is not symmetric. If they're on opposite faces (one R, one S), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and thus be a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out:

If the OH on C2 is R and the OH on C4 is S, due to the mirror plane in the center, the molecule would be symmetric. Similarly, if OH on C2 is S and C4 is R, it's the same as the first case because of the mirror plane. So, these two configurations (R,S and S,R) are the same molecule—meso.

Thus, the possible stereoisomers are:

1. (R,R) and (S,S) – which are enantiomers of each other.

2. (R,S) and (S,R) – which are the same as each other (meso).

So, there are three possible stereoisomers: two enantiomeric pairs and one meso compound. Wait, no, because (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, and (R,S) and (S,R) are the same as each other because of the symmetry. So, in total, three stereoisomers: (R,R), (S,S), and (R,S) (meso).

Wait, but no, because (R,R) and (S,S) are enantiomers, and (R,S) is a meso compound. So, there are three stereoisomers in total.

Wait, but wait, when you have two stereocenters, the maximum number is four. But in this case, two of them are the same due to symmetry. So, the actual number is three: two pairs of enantiomers (but wait, no, because (R,R) and (S,S) are a pair of enantiomers, and (R,S) is a meso compound, which is its own mirror image). So, in reality, there are three stereoisomers: two enantiomers (R,R) and (S,S), and one meso (R,S) which is the same as (S,R).

So, in Reaction II, when NaBH4 is used to reduce pentane-2,4-dione, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. But depending on the reaction conditions, how many stereoisomers are formed?

In the problem statement, Reaction II uses excess NaBH4 and an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent for ketones. The reduction of a diketone typically leads to the formation of a diol. However, the reduction of each ketone is independent, so the configuration at each OH group is determined by the reduction step.

Now, when reducing a ketone with NaBH4, the approach of the hydride can be from either face, leading to a racemic mixture unless the ketone is prochiral in a way that leads to a specific configuration.

But in the case of pentane-2,4-dione, each ketone is in a symmetric environment. Wait, no, the two ketones are on C2 and C4, so each is in a different environment.

Wait, when reducing each ketone, would the configuration of the OH groups be the same?

Hmm, perhaps both OHs are added from the same face, leading to either both R or both S configurations. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the reduction could lead to a mixture of both configurations.

But perhaps in this problem, the product is a single stereoisomer. Or maybe, given the symmetry, the product is a meso compound.

Wait, if the reduction of each ketone leads to the same configuration (both R or both S), the product would be a pair of enantiomers. But if the reduction leads to opposite configurations, the product would be meso.

But I'm not certain. Let's assume that the product is a racemic mixture, but considering the possibility of a meso compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single meso compound because the two OHs end up on opposite sides due to the symmetry of the molecule.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's proceed under the assumption that the product from Reaction II is a single meso compound. So, 2,4-pentanediol would be a single stereoisomer (the meso form), leading to one peak in the chiral HPLC.

Wait, but no. If the product is the meso form, it would have an internal plane of symmetry and thus would not be chiral, so it would elute as a single peak in the chiral HPLC because it's not chiral. But wait, the meso compound is achiral, so in a chiral HPLC column, it would elute as a single peak because it doesn't interact with the chiral stationary phase.

Alternatively, if the product is a racemic mixture, it would elute as a single peak in the chiral HPLC because the two enantiomers would co-elute.

Wait, but in reality, if the product is a racemic mixture, the chiral HPLC would show two peaks because it can separate enantiomers. But wait, no, because a racemic mixture is a 50:50 mix of enantiomers, and they would not be separated on a chiral column—they would elute together because the column cannot distinguish enantiomers if they are in a racemic mixture. Wait, no, a chiral column can separate enantiomers because the stationary phase is chiral. So, a racemic mixture would result in two peaks: one for each enantiomer.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to summarize the possible products.

Reaction I:

Product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This has two chiral centers (C3 and C5). The configuration at C5 is S. The configuration at C3 is either R or S. So, the product could be (3R,5S) or (3S,5S). If the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, the product would have two enantiomers: (3R,5S) and (3S,5S). But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, meaning only one configuration at C3 is formed.

But I don't know for sure. Let's assume that Reaction I produces a single diastereomer, so it's a single compound.

Reaction II:

Product: 2,4-pentanediol. Assuming that the product is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, it would elute as a single peak in normal-phase HPLC and a single peak in chiral HPLC because it's not chiral.

Alternatively, if the product is a racemic mixture of (2R,4R) and (2S,4S), which are enantiomers, then in the chiral HPLC, they would elute as two separate peaks. But in normal-phase HPLC, they might elute as one peak if the column isn't chiral, but wait, no. In normal-phase HPLC, the separation is based on polarity, not chirality. So, if two enantiomers have similar polarity, they might elute together, giving a single peak. But if they have different polarities, they would elute separately.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single meso compound, so it's achiral and would give a single peak in both HPLC methods.

Now, combining the products from both reactions:

If Reaction I produces a single diastereomer (two chiral centers, a single stereoisomer), and Reaction II produces a meso compound, then the combined products would have:

- From Reaction I: one compound with two chiral centers → possibly two peaks in chiral HPLC if it's a racemic mixture, or one peak if it's a single diastereomer.

Wait, but if Reaction I produces a single diastereomer, which is a single stereoisomer, then in the chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak because it's a single enantiomer. Wait, no, because it's a diastereomer, perhaps not.

Wait, no. The chiral HPLC separates enantiomers. If Reaction I's product is a single stereoisomer (say, (3R,5S)), then in the chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak. If it's a racemic mixture of (3R,5S) and (3S,5S), then the chiral HPLC would show two peaks.

But I'm not certain about the outcome of Reaction I. So, perhaps I should proceed with an alternative approach.

Let me think about the number of peaks in each HPLC.

Normal-phase HPLC: separates based on polarity. So, if the two products are non-polar and polar, they would elute at different times, giving two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: separates enantiomers. So, any chiral compounds would show multiple peaks.

So, let's consider the possible products:

Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

This compound has two chiral centers. If it's a single stereoisomer, then it's a single enantiomer, so in chiral HPLC, it would elute as a single peak. If it's a racemic mixture, then in chiral HPLC, it would show two peaks.

Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol. If the product is a meso compound, it's achiral, so it would elute as a single peak in both HPLCs. If the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers, then in chiral HPLC, it would show two peaks, but in normal-phase, it would show a single peak (since enantiomers have the same polarity).

So, combining Reaction I and II:

If Reaction I gives a single stereoisomer (so one peak in chiral HPLC) and Reaction II gives a meso compound (one peak), then in chiral HPLC, we'd have two peaks (one from each product). In normal-phase HPLC, two peaks as well.

But wait, no. Because if the products are different compounds, each would elute separately in both HPLC methods.

Wait, normal-phase HPLC: each product is a different compound, so two peaks.

Chiral HPLC: each product would elute based on their enantiomeric form.

Let me think again. The products are:

1. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (two chiral centers, possibly a single stereoisomer)

2. 2,4-pentanediol (possibly a meso compound)

So, in normal-phase HPLC:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: one peak

- 2,4-pentanediol: one peak

Total: 2 peaks.

In chiral HPLC:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: if it's a single stereoisomer, one peak. If it's a racemic mixture, two peaks.

- 2,4-pentanediol: if it's meso, one peak. If it's a racemic mixture, two peaks.

But I'm not sure about the actual stereochemistry of each product.

Wait, perhaps the key is to think about the number of stereoisomers in each product.

Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

It has two chiral centers. So, possible stereoisomers: up to four. But considering the starting material's configuration, perhaps it's a single diastereomer.

But without knowing the exact outcome, perhaps we can model it as a single stereoisomer, leading to one peak in chiral HPLC.

Reaction II's product: 2,4-pentanediol.

Assuming it's a meso compound (achiral), so one peak in both HPLCs.

So, combining both products:

In normal-phase HPLC: two peaks (each product is a different compound).

In chiral HPLC: one peak from Reaction I's product (if it's a single stereoisomer) and one peak from Reaction II's product (meso, so one peak). So total two peaks.

But wait, the options don't have two peaks. Looking back at the options:

Options:

A) 5 and 4

B) 3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

Wait, none of the options match two peaks. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps Reaction I's product has two chiral centers, leading to multiple stereoisomers, which would cause multiple peaks in the chiral HPLC.

Let me try a different approach.

Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

It has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5 (S).

After reduction, the product has a new chiral center at C3.

So, how many stereoisomers does it have?

At C5: S

At C3: R or S.

So possible stereoisomers: (3R,5S) and (3S,5S).

Thus, two stereoisomers.

If the product is a racemic mixture at C3, then the product would have two enantiomers, leading to two peaks in the chiral HPLC.

But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product might not be a racemic mixture. Perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer, so one peak in chiral HPLC.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diastereomer, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 5 and 4

B)3 and 2

C)4 and 2

D)3 and 3

The correct answer is one of these.

Let me think about the number of peaks in each HPLC.

In normal-phase HPLC, each product is a different compound, so two peaks.

In chiral HPLC:

If Reaction I's product has two stereoisomers, and Reaction II's product has two stereoisomers, then total peaks would be 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4.

But looking at the options, option C is 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal. So that could be a possibility.

But wait, Reaction II's product. If it's a meso compound, it's a single peak in chiral HPLC. If it's a racemic mixture, it's two peaks.

So, let's think again.

If Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture (two peaks in chiral HPLC) and Reaction II's product is a meso (one peak in chiral HPLC), total in chiral HPLC: 2 + 1 = 3.

If Reaction II's product is a racemic mixture (two peaks), then total in chiral HPLC: 2 + 2 =4.

So, let's go through each reaction again.

Reaction I:

Product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

It has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

The starting material has C5 as S. After reduction, C3 becomes a new chiral center.

Assuming that the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, the product would have two stereoisomers: (3R,5S) and (3S,5S). So, two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Reaction II:

Product: 2,4-pentanediol.

Assuming that the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (e.g., (2R,4R) and (2S,4S)), then in chiral HPLC, that would give two peaks.

So, total in chiral HPLC: 2 (from Reaction I) + 2 (from Reaction II) = 4 peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC: each product is a different compound, so two peaks.

So, looking at the options, option C says 4 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal.

So, the answer would be option C.

Wait, but looking back, the product from Reaction I, 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, would have two stereoisomers (racemic mixture?), leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC. The product from Reaction II, 2,4-pentanediol, would have two enantiomers (racemic), leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC. So, total 4 in chiral, 2 in normal-phase.

Thus, the correct option is C: 4 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


The problem involves two reactions and analyzing the products using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. Here's the analysis:

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one
- **Reagent**: LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride)
- **Product**: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol
- **Key Points**:
  - The ketone at C3 is reduced to a secondary alcohol, forming a new chiral center at C3.
  - The configuration at C5 remains S, as the reduction does not affect this stereocenter.
  - The product has two chiral centers (C3 and C5), leading to two possible stereoisomers: (3R,5S) and (3S,5S).
  - Assuming the reduction leads to a racemic mixture at C3, the product will have two stereoisomers, resulting in **two peaks** in the chiral HPLC.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (Sodium Borohydride)
- **Product**: 2,4-pentanediol
- **Key Points**:
  - Both ketones at C2 and C4 are reduced to secondary alcohols, forming two chiral centers.
  - The product can exist as four stereoisomers: (2R,4R), (2S,4S), (2R,4S), and (2S,4R). However, due to symmetry, (2R,4S) and (2S,4R) are the same meso compound.
  - This leaves three stereoisomers: two enantiomeric pairs (2R,4R and 2S,4S) and one meso compound (2R,4S/2S,4R).
  - Assuming the reduction leads to a racemic mixture, the product will have two enantiomers (2R,4R and 2S,4S), resulting in **two peaks** in the chiral HPLC.

### Combined Products:
- **Products**:
  1. 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (two stereoisomers).
  2. 2,4-pentanediol (two stereoisomers).
- **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
  - Separates based on polarity. Since the two products are distinct compounds with different polarities, they will elute as **two peaks**.
- **Chiral HPLC**:
  - Separates enantiomers. The two stereoisomers of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and the two enantiomers of 2,4-pentanediol will each elute as separate peaks, resulting in **four peaks**.

### Final Answer:
The chemist observes **4 peaks** in the chiral HPLC and **2 peaks** in the normal-phase HPLC.

**Answer: C**
