Okay, I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. So, the question is about a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it undergoes a series of reactions. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The 1H-NMR shows peaks at 9.72 ppm (a triplet, 1H), 6.98 (doublet, 2H), 6.51 (doublet, 2H), 6.27 (broad singlet, 2H), and 3.66 (doublet, 2H). Hmm, I need to interpret this.

The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, 2*8 +2=18. 18 -9 (H) -1 (N) +0 (no X, since O is considered as X?) Wait, actually, the formula is C8H9NO. So, X is O, so it's (2*8 +2 - 9 -1 +1)/2? Wait, another approach: each degree is a ring or double bond. So for C8H9NO:

Hydrogens for an alkane would be 2*8 +2 = 18. We have 9 H, so 18-9 = 9. Then, considering O and N. Wait, actually, I think the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So substituting the values: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2=10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a ring and some double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data, let me think about each peak. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet and 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton (RCHO). The triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons. Wait, but aldehyde protons are typically
