Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Oh wait, I think I can break this down.

So, the potential has two parts: the first part is (1/2)kr², which looks like a standard harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions. The second part is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I remember that cos²θ can be expressed in terms of double angles using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. Maybe that will help in simplifying the potential?

Let me write that out. Substituting the identity, the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ].

Let me compute that. The second term becomes (3/2) * (1/2) kr² (1 + cos2θ) = (3/4)kr² (1 + cos2θ). So the total potential is:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + 3/4 kr² (1 + cos2θ) 

Wait, adding these together: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² is (5/4) kr², plus (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So,

V(r, θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should think about this potential in polar coordinates and see if it can be separated into radial and angular parts.

Wait, in polar coordinates, any potential that's separable into functions of r and θ would be helpful. Let's see: our potential is V(r,θ)= (1/2) kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ.

So, V(r,θ) can be written as kr² [ 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Alternatively, factoring out kr², so it's kr² times a function of θ. So
