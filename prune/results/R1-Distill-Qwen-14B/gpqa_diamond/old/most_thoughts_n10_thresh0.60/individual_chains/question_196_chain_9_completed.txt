Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in this oscillator. Alright, let's recall what I know about oscillators, both classical and relativistic.

In a classical harmonic oscillator, like a mass on a spring, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the force is F = -kx. The maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, the maximum kinetic energy would be when x is maximum, which is the amplitude A. So, in that case, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving for v_max gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). That would be the classical result. Looking at the options, option C looks like that, but wait, the problem is relativistic. So relativity probably changes things.

Relativistically, the situation is different because as the speed approaches the speed of light, the relativistic effects become significant. The kinetic energy in relativity isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, it's (gamma -1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy in the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy, but wait, wait. No, the total energy in the oscillator, from what I remember, should still satisfy energy conservation, but the form of the kinetic energy changes.

Wait, but hang on. In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus mc²? Or is it different? No, wait. For a classical oscillator, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, when the mass is moving at high speeds, energy isn't just the sum of kinetic and potential. So perhaps the total energy should be considered differently.

Wait, maybe the approach is similar but with relativistic expressions. The total energy E in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But for an oscillator, the total energy is a combination of kinetic and potential. So perhaps when the oscillator is at maximum displacement (x=A), all its energy is potential, and when it's at the equilibrium position (x=0), all energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². So, let me think.

At maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero because the mass is at rest (velocity is zero there). At the equilibrium point, x=0, velocity is maximum. So at that point, all the energy is kinetic: E = (gamma -1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v is the maximum speed v_max.

But wait, another approach is considering the total energy of the system. The total energy should be the sum of the rest mass energy and the potential energy at maximum amplitude. Because in the rest frame of the oscillator, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the case of a classical oscillator, the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², and that's the total mechanical energy. But in relativity, the total energy includes the rest mass energy plus the mechanical energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

Wait, perhaps. So at maximum displacement, the mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², and the total energy would be mc² plus that.

But then when the mass is moving at maximum speed (x=0), its kinetic energy is E_kinetic = (gamma -1) mc². And the potential energy is zero at x=0. So the total energy at that moment is (gamma -1) mc².

But the total energy must remain the same as at maximum displacement. So,

mc² + (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, that can't be right because if I rearrange that, (gamma -1) mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA² → gamma = 2 + (kA²)/(2mc²). Hmm, but that seems a bit off. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, no. At maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². But the total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. So E_total = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But when the mass is at x=0, moving at maximum speed, its potential energy is zero, and the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So E_total = (gamma -1) mc².

Setting them equal:

mc² + (1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

Wait, that can't be right because when you subtract mc² from both sides, you get (1/2)kA² = (gamma -2) mc². That would require gamma to be greater than 2, which is possible, but let's see if that leads us to the correct expression.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let's think again: the maximum potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E of the oscillator is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy E of the system is also equal to gamma mc². So when the mass is at maximum displacement, E = (1/2)kA². But wait, that might not include the rest mass energy. Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Wait, perhaps the rest mass energy mc² is separate from the oscillator's mechanical energy. So the total energy of the system would be E = mc² + (1/2)kA². When the mass is moving, its total energy is E = gamma mc². So:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA².

So, gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So,

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max)^2/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Hmm, that seems manageable. Let me write that as:

1/(sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But wait, this seems like it's missing a term. Because in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is sqrt(kA²/m), but in this approach, let's see what happens in the non-relativistic limit.

So when kA²/(2 m c²) is much less than 1, we can expand gamma as approximately 1 + (1/2)(kA²)/(m c²) * v². Wait, no. Wait, let me think about the non-relativistic case.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, (v_max)^2 = (k A²)/(m). So, plugging into our equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

But in non-relativistic case, v is small compared to c, so gamma ≈1. So,

gamma ≈1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ≈1 + ( (m (v_max)^2) )/(2 m c²) ) → 1 + (v_max²)/(2 c²). 

But in non-relativistic case, v_max² is much smaller than c², so gamma ≈1 + (v_max²)/(2 c²). But in reality, gamma is 1/(sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)), which in non-relativistic limit is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2 c²). So, yeah, that aligns.

So from our equation:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

But, gamma is also 1/(sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2)).

So, let's solve for v_max:

1/(sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2))) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me let x = v_max^2/c². Then,

1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c^2) as a term, let's say, alpha. So,

1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + alpha.

Then, squaring both sides:

1/(1 - x) = (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

(1 - x) = 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, wait, wait. No, let's re-express step by step.

1/sqrt(1 - x) = 1 + a.

Square both sides: 1/(1 - x) = (1 + a)^2.

Multiply both sides by (1 - x):

1 = (1 + a)^2 (1 - x).

Then,

(1 + a)^2 (1 - x) = 1.

Expanding,

(1 + 2a + a²)(1 - x) = 1.

But since alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c^2), and if the oscillator isn't moving at relativistic speeds, alpha would be small, but perhaps in general, we can proceed.

So,

1 + 2a + a² - (1 + 2a + a²) x = 1.

Subtract 1 from both sides:

2a + a² - (1 + 2a + a²) x = 0.

Let me factor:

(2a + a²) = (1 + 2a + a²) x.

So, x = (2a + a²) / (1 + 2a + a²).

Hmm, but let's consider a as (k A²)/(2 m c²). Let me plug that back in.

x = [2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ] / [1 + 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) + (k A²/(2 m c²))² ].

Simplify numerator:

2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) = (k A²)/(m c²).

So numerator becomes (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Denominator: 1 + (k A²)/(m c²) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4).

Wait, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial equation setup. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to equate the total mechanical energy (which is (1/2)kA²) to the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. Hmm, no. Because in relativity, the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So, when the mass is at x=0, it's moving at maximum speed, so all the energy is kinetic. But wait, the potential energy is zero at x=0, so the total energy is just kinetic.

Wait, but in the setup of the oscillator, the total mechanical energy is (1/2)kA². So, when the mass is at x=0, the kinetic energy is (gamma -1) mc². So,

(1/2)kA² = (gamma -1) mc².

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Which leads us back to the same equation as before. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) as alpha for simplicity.

So,

1 / sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = 1 + alpha.

Then, square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + alpha)^2.

Multiply both sides by (1 - v²/c²):

1 = (1 + alpha)^2 (1 - v²/c²).

Divide both sides by (1 + alpha)^2:

1/(1 + alpha)^2 = 1 - v^2/c².

So,

v^2/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Factor that expression:

v^2/c^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Compute numerator:

(1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2) -1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = (2 alpha + alpha^2) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator:

alpha(2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha) ).

But alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

Plugging back in:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ).

Simplify denominator:

sqrt(...) is in the numerator.

Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ) = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) [ 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Which is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) * [ (4 m c^2 + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ].

Wait, because 2 = 4 m c²/(2 m c²), right? Wait, perhaps I should factor differently.

Wait, 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) = [4 m c² + k A^2 ] / (2 m c^2).

So,

( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) * [ (4 m c² + k A^2 )/(2 m c^2) ) ] = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)] / [ (2 m c^2)(2 m c^2) ) ].

So,

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) / (4 m² c^4).

So, the numerator inside the square root is [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)] / (4 m² c^4).

Taking sqrt of that gives [ sqrt(k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)) ) ] / (2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c * [ sqrt( k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ) / (2 m c²) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Simplify numerator:

sqrt(k² A^4 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)) ) is sqrt(k^2 A^4) * sqrt(4 m c^2 + k A^2) = k A^2 sqrt(4 m c^2 + k A^2).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, sqrt(k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)) is A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ) .

Wait, let me think again. The numerator under the square root is:

k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2) = A² [k (4 m c² + k A^2)].

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor out 4 m c².

Wait, 4 m c² + k A^2 = 4 m c^2 ( 1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let me factor out k from the inside:

k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) = k A^2 [4 m c^2 + k A^2] = k A^2 [4 m c^2 (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) )) ] = 4 m c^2 k A^2 [1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ) ].

So, the square root becomes sqrt(4 m c^2 k A^2 [1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ) ]) ) = sqrt(4 m c^2) * sqrt(k A^2) * sqrt(1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ) ).

Which is 2 c sqrt(m) * A sqrt(k) * sqrt(1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2) ) ).

Wait, but perhaps I'm getting stuck in the algebra here. Let me try a different approach.

Let me factor out (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) from the expression for v_max.

Wait, another approach: perhaps look for the options given and see which one matches.

The options are:

A) v = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA²)/(2m))^2 )

B) v = c * sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

C) v = sqrt( kA²/m )

D) v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )^2 )

Hmm.

We thought that v_max is given by:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ( 2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ) )

Let me write this expression as:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha ), where alpha is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] ) / (1 + alpha )

Multiply numerator and denominator by 1/(1 + alpha):

Wait, no, perhaps square both sides to see it better.

v_max² / c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha )^2.

Hmm, let me write alpha as a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v²/c² = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2a + a²) / (1 + a)^2.

Which can be written as:

v²/c² = [ a (2 + a) ] / (1 + a)^2.

Let me factor the numerator:

a (2 + a) = a (a + 2) = a (a + 2) = same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator differently.

Wait, 2 + a = a +2 = (a +1) +1.

Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively,

numerator: 2a +a² =a² +2a = a(a +2).

Denominator: (1 +a)^2.

So,

v²/c² = [a(a +2)] / (1 + a)^2.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can manipulate this expression:

a(a + 2) = (a^2 + 2a) = (a^2 + 2a +1 ) -1 = (a+1)^2 -1.

So,

v²/c² = [ (a+1)^2 -1 ] / (a+1)^2 = 1 - [1/(a+1)^2 ].

So,

v²/c² = 1 - 1/(a+1)^2.

Which implies,

v/c = sqrt( 1 - 1/(a+1)^2 ).

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(a +1)^2 ).

Where a is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) +1 )^2 ).

Hmm, looking at the options:

Option D: v = c * sqrt(1 -1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ).

Yes, that's exactly what we have here. So the correct option is D.

Wait, let me check with our expression.

Yes, because a = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2), so a+1 = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2).

So,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 ), which is option D.

So the correct answer is D.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

In a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the total energy of the system is the sum of the rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. At maximum displacement \( x = A \), all the energy is potential, given by \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \). At equilibrium (\( x = 0 \)), all the energy is kinetic, and the total energy is expressed as \( (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor.

Equating the total energy at maximum displacement and equilibrium:

\[
\frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
\]

Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + \alpha)^2.
\]

Rearranging for \( v^2/c^2 \):

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):

\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Verifying the other options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because the denominator inside the square root does not match the derived expression.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the term inside the square root does not align with the relativistic energy conservation.
- **Option C**: Incorrect as it represents the classical result, ignoring relativistic effects.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
