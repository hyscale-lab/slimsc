Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. Alright, the question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer, same direction as the light beam. But light is already moving through the glass. I remember that when a medium is moving, the speed of light in that medium can be affected. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused between the refractive index and the velocity of the medium itself.

In a vacuum, light speed is c=1, but in a medium like glass, it's c/n. So normally, in the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light would be 1/n. But now the glass is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed?

I think this is a problem involving the addition of velocities, perhaps using special relativity. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add them normally. But wait, in this case, the velocity v is probably much smaller than c. But the problem doesn't specify; perhaps it expects us to consider that v is not negligible, so we can't ignore relativistic effects.

Wait, but light speed is always c in any inertial frame, right? That's Einstein's postulate. But wait, no. Wait, that's only in vacuum. Or does it apply regardless of the medium? Hmm, that's where I get a bit stuck.

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium is less than c. So in the glass's rest frame, the speed is c/n. But when the glass is moving, does the speed relative to the lab frame change?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the glass as a moving medium, but the light speed inside is still c/n, but the frame where the glass is moving could affect the observed speed. Wait, but the observer is in the lab, and the glass is moving towards them. So the situation is that the glass is moving, and the light is moving through the glass.

Wait, but the light is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observerâ€”so if the glass is moving
