Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and understand what's being asked.

The problem says that an organic chemist performed two reactions, I and II. Then, after they're done, the products from both reactions are combined and run on two different HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about how many peaks the chemist would observe in each chromatogram.

Let me break down each reaction.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used to reduce carbonyl groups. So, the starting compound is a ketone. Hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on the third carbon of a six-carbon chain. The structure would be CH3-CH2-CO-OCH3-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5-methoxyhexan-3-one—so hexan-3-one implies the carbonyl is at position 3, and the methoxy group is at position 5.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO something. Let me draw it. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3?

Wait, maybe better to write as:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=O (since it's 3-one)
4: CH2-
5: OCH3 attached to a CH2?
Wait, no, wait. 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

The structure is CH2CH2–CO–CH2–OCH3–CH2? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as:

CH2CH2–CO–CH2–CH2–OCH3? No, wait, the substituents.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think again. Hexan-3-one is (S)-configured, so the structure is:

The carbonyl is at position 3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2
