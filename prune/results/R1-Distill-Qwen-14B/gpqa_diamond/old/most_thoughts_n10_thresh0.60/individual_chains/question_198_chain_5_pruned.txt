Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to understand what's being asked.

The question is about the percentage of blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in a solution. The solution contains Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 10^-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt thiocyanato complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. I need to find what percentage of the Co species are the blue dithiocyanato complexes.

Hmm, I remember that stability constants (formation constants) tell us how stable a complex is. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the complexes with higher β will form more in solution.

So, the cobalt can form various complexes with thiocyanate. The complexes are Co(SCN)_n^2- or something like that. The possible complexes are [Co(SCN)]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-. Wait, I'm not sure about the charges exactly, but I think the number of SCN ligands increases, changing the charge as they form more complexes.

The problem is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, which one is blue? I think the [Co(SCN)_2] is blue, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I remember that the [Co(SCN)_6]^3- is a different color, but maybe that's not relevant here. Since the question is about dithiocyanato, meaning two SCN ligands, so [Co(SCN)_2] is the complex in question.

We need to calculate the mole fraction of this complex among all the Co species present.

So the approach is to model all the possible complexes, calculate their concentrations, and then find the percentage of the blue one.

Let me think about the possible species. The metal ion (Co^2+) can form complexes with SCN^- up to four ligands, perhaps. Because the β4 is given as 16. So the complexes are:

Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} ?

Wait, the charge would be 2+ minus n times (−
