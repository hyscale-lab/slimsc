Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to find the correct 1H NMR data from the options provided.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the structure is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, two substituents on the benzene. The total carbon count is 8. Benzene itself has 6 carbons, so the two substituents must add 2 carbons in total. But wait, waitâ€”each substituent is probably a group that's attached to the ring. So maybe each substituent is one carbon? Or perhaps one substituent is two carbons and the other is none? Wait, no, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents, each adding their own carbons.

Wait, the benzene ring has 6 carbons; the substituents add two more. So each substituent must be one carbon each, right? Because 6 + 2 = 8. So each substituent is a single carbon group attached to the ring.

But wait, what are the substituents? The IR spectrum tells me there's a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic halogen bond (like an aryl-halide, like Cl, Br attached to the ring). So the two substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

So possible substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, maybe an acyl group) and a halogen (like Cl, Br).

Wait, but a carbonyl group as a substituent would be something like a ketone, like a carbonyl attached directly to the ring. So for instance, maybe a benzene ring with a ketone group and a halogen.

Wait, the substituent could be a carbonyl group, like a carbonyl is part of the substituent, such as an acetyl group (CH2CO-), but that would add more than one carbon. Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, the benzene ring has 6 carbons. The substituents must add 2 more, making 8 total. So substit
