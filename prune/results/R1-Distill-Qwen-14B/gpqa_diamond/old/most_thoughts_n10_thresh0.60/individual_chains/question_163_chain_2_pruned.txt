Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution, and we need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. Also, we have to determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, right? So when you add a strong acid to it, they should react. The acid is monobasic, so it has one H+ ion per molecule. For example, like HCl or HNO3.

First, I think I need to write the chemical equation for the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Fe(OH)3 is a base, so it should react with the acid to produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and maybe some salt. The acid is monobasic, so the product would be Fe salt with the acid's anion.

So, let's write the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ with three OH^- groups. The acid HX (where X is the anion) would donate H+ ions. So when Fe(OH)3 reacts with HX, it should produce FeX3 and water. Wait, but since HX is a strong acid, it will fully dissociate.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, right? Because it's a metal hydroxide. So when it reacts with a strong acid, it should react completely. The reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ (from the acid) to dissolve. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So, the acid needed is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but first I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. Let me find the molar mass of Fe(OH)3.

Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16.00, and Hydrogen is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(1.008 +16.00) = 55.85 +3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 0.0009358 mol. Let me calculate that: 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 9.358e-4 mol.

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 ≈ 0.0009358 mol.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ (from the acid), the moles of H+ needed = 0.0009358 *3 = 0.0028074 mol.

The acid is 0.1 M, meaning 0.1 moles per liter. To find the volume of acid needed, moles = Molarity * Volume(L). So Volume (L) = moles / Molarity.

So, Volume = 0.0028074 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.028074 L = 28.074 cm³. Wait, because 1 L is 1000 cm
