Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the Schrödinger cat state and calculating non-Gaussianity using relative entropy. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem gives me a state |ψ> which is a superposition of two coherent states: cos(phi)|alpha> and sin(phi)|-alpha>, normalized by N. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

I remember that coherent states are Gaussian states, so the superposition of coherent states can lead to a non-Gaussian state, which is what the Schrödinger cat state is about. Non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-classical a state is because Gaussian states are easier to handle in quantum optics and can be described by just a few parameters like mean photon number and photon number distribution variance.

The question is asking for the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state |ψ> and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So, this del_b is the relative entropy between the two states.

Wait, but how do I compute this? I think the relative entropy of quantum states is also called the quantum relative entropy. It's a measure of how different two quantum states are. The formula for relative entropy is S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho (ln rho - ln tau)). So, in this case, del_b would be S(rho || tau) - S(tau || rho), but no, wait, the way it's written, it's trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau). Oh, right, that's exactly the same as the relative entropy S(rho || tau) if we assume tau is the reference. Wait, no. Wait, the relative entropy is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the problem defines del_b as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So that's different. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit.

But, wait, perhaps the reference state tau is the maximally mixed state? Or maybe it's the state that rho would reduce to if it were Gaussian. I'm not exactly sure about the specifics of the reference state here. The problem statement says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So the reference is some Gaussian state, possibly the closest Gaussian approximation to rho.

Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe the reference state tau is the Gaussian state that minimizes the relative entropy with rho. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as rho. Oh, wait, in that case, for a squeezed state or coherent state, the first and second moments are the same? Or maybe not. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the reference Gaussian state is the state that is the 'closest' Gaussian approximation to rho. But I'm not sure. Wait, maybe the problem is using a specific reference Gaussian state, like the
