Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question starts by talking about a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3. The NMR data is given, and the question is about the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product.

First, I need to visualize the structures involved. Let's break it down.

1. The dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. Dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride. Since the starting alkene is cis, the dehydration would form a bicyclic structure perhaps? Or maybe the anhydride is a cyclic one. The NMR of the anhydride shows a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR. That's a high ppm, which usually indicates something deshielded, like an aromatic proton or maybe a conjugated carbonyl group. But in an anhydride, maybe it's an alpha proton adjacent to two carbonyl groups?

Wait, but the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Let me think about what carbons those could be. 137 ppm is probably a carbon next to electron-withdrawing groups, maybe a carbonyl or a conjugated double bond. 165 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, so that would be from the anhydride's carbonyl groups. The 137 ppm could be a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl, like in a conjugated system.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests all the protons in that environment are equivalent. So maybe it's a pair of equivalent protons, like two identical protons on a symmetric structure. Maybe they're part of a cyclic structure. For example, if the anhydride is cyclic, like a five-membered ring, perhaps a bicyclic structure. Alternatively, if the original acid had a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form an anhydride that has a ring.

Wait, another thought: the dicarboxylic acid has a cis-alkene. So when it dehydrates, maybe it forms a cyclic anhydride. For example, maleic anhydride is a cyclic anhydride from maleic acid (which is a diacid with a cis double bond). Maleic anhydride would have two carbonyl groups and a conjugated double bond. In its 1H NMR, the protons on the double bond would be deshielded. But wait, maleic anhydride's structure is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Its protons on the double bond are actually equivalent and as a pair would show up as a singlet? Or maybe as a doublet. Hmm.

Wait, but the
