Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because these synthesis pathways can get tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and ending with a final product, which is one of the four options. I'll need to figure out each step and see where it leads.

First, the initial reaction: benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene typically uses a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. So this is a nitration reaction. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution here. Nitration adds a nitro group. Where does it go? Benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group can go into any position, but in the case of benzene, the ring is symmetric, so product 1 would be nitrobenzene. Wait, no, wait. Nitration of benzene gives nitrobenzene, but actually, benzene is a symmetric molecule, so the nitro group can be in any position. Oh, but wait, maybe the first product is nitrobenzene, but wait, maybe it's a meta director or para director. Oh wait, nitro is a meta director, but in the first step, it's just benzene, so the product is nitrobenzene. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Next step: product 1 is treated with Br2 and Fe. Oh right, that's a bromination reaction. Wait,
