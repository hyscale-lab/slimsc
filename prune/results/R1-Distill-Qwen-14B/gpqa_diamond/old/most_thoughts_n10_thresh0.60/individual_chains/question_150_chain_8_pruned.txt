Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of NMR and reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The question gives me a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let me think about the possible structures. The formula has 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen. Oh, wait, wait. Wait, the molecular formula is C8H9NO. So, I should calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So, (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2= 10/2=5. Five degrees of unsaturation—so that could be five rings, or one ring and two double bonds, or a combination like that. But more likely, maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4 degrees) and a double bond (another degree) plus maybe an amine or something with the N and O.

Looking at the NMR data: the peaks are at 9.72 (t, 1H), 6.98 (d, 2H), 6.51 (d, 2H), 6.27 (bs, 2H), 3.66 (d, 2H). Let me break this down.

First, the peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet integrating for one proton. That's a pretty high chemical shift—could be an aldehyde proton. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm and are deshielded. So maybe that's an aldehyde group. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton next to an electron-withdrawing group, but that's less likely. Let's tentatively say it's an aldehyde.

Then, 6.98 and 6.51 are doublets each integrating for two protons. Those look like aromatic protons. Maybe adjacent to substituents. The 6.98 is a doublet, perhaps para-substituted on a benzene ring. Wait, but each is a doublet—so perhaps two sets of doublets, each with two pro
