Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the expectation value is like the average outcome you'd expect from many measurements of an observable on a system in a given state.

The problem states that the spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I should check if that's a valid state. The coefficients need to satisfy the normalization condition, so the sum of the squares should be 1. Let me calculate: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) which is 0.75. Adding them gives 1, so that's good. The state is normalized.

The operator given is 10σz + 5σx. I think σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. The expectation value of the entire operator would be the sum of the expectation values of each term. So I can compute each part separately and then combine them.

First, let's find the expectation value of σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that should make things easier. The expectation value of σz is ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩.

The state ψ is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. So when I apply σz to each component, |↑⟩ becomes +1 * |↑⟩, and |↓⟩ becomes -1 * |↓⟩. So the operator acting on ψ gives σzψ = 0.5*(1)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*(-1)|↓⟩.

Now, the inner product ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ is (0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|) * (0.5 |↑⟩ - (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩).

Breaking this down, the terms are:
0.5 * 0.5 * (⟨↑|↑⟩) → 0.25 * 1 = 0.25
0.5 * (-sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑|↓⟩ → since they're orthogonal, that's 0.
(-sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) * ⟨↓|↑⟩ → again, zero.
(sqrt(3)/2) * (-sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↓|↓⟩ → ( -3/4 ) * 1 = -0.75.

Adding all these terms: 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So expectation value of σz is -0.5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, wait, no, because when I calculate ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩, I have the state written as ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. Then σzψ = a σz|↑⟩ + b σz|↓⟩ = a*(+1)|↑⟩ + b*(-1)|↓⟩.

So, ⟨ψ|σz|ψ⟩ becomes (a*)⟨↑| + (b*)⟨↓|) [a|↑⟩ - b|↓⟩ ].

Which is a* a ⟨↑|↑⟩ + a* (-b) ⟨↑|↓⟩ + (b*) a ⟨↓|↑⟩ + (b*) (-b) ⟨↓|↓⟩.

Since ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0, and a and b are real (I think?), so a* = a, b* = b.

So terms become a^2 (1) + (- a b)(0) + (a b)(0) + (b^2)(-1) → a^2 - b^2.

Wait, that's a different approach. So, for my state, a is 0.5, b is sqrt
