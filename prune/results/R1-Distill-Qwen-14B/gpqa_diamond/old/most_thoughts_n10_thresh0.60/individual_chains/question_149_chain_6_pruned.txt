Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that I have a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly like what's expected except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H, which is what we expect. So, maybe they’re splitting each other or something else. But the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the reason. So, it's not like they're splitting each other because the shifts are similar, and the integrals add up to one. Wait, if it's spin-spin coupling, you usually see a doublet or a triplet or something. But the question says we can rule that out based on the coupling pattern, so maybe it's not that. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, which matches the expected molecule. So, the same molecular weight but two different peaks. Hmm, maybe they're isomers or something.

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different. But the question says the mass is consistent with the expected compound, so the mass is same. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have the same molecular weight and same NMR shifts because they are mirror images. Wait, but in NMR, if you have enantiomers, in a racemic mixture, each proton environment would be same, but wait—what about the NMR? If it's a chiral compound, you’d get a single peak for each proton because the protons are equivalent in the two enantiomers. So the NMR would look the same as the pure compound, right? But the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So maybe this isn't about enantiomers. Unless... maybe the coupling is something else. Wait, but the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So maybe it's not B.

Option C: Double coupling during an amide bond formation. Double coupling? Wait, when forming an amide bond during synthesis, sometimes if the reaction doesn
