Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about a meson resonance called X. They're asking what the mean decay distance is. They gave me some numbers: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that the mean decay distance has something to do with the lifetime of the particle and how fast it's moving when it decays. Oh right, the formula I think is something like c multiplied by the lifetime (τ), but then multiplied by the velocity (βc) to get the distance. So the mean decay length L is βγ c τ. Wait, but wait, isn't τ related to the particle's width? Oh yeah, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that the lifetime is inversely proportional to the width. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But I'm probably mixing up some factors here.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I need to find the lifetime τ. The width Γ is given, which is the total decay width. The uncertainty principle says ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ, so Γ * τ ≈ ħ. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I think Γ is the total decay width, and the relation is Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. That makes sense.

Next, I need to find the velocity β of the meson. Since the meson is moving, its energy E is given as 8 GeV. The mass is 1.2 GeV. So, the energy E is the total energy, which is γ m c². Wait, yes: E = γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). But since E is in GeV and m is in GeV/c², let me make sure the units work. Oh right, c is a big factor, so I should probably express everything in natural units to make the math easier.

Wait, but maybe I can compute β using the relativistic energy formulas. The energy E is the total energy, which is γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But since E and m are both given in GeV, let's see. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between energy, mass
