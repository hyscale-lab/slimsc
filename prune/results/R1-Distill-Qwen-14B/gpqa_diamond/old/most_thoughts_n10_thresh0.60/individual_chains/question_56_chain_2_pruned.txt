Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom transitions. Hmm, I remember that when an electron transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon, and the selection rules determine which transitions are allowed.

The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. I think dipole transitions are governed by the electric dipole selection rules. So, what are those rules again? Oh right, for the hydrogen atom, the selection rules are Δn = ±1, ±2, etc., but typically only Δn = ±1 is considered for dipole transitions. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the standard dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. And for hydrogen, when considering electron transitions, the transitions are allowed only if the orbital quantum number changes by ±1. But wait, some sources say that for hydrogen, the selection rules are a bit different because of the specific structure of the atomic orbitals.

Wait, the initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, which is n=1, l=0, m=0. So the initial and final states both have l=0. But wait, according to the selection rules, for a dipole transition, Δl must be ±1. So from l=0, the possible transitions would be to l=1. But wait, the final state here is l=0. So how can that be?

Oh wait, maybe I'm thinking of the wrong selection rules. Let me double-check. In the hydrogen atom, the transition from a state with angular momentum l to another state is only allowed if the photon's angular momentum (which is ±1) changes the state's m by 0, ±1. But for l, the selection rule is Δl = ±1. So from l=0, you can only go to l=1, right? Because going to l=0 would mean Δl=0, which isn't allowed for dipole transitions.

Wait, but the problem states that it's a two-dipole transition. So maybe it's a two-photon process, but each photon still follows the dipole selection rules. So the initial state |3,0,0> must transition to an intermediate state,
