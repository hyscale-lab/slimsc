Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable, P, and getting a specific outcome, which is 0. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the probabilities of their outcomes are related to the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, let me write that down. So the state vector, I think, is a column vector like this:

|ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

But wait, are these normalized? I should check if the state is normalized because probabilities depend on that. To normalize, the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the components should be 1.

Let me calculate the norm squared. (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. Oh, so the vector has a norm squared of 6. That means the state isn't normalized. So I guess I need to normalize it first. Or maybe the problem assumes it's already normalized? Hmm, but wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about it, so perhaps I have to proceed assuming the given vector is the state, and perhaps the probabilities will take that into account.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must be normalized because the total probability must sum to 1. So maybe I should first normalize the vector. Let me think: the norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) times the given vector. So the state vector |ψ> is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Wait, but the problem says "the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix having elements (-1, 2, 1)." Oh, but maybe it's not normalized, but perhaps the probabilities are calculated without considering normalization. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized, so perhaps the given vector is already normalized. Let me check again: 1^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Sum is 6, so no, it isn't normalized. So I'll have to normalize it before proceeding. Otherwise, the probabilities I calculate would be wrong.

So first step
