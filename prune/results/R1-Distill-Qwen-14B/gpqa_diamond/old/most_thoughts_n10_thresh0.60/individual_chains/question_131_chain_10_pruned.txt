Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: A dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene was dehydrated to form an anhydride. This anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm in its 1H NMR and two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm in the 13C NMR. Then this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products, major and minor, both with the formula C13H16O3.

The NOESY spectra show a cross-peak in the major product but not in the minor. The question is about which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product's NMR.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, the initial compound is a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. When such a compound is dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would depend on the starting acid. Since it's a cis-alkene, the dehydration would form a bicyclic anhydride perhaps, but wait, maybe it's a simple annulation. Alternatively, perhaps the acid is something like maleic acid (though that's more of a trans diacid). Wait, no, the problem says cis-alkene, so the diacid would have the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons with the double bond in cis configuration.

Wait, let me think. If the dicarboxylic acid is cis, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that's not a diene. Oh, wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene, meaning the structure is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's a single bond. Wait, no, wait: a cis-alkene would be two double bonds? No, no, a diacid with a double bond in the chain. So maybe HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH isn't right because that's single bonds. Wait, perhaps HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH is a straight chain, but that doesn't have a double bond. Oh, wait, no, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene, so perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's not a diene either. Wait no, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH, but that's butanedioic acid, which is succinic acid. But that doesn't have a double bond. Oh, wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH with a double bond somewhere else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the diacid has a cis-alkene. So maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-COOH? No, that would be a diacid with a double bond in
