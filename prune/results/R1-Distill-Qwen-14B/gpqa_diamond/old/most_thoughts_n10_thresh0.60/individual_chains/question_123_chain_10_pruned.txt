Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially in special relativity, things like time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me think.

The problem says that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is coming towards them. The question is asking how much distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem mentions that both the ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames. That probably means we're only dealing with classical mechanics here, like simple relative velocity, and not relativity effects because the speed is a significant fraction of the speed of light. Oh wait, 60,000 km/s is way less than the speed of light, right? Wait, the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 20% of that. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be non-negligible.

But wait, the problem says to ignore gravity and other movements, so maybe it's just about relative motion. Let me approach this step by step.

In the ejecta's frame (let's call this frame S'), the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km
