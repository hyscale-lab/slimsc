Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of product particles in a decay process. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the problem says that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino, right? The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I remember that neutrinos are super light, almost massless, but I guess I have to consider their rest mass too. Wait, but the problem doesn't give a rest mass for the neutrino. Oh, right! In particle physics, neutrinos are usually considered to have negligible mass compared to other particles. So maybe I can approximate their rest mass as zero. That should simplify things a bit.

The question is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles, which are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum should still be zero because of conservation of momentum. So that means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, the magnitude of the muon's momentum (p_mu) would equal the magnitude of the neutrino's momentum (p_nu), but their directions are opposite. That makes sense.

I also know that energy is conserved. The total energy before the decay is just the rest energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So that's E_initial = m_pi * c². But after the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy plus its rest mass energy, which is almost zero. So, E_nu ≈ K_nu + m_nu c², but m_nu is almost zero, so E_nu ≈ K_nu.

The muon's energy is E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c².

So, putting it all together, conservation of energy gives:

m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu
=> m_pi c² = (K_mu + m_mu c²) + K_nu.

But wait, m_pi c² is the total energy before decay, which is equal
