Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Let me think through this step by step. Hmm, the question gives me a lot of data, so I need to parse it carefully.

First, the problem states that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But I'm not sure if the masses are directly relevant here; maybe it's more about the elemental abundances. Let me see.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW (equivalent width) method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The values provided are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I think I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, the question is asking for (n_Si,1 / n_Si,2) or (n_Si in Star1) divided by (n_Si in Star2)?

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7

Wait, wait. I remember that the notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y, relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. Or wait, another way: [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. So, for example, if [Fe/H] is 0, then nFe/nH is the same as in the Sun.

Let me write down the Sun's abundances:

For the Sun:
- nFe/nH = 10^( (7.5 -12) ) = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly, nMg/nH = 10^(7 -12) = 10^(-5)

Wait, wait, no. Wait: The notation says 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals a value. So, for example, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Same for Mg: 7.5? Wait, no, the problem says for the Sun, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5, so log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5-12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, nMg/nH is 10^(-5), because 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Now, the problem gives [Fe/H]_1 = 0, which means Star_1 has the same Fe/H ratio as the Sun. Wait, no, [Fe/H] is log10(nFe/nH) - log10(nFe/nH)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 =0 implies that Star_1 has the same Fe/H
