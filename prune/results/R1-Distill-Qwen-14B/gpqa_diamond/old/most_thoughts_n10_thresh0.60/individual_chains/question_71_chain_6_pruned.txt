Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's see. I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors, like the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσd²) ) )^(1/4), but wait, maybe a simpler version is T = T_eff * sqrt(R / (2a)), where a is the distance from the star. Or was it another formula? Oh wait, the inverse square law for flux. So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance because the flux decreases with the square of the distance. So flux F is proportional to L/(4πa²), and the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to the fourth root of (F), so T ~ (1/a)^(1/2). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a).

Wait, but wait, the problem states that all planets have the same albedo. Oh, right, because albedo affects the absorbed energy. Since albedo is the same, that part cancels out in the ratio. So we just need to find the ratio of their distances, then take the square root and invert it.

The planets are in orbital resonance, and their periods are in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 P2=2P1, Planet_3 P3=2.5P1, Planet_4 P4=3.5P1, Planet_5 P5=5P1. 

But Kepler's third law says that (P^2)/(a^3) is constant for planets around the same star. So a^3 is proportional to P^2. So a is proportional to P^(2/3). 

So the distance of each planet from the star is proportional to their period raised to the power of 2/3. 

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. The equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), which is (a)^(1/2). So T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^(1/2), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

Wait, wait, let me clarify: T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T4 = k / sqrt(a4), T2 = k / sqrt(a2). So T4/T2 = sqrt(a2/a4). Or, because a is proportional to P^(2/3), so a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3). 

Wait, let me structure this step by step.

1. From Kepler's law, a³ ∝ P² → a ∝ P^(2/3).

2. So a4 / a2 = (P4 / P2)^(2/3).

3. T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) → T4 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a4).

Wait, let's substitute a4 and a2.

a4 = k * P4^(2/3)

a2 = k * P2^(2/3)

So a4 / a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3)

Therefore, a2/a4 = (P2
