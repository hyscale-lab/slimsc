Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles they emit. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

The question is about a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. I remember that Pauli statistics have something to do with the total wavefunction being antisymmetric, which includes spin, orbital angular momentum, and other quantum numbers. 

The problem states that the Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, wait, T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So this is a condition they must satisfy for the NN state.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So we're looking at what's allowed in terms of the emitted particle's angular momentum states. The options are different transitions, and I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted.

I think I should start by recalling some basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is given as (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0: 2S+1 = 1 → S=0 (since 2*0+1=1). The L is S, which is 0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, and J=0 since J = L + S = 0+0=0.

When the NN emits a particle X, the total angular momentum and parity must be conserved. Also, the parity of the system changes based on the parity of the emitted particle and the orbital angular momentum involved.

Let me think about parity first. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number. The initial parity for 1S0 is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the parity of the system after emission is the product of the parity of the emitted particle and the parity change due to the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Wait, more precisely, the parity of the emitted particle X is intrinsic, given as -1. The orbital angular momentum state of X (like S, P, D...) will affect the parity. The parity of the process would be the product of the intrinsic parity of X and (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the emitted particle.

Wait, no. Actually, the parity conservation requires that the parity before (initial) must equal the parity after (final) times the parity of the emitted particle. Or something along those lines. Let me get that straight.

In the initial state, the parity is P_initial = (-1)^L_initial. Since the initial state is 1S0, L_initial is 0, so P_initial = 1.

After emission, the final NN state's parity is P_final = (-1)^L_final. The emitted particle X has a parity of P_X. The total parity after emission includes the parity of the emitted particle. The process must conserve parity, so P_initial = P_final * P_X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number associated with the emission. Oh wait, no, I think the orbital angular momentum of X affects the parity. So the overall parity after emission is P_final_total = P_final_NN * P_X * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle.

Wait, but the parity of the initial state is equal to the parity of the final state (NN) multiplied by the parity of the emitted particle and the factor from the orbital angular momentum. So:

P_initial = P_final_NN * P_X * (-1)^l

Because the process must conserve parity. Since P_initial is 1, and P_X is given as -1, we can write:

1 = P_final_NN * (-1) * (-1)^l

So rearranging, P_final_NN = (-1)^{l+1}

Wait, because 1 = P_final_NN * (-1) * (-1)^l → P_final_NN = (-1)^{l+1}.

But wait, the parity of the NN system after emission is also determined by its L. So P_final_NN = (-1)^{L_final}.

So combining both expressions:

(-1)^{L_final} = (-1)^{l+1}

Which implies that L_final = l +1 mod 2.

So L_final ≡ l +1 (mod 2). That gives a condition between the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle (l) and the final orbital angular momentum of the NN system (L_final).

But wait, the orbital angular momentum L_final of the NN is part of their term symbol. Each option gives the final term of the NN state, like 7D1 means L=2 (since D is L=2), 3S1 → L=0
