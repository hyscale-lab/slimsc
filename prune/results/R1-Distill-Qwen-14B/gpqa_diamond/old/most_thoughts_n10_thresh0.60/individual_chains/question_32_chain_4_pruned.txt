Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of RHIC when the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, and the energy given would be their kinetic energy, but wait, sometimes these problems might refer to total energy. I need to clarify that.

The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh, wait, lithium has an atomic number of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, that makes it Li-6. Because Li typically has isotopes, like Li-6 and Li-7. So the mass number A is 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

The problem says the speed is 0.96c. I think I need to calculate the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic energy, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, it's usually the kinetic energy per particle, but sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm, I need to figure that out.

Wait, the question says "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c". So I think they're referring to the total energy, because the speed is a relativistic speed, so the gamma factor comes into play.

So the formula for total energy is gamma * m0c². But wait, the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) m0c². But the question isn't specifying whether it's kinetic or total. Let me read the question again. It says, "the energy of the RHIC so that the speed is 0.96c". I think RHIC accelerates the ions to a certain energy, which is their kinetic energy. So perhaps the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, the energy refers to the total energy. But I'll proceed step by step.

First, I need to find the total energy. To do that, I can compute gamma when v is 0.96c.

Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's calculate that.

v = 0.96c, so v²/c² = (0.96)^2 = 0.9216.
