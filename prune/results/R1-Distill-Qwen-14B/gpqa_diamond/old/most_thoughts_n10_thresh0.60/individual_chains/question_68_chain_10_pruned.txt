Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, it's about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equals gamma times S_z. Right, so mu = γSz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and then it's switched off and turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment.

Wait, I remember that when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the time evolution of the system. So initially, when the field is along Z, the Hamiltonian is H_initial = -μ·B, which for spin-1/2 would be proportional to S_z. Then, when the field is switched to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -μ·B', where B' is along Y. But wait, the particle's magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma * S_z. Wait, that's interesting. Oh, wait no—wait, mu is the magnetic moment vector, so mu = gamma * S, right? Because S is the spin vector, so S has components S_x, S_y, S_z. So mu would be gamma times the spin vector.

Wait, wait, the problem says mu equals gamma * S_z. Oh, that's a bit confusing. So the magnetic moment is only in the z-direction? Or is that a typo maybe? Because usually, magnetic moments are proportional to the spin vector. Hmm, but the question says mu = gamma * S_z. So that suggests that the magnetic moment is only along z. But then when the field is turned on along Y, the interaction would be a bit different. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's see.

Wait, the initial state is when the magnetic field is along +Z. So the particle's moment is aligned with the field. So the spin is up in the Z direction. Then, when the field is turned off (so B is zero), and then another field is turned on along Y. But wait, the problem says both fields have the same magnitude B. So I think the initial state is with the field along Z, then it's turned off (so the magnetic field is zero for an instant?), and then a new field along Y is applied. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact setup, but perhaps the
