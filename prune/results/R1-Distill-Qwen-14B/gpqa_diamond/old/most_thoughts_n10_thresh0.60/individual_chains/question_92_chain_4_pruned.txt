Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, how exactly do I calculate that? 

The molecule given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let me try to visualize the structure. It looks like it's a diene with multiple branches. Let's count the number of each atom. Carbon and hydrogen, of course.

So, the formula would be something like CxHy. Let me count the carbons first. Each (CH3)2 group has two CH3, so that's 2 carbons per group. Let me see, the structure is:

(CH3)2C=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2.

Wait, no, I should break it down. The main chain might be longer. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to count each part.

Wait, maybe I should just count each carbon and hydrogen. Let's see:

Each (CH3)2 group contributes 2 CH3, so 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens per group. Wait, but each (CH3)2 is a substituent attached to a carbon. Let me try to count each part step by step.

Wait, the molecule is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Let's parse this:

- The first part: (CH3)2C=CH- : So that's a substituent where the central carbon is attached to two CH3 groups and a double bond. So that's one carbon (the double-bonded one) with two CH3 groups attached. So for this part, each (CH3)2 is two carbons and six hydrogens? Wait, each CH3 is 3 H, so two CH3s give 6 H. So the (CH3)2C=CH- part has 3 carbons (the central C, two from CH3 groups, and the CH part). Wait, no: (CH3)2C is a group where the central C has two CH3 and one more bond (the C=CH-). So that's 3 carbons: the central one, plus two from each CH3? No
