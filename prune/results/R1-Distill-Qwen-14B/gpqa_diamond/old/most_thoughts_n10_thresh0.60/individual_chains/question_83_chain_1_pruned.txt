Okay, so I have this chemistry problem about titration, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving two pH values.

Hmm, right. I remember that when you dilute a weak acid, its concentration decreases, which affects the pH. Also, during titration, the pH changes based on how much NaOH you've added. 

First, let me outline the steps. 

1. **Dilution of Acetic Acid**: The initial concentration is 0.05 M, and we add the same volume of water, so the volume doubles. Using the dilution formula, the new concentration of acetic acid will be half of 0.05 M, which is 0.025 M. Wait, because when you mix equal volumes, the concentration becomes half. So yes, 0.025 M.

2. **Titration Setup**: The NaOH is 0.1 M. The volume needed for equivalence can be calculated using the formula M1V1 = M2V2. The reaction is between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH (a strong base). 

   So, moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity × Volume (in liters) = 0.025 M × 0.02 L = 0.0005 mol. Oh wait, because 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. 

   Moles of NaOH needed for equivalence: same as moles of acetic acid. So, 0.0005 mol / 0.1 M = 0.005 L, which is 5 cm³. Wait, is that right? Wait, 0.1 M NaOH, so 0.0005 / 0.1 = 0.005 L = 5 mL. So equivalence point is
