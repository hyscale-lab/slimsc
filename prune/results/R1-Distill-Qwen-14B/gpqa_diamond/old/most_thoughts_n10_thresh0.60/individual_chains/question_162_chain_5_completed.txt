Okay, so I've got this question about general relativity or differential geometry, I'm not entirely sure. The question gives me a metric and asks about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, let's break this down.

The metric is given as ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like a two-dimensional metric because I only see dx and dy. Oh, right, so this is a 2-dimensional spacetime, maybe? Or is it? Well, the question is about a pseudosphere, which is a two-dimensional surface in some space. 

Wait, no. Wait, pseudosphere usually refers to a surface with constant negative curvature, but I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, in the context of general relativity, a pseudosphere might be a 2-sphere with an imaginary radius or something like that. Or perhaps it's a typo, and they mean a sphere. But the question specifically says pseudosphere, so I'll go with that.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. But the metric given is in terms of x and y, not spherical coordinates. Maybe that's a clue. Let me think.

So, the metric in 2D could be written as ds² = g_{xx} dx² + g_{yy} dy², assuming it's diagonal. Here, g_{xx} and g_{yy} are both 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the metric is conformally flat, right? Because it's a multiple of the flat metric (dx² + dy²). 

If the metric is conformally flat, then the area element would be sqrt(det(g)) dx dy. The determinant of g, which is diagonal, is (32/(4 - x² - y²))². So the square root is (32/(4 - x² - y²)). So the area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

Wait, but what's the region where this metric is defined? The denominator is 4 - x² - y². To avoid singularities, the denominator should not be zero. So 4 - x² - y² > 0, which implies x² + y² <4. So the domain is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. Because 4 is 2 squared.

So the area would be the integral over this region of the area element. The area element is (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. So the area A is the double integral over x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me switch to polar coordinates because the region is a circle and the integrand depends on r². So let's set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. Then dx dy becomes r dr dθ. The integrand becomes 32/(4 - r²) * r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes the integral from θ=0 to 2π, and r=0 to 2. The area is ∫ (from 0 to 2π) ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr dθ.

Let me compute the r integral first. Let me make a substitution: let u = 4 - r², then du/dr = -2r, so r dr = -du/2. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So the integral becomes ∫ [32 r / u ] dr = ∫ [32 (-du/2) / u ].

Wait, let's compute the inner integral ∫ (32 r)/(4 - r²) dr from 0 to2.

Let me compute ∫ 32 r/(4 - r²) dr. Let u = 4 - r², du = -2r dr, so r dr = -du/2.

So:

32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [ ( - du/2 ) / u ] = -32/2 ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ∫ (1/u) du = -16 ln|u| + C.

The limits as r goes from 0 to 2. When r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=0. So evaluating from u=4 to u=0:

-16 [ln(0) - ln(4)] = -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = -16 (-infty - ln4) → this is getting tricky because ln(0) is negative infinity.

Wait, let me see. The integral from r=0 to r=2 is:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = -16 [ ln(u) ] from u=4 to u=0.

So it's -16 [ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is -infinity, so it becomes -16 [ (-infty) - ln4 ] = -16 (-infty - ln4) = +16*(infinite + ln4). Which is infinity.

So the integral diverges to infinity. Therefore, the area is infinite.

Wait, but wait a minute. The denominator 4 - r² approaches zero as r approaches 2. So near r=2, the integrand becomes very large, leading the integral to blow up. That implies that the area is infinite.

But the question is about the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, the question says "the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2." But in the metric, the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). So when x² + y² approaches 4, the metric blows up. So the region is a disk of radius 2, but the metric itself becomes singular at the boundary.

So perhaps the pseudosphere is the boundary of this region. The boundary is at r=2, which is where the metric becomes singular. But in the metric given, points at r=2 are not included because the denominator becomes zero, so the manifold is only defined for r <2.

Wait, then maybe the pseudosphere is the boundary at r=2, but the area would be the area of a 1-sphere, which is a circle. But the area of a circle is circumference, so that would be 2πr. But the radius here is 2, so circumference would be 4π. But that doesn't match any of the options, which are all in terms of x² and y², except option D which is infinity.

Wait, earlier when I calculated the area, integrating over the entire region, the area came out as infinite. So perhaps the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Alternatively, perhaps the pseudosphere has a finite area. Wait, but my calculation suggests the integral is infinite. So the area would be infinite, so the answer would be D) +infty.

Looking at the options, option D is +infty. So the correct answer should be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is a conformally flat metric in two dimensions. The area element in this metric is proportional to \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy\). The region of definition for the metric is restricted to \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), as the denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) must be positive to avoid singularities. Thus, the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane.

To compute the total area, we integrate the area element over this disk. Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\)), the area element becomes 

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then given by the double integral:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

First, compute the radial integral:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32 r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Using the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), \(du = -2r \, dr\), the integral becomes:

\[
-16 \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_{4}^{0}.
\]

As \(u \to 0\), \(\ln(u) \to -\infty\). Thus, the integral diverges to infinity:

\[
-16 \left[\ln(0) - \ln(4)\right] = -16 \left[-\infty - \ln(4)\right] = +\infty.
\]

This indicates that the total area of the region is infinite. Since the metric becomes singular at \(r = 2\), the boundary of the disk is not included in the manifold, and the area calculation reflects the divergence at the boundary.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**D) \(+\infty\)**.

Answer: D
