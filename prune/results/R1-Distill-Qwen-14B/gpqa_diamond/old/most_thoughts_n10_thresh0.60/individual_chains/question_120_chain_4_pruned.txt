Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax of a star is inversely proportional to its distance from us. Wait, the formula is plx = 1/d, where d is distance. So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniform distribution typically means that the number density is the same throughout space. But wait, when I'm looking at a certain range of parallax, I'm essentially looking at a shell of stars at a certain distance. Because parallax decreases as you go further away.

So I need to find how the number of stars in a given parallax range (like from plx to plx + dplx) depends on plx. Let me think about the volume involved. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance, so plx = 1/d. So a small change in plx, dplx, corresponds to a change in distance. Let me see, if plx changes by dplx, then d changes by what? Let me write plx = 1/d, so d = 1/plx. Taking the differential, d(d) = - (1/plx²) dplx. So the thickness of the shell at distance d is proportional to 1/plx².

But wait, that's the thickness. The number of stars in a shell depends on the volume of that shell. The volume of a spherical shell is 4π r²
