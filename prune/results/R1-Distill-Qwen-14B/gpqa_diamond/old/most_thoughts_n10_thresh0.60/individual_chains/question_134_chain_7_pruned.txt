Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed together. I need to find the enthalpy of neutralization. The options are given, but I'm more concerned with figuring out the process.

First, I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) is usually calculated using the formula: ΔH = -n H+ × H+ × ΔH per mole. Wait, no, I think more accurately, it's based on the moles of H+ and OH- reacting. Because neutralization is an acid-base reaction where H+ and OH- combine to form water.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is typically per mole of H+ or per mole of OH- involved. So I think the key is to find the total moles of H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reactant.

Wait, but in this case, there are multiple acids and a base. So I need to calculate the total H+ from the acids and the total OH- from the base, then see which is in excess.

Let me break it down:

1. Calculate moles of H+ from HCl:
HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each HCl gives 1 H+.
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 0.5 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

2. Calculate moles of H+ from H2SO4:
H2SO4 is a strong acid (I think it's diprotic, but in solution, especially in dilute conditions, it dissociates completely as H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.
So for each mole of H2SO4, 2 moles H+ are produced.
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

3. Now total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Next, the base: Ba(OH)2. It's a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles OH-.
Molarity is 0.5 M, volume is 0.2 L. Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 *2 = 0.2 moles.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. When they mix, they'll neutralize each other:

H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat, so the process is exothermic.

The reaction will proceed until one of them is used up. So OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

So the reaction will produce 0.2 moles of water, and there will be leftover H+ of 0.08 moles (0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08).

But wait, when calculating enthalpy of neutralization, sometimes it's per mole of acid or base. Alternatively, it's the total heat released when the moles of H+ and OH- react. So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react.

But wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-) for strong acids and bases. So I'll need to use that.

So the total enthalpy change would be the moles of H+ (or OH-) reacted multiplied by the enthalpy per mole.

So moles reacted are 0.2 moles. So ΔH = -57.3 kJ/mol * 0.2 mol = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, so I think I might have made a mistake because the units here are in kJ, but option B is in kcal. Let me check the units.

Wait, I think the
