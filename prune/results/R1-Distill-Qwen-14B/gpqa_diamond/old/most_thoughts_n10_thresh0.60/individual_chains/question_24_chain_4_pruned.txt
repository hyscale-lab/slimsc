Okay, let me try to work through this chemistry problem step by step. Hmm, it's a bit complex, but I'll take it slowly.

So, the question is about some mixtures of liquids undergoing reactions, and we need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. Let's go through the problem statement again and break it down.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, both liquids in X must have some unsaturation because bromine water is usually decolorized by alkenes or alkynes. They're probably alkenes or maybe even aromatic compounds, but maybe not because if they were, they might have conjugated double bonds.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum when heated, it forms mixture Y, which is a result of a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. Wait, that's interesting. So, the products after the reaction don't have any double bonds, maybe? Because if they didn't have any unsaturation, they wouldn't react with bromine to decolorize it. Or perhaps the double bonds are saturated, so the products are single bonds.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28% and is a constituent of Y. So, Z is a product of Y, right? And it's a widely used solvent, which makes me think of something like toluene, but wait, toluene is an aromatic compound, which might not be the case here because Y doesn't have any double bonds.

Wait, Z is a hydrocarbon, so no oxygen. Mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. Let me calculate what that implies. The mass fraction is (mass of H)/(mass of compound) = 14.28%. Let's suppose the molecular formula is CnHm.

The mass of hydrogen is m*(1) and the mass of the compound is (12n + m). So:

(m) / (12n + m) = 0.1428

Hmm, 0.1428 is approximately 1/7. So,

m / (12n + m) ≈ 1/7
7m ≈ 12n + m → 6m ≈ 12n → m = 2n.

So, the formula is CnH2n. That's the general formula for an alkene, but wait, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So, maybe it's a saturated compound. Oh, but wait, if Z is a constituent of Y, and Y comes from X via a disproportionation reaction, which usually involves multiple changes in oxidation states.

Wait, but hydrogenation of X and Y gives Z. So, X, when hydrogenated, turns into Z. Similarly, Y, when hydrogenated, also turns into Z. So, perhaps X and Y are dienes or something that hydrogenate to the same compound.

But wait, the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine. So, they must have double bonds. When X undergoes a reaction (disproportionation)
