Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the masses matter here. The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant. Or wait, maybe it's a red herring, and the problem doesn't require it. Let's focus on the given abundances.

The problem states that using the EW method (which I think stands for Equivalent Width, a method used in spectroscopy to determine elemental abundance), astronomers have determined the elemental abundances for these stars. The given values are:

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

They want the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2], or the ratio [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

Wait, no, the ratio of silicon atoms would be (n_Si1 / n_Si2). But since the problem is about their abundances relative to the Sun, I think I need to compute each star's silicon abundance relative to the Sun and then find the ratio between them.

First, let's clarify what these abundance notations mean. [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances, relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, no, the correct formula is [X/Y] = log10(n_X/n_Y) - log10(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So, [X/Y] = log10( (n_X / n_Y) / (n_X_sun / n_Y_sun) ) ) = log10( (n_X / n_Y) * (n_Y_sun / n_X_sun) )

So, for the Sun, the values given are:

n_Fe_sun / n_H_sun = 10^((7.5 - 12)) ) because 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)

Similarly for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH_sun = 10^-5.

Wait, wait, let me clarify. The formula given is 12 + log10(n_X/nH) = value. So, for Fe, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) = same as 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5.

So, for the Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Now, let's tackle Star_1 first.

Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 =0 → which is the logarithm of (nFe/nH) in Star_1 divided by (nFe/nH)_sun. So,

[Fe/H]_1 = log10( (nFe_1 / nH_1) / (nFe_sun / nH_sun) ) ) = 0 → (nFe_1 / nH_1) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) = 10^0 =1 → So, nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → same as the Sun.

So, Fe abundance is same as Sun in Star_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. [Si/Fe]_1 = log10( (nSi_1 / nFe_1) / (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) ) = 0.3.

So, (nSi_1/nFe_1) = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

Wait, yes.

So, (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = (nSi_sun / nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

What is (nSi_sun /nFe_sun)?

From the Sun's data, nFe/nH = 3.16e-5, nMg/nH=1e-5.

But wait, what about nSi/nH? The Sun's data only gives for Fe and Mg. Hmm, perhaps we can get nSi_sun from another approach, but maybe the problem expects us to know that the solar silicon abundance is given elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps we can use other relations.

Wait, let me think. The question is about the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2. So perhaps I can express [Si] in each star relative to the Sun, and then take the ratio.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so Fe is same as Sun.

[Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 → So, Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe than in the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 is 0 → Mg abundance same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3 → Mg/Si in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times higher than in the Sun.

So, let me compute each star's [Si/H] abundance relative to the Sun.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3.

Because [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H]. Since [Fe/H] is 0.

So, (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) = 10^0.3 → So, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

We have [Mg/H]_2 =0 → same as Sun.

[Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = (Mg/Si)_sun * 10^0.3 → Mg/Si in Star 2 is 10^0.3 times higher.

So, (nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since [Mg/H]_2 =0, nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

So, nMg_2 = (nMg_sun / nH_sun) * nH_2.

Similarly, nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

Wait, because [Si/H]_2 would be something, but I need to find it.

Alternatively, perhaps express [Si/H]_2 in terms of [Mg/Si]_2 and [Mg/H]_2.

Starting with [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3 → which is log10( (nMg_2 / nSi_2) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But [Mg/H]_2 is 0 → (nMg_2 /nH_2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

So, nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

Similarly, nSi_2 = (nSi_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 * (something).

Wait, let's express nMg_2 in terms of nH_2 and nSi_2.

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

And nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_2.

So, setting equal:

(nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_2.

Divide both sides by (nMg_sun):

(1/nH_sun) * nH_2 = (1/nSi_sun) * 10^0.3 * nSi_2.

Multiply both sides by nH_sun * nSi_sun:

nH_2 * nSi_sun = nH_sun * 10^0.3 * nSi_2.

Wait, but nH_2 is the hydrogen in Star_2. Hmm, perhaps it's better to express nSi_2 in terms of nH_2 and the solar values.

Wait, maybe a better approach: let's express [Si/H]_2.

We know [Mg/H]_2 =0 → same as Sun.

So, nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

And [Mg/Si]_2 = log10( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) ) =0.3.

So, (nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) * 10^0.3.

But since nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) *nH_2,

So, (nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2 ) / nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Multiply both sides by nSi_2 and divide by (nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2):

nSi_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2) ) / [ (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 ) ] * (nMg_sun /nH_sun *nH_2) ) ?

Wait, maybe I should solve for nSi_2 in terms of nH_2.

Let me rearrange the equation:

nMg_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * nH_2.

We have (nMg_2 / nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_2 = (nMg_2 * nSi_sun) / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3 )

Substituting nMg_2:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun /nH_sun * nH_2 ) * nSi_sun ] / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3 )

Simplify:

nSi_2 = [ (nMg_sun * nH_2 ) /nH_sun ) * nSi_sun ] / (nMg_sun * 10^0.3 )

The nMg_sun terms cancel out:

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * nSi_sun / (10^0.3 )

So,

nSi_2 = (nH_2 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / 10^0.3 )

Thus, nSi_2 / nH_2 = (nSi_sun / nH_sun) / 10^0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = log10( (nSi_2 / nH_2) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) ) = log10( 1/(10^0.3) ) ) = log10( 10^(-0.3) ) ) = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 is -0.3.

Wait, that seems right. Because if [Mg/Si] is higher by 0.3, then Si is lower relative to Mg. Since [Mg/H] is same as Sun, [Si/H] must be lower by 0.3.

So, for Star_1, [Si/H] is 0.3, and for Star_2, [Si/H] is -0.3.

Wait, no wait: Let's recheck.

For Star_1, [Si/Fe] is 0.3, and [Fe/H] is 0. So [Si/H] = [Si/Fe] + [Fe/H] = 0.3 +0 =0.3 → correct.

For Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3, and [Mg/H] is 0. So, [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 → yes, that's correct.

Because [X/H] = [X/Y] + [Y/H]. So, [Si/H] = [Si/Mg] + [Mg/H]. So, [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H]. Wait, perhaps I should re-express it.

Wait, [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H]. So, [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So, 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

Yes, that's correct.

So now, each star's [Si/H] is known:

Star_1: +0.3

Star_2: -0.3

So, the ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2 is (n_Si1 / n_Si2) = 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }.

Because [Si/H]_1 = log10(n_Si1 / n_H1) - log10(n_Si_sun /n_H_sun) )

Similarly for [Si/H]_2.

So, the ratio (n_Si1 /n_Si2) = (n_Si1 /n_H1) * (n_H2 /n_Si2) ) = (10^{[Si/H]_1} ) * (10^{ - [Si/H]_2 } )

Which is 10^{ [Si/H]_1 - [Si/H]_2 }

So, substituting [Si/H]_1 =0.3 and [Si/H]_2 =-0.3:

Ratio =10^{0.3 - (-0.3)}= 10^{0.6}.

What's 10^0.6 approximately?

10^0.6 is about 3.98, which is approximately 4. Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check whether I have the ratio correct.

Because the question is the ratio of the number of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So, it's (n_Si1)/(n_Si2).

n_Si1 is (n_Si_sun * 10^{[Si/H]_1} ), and n_Si2 is (n_Si_sun * 10^{[Si/H]_2} ).

So,

n_Si1 = n_Si_sun * 10^{0.3}

n_Si2 = n_Si_sun * 10^{-0.3}

So, the ratio is (10^{0.3} ) / (10^{-0.3} ) = 10^{0.6} ≈ 3.98 → ~4.

But looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is the closest. So the answer should be A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me calculate 10^0.6 more accurately.

10^0.6 = e^(0.6 * ln(10)).

ln(10) ≈ 2.302585.

0.6 * 2.302585 ≈ 1.38155.

e^1.38155 ≈ e^1 is ~2.718, e^0.38155 is approximately 1.464 → so 2.718 *1.464 ≈ 4. So, 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which rounds to ~4. So option A is ~3.9, which is about that.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze their elemental abundances relative to the Sun using the given data:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
   - [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 = 0.3 + 0 = 0.3 dex.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex
   - [Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0 - 0.3 = -0.3 dex.

3. **Sun**:
   - nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5), nMg/nH = 10^(-5). These values are not directly needed for the final ratio but are used to define the reference for [X/H].

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is given by:

\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\left([{\text{Si/H}}]_1 - [{\text{Si/H}}]_2\right)}.
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{\left(0.3 - (-0.3)\right)} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

### Calculation of \(10^{0.6}\):
Using approximations:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \quad \text{(closest to 3.9)}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.
