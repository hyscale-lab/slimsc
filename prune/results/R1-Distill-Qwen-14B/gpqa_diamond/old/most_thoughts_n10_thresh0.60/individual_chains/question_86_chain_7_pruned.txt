Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it involves a chemist performing two reactions with two different starting materials and using different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, depending on the reaction.

Wait, the question is about selecting the correct starting materials A and B from the options given. The reactions are:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but their reactions might differ. Let me think about what these reagents typically do. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used in the reduction of ketones and aldehydes to alcohols. BH3 is a similar reagent, but I think it's often used in the formation of alkenes through the reduction of ketones, but wait, no, maybe that's another reaction. Alternatively, I'm mixing things up. Oh wait, BH3 is more commonly used in the reduction of esters or amides? Or perhaps it's about the specific conditions or whether the reaction is under acidic or basic conditions.

Wait, another thought: When you have a cyclic ketone, like a pyranone, and you reduce it, you can get a diol. But wait, the product here is a tetrahydro pyran with a ketone group. Oh wait, no, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic hemiacetal or something else? Wait, maybe it's a gamma-lactone? Hmm, not exactly. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, the product is a 5-membered ring? No, wait, pyran is a six-membered ring, right? So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a six-membered ring, with oxygen, a ketone at position 2, and with four substituents (maybe an ethyl group at position 4). So it's a cyclic hemiacetal? Or perhaps a cyclic ether with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is the result of
