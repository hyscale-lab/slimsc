Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question involves space travel at a significant fraction of the speed of light, so I'm thinking it's related to special relativity, particularly time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their experienced time (proper time) is less than the time observed from a stationary frame. 

The problem states that an astronaut is 22 years old and is traveling to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The average lifetime of these aliens is 150 solar years. The question is, how long does the trip take from the astronaut's perspective?

Wait, wait. The options suggest that the astronaut might not survive the trip. So I need to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut and compare it to their lifespan.

First, I think I should calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, wait, do I remember where the Large Magellanic Cloud is? I think it's a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, and it's about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let me confirm that. I remember that the Andromeda galaxy is about 2.5 million light-years away, so LMC is much closer. Yes, I think it's approximately 160,000 light-years. So the distance D is 160,000 light-years.

The speed of the spacecraft is v = 0.99999987c. So in terms of a fraction, that's almost the speed of light. Let me calculate the time from Earth's frame of reference. Time is distance divided by speed. So t = D / v.

But wait, D is in light-years and v is a fraction of c, so the units should work out. For example, if D is 160,000 light-years and v is 0.99999987c, then t is approximately 160,000 / 0.99999987 years. Let's compute that: 160000 divided by approximately 1 is about 160,000 years. But that's the time measured in Earth's frame. But the astronaut's time is shorter due to time dilation.

Wait, time dilation formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Oh, right, because the astronaut's proper time is shorter. So I need to compute gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since v is very close to c, gamma will be very large.

Wait, v is 0.99999987c, so let's compute beta = v/c = 0.99999987. Let me compute 1 - beta squared. 1 - (0.99999987)^2.

Let me calculate that. The square of 0.99999987 is approximately (since 1 - 0.00000013)^2. But wait, 0.
