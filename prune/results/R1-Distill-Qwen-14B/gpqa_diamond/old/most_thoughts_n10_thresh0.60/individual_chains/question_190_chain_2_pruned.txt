Okay, so I've got this question about nucleophilicity in aqueous solution. Hmm, I remember that nucleophilicity can depend on a few factors like the solvent, the charge of the nucleophile, and the structure. Let me think this through.

The question gives five nucleophiles:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate
2. Hydroxide
3. Propionate
4. Methanol
5. Ethanethiolate

And I need to arrange them from most reactive to least reactive in aqueous solution.

Wait, the solvent is aqueous, so it's polar protic. In such solvents, charged species are less soluble and thus less reactive because they get solvated heavily. But wait, sometimes the more polarizable ions are better nucleophiles despite solvation.

So first, I should consider the charge of each nucleophile. The more negative the charge, the more nucleophilic it should be, right? But in a polar protic solvent, the actual reactivity is a bit tricky because of solvation. The smaller the ion and the higher the charge, the more it's solvated, making it less reactive.

Looking at the options:

1. 4-methylcyclohexan-1-olate is a conjugate base of an alcohol. It has a negative charge on the oxygen. So it's a strong base and a good nucleophile, but maybe not the best because of solvation.

2. Hydroxide ion (OH⁻). It's a strong base and a good nucleophile. But in aqueous solution, it's surrounded by water molecules tightly, which slows it down a bit. However, compared to other nucleophiles here, maybe it's in the middle.

3. Propionate (CH₂CH₂COO⁻). It's the conjugate base of propionic acid. It's a weaker base than hydroxide because it's a carboxylate. Carboxylate ions are less nucleophilic in polar protic solvents because they are stabilized by resonance and solvation. So propionate might be a weaker nucleophile.

4. Methanol (CH3OH). It's a neutral molecule. Without a charge, it's a poor nucleophile because it can't attack as effectively. Polar aprotic solvents would make it better, but in aqueous, its nucleophilicity is low.

5. Ethanethiolate (HS⁻). Wait, no, ethanethiolate is actually CH3CH2S⁻. Thiols are weaker acids than alcohols, so their conjugate bases are stronger bases. So ethanethiolate is a stronger base than hydroxide. In a polar protic solvent like water, the less solvated a nucleophile is, the more reactive. Since S is larger than O, the ethanethiolate ion is less solvated. So it's a better nucleophile in aqueous solution than OH⁻. Oh right, because S is more polarizable and less solvated due to weaker H-bonding capability.

Wait, but wait. How do the sizes and basicity affect their nucleophilicity in aqueous?

In polar protic solvents, nucleophilicity is inversely related to the ability to stabilize charge through solvation. So bigger, less solvated ions are better nucleophiles.

So order of nucleophilicity in polar protic:

HS⁻ > HO⁻ > RCOO⁻ > others like RO⁻ maybe. Wait, but wait, cyclohexanolate is RO⁻, but with a bulky group.

Wait, the cyclohexanolate is a conjugate base of a tertiary alcohol. So it's a strong base, but in a polar protic solvent, bulky bases might have lower nucleophilicity because of poor solubility, but in this context, maybe the charge is more important.

Wait, the order of nucleophilicity in aqueous (polar protic) is generally:

HS⁻ > OH⁻ > RO⁻? Wait, I thought in polar protic, the order is different because of solvation. Let me think again.

In polar aprotic solvents, nucleophilicity follows basicity: HS⁻ > OH⁻ > CH3O⁻ > CH3CH2O⁻, etc.
