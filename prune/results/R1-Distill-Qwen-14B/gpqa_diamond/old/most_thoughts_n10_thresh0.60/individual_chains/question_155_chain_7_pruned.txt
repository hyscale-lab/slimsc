Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. I'm a bit new to this, so I'm going to take it step by step. Let's see what the problem is asking.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the Pz operator, ΔPz. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the square root of the expectation value of the square minus the square of the expectation value of the observable itself. So the formula is ΔPz = sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩²).

But wait, I need to compute these expectation values. To do that, I need to know the state the system is in. The problem says the system is in the eigenstate of Px corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The explicit state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So the state vector |ψ⟩ is:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2,
          1/√2,
          -1/2 ]

Now, to find ⟨Pz⟩, I think I'll need to compute the expectation value of Pz in this state. And to find ⟨Pz²⟩, I'll compute the expectation of Pz squared. 

Wait, but how do I do that? Oh right, for any operator A, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩. So first, let's write down the matrix form of Pz.

The matrix for Pz is given as:

[ ħ    0     0 ]
[ 0    0     0 ]
[ 0    0   -ħ ]

So Pz is a diagonal matrix. That should make things easier because acting on a vector is just multiplying each component by the corresponding diagonal element.

First, let's compute ⟨Pz⟩. That's ψ† Pz ψ.

So ψ is a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So ψ† would be the row vector: [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Now, ψ† * Pz is:

[ (-1/2)*ħ, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ]

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Wait, when you multiply a row vector with a matrix, each element is the sum of products of the row's elements multiplied by the columns of the matrix. Oh wait, no, ψ† is a row vector, and Pz is a 3x3 matrix. So ψ† * Pz would be a row vector where each element is the sum of ψ† elements multiplied by the columns of Pz.

Wait, another approach: since Pz is diagonal, when you multiply ψ† by Pz, you just multiply each component of ψ by the corresponding diagonal element.

So ψ† * Pz would be [ (-1/2)ħ, 0, (-1/2)(-ħ) ] → [ (-ħ/2), 0, (ħ/2) ].
