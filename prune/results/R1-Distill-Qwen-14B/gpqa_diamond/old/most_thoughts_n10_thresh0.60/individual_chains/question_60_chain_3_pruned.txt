Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that there's an alien spacecraft traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip would take from their perspective. The options given are about whether they die or the time it takes.

Wait, I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is when time moves slower for the moving observer compared to a stationary one. So from Earth's frame, the trip would take a certain amount of time, but from the astronaut's perspective, it's less.

But wait, no, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The astronaut is on the spacecraft, which is the moving frame. So, the Earth is moving towards them at that high speed. So from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted. Oh right, length contraction! Because in their frame, the distance is shorter than what Earth would measure.

So the first step is to calculate the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth, but wait, the problem doesn't give specific distances. Hmm, maybe I can figure it out using the given speed and the time experienced by the astronaut.

Wait no, the problem is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective, their proper time. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut. Proper time is the shortest time measured in the moving frame.

The formula for time dilation in special relativity is T = gamma * t, where T is the dilated time (Earth's frame) and t is the proper time (astronaut's frame). But wait, no, the astronaut is the one who experiences the proper time. So from Earth's perspective, the time taken would be longer, but the astronaut's own clock would show less time.

Wait, but the question is asking for the astronaut's experienced time. So I need to compute the proper time.

The spacecraft's speed is v = 0.99999987c. That's really close to the speed of light. Gamma (γ) is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate gamma.

v = 0.99999987c, so v²/c² = approximately (0.99999987)^2. Let's compute that. 0.99999987 squared is about 0.99999974. But wait, that's an approximation. Let's do it more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is a very precise number. Let me compute (1 - v^2/c^2) first.

v^2/c^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = approximately let's compute:

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 1e-6 as a rough estimate. Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013, right? So when I square that, (1 - 2*0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2, but the square is negligible. So approximately, 1 - 2 * 0.00000013 = 1 - 0.00000026. So 0.99999974.

Wait, but more accurately, let me compute 0.99999987^2:

= (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*1.3e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is approximately 1 - 2.6e-7 + 1.69e-14 ≈ 0.99999974 (since 1.69e-1
