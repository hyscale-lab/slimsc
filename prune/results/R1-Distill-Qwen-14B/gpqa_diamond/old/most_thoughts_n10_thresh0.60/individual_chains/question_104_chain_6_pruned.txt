Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Hmm, I need to figure out how the orbital periods of the two planets relate based on the given data. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the RV method measures the Doppler shift of a star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull. The shift tells us about the star's wobble. So when a planet orbits a star, the star itself moves a little in the opposite direction. The bigger the shift, the more massive the planet or the closer it is, I think.

But wait, the question says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So their masses are about the same. The stars are similar to the Sun, so their masses are same too. So the main difference between the two planets is the RV shift. Planet #1's shift is 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2's is 7. Oh wait, no, no, the shifts are for the same spectral line. So the shift in wavelength (the Doppler shift) is measured as periodic. 

I think the RV method gives us the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p^3 sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ (1) / ( (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) * (P/(2π))^(-1/3) ) ) ]

Wait, no, maybe I should think of a simpler version. Oh right, the formula for K is:

K = ( (2πG) / (P c) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) ) * (1 / sqrt(1 - e²))

But since both planets are detected, and the orbits are circular, e (eccentricity) is zero. So the sqrt(1 - e²) term becomes 1. Also, the mass of the planet is much smaller than the star's, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So M_p is similar for both planets, and M_star is same for both. So the term (M_p sin
