Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it would have decayed. Now, 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed yet. They want to know the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, the next 150 minutes? Or the remaining time after 50 minutes? Oh, wait, the wording says "the next 150 minutes", but I need to clarify when that 150 minutes starts.

Wait, no. Let's read it again. "So far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" Oh, so the 50 minutes have already gone, and now they're asking about the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 +150= 200 minutes. Or wait, no, perhaps they're asking about the probability over the next 150 minutes, starting now, regardless of the previous time.

But wait, no, I think that's incorrect. Because for radioactive decay, the process is memoryless. So the probability doesn't depend on the time already passed. So the decay probability in a given interval is independent of when you start observing.

Wait, okay, so the key concept here is that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, which has the memoryless property. That means that the probability of the atom decaying in a future interval depends only on the length of that interval, not on how much time has already passed.

But let's think about the given data. The decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So the probability of decay (P) in time t is 0.32 when t is 100 minutes. So using the exponential decay formula, P = 1 - e^(-位t), where 位 is the decay constant.

Wait, so let's write that down. We have P = 1 - e^(-位t). So for t=100, P=0.32.

So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-位*100
