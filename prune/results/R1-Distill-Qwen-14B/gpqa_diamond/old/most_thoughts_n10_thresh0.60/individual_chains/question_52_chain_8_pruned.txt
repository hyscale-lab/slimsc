Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, so the question is about how the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels changes when a star has spots. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the star has certain parameters. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, no, wait. The way the question is phrased, when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So the effective temperature of the photosphere has decreased.

Now, the key point is that in the photosphere, the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots. The question is asking what the factor by which this ratio changes. So, we need to find (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_with_spots.

I remember that the ratio of populations in two energy levels in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium) is given by the Boltzmann equation. The formula is N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Or wait, actually, the ratio is N_i/N_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where E_i > E_j.

In this case, the transition corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Ã…. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. So this must be a transition between two energy levels of neutral Ti.

The ratio in question is N1/N2. Let's denote the lower energy level as level 1 and higher as level 2. So E2 > E1.

So, N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ).

Wait, because if E2 is higher than E1, then (E2-E1) is positive, so the exponential is exp(-deltaE/(kT)). But wait, the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), because (E2-E1) is positive, so it's exp( positive deltaE/(kT) ), which is a larger number, so N1 would be higher than N2 when T is lower.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right. The Boltzmann factor is (for energy levels i and j, with j higher than i):

N_j/N_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

So if E_j > E_i, then (E_j - E_i) is positive, and so the exponential is a factor less than 1. So N_j is less than N_i. So, the ratio N_i/N_j is greater than 1, and increases as T decreases because the exponential term increases (since denominator kT is smaller, so the exponent becomes more positive, making the exponential larger).

Hmm, but in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K) compared to when it doesn't (6000 K). So when the star has spots, the photosphere is cooler.

The ratio N1/N2 is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So, with spots, N1/N2 is lower than without. Let's think about that.

If the temperature decreases, let's see how N1/N2 changes.

N1/N2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, no, according to the Boltzmann equation, N2 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) * N1.

So, rearranged, N1/N2 = (
