Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light traveling through glass that's moving. Hmm, I think I remember something about how the speed of light doesn't change based on the source's motion, but wait, is that always true? Oh right, in a vacuum, the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer's motion. But wait, this is in glass, so that's a different medium. So the index of refraction n comes into play here. 

The question says the glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. The light is propagating through the glass. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the laboratory frame.

Wait, in the glass, the speed of light would normally be c/n, right? Since c is the speed in a vacuum, and n is the index. But wait, the glass itself is moving. Does that affect the speed as observed in the lab?

I think special relativity comes into play here. Oh wait, but for speeds that are not a significant fraction of the speed of light, maybe we can use the Galilean addition of velocities. But wait, no, Galilean relativity doesn't apply when dealing with light. Because according to Galilean, if the glass is moving at speed v, and the light is going at speed u in the glass's frame (which would be c/n), then in the lab frame, the speed would be u + v. But wait, no, because the direction matters. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light, so the
