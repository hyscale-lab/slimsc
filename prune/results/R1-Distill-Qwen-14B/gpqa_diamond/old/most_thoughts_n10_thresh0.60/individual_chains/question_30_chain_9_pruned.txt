Okay, so I have this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I need to figure out what color it absorbs. Let me think.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. Wait, I remember that when a substance absorbs light, it's because the energy of that light causes electrons to jump to a higher energy level. Then, when they drop back down, they emit light. But wait, the question is about what color is absorbed, not emitted. So the absorbed light has higher energy than the emitted light.

Oh right, the energy difference is what's important. The energy of the emitted light corresponds to the energy gap between the levels. But wait, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted one, right? Because the absorbed photon provides the energy for the electron to jump up. Then, when it drops, it emits a lower energy photon.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think. The energy levels: let's say the electron is in a lower energy level. When it absorbs a photon, it jumps to a higher energy level. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. But that photon's energy is the difference between the two levels. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted one because the electron goes up from a lower to higher (so more energy needed for absorption) and then comes down, emitting less energy.

So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. What's the energy of the absorbed light? Since the energy difference is the same, but the absorbed photon is higher in energy. Wait
