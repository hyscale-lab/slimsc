Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Then, Pauli statistics require something about their quantum numbers. The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I think T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum, right?

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, the question is about which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are various transitions, each with a lowercase letter denoting the angular momentum state of X. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from the initial state to a final state plus a particle.

Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the conservation laws are crucial here: angular momentum and parity must be conserved. Also, the Pauli exclusion principle comes into play because of the identical particles involved, but maybe that's already handled by the given condition.

Let me break it down. The initial state is 1S0. So, the term is written as (2S+1)L(J). For 1S0, that's (2*0 +1)S0, so S=0, L=0, J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, when they emit a particle X, the final state is another NN state. Let's denote the emitted particle's angular momentum as l (lowercase). So the orbital angular momentum part of the emitted particle is l.

But wait, in the problem statement, each option shows something like 7D1 + p. I think the lowercase letters are the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. Like p is l=1, d is l=2, f is l=3, etc. So, the emission process involves the NN system going from initial state to final state plus a particle with angular momentum l.

So when X is emitted, the NN system's quantum numbers change. The total angular momentum J' of the NN final state is the sum of their orbital angular momentum L' and their total spin S'. Wait,
