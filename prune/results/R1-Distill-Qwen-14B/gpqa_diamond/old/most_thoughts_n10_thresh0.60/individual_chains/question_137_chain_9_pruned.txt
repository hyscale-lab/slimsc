Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons are used to accelerate charged particles, like protons, using magnetic fields and electric fields. The question says a proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, so T is almost zero at t=0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. 

Wait, the problem says the voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. And the given data are Phi0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is how many revolutions the proton makes.

I think the key here is to find out how much energy the proton gains and relate that to the number of revolutions. Since it's a synchrocyclotron, I remember that the magnetic field strength is varied over time to keep the particles in the same orbit as they gain energy. But wait, in a regular cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant. Synchrocyclotron must have a varying field because, as particles gain energy, their radius increases. Oh right, because the cyclotron frequency depends on the magnetic field and the mass of the particle. So to keep the particles in the same phase as the accelerating voltage, the field changes.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Hmm, maybe that relates to the number of times it goes through the potential well of the electric field? Or perhaps each acceleration corresponds to a certain energy gain. I'm a bit confused here.

The voltage is
