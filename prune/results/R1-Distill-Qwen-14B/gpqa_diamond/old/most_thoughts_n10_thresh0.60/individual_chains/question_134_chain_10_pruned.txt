Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these thermodynamics concepts. Let me take a deep breath and think through it step by step.

The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when three different solutions are mixed: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but I think that's per mole of H+ ions. Hmm.

First, I need to figure out what's happening when these three solutions are mixed. Wait, mixing HCl and H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2. Oh, right, HCl and H2SO4 are acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So they'll react. But wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid but it's diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base as well. So the reaction should be an acid-base neutralization.

But wait, I should write down the possible reactions. Let me see. The acids will donate H+ ions, and the base will donate OH- ions. The products will be water and possibly a salt.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it'll dissociate completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. HCl is a strong acid, so it'll dissociate into H+ and Cl^- ions. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but since it's a diprotic acid, it might donate two H+ ions. Wait, but wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid in its first dissociation, but the second may not be as strong. Hmm, but I think in problems like this, they often assume complete dissociation for the first H+.

Wait, but in neutralization reactions, it's the H+ from the acids reacting with the OH- from the base. So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Let me think. The reaction is H+ + OH- â†’ H2O, and this releases enthalpy. The enthalpy change will depend on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react. But wait, since both HCl and H2SO4 are acids, they each contribute H+ ions, and Ba
