Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

So the question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh right, that's probably the peak wavelength from black body radiation, which relates to temperature. Then, the radial velocities are given as 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. 

The question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor, and I need to find that factor. The options are A to D, some numbers around 2.2 to 2.35.

Hmm. Okay, so I think I should approach this by recalling the formulas related to black body radiation and luminosity.

First, I remember that the luminosity of a star (assuming black body) is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann Law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But since we're looking for the ratio of luminosities, the constants will cancel out.

So, for Star_1 and Star_2, the luminosity ratio would be (L1/L2) = (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴). Because the 4πσ terms are the same for both.

Now, the problem says that the peak wavelengths are the same. Oh right, Wien's Law says the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature. So λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be equal. Wait, wait, no: λ1_max = λ2_max → T1 = T2? Because if λ_max is the same, then T must be the same. Because λ_max = b / T → T = b / λ_max. So if λ_max is the same, T1 equals T2.

Wait, that's a key point. So if both stars have the same λ_max, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2.

Wait no, wait a second. Because in reality, the peak wavelength is determined by the star's temperature. So if two stars have the same peak wavelength, they must have the same temperature. So yes, T1 equals T2.

Wait, but wait again. Could redshift affect the observed wavelength? Because the star's radial velocity is given. Oh, right! Because if a star is moving towards us or away from us, there's a Doppler shift in the observed wavelength. So the observed wavelength maximum might be different from the emitted wavelength maximum.

Ah, right. So the star's temperature determines the emitted wavelength, but if the star is moving, the observed wavelength is shifted.

Wait, so the given wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the observed wavelengths. So that's the key. So the observed λ_max for Star_1 and Star_2 are the same. So the observed λ_max is the same for both, but the actual emitted λ_max might be different because of their velocities.

So to get the actual temperature of each star, we have to account for the Doppler shift.

Wait, okay. Let me think about this. The star's emitted wavelength is λ_emitted = λ_observed / (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is the radial velocity. But wait, actually, the Doppler shift formula is a bit more precise. For a source moving away at velocity v, the observed wavelength λ is longer than emitted λ0 by a factor (1 + v/c), where v is positive for recession. So λ = λ0 (1 + v/c). But if the star is moving towards us, v is negative, so λ is shorter.

Wait, but wait. The formula for the Doppler effect in terms of wavelength is: λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ) for relativistic speeds. But since 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), we can approximate it with a linear approximation. Alternatively, perhaps just using λ_observed ≈ λ_emitted (1 + v_r / c), but with the sign depending on the direction.

Wait, but let's think again. The correct Doppler shift formula when the source is moving away is λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r / c), where v_r is positive when moving away. If the star is moving towards us, v_r is negative, so λ_obs is shorter than λ_emit.

But in our case, Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so its observed wavelength is the same as its emitted. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Wait, the problem says: "the radial velocities of the two stars to be 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively." So Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, correct? Because radial velocity is positive when moving away, I think. So for Star_2, v_r = +700 km/s.

Wait, but then the observed λ_max for both stars is the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_emit1, since v_r1=0. And λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2 / c ), because Star_2 is moving away.

But the problem says that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. Oh wait, no, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So λ_obs1 = λ_obs2.

So λ_emit1 = λ_obs1, because Star_1 has v_r1=0. For Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c). Since λ_obs1 = λ_obs2, then λ_emit2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v_r2/c).

But wait, let's get this straight. Because Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer than its emitted. So λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r2/c).

But we have λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. So:

λ_emit2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v_r2/c).

But since Star_1 emits at λ_emit1 = λ_obs1, and Star_2 emits at λ_emit2 = λ_obs1 / (1 + v_r2/c).

But wait, the temperatures of the stars are determined by their emitted wavelengths, right? Because the observed wavelength is just a Doppler-shifted version.

So, using Wien's Law, T = b / λ_emit.

So T1 = b / λ_emit1 = b / λ_obs1.

T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs1 / (1 + v_r2/c)) ) = (b * (1 + v_r2/c)) ) / λ_obs1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c).

Wait, that would be the case if Star_2 is moving away, so its emitted wavelength is shorter than the observed, making its temperature higher than what would be inferred from the observed wavelength.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Let's say Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s. So, the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted. So, the emitted wavelength is λ_emit2 = λ_observed2 / (1 + v_r2/c ), if v_r is positive when moving away.

Wait, no, the Doppler formula is a bit tricky. Let me recall: when a source moves away, the observed wavelength is longer. So λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive if moving away.

But wait, another way to think: the relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r/c)/(1 - v_r/c) ) ), but for small v_r, this approximates to λ_obs ≈ λ_emit (1 + v_r/(c)).

So for v_r = 700 km/s, c is about 3e5 km/s. So v_r / c = 700 / 3e5 ≈ 0.002333... So 0.2333%.

Thus, (1 + v_r/c) ≈ 1.002333.

So for Star_2, λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * 1.002333.

But the problem says that λ_obs1 = λ_obs2. And λ_obs1 is the same as λ_emit1, because Star_1's radial velocity is zero.

So, λ_emit1 = λ_obs1.

And λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1.002333) ) = λ_obs1 / 1.002333.

Wait, no, wait. Because λ_obs2 = λ_emit2 * (1 + v_r/c ), so λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r/c ). But since λ_obs2 equals λ_obs1, which equals λ_emit1, then λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r/c ).

So λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / 1.002333.

But from Wien's law, T = b / λ_emit. So T1 = b / λ_emit1, T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1 / 1.002333 ) ) = (b * 1.002333 ) / λ_emit1 ) = T1 * 1.002333.

So, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ) ≈ T1 * 1.002333.

Wait, but that's a small increase in temperature for Star_2. Now, since the problem says that the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, but their emitted wavelengths are different because of their velocities. So their temperatures are not the same.

Now, going back to luminosity.

Luminosity L is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T^4.

We can write the ratio L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4).

Because 4π σ is the same in numerator and denominator.

Given that R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So, (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25.

So that part is 2.25.

Now, the T ratio: since T2 = T1 * 1.002333, so T1 = T2 / 1.002333.

Wait no, wait. From above, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ).

Wait, no, earlier I had T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ), because λ_emit2 = λ_emit1 / (1 + v_r2/c ), so T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_emit1/(1 + v_r2/c )) = (b (1 + v_r2/c )) / λ_emit1 ) = (1 + v_r2/c ) * (b/λ_emit1 ) = (1 + v_r2/c ) * T1.

So yes, T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ), so T1 = T2 / (1 + v_r2/c ).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me rephrase.

Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs1; T1 = b / λ_emit1.

Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs2 / (1 + v_r2/c ) = λ_obs1 / (1 + v_r2/c ); so T2 = b / λ_emit2 = b / (λ_obs1 / (1 + v_r2/c )) ) = b (1 + v_r2/c ) / λ_obs1 = (1 + v_r2/c ) * (b/λ_obs1 ) = (1 + v_r2/c ) * T1.

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v_r2/c ).

So, the ratio T1^4 / T2^4 = [T1^4 ] / [ (T1 (1 + v_r/c ))^4 ] = 1 / (1 + v_r2/c )^4.

So putting it all together, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1^4)/(T2^4) ) = (2.25) * [1 / (1 + v_r2/c )^4 ].

Wait, no. Because L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4) / (R2² T2^4 ) = ( (R1/R2)^2 ) * (T1 / T2 )^4.

Wait, no, because T1^4 / T2^4 is (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Because L is proportional to R^2 T^4. So L1 = 4π (R1)^2 σ T1^4, L2=4π (R2)^2 σ T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1² T1^4 )/( R2² T2^4 ) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Wait, no. Because (T1^4)/(T2^4) = (T1/T2)^4. So yes.

So since T2 = T1 (1 + v_r2/c ), then T1/T2 = 1/(1 + v_r2/c ).

So (T1/T2)^4 = 1/(1 + v_r2/c )^4.

So putting it all together, L1/L2 = (2.25) * (1/(1 + v_r2/c )^4 )

Wait, but wait. Because L1 is compared to L2. So let's compute this factor.

v_r2 is 700 km/s. c is approximately 3e5 km/s.

v_r2/c = 700 / 3e5 = 700 / 300000 = 0.002333...

So 1 + v_r2/c ≈ 1.002333.

So (1 + v_r2/c )^4 ≈ (1.002333)^4.

Calculating this:

(1.002333)^4 ≈ ?

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute 1.002333 squared.

1.002333^2 = approx 1.002333 * 1.002333.

Let me compute:

1.002333 * 1.002333:

= (1 + 0.002333)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.002333) + (0.002333)^2.

= 1 + 0.004666 + 0.00000544.

≈ 1.00467144.

Now, square that to get to the fourth power:

(1.00467144)^2 ≈ ?

Again, using the same approximation.

(1 + 0.00467144)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*(0.00467144) + (0.00467144)^2.

= 1 + 0.00934288 + 0.00002182.

≈ 1.0093647.

So approximately 1.009365.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009365.

Thus, 1/(1.009365) ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, no. Because L1/L2 = 2.25 * [1/(1.002333)^4 ].

So [1/(1.002333)^4 ] is approx 1/1.009365 ≈ 0.9907.

Wait, no. Because 1.002333^4 is 1.009365, so 1/1.009365 ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Calculating that: 2.25 * 0.99 = 2.2275, approximately.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute 2.25 * 0.9907 accurately.

2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814.

0.25 * 0.9907 = 0.247675.

Adding them together: 1.9814 + 0.247675 = 2.229075.

So approximately 2.229.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A) ~2.25

B) ~2.32

C) ~2.35

D) ~2.23

Wait, 2.229 is close to 2.23, which is option D. But let me think if I made any mistakes in the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.002333)^4 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approximation for (1 + x)^n.

Using the binomial expansion for (1 + x)^4, where x is small.

(1 + x)^4 ≈ 1 + 4x + 6x² + 4x³ + x^4.

x is 0.002333.

So 4x = 4 * 0.002333 ≈ 0.009332.

6x² = 6 * (0.002333)^2 = 6 * 0.00000544 ≈ 0.00003264.

4x³ = 4*(0.002333)^3 ≈ 4*(0.0000000125) ≈ 0.00000005.

x^4 is negligible.

So adding up: 0.009332 + 0.00003264 = 0.00936464.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1 + 0.00936464 = 1.00936464.

Thus, 1.00936464 is more precise.

So 1/(1.00936464) ≈ 0.9907.

So 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907.

Let me compute that more accurately.

2.25 * 0.9907:

Compute 2 * 0.9907 = 1.9814.

0.25 * 0.9907 = (1/4)*0.9907 = 0.247675.

Adding them: 1.9814 + 0.247675 = 2.229075.

So 2.229 approx.

Looking at the options, D is ~2.23, which matches this.

Wait, but the problem states that the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a factor of the options given. So according to our calculation, the factor is approximately 2.229, which is about 2.23, so option D.

But wait, am I certain I didn't make a mistake with the Doppler shift?

Wait, another thing to consider: when a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, which makes it appear cooler than it actually is. Because the emitted wavelength is shorter, implying higher temperature.

Wait, earlier I assumed that T2 is higher than T1 because the observed wavelength is the same, but Star_2 is moving away. Let's confirm.

So, the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, say λ_obs.

Star_1: λ_emit1 = λ_obs.

Star_2: λ_emit2 = λ_obs / (1 + v_r2/c ) → since it's moving away, v_r2 positive, so (1 + v_r2/c ) is greater than 1. So λ_emit2 is less than λ_obs. So the emitted wavelength is shorter, which implies higher temperature.

Since T is inversely proportional to λ_emit, a shorter λ_emit → higher T.

So T2 = (1 + v_r2/c ) * T1.

Which makes T2 larger than T1.

So when computing L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

Which is (1.5)^2 * (1/(1 + v_r2/c ))^4.

Which is 2.25 * (1/(1.002333))^4 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.229.

So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the velocities being given are for the emitting regions, but that's probably not the case. The problem states radial velocities, which affect the observed wavelengths.

But I think the approach is correct.

So the factor is approximately 2.229, so the answer is D) ~2.23.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we start by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

\[
L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4
\]

The ratio of luminosities is given by:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4
\]

### Step 1: Radius Ratio
From the problem, the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2:

\[
\frac{R_1}{R_2} = 1.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = 2.25
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Ratio
The problem states that the observed peak wavelengths (\(\lambda_{\text{obs}}\)) of both stars are the same. Using Wien's law, the temperature of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its peak wavelength:

\[
T = \frac{b}{\lambda_{\text{emit}}}
\]

For Star_1, since its radial velocity (\(v_r\)) is 0, the emitted and observed wavelengths are the same:

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs}}
\]

For Star_2, which has a radial velocity of \(v_r = 700 \, \text{km/s}\), the observed wavelength is Doppler-shifted:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{emit,2}} \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Rearranging for \(\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}\):

\[
\lambda_{\text{emit,2}} = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

Substituting into Wien's law for Star_2:

\[
T_2 = \frac{b}{\lambda_{\text{emit,2}}} = \frac{b}{\frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}} = T_1 \left(1 + \frac{v_r}{c}\right)
\]

Thus, the temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{v_r}{c}}
\]

### Step 3: Substituting Values
The speed of light \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), so:

\[
\frac{v_r}{c} = \frac{700}{3 \times 10^5} \approx 0.002333
\]

\[
1 + \frac{v_r}{c} \approx 1.002333
\]

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{1.002333}
\]

Raising this to the fourth power:

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \frac{1}{(1.002333)^4}
\]

Using the approximation \((1.002333)^4 \approx 1.009365\):

\[
\left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 \approx \frac{1}{1.009365} \approx 0.9907
\]

### Step 4: Final Luminosity Ratio
Substituting into the luminosity ratio formula:

\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = 2.25 \times 0.9907 \approx 2.229
\]

### Step 5: Match with Options
The closest option to \(2.229\) is:

**D) ~2.23**

Answer: D
