Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. I need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D with different pH values and volumes.

Hmm, right. So, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and when it's dissolved in an acid, it should react. The acid is monobasic, so it donates one H+ ion. Let me think about the reaction.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, I believe. It can react with a strong acid like HCl. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. Yeah, that makes sense. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve.

First, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 I have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Let me calculate that.

Fe: 55.85
Each OH group is 17 (16+1). So 3 OHs are 51. So total molar mass is 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check: Fe (55.85) + 3(O (16 each)) → 48 for O, and 3 H (1 each → 3). So 55.85 + 48 +3 = 106.85 g/mol. Yep.

So the mass given is 0.1 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me calculate that accurately.

0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009356 mol. Let's say about 0.000936 mol.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 needs 3 moles of H+ to react. So 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)3 → 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 mol H+ needed.

The acid used is 0.1 M. So the volume needed is moles / concentration. So 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but the options don't have 28.08. Oh
