Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question mentions that both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. Oh, right, the transit method measures the dip in starlight as the planet passes in front, while RV detects the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational tug making the star wobble.

They're asking for the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. The options are given.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors. I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25, right? Oh, but both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio.

So the key factors are the star's temperature, the planet's distance from the star (a), and the planet's radius. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the formula, the planet's radius doesn't directly affect the equilibrium temperature. Because equilibrium temperature is more about how much energy the planet absorbs and radiates. The formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25. So planet radius doesn't matter here. Wait, but wait, no, the star's properties dominate, but the planet's distance (semi-major axis a) is the main factor. Oh, wait, but in this case, we don't have the distance of each planet. Hmm, the question doesn't give the semi-major axes directly. So how do I find a for each planet?

Wait, but the question gives data about the RV shifts. The RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The RV shift is related to the planet's mass and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula for RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) * sin(i)) / ( (M_star + M
