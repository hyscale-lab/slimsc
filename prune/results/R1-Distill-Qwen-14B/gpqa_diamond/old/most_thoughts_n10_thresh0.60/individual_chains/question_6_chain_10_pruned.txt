Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the energy spectrum for a particle in a particular potential. Let me think through this step by step.

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, polar coordinates are used, so r is the radial distance and θ is the angular part.

I think the first thing I should do is try to separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Let me see. The potential has two terms: the first is (1/2)k r², which is purely radial. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Oh, wait, that can be expressed as (3/2)k r² ( (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ), since cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So expanding that, the second term becomes (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Wait, but when you write the potential that way, it's V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Combining the radial terms: (1/2 + 3/4)k r² = (5/4)k r². So the potential becomes (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Hmm, maybe that's helpful.

Wait, but in terms of separation of variables, I should check if the potential separates into functions of r and θ. Let me see: V(r,θ) = [ (5/4)k r² ] + [ (3/4)k r² cos2θ ]. So that's V(r) + V(θ), but the second term is not just a function of θ; it's multiplied by r². Oh wait, that's a problem because then you can't separate r and θ in the Schrödinger equation. So maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential differently. Maybe the potential can be expressed as a sum of a purely radial part and a part that's proportional to cos2θ, but each multiplied by r². So V(r,θ) = A
