Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down step by step. I'm going to think through this as if I'm a student trying to solve it.

Alright, the problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases forms, which is passed through three tubes. 

The first tube is Mg(ClO4)2, which is anhydrous. The second is Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third has red-hot copper. The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 2 doesn't change, and tube 3 gains 0.80g. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure.

The question is about the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Wait, so the setup involves some kind of gas analysis. Let me think about what each of these tubes does.

Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a desiccant, but it's anhydrous. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb moisture, especially water vapor. So when a gas mixture passes through it, any water vapor would be absorbed. The weight gain of 3.60g suggests that this is the mass of water that was absorbed. So, the gas mixture must have had water vapor, which was captured here. So tube 1's gain is H2O: 3.60g.

Then, tube 2 is Ca(OH)2 solution. Ca(OH)2 is a base and can react with acidic gases. If the gas mixture after tube 1 (which removed H2O) now reacts with Ca(OH)2, but here the tube's weight didn't change. That suggests that no reaction occurred. So, the acid gases like CO2 must have been neutralized, but if the weight didn't change, maybe the solution didn't react. Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Oh wait no, the tube's weight didn't change. So, perhaps the gas that passed through didn't react with Ca(OH)2. So, which gases don't react with Ca(OH)2?

Well, CO2 would react, as would H2S or other acidic gases. But if the solution didn't change, maybe those gases weren't present. Alternatively, maybe the gas was something else, like NH3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the gas that passed through was inert or didn't react.

Then, tube 3 has red-hot copper. Copper metal at high temperatures can react with certain gases. The likely candidates are either CO or H2, because they can be oxidized. The reaction would form CuO. The weight gain of 0.80g is probably from the copper oxide formed.

So the gas that reacted in tube 3 is either CO or H2. Let's think about the possible reactions.

If it's CO reacting with copper, the reaction would be:
2 Cu(s) + CO(g) → 2 CuO(s) + C(s) ?

Wait
