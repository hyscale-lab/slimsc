Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distance. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. They give me the production energy E_X as 8 GeV, the mass m_X as 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X as 320 MeV. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very tiny distance, which makes sense because particles decay quickly.

Wait, I remember that decay properties relate to the particle's lifetime. The mean lifetime τ is related to the decay width Γ. Oh right, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes into play here. The uncertainty in energy multiplied by the uncertainty in time is roughly Planck's constant over 2π. So τ ≈ ħ / Γ.

But wait, Γ here is the decay width. Γ is given in MeV, which I need to convert into appropriate units for the calculation. So I should convert Γ_X from MeV to Joules because Planck's constant is in J·s.

Let me jot down the constants I know. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. But since we're using ħ, which is h/(2π), that's about 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Wait, but I also need to convert Γ from MeV to Joules. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So 320 MeV is 320 x 10^6 eV. Let's compute that.

Γ = 320 MeV = 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = ?

Let me calculate that step by step. 320e6 is 3.2e8. Multiply by 1.602e-19: 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = (3.2 * 1.602) * 1e-11. What's 3.2 * 1.602? Let's see: 3*1.602=4.806, 0.2*1.602=0.3204. So 4.806 + 0.3204 = 5.1264. So 5.1264e-11 J.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 3.2e8 multiplied by 1.602e-19 equals 3.2 * 1.602 = 5.1264, exponent is 8 + (-19) = -11. So 5.1264e-11 J.

So Γ is approximately 5.1264e-11 J.

Now, τ = ħ / Γ. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So τ = (1.0545718e-34) / (5.1264e-11) ≈ let's compute that.

Dividing 1.05457e-34 by 5.1264e-11. The exponents: 1e-34 / 1e-11 = 1e-23. So 1.05457 /5.1264 ≈ 0.2057. So τ ≈ 0.2057e-23 seconds, which is 2.057e-24 seconds.

Wait, that seems really short. But particles with large decay widths have short lifetimes, which makes sense here because Γ is 320 MeV, which is quite large.

Now, the decay distance is the speed of the particle multiplied by the lifetime. The particle's speed depends on its energy. But since the production energy is 8 GeV, which is higher than its rest mass (1.2 GeV), it's moving relativistically.

I think the mean decay length is given by L = γ c τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

So I need to calculate the Lorentz factor γ. The energy E is given as 8 GeV. The rest mass is 1.2 GeV, so the energy is much larger than the rest mass. So, E = γ m c².

Wait, but E is the total energy, so E = γ m c². Let me solve for γ. γ = E / (m c²). But E and m are both given in GeV, so I can compute γ.

Wait, E_X is 8 GeV, m_X is 1.2 GeV. So γ = 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... approximately 6.6667.

But wait, let me make sure. Because E = γ m c², and since m is in GeV/c², and E is in GeV, the units should work out. So yes, γ is E/(m c²) but since m is in GeV/c², E/m would have units GeV/(GeV/c²) ) = c². So to get γ, it's E/(m).

Because E = γ m c² → γ = E/(m c²). Wait, but units-wise: m is in GeV/c², so m c² is GeV. So E (GeV) / (m c² (GeV)) ) gives unitless γ. So yes, γ = E_X / m_X = 8 / 1.2 = 6.6667.

Ah, but wait, E_X is the total energy, which is the sum of rest energy and kinetic. So for high energies (E >> m), γ is approximately E/m. Which is correct here.

So γ is approximately 6.6667.

Now, the speed v is approximately c when γ is large. But let's see, in our case, γ is about 6.6667, which is a moderately high value, so v is very close to c.

But perhaps for precise calculation, I should compute v using the relation γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's see: v = c sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

But since γ is 6.6667, 1/γ² is 1/(44.444) ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of that is about 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887 c.

Alternatively, for approximation, maybe I can just take v ≈ c. Since the decay length is going to be so small, even a 1% difference might be significant, but perhaps it's acceptable to take v≈c. Alternatively, I can compute more accurately.

But perhaps the exact value isn't crucial because the options are in the same order of magnitude, but let's proceed.

So, lifetime is τ = 2.057e-24 seconds.

Decay length L = γ v τ. Since v ≈ c, L ≈ γ c τ.

Compute c in meters per second: c ≈ 3e8 m/s.

So L ≈ γ * c * τ.

Putting the numbers in:

γ=6.6667, c=3e8 m/s, τ=2.057e-24 s.

Compute 6.6667 * 3e8 * 2.057e-24.

Let me compute it step by step.

First, 6.6667 * 3e8 = 2.00001e9.

Then multiply by 2.057e-24:

2.00001e9 * 2.057e-24 = (2.00001 * 2.057) * 1e-15.

2.00001 * 2.057 ≈ 4.114.

So L ≈4.114e-15 meters.

Wait, that's 4.114 x 10^-15 m. Looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 5.0223e-16 m

B)4.0655e-15 m

C)5.0223e-15 m

D)4.0655e-16 m

Hmm, my calculation gives about 4.114e-15 m, but option B is 4.0655e-15. Close, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me go back and double-check the steps.

First, the decay width Γ. Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV. So 320e6 eV. Each eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 320e6 * 1.602e-19 = ?

320e6 = 3.2e8. 3.2e8 * 1.602e-19 = (3.2 *1.602) =5.1264, exponent is 8-19= -11 → 5.1264e-11 J. That is correct.

Then τ = ħ / Γ = (1.05457e-34 J s) / (5.1264e-11 J) = 1.05457e-34 /5.1264e-11.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = (1.05457 /5.1264) * 1e-23.

1.05457 /5.1264 ≈ 0.2057. So 0.2057e-23 = 2.057e-24 seconds. That's correct.

γ is 8 GeV / 1.2 GeV = 6.666666... So that's correct.

So L = γ c τ = 6.666666 * 3e8 m/s * 2.057e-24 s.

Compute 6.666666 *3e8: 20e8? Wait, 6.666666 *3 =20? No, 6.666666 *3 is 20? Wait, 6 *3=18, 0.666666 *3=2 →18+2=20. So 6.666666 *3e8 =20e8 =2e9.

So 2e9 m/s * 2.057e-24 s = (2e9) * (2.057e-24) )= (2 * 2.057) * 1e-15.

2 *2.057 is 4.114, so 4.114e-15 meters.

Wait, but the options are B:4.0655e-15 and C:5.0223e-15.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma? Let me check that.

Wait, E = γ m c^2.

But originally, E is the total energy, so E = gamma m c^2. So gamma is E / (m c^2). But since m is in GeV/c², and E is in GeV, m c² is (GeV/c²) * c² = GeV. So gamma is E / (m c²) = (8 GeV) / (1.2 GeV) )= 6.666... So that's correct.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the mean decay length is actually calculated using the velocity times the lifetime. So L = v tau. But wait, no, because the particle is moving, so the mean decay length is gamma c tau.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the velocity more accurately.

Let's compute beta = v/c. Because beta is v/c, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

We have gamma =6.6667. So sqrt(1 - beta²) = 1/gamma → 1/6.6667 ≈0.15. So 1 - beta² = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225. So beta² = 0.9775 → beta = sqrt(0.9775) ≈ 0.9887. So v ≈0.9887 c.

So instead of taking v=c, perhaps a more accurate calculation would use v= beta c.

So L = gamma * beta c tau.

Wait, no. Because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), and L = gamma v tau. Because, the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Wait, no, actually, the mean lifetime in the lab frame is tau = gamma tau_0, where tau_0 is the proper lifetime. So the lifetime is longer by gamma. But the particle is moving, so the decay length is v * tau.

Wait, no. The mean lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0. So the distance is v * tau = v gamma tau_0.

Wait, but tau_0 is the lifetime in the rest frame. So another approach: the mean decay length is L = v * tau, where tau is the lifetime in the lab frame.

Which is tau = gamma tau_0.

So L = v gamma tau_0.

But tau_0 is the proper lifetime, which is ħ/(Gamma). Because the width is Gamma, so tau_0 = ħ/(Gamma).

Hmm, but earlier I computed tau as gamma tau_0. So proper lifetime is tau_0 = ħ/Gamma. So the lab frame lifetime is gamma times that.

So L = v * gamma tau_0 = v gamma (ħ / Gamma).

But v is beta c. So substituting,

L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

But gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2)).

So substituting gamma, we have:

L = beta c * [1/(sqrt(1 - beta^2)))] * (ħ / Gamma).

But beta = v/c. So let's see,

beta / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = beta / sqrt( (1 - beta)(1 + beta) ) ) = [beta] / [sqrt(1 - beta) sqrt(1 + beta) ) ].

But perhaps another approach. Let me compute beta and gamma.

Given gamma =6.6667, beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2)).

gamma^2 = (20/3)^2? Wait, 6.6667 is approximately 20/3. So 20/3 squared is 400/9 ≈44.444.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/(44.444)) = sqrt(1 - 0.0225) = sqrt(0.9775) ≈0.9887.

So beta is about 0.9887.

So L = beta c gamma (ħ / Gamma).

Wait, but earlier approach, L = gamma v tau_0.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Let's think again.

The proper lifetime is tau_0 = hbar / Gamma.

Then the lab lifetime is tau = gamma tau_0.

The distance is v * tau = v gamma tau_0 = gamma v tau_0.

But since v = beta c, and gamma =1/sqrt(1 - beta^2), which is the same as gamma = (1 - beta^2)^-1/2.

Alternatively, let's compute v tau_0 = beta c tau_0.

Then L = gamma v tau_0 = gamma beta c tau_0.

But tau_0 is hbar / Gamma.

So L = gamma beta c (hbar / Gamma).

Wait, let me compute this.

hbar = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Gamma is 5.1264e-11 J.

So hbar / Gamma = 1.05457e-34 / 5.1264e-11 = approximately 2.057e-24 seconds, which matches tau_0.

So,

L = gamma * beta * c * tau_0.

Which is gamma * beta * c * (hbar / Gamma).

Ah, but wait, that's same as gamma * beta * (c hbar / Gamma).

But c hbar is a constant. Let me compute c * hbar.

c = 3e8 m/s.

hbar = 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So c hbar = 3e8 * 1.05457e-34 = 3.1637e-26 J·m.

Then, c hbar / Gamma = 3.1637e-26 / 5.1264e-11 = approximately 6.17e-16 meters.

Wait, but L is gamma * beta * (c hbar / Gamma). So,

gamma is 6.666666,

beta is about 0.9887.

So 6.666666 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.666666 * 0.9887 ≈ let's calculate.

6.666666 * 0.9887 → approximately 6.666666 *0.9887= let me compute:

6 * 0.9887=5.9322,

0.666666 *0.9887 ≈0.66.

So 5.9322 +0.66=6.5922.

So approximately 6.592.

So L ≈6.592 * (6.17e-16 m) → 6.592 *6.17e-16.

Let me compute 6.592 *6.17:

6 *6.17=37.02,

0.592 *6.17 ≈ 3.65.

Total ≈37.02 +3.65=40.67.

So L ≈40.67e-16 m =4.067e-15 m.

Ah, that's about 4.067e-15 m. Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the relationship between the decay width \( \Gamma \), the mean lifetime \( \tau \), and the decay length \( L \). The steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the mean lifetime \( \tau \):**  
   The mean lifetime is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
   \]  
   Here, \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 320 \times 10^6 \, \text{eV} \). Converting \( \Gamma \) to joules:  
   \[
   \Gamma = 320 \times 10^6 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} = 5.1264 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Substituting into the formula for \( \tau \):  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{5.1264 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \):**  
   The Lorentz factor is given by \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \), where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) is the rest mass.  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \), \( \tau \), and the decay length \( L \):**  
   The decay length is given by \( L = \gamma v \tau \), where \( v \) is the particle's velocity. For relativistic particles, \( v \approx c \), so \( L \approx \gamma c \tau \). Substituting \( \gamma = 6.6667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.057 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   L \approx 6.6667 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.057 \times 10^{-24}).
   \]  
   Compute step-by-step:  
   \[
   6.6667 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 2.00001 \times 10^9,
   \]  
   \[
   L \approx (2.00001 \times 10^9) \times (2.057 \times 10^{-24}) = 4.114 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

4. **Refining the calculation for precision:**  
   To improve accuracy, \( v \) is calculated as \( v = \beta c \), where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). For \( \gamma = 6.6667 \):  
   \[
   \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(6.6667)^2}} = \sqrt{1 - 0.0225} \approx 0.9887.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \beta \) into \( L = \gamma \beta c \tau \):  
   \[
   L \approx 6.6667 \times 0.9887 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.057 \times 10^{-24}).
   \]  
   Compute step-by-step:  
   \[
   6.6667 \times 0.9887 \approx 6.592,
   \]  
   \[
   L \approx 6.592 \times (3 \times 10^8) \times (2.057 \times 10^{-24}) \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
   \]

5. **Comparing with the options:**  
   The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.067 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) matches closely with option **B: \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \)**.

**Answer: B**
