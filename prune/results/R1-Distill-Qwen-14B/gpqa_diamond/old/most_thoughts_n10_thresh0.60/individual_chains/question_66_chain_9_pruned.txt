Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincaré symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are A, B, C, D, each combining different symmetries.

Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the fields they involve. But what about the symmetries?

Wait, I think that any effective field theory must respect certain fundamental symmetries. One of the key things I've heard is that the Standard Model itself respects Lorentz symmetry, so SMEFT, being an effective theory based on it, should also respect Lorentz symmetry. That makes sense because the SM is Lorentz invariant, so SMEFT can't violate that. So Lorentz symmetry (1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincaré symmetry. I'm a bit confused here. Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So Poincaré is a bigger symmetry group. But wait, in effective field theories, especially when considering higher-dimension operators, do we necessarily respect Poincaré symmetry? Or is it more about how the operators are constructed.

Wait, no. Effective field theories are typically formulated in a way that respects the symmetries of the underlying theory. The SMEFT is built from the Standard Model, which is a Poincaré-invariant theory
