Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about neutrinos from the Sun. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, especially the proton-proton chain. Oh right, there are different branches in the proton-proton (pp) reactions. The question is about the pp-III branch suddenly stopping.

Wait, what's the pp-III branch? I think the main proton-proton chain is the pp-I branch, which produces helium-4. Then there's the pp-II branch, which might involve boron and produces some neutrinos, and the pp-III branch maybe another variation, possibly involving more protons. Oh, right, the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the others. Or was it lower? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So the question says that the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Since the Sun's energy takes about 8-10 minutes to reach Earth, that means we're considering the neutrinos emitted during that time. Because if the pp-III stops, neutrinos from that process won't reach us anymore, but the others would continue.

The question is about the flux ratio between two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So, what's the contribution of the pp-III branch to these bands?

I remember that the pp-I branch produces lower-energy neutrinos, around 250-500 keV or so. The pp-II branch produces higher-energy neutrinos, maybe up to 800 keV or so. The pp-III branch, if it's a higher energy process, might produce neutrinos in the 800-900 keV range, or maybe even higher. But if pp-III stopped, then any neutrinos from that branch wouldn't be reaching us anymore.

Wait, but how does this affect the flux in the two bands? Let's think: before the pp-III stopped, both bands would have contributions from all branches. But after it stops, the flux in the bands would change depending on how much each branch contributed.

Suppose the pp-III mainly contributes to higher energy neutrinos, like band 2 (800-900 keV). So if it stops, the flux in band 2 would decrease more than band 1.

Wait, but let's get more precise. The main neutrino emission from the Sun comes from the pp-I and the CNO cycles, right? The pp-I produces lower-energy neutrinos, and the pp-II and pp-III produce higher-energy ones.

So, if the pp-III stops, the higher-energy neutrinos (like in band 2) would have a significant drop in flux because the pp-III was a major contributor in that region. Band 1 is in the 700-800 keV range, which might be dominated more by pp-II or pp-I.

Wait, let me think about the neutrino energies. Okay, for the pp-I branch, the dominant neutrino emission is the pep branch, which emits a neutrino in the 1-2 MeV range. But wait, that's higher than the bands in the question. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.
