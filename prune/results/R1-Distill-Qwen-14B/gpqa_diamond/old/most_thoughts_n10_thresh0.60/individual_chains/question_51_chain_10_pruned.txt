Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the net potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, let's think through this carefully.

Alright, the setup is that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I remember that when a charge is near a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute, but since it's grounded, charges can move in or out from the ground.

Wait, wait. Grounded conducting spheres... I think that when a charge is near a grounded conducting sphere, the sphere will induce charges on its surface. But because it's grounded, the sphere's net charge might adjust. Oh right, for a conducting sphere, the charges reside on the surface. So when an external charge q is placed near it, the sphere's induced charges will arrange to minimize potential energy, but since it's grounded, any excess charge would flow away or onto the sphere.

Wait, no, wait. If the sphere is grounded, it can either lose or gain electrons. So if the charge q is positive, the sphere might have negative charges induced, but since it's grounded, those negative charges could leave the sphere. Hmm, no, wait. No, the sphere being grounded allows charges to flow between the sphere and the earth. So the sphere's potential is the same as the ground's, which is zero.

Wait, when a charge is placed near a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges rearrange. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges are such that the internal electric field is zero. But when it's grounded, the sphere's potential is fixed at zero. So the presence of the
