Okay, so I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product of this reaction sequence. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

First, the starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That structure sounds a bit complicated, but I think it's a norbornene derivative with a tert-butoxy group attached. Norbornene is a bicyclic compound with two double bonds, right? So the tert-butoxy is at the 7 position.

Next, it's combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, but wait, what's happening here? Oh, maybe it's a substitution reaction. The starting material has an oxygen in the tert-butoxy group, which is an ether. But sodium iodide... Wait, perhaps it's more about the dibromomethyl groups. The other compound has two dibromomethyl groups attached to the cyclohexadiene.

I remember that when there are dibromomethyl groups and a nucleophile like iodide is present, it might lead to elimination or substitution. Oh wait, but in this case, maybe it's an alkylation. The tert-butoxy group is an excellent leaving group under certain conditions. Oh no, wait, the tert-butoxy is an ether, so maybe it's undergoing some kind of elimination or perhaps the iodide is acting as a nucleophile.

Wait, another thought: the starting material is bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene, which is norbornene. The substituent is at position 7, which is the bridgehead. So when it reacts with 2 equivalents of the other diene, perhaps this is a Diels-Alder reaction? Because norbornene is a good diene in Diels-Alder reactions. Wait, but the other compound, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene, is a dienophile perhaps?

Wait, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups. So maybe the reaction is a Diels-Alder where the norbornene is the diene and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile? But wait, the dienophile usually has a double bond. Oh, but this compound is a diene as well. Hmm, maybe it's a [4+4] cycloaddition? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the dibromomethyl groups are leaving groups, so the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps the iodide is causing an elimination. Wait, when you have a dihalide and a strong base like sodium iodide, you might get dehydrohalogenation. But I'm not sure how that applies here.

Wait, the starting molecule has the structure bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with a tert-butoxy group. The tert-butoxy is O(C(CH2)3). So, in the presence of a base like sodium iodide, maybe the tert-butoxy group is deprotonated, but wait, tert-butoxy is already a strong base? Wait, no, iodide
