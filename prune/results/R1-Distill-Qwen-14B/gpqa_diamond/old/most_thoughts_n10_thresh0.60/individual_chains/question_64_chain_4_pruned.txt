Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the problem says.

We have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B that weigh 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air, which probably means it's a decomposition reaction. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through three tubes: first anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and then red-hot copper. 

The results are: tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP). 

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are 13, 15, 17, 19.

Hmm. Let's try to break this down. 

First, the gases formed from heating salts A and B. Heating metal salts often leads to decomposition into metal and some gas, like CO2, SO3, H2O, etc. Since Mg(ClO4)2 is in the first tube, which is a drying agent. When it absorbs moisture, it gains weight. So tube 1 probably absorbed water vapor. So the gas that reacted with Mg(ClO4)2 is water vapor, H2O. The gain is 3.60g. 

Then, the second tube has Ca(OH)2 solution. If the weight didn't change, that implies that no CO2 was present. Because CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, which would increase the tube's weight. Since no change, maybe the CO2 wasn't there, or perhaps it was all absorbed, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the gas wasn't CO2. Hmm.

Wait, but the gas that passed through tube 2 didn't cause any reaction. So what gases don't react with Ca(OH)2? Maybe NH3? Or maybe it was inert. Wait, but the gas C collected in the end was 2.24 liters at STP, which is 0.1 mol (since STP is 22.4 L/mol). So gas C is 0.1 moles.

Wait, let me think. The gases after decomposition pass through Mg(ClO4)2, which absorbs H2O. So the water is gone. Then in the second tube, which is Ca(OH)2 solution, if any CO2 was present, it would react. But since the weight didn't change, maybe there's no CO2. So perhaps the only gas left is something else.

Then, the third tube is red-hot copper. Red-hot copper would react with certain gases. For example, CO2 at high temperatures can react with copper, but wait, CO2 doesn't react with Cu unless it's in the presence of something else. Alternatively, sulfur dioxide can react with copper. Wait, when SO2 is passed through hot copper, it can be oxidized. Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, more accurately, if the gas is CO2 and it's passed through red-hot copper in an inert atmosphere, I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the gas is H2S, but that's probably not the case here. Wait, let's think again. 

The third tube gains 0.80g. That's CuO formed. So the reaction is probably Cu + gas → CuO. What gases would cause copper to form CuO? Let's see. If the gas is O2, but that's unlikely because the salts were heated without air, so O2 might not be present. Alternatively, SO3 gas? No, because SO3 is a strong acid and would react in earlier steps, perhaps. Wait, maybe it's CO. Wait, CO can react with copper oxide. Or maybe, the gas is H2, but that's not obvious.

Wait, perhaps the gas is H2O vapor. But H2O wouldn't react with
