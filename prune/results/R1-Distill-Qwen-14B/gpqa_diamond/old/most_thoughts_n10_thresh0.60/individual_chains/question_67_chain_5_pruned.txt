Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l=1 because p orbitals are l=1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, wait. Oh right, the notation is |l1, l2, L, M>. So l1 and l2 are both 1, L is 2, and M is -1. 

The question is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ. So each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is -ħ. Let me remember how angular momentum states work.

In quantum mechanics, when you combine two angular momenta, you can have a total angular momentum which is the sum. The possible L values go from |l1 - l2| to l1 + l2 in integer steps. Here, l1 and l2 are both 1, so L can be 0, 1, or 2. The given state has L=2, so that's the maximum possible. 

But what about the individual components? Each Li has possible m values from -li to +li. So for each electron, L1z can be -1ħ, 0, or +1ħ, same for L2z.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. I think the coupled state can be expressed as a linear combination of product states. Wait, product states would be |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2>, which would be |1, m1>|1, m2>. 

The coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> is a sum over all possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M. But in this case, M is -1. So the state is a combination where m1 + m2 = -1. 

But wait, the problem says we're ignoring spin angular momentum, so we're only considering orbital angular momentum here. 

So the question is about the joint probability of measuring L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ. Because each L1z and L2z is being measured, we're looking for the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z eigenvalue is m1 * ħ, so if it's -ħ, m1 is -1. Same for m2.

But let's see what the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> looks like in terms of the product states |1, m1>|1, m2>. The coupled state is a combination of these product states where m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs are:
- (-1, 0)
- (0, -1)

Wait, because m1 + m2 = -1. So the possible m1 and m2 are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. Because each m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the state |1,1,2,-
