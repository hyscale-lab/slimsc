Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when atoms are excited, it relates to their energy states. I remember that the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere has to do with the thermal energy of the star. Oh wait, LTE—oh right, Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So each region is in equilibrium, and we can use Boltzmann distribution here.

So Boltzmann distribution says that the population of energy levels is proportional to exp(-E/(kT)), where E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is temperature. The ratio of the populations of two energy levels would be given by (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the levels.

In this problem, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote that as ΔE = 1.38e-23 J.

The problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as those in star_2. So the excitation level ratio is 2 for star_1 relative to star_2. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: Let me denote the excitation (population) as n for each star. So n1 (from star_1) is twice n2 (from star_2). But wait, wait—wait, the problem says that the iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited. So the excitation level (n) for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So n1 = 2 * n2.

But wait, how does that relate to the temperatures? Because the ratio of populations depends on the temperatures and the energy difference.

Let me think: For each star, the population ratio between the upper and lower energy levels is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is n_upper1 / n_lower1 = exp(-ΔE/(k T1)), and similarly for star 2, it's n_upper2 / n_lower2 = exp(-ΔE/(k T2)).

But wait, the question is about the overall excitation level. Oh wait, maybe each star's exc
