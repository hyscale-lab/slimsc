Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking at what energy the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Hmm, I remember that when high-energy gamma-rays interact with the CMB, they can produce electron-positron pairs. This process is called photon-photon annihilation, right? So the reaction is gamma + gamma -> e+ + e-. 

I think this process is significant because it affects how long high-energy photons can survive in the universe. If the energy is high enough, the gamma-rays can annihilate with CMB photons quickly, so their lifetime is limited by this process. 

Wait, the problem is about the energy where the lifetime is limited by this process. So I probably need to calculate the gamma-ray energy where this annihilation process becomes effective enough to limit their lifetime.

I recall that the cross-section for this annihilation depends on the energy of the gamma-rays. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of the interaction happening. I think at very high energies, the cross-section peaks and then decreases, or maybe it's the opposite. Oh wait, maybe it's a threshold energy problem.

The threshold for pair production would be when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to create an electron-positron pair. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, but wait, each photon isn't enough on its own. So the minimum energy required for each photon to produce an electron-positron pair when colliding with another photon. 

Wait, no, the CMB photon is low energy. Let me think. The CMB photon has average energy 1e-3 eV, which is really low. The gamma-ray is high energy. So for pair production to happen, the sum of the energies of the two photons must be at least twice the electron rest mass (2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV). 

But each photon's energy must be at least the electron rest mass divided by 2? Or is it that one photon can be high energy and the other low? Let me think about the invariant quantity in this process.

The center-of-mass energy squared s is given by (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. Since the CMB photon is moving in the opposite direction for maximum energy, so the momenta are opposite. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 (since p1 and p2 are in opposite directions, their sum would be |p1 - p2|, but wait, the energy is E1 + E2 because they are moving towards each other. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let's think in terms of the invariant s.

The invariant s for two photons is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since photons are massless, E = pc for each. So for photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, say p1 in +x and p2 in -x. So p1 c = E1, p2 c = E2. So the invariant s becomes (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 - E2)^2. Let me compute that: (E1+E2)^2 = E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2². (E1 - E2)^2 = E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2². So subtracting, s = [E1² + 2 E1 E2 + E2²] - [E1² - 2 E1 E2 + E2²] = 4 E1 E2.

So s = 4 E1 E2. For pair production, we need s >= (2 m_e c²)^2. So 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2. Simplify this: E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2. 

Wait, let me think again. The rest mass of the pair is 2 m_e c², so the invariant s must be at least (2 m_e c²)^2. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2 = 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2. So 4 E1 E2 >= (2 m_e c²)^2 => E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2.

Wait, but for two photons moving in opposite directions, so the maximum possible s is 4 E1 E2, right?

So the condition for pair production is E1 E2 >= (m_e c²)^2.

In this problem, E1 is the gamma-ray's energy, and E2 is the CMB photon's energy. The average CMB photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So E2 is about 1e-3 eV, which is 0.001 eV. 

Let me compute m_e c². The rest mass energy of the electron is about 0.511 MeV, which is 0.511e6 eV. So (m_e c²)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2. Then E1 * E2 >= (0.511e6 eV)^2.

We can solve for E1. E1 >= (0.511e6 eV)^2 / E2.

Given E2 is 1e-3 eV, substituting in:

E1 >= (0.511e6)^2 / (1e-3) eV.

Calculate that:

(0.511e6)^2 = (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61121e11 eV².

Divide by 1e-3 eV: 2.61121e11 / 1e-3 = 2.61121e14 eV.

Wait, but 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e8 TeV, which is way higher than any of the options given. The options are in the range of 1e5 GeV, which is 1e2 TeV (since 1 GeV is 1e3 MeV, 1 TeV is 1e3 GeV). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's check the units again. m_e c² is 0.511 MeV, which is 511,000 eV, so 5.11e5 eV. So m_e c² squared is (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2.

E1 * E2 >= 2.61e11 eV². We have E2 = 1e-3 eV. So E1 >= 2.61e11 / (1e-3) = 2.61e14 eV.

Wait, 2.61e14 eV is 2.61e8 TeV. Because 1 TeV is 1e12 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 261e12 eV, which is 261 TeV.

But the options are all in GeV, and the given options are like 1e5 GeV, which is 1e2 TeV. So 1e5 GeV is 1e5 * 1e9 eV = 1e14 eV.

Wait, wait. Wait, 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 1e5 GeV is 1e14 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 261 GeV. Hmm, but that's way below the options given. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, (0.511 MeV)^2 is (511,000 eV)^2.

Wait, 511,000 eV is 5.11e5 eV. Squaring that gives (5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11 (eV)^2. So correct.

E1 >= (2.61e11) / (1e-3) = 2.61e14 eV.

2.61e14 eV is 261,000 GeV, because 1 GeV is 1e9 eV. So 2.61e14 eV is 261,000 GeV, which is 2.61e5 GeV. Wait, 2.61e5 GeV is 261,000 GeV. So 2.61e5 GeV is option C, which is 2.6e5 GeV. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about the lifetime being limited by this process. So, perhaps I need to consider the photon's lifetime in the universe due to this annihilation. The lifetime tau is related to the mean free path or the interaction probability.

But maybe the question is asking when the photon's lifetime (proper lifetime) is smaller than the age of the universe, so that their survival is limited. Alternatively, the mean lifetime is determined by the interaction rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the energy where the photon's lifetime due to this process becomes comparable to the age of the universe.

The lifetime tau can be found using the relation:

tau ≈ (gamma-ray energy) * (mean free time)^(-1)

Wait, but perhaps more accurately, the mean free time tau is the inverse of the interaction rate, which is cross-section multiplied by the number density of target photons.

The interaction rate gamma_rate = sigma * n_photon * v, where sigma is the cross-section, n_photon is the number density of photons, and v is the relative velocity.

Wait, but for very high-energy photons, the cross-section for pair production can be approximated. I think the cross-section for photon-photon pair production at high energies is given by sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E_cm^2) * ln( ... ), but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, I think at high energies, the cross-section for pair production scales as sigma ~ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E^2), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the cross-section formula for photon-photon annihilation. The cross-section for gamma gamma -> e+ e- is approximately:

sigma = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^4 c^6) / (E1 E2) ) * [ ln( (2 E1 E2)/(m_e c^2)^2 ) - 1/2 ]

But since E1 is much larger than E2 (since the gamma-ray is much higher energy than CMB photons), we can approximate E1 ≈ E, E2 ≈ 0.001 eV. So the cross-section would be approximately sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) * (m_e^4 c^6) / (E * E2).

But wait, let me get the formula right. I think the cross-section for this process is given by:

sigma = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (s) ) * (ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)) - 1),

where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, but earlier I found that s = 4 E1 E2.

So s =4 E1 E2.

So substituting s into the cross-section formula:

sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (4 E1 E2) ) * [ ln( (4 E1 E2)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) ) ) - 1 ]

Simplify the argument of the log:

(4 E1 E2)/(4 m_e^2 c^4) )= (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4).

Since E1 >> m_e c^2 (because the gamma-ray is high energy), and E2 is small (~1e-3 eV), but the product E1 E2 could be on the order of m_e^2 c^4, which is (0.511 MeV)^2.

Wait, but the cross-section is only significant when E1 E2 is about (m_e c^2)^2, which brings us back to the threshold condition.

But perhaps for the purpose of calculating the mean free time, I can model the cross-section as sigma = (constant) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2), but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe the cross-section can be approximated as sigma ~ (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1^2) because E1 is much larger than E2.

Wait, another approach: the photon-photon cross-section for pair production is given by sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (m_e^4 c^6) / (E1^2 E2) ) [ ln( E1/(m_e c^2) ) - 1/2 ].

But I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to look for the standard formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the typical approach is to equate the photon's energy with the threshold for pair production, using the CMB photon's energy.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave me E1 = ( (m_e c^2)^2 ) / E2, which for E2=1e-3 eV gives E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511e6)^2 * 1e3 eV.

Calculating that:

0.511e6 is 5.11e5, so squaring gives about 2.61e11. Multiply by 1e3 gives 2.61e14 eV, which is 2.61e5 GeV. So option C is 2.6e5 GeV, which matches this result.

So, the gamma-rays with energy around 2.6e5 GeV would have their energy product (E1 E2) equal to (m_e c^2)^2, which is the threshold for pair production.

But wait, the question is about the energy where the gamma-ray's lifetime is limited by this process. So it's when the interaction is significant enough that the photon's lifetime is no longer cosmologically long. So the gamma-ray's lifetime is inversely proportional to the interaction rate.

The interaction rate is given by the product of the cross-section and the photon density. So, gamma_rate = sigma * n_photon * v.

n_photon is the number density of CMB photons. The CMB photon density is approximately 411 photons per cubic cm, or about 411 cm^-3. Converting to m^-3: 411e6 m^-3 (since 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m^3).

Wait, let me compute it accurately. The CMB photon density is about 411 cm^-3. So per cubic meter, it's 411e6 m^-3 (since 1 m^3 is 1e6 cm^3, so 411 cm^-3 is 411 * 1e6 m^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3).

The relative velocity v between the gamma-ray and the CMB photon can be approximated as the speed of light c, since both are moving at nearly c.

So the interaction rate is sigma * n_photon * c.

The mean free time tau is the inverse of the interaction rate: tau = 1/(sigma * n_photon * c).

The lifetime tau must be compared to the age of the universe. If tau is much smaller than the age, the gamma-rays would have been annihilated quickly, so their lifetime is limited by this process.

So let's compute tau.

But since I'm looking for the energy E where tau is comparable to the age of the universe, I can set tau ≈ age of universe.

The age of the universe is roughly 13.8 billion years, which is about 4.3e17 seconds.

But how does sigma depend on E?

Earlier, the cross-section for pair production is sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1 E2) ) * [ ln( (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) - 0.5 ]

But when E1 E2 is much larger than (m_e c^2)^2, the logarithm term becomes significant. Let me consider E1 E2 >> (m_e c^2)^2, so ln(E1 E2/(m_e^2 c^4)) is approximately ln(E1/(m_e c^2)) + ln(E2/(m_e c^2)), but since E2 is much less than m_e c^2, perhaps this term can be approximated differently.

Alternatively, perhaps for E1 >> m_e c^2 and E2 << m_e c^2, the cross-section can be approximated as sigma ≈ (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4) / (E1^2) ) * [ ln(E1/(m_e c^2)) ]

Wait, maybe I should look for a standard formula for the photon-photon cross-section for pair production.

I recall that the cross-section for gamma + gamma -> e+ + e- is given by:

sigma = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2) * [ ln( (E1 E2)/(m_e c^2)^2) ) - 1/2 ]

This is the Klein-Nishina formula for photon-photon cross-section at high energies.

So sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2) * [ ln(s/(4 m_e^2 c^4)) - 1/2 ]

Wait, but since s = 4 E1 E2, as established earlier, s/(4 m_e^2 c^4) ) = (E1 E2 )/(m_e^2 c^4).

So sigma becomes:

sigma = (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E1 E2) [ ln( (E1 E2)/(m_e^2 c^4) ) - 1/2 ]

So, let me plug in the numbers.

E1 is the gamma-ray energy, E2 is the CMB photon energy, 1e-3 eV.

Let me denote E1 as E.

So E2 = 1e-3 eV.

So E1 E2 = E * 1e-3 eV.

The term inside the log is (E * 1e-3) / (m_e c^2)^2.

We can compute (m_e c^2)^2 as (0.511 MeV)^2 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 = 2.61e11 eV².

So (E * 1e-3 eV) / (2.61e11 eV²) = E/(2.61e14 eV).

So the argument of the logarithm is E/(2.61e14 eV).

Assuming E is much greater than 2.61e14 eV, the logarithm is approximately ln(E/(2.61e14 eV)).

So sigma becomes:

sigma = (8 pi/3) * (m_e^2 c^4) / (E * 1e-3 eV) * [ ln(E/(2.61e14 eV)) - 0.5 ]

Hmm, but for E around 2.6e14 eV (which is 2.6e5 GeV), which was our threshold condition, the term inside the log becomes ln(1) = 0, so ln(1) - 0.5 is -0.5. But that can't be right because the cross-section would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps I should reconsider.

Wait, the actual condition for pair production is when E1 E2 >= (m_e c^2)^2.

At E1 E2 = (m_e c^2)^2, the argument is 1, so ln(1) is zero. So the term inside the square brackets becomes [0 - 0.5 ] = -0.5. That would make sigma negative, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the formula is only valid when E1 E2 >> (m_e c^2)^2. So perhaps I should consider that when E1 E2 is much larger than (m_e c^2)^2, the logarithm is positive.

So, when E is much larger than (m_e c^2)^2 / E2, which for E2=1e-3 eV is much larger than 2.61e14 eV, then the logarithm term is positive.

But maybe for the purpose of this problem, the peak of the cross-section occurs around the threshold energy, so the dominant process is near the threshold.

But perhaps the problem is just looking for the threshold energy, which is E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2.

Which gives E1 = (0.511e6 eV)^2 / (1e-3 eV) = (0.511e6)^2 * 1e3 eV.

Calculating:

0.511e6 = 5.11e5 eV.

(5.11e5)^2 = 2.61e11.

Multiply by 1e3: 2.61e14 eV.

Which is 2.61e5 GeV (since 1 GeV = 1e9 eV).

So that's 2.6e5 GeV, which is option C.

But wait, the problem is about the gamma-ray's lifetime being limited by this process. So, the process becomes significant when the cross-section is large enough that the interaction time is comparable to the age of the universe.

So, the lifetime tau is given by 1/(gamma_rate) = 1/(sigma * n_photon * c).

If tau is less than the age of the universe, then the gamma-rays are effectively annihilated within the age of the universe, so their lifetime is limited by this process.

So let me compute tau in terms of E.

tau = 1/(sigma * n_photon * c )

sigma is (8 pi/3) (m_e^2 c^4)/(E * 1e-3 eV) [ ln(E/(2.61e14 eV)) - 0.5 ]

n_photon is 411 cm^-3 = 4.11e8 m^-3.

c is 3e8 m/s.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to just find the threshold energy, which is E1 = (m_e c^2)^2 / E2, which is 2.6e5 GeV. So the correct answer is C.

So the answer should be C.


To determine the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays in the universe is limited by their annihilation with CMB photons, we analyze the photon-photon annihilation process, $\gamma\gamma \rightarrow e^+e^-$. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Threshold Energy for Pair Production**:  
   For pair production to occur, the combined energy of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame must be at least equal to the rest mass energy of the electron-positron pair, $2m_e c^2 = 1.022$ MeV. The invariant quantity $s$ for two photons is given by:  
   \[
   s = 4E_1E_2
   \]  
   where $E_1$ is the energy of the gamma-ray and $E_2$ is the energy of the CMB photon. At the threshold, $s = (2m_e c^2)^2$, leading to:  
   \[
   E_1E_2 \geq (m_e c^2)^2
   \]  
   Substituting $E_2 = 10^{-3}$ eV (the average energy of a CMB photon), the threshold energy for the gamma-ray is:  
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{(m_e c^2)^2}{E_2}
   \]  
   The rest mass energy of the electron is $m_e c^2 = 0.511$ MeV $= 5.11 \times 10^5$ eV. Squaring this gives:  
   \[
   (m_e c^2)^2 = (5.11 \times 10^5)^2 = 2.61 \times 10^{11} \, \text{eV}^2
   \]  
   Substituting $E_2 = 10^{-3}$ eV:  
   \[
   E_1 \geq \frac{2.61 \times 10^{11}}{10^{-3}} = 2.61 \times 10^{14} \, \text{eV}
   \]  
   Converting to GeV ($1$ GeV $= 10^9$ eV):  
   \[
   E_1 \geq 2.61 \times 10^5 \, \text{GeV}
   \]  

2. **Interpretation of the Result**:  
   The calculated energy, $2.61 \times 10^5$ GeV, corresponds to the threshold energy where gamma-rays begin to interact significantly with CMB photons via pair production. At this energy, the interaction rate becomes high enough to limit the gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe.

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The closest option to the calculated threshold energy is **C) $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV**.

Thus, the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by annihilation with CMB photons is **C) $2.6 \times 10^5$ GeV**.

Answer: C
