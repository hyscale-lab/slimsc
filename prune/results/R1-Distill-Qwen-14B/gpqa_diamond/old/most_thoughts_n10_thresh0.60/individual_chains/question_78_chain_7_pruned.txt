Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric and magnetic potentials due to a moving point charge. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a certain time t and position r. The setup involves a charge q moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. So, d is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to the observation point.

Hmm, I remember that potentials in electromagnetism are usually calculated using certain formulas, especially when charges are moving. For static charges, the scalar potential is straightforward, but when the charge is moving, things get more complicated because of relativity and the effects of motion on the fields.

Wait, the options given involve expressions that don't look like the simple Coulomb potential. So this must involve the potentials due to a moving charge, considering retarded time or something like that.

I think the scalar potential for a moving charge isn't just q/(4πε₀ r) anymore, because the charge is moving, and the fields are affected by its velocity. Or wait, no—maybe under certain approximations or in certain gauges, it still looks similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the retarded potentials. Retarded time is when you consider that the fields at a point r are due to the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, which is the time it takes for the field to travel from the charge to the observation point.

The general expressions for the potentials for a moving charge are derived from the Liénard's equations, right? So the scalar potential V and vector potential A can be found using these.

The scalar potential from a moving charge is given by something like V = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/|r - r') ) evaluated at the retarded time. But wait, if the charge is moving, doesn't that affect the potential? Or maybe not directly—maybe it's the same as the static case, but with r as the distance at the retarded time.

Wait, no. For the scalar potential, I think it's just the static potential evaluated at the retarded position. So V(r, t) would be (q/(4πε₀)) /
