Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it.

The question says that the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction at θ=30 degrees and the form of f.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the angle. For a dipole antenna, for example, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (θ=90 degrees) and falls off with θ. So, the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle θ.

The function f probably describes the radiation pattern, which is a function of θ. The power radiated per unit solid angle would be maximum in some direction. So, the total power A is the integral of f over all solid angles, which should be a constant.

Wait, but the question gives the maximum power as A. So, A is the maximum value of f. Then, the fraction of A at θ=30 degrees would be f(30)/A.

I think for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far zone is proportional to sin²θ. Oh wait, right, the dipole's radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and the intensity (which is proportional
