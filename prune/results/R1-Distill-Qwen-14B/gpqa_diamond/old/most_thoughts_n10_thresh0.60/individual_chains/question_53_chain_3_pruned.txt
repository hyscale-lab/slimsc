Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to figure it out step by step. So the question is about determining the molecular formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound, and they've given some spectroscopy data—FTIR and 1H NMR.

First, the FTIR shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Ester groups have characteristic peaks around 1740 cm⁻¹ for the carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So that tells me the compound has an ester functional group, which typically comes from an ester linkage, like R-O-CO-O-R' or something like that. Wait, no, ester is more like R-O-CO-R', right? So it's a carbonyl group connected to an oxygen which is connected to an OR group.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. Let's parse what each part means. The NMR shows six signals. The first two are aromatic-H, so that suggests there are two different types of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents are in positions that cause the aromatic protons to split into two sets. Wait, di-substituted benzene rings can have different substitution patterns. For example, if the substituents are para to each other, the aromatic protons would be all equivalent, but since there are two signals here, that suggests that the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two sets of aromatic protons. So maybe meta substitution? Because in para, all H's are equivalent, but in meta, perhaps two sets due to symmetry. Wait, no—wait, if it's a di-substituted benzene, the number of signals depends on the substituents and their positions. Let me think: di-substituted can be para, meta, or ortho. For para, the ring has two equivalent H's on each carbon, but actually, in para substitution, all four aromatic H's are equivalent, so you'd get one peak. But in the NMR, there are two aromatic signals. So that suggests that the substituents are in positions that cause the ring to have two sets of non-equivalent H's.

Wait, but wait. Maybe it's a substituent that's not symmetrical. Let's say the substituents are such that the ring isn't perfectly symmetric.
