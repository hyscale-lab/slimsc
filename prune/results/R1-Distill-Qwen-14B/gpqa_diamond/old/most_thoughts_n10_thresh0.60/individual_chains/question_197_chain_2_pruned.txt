Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying the product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X is based on the given IR and NMR data. Let's start with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which is a broad range, probably indicating an -OH group or maybe an alkyne. Wait, but the presence of a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. Then there are peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those could be from aromatic rings, like C=C stretching. So maybe Compound X is an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an acid.

Looking at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet (but broad, denoted by bs). High ppm for a proton, maybe an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, in carboxylic acids, the proton is usually around 10-12 ppm and appears as a broad singlet. So that might be a carboxylic acid group. Alternatively, an aldehyde would be around 9-10, but it's more upfield than 10.5. So maybe it's a COOH group.

Next, the NMR has a peak at 8.0 ppm, a doublet integrating for 2H. Then another at 7.2 ppm, also a doublet, 2H. That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. The doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons, like in a para-substituted benzene. So maybe it's a benzene ring with substituents in the para positions.

Then, the peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 (m, 2H), 1.4 (d, 3H), and 0.9 (t, 3H). Let's think about this. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2 (like a CH2CH2CH3 group). The doublet at 1.4 ppm with 3H suggests a CH2CH(CH3) group maybe? Or perhaps a geminal group. Wait, 1.4 ppm is a bit upfield for a CH3, but more like a CH(CH3) something.

Putting that together, perhaps it's a branching. Let's consider the possible structure. There's a benzene ring with substituents. One substituent is a COOH group (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and another substituent is an alkyl chain. The NMR suggests some branching on the alkyl chain.

So, for the substituents on the benzene, we have a COOH group at one position and an alkyl group at the para position. Because the aromatic protons are a pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H, that suggests that the substituents are in the para positions. So the structure would be something like 4-ethylsomething benzene with a COOH group.

Wait, but looking at the peaks: the 1H NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which usually indicates a CH2CH2CH3. So maybe this is a longer chain. Let's think about the possible structure.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a methylene (CH2) group near another group. Maybe like a CH2 connected to a CH(CH3), which is connected to the benzene. Let's see.

So let's try to build the structure. Benzene ring with a COOH group at position 1 and an alkyl group at position 4. The alkyl group would be something like (CH2)2CH(CH2CH3) or another branch.

Wait, looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm: COOH proton, broad singlet.
- 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm: aromatic protons, para-substituted.
- 2.9 ppm: a methine (CH) group, maybe adjacent to another CH2.
- 1.7 ppm: two protons, perhaps a CH2 connected to a CH.
- 1.4 ppm: a CH3 group attached to a CH (maybe a CH(CH3) group).
- 0.9 ppm: a CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, maybe the alkyl group is a pentyl group with branching. Let's see: from benzene, the substituent is a CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2 group. Wait, that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. Hmm.

Wait, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet for 3H. That's typical of a CH3 attached to a CH, like CH(CH3). So the group would be something like CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think again.

The 1H NMR:

1.7 ppm is a multiplet for 2H. That could be a CH2 connected to another CH2 or a CH.

So perhaps the substituent is something like CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3). Let me try to draw this.

Wait, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH(CH3) group. So the substituent on the benzene is a CH2CH2CH(CH3). No, that doesn't quite add up. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about that. A sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). But wait, let's see:

The substituent would be attached to the benzene ring as -CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH3). But wait, let's think about the NMR.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be the CH group (the quaternary carbon would have the CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3) group). So the substituent would be CH2CH(CH2CH2CH3), but wait, that would be a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an isobutyl group.

Wait, isobutyl group is CH2CH(CH3
