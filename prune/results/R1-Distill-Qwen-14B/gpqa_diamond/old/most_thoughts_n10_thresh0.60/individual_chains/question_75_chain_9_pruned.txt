Okay, so I've got this question here about a genetics experiment gone wrong, and I'm trying to figure out why the protein isn't overexpressing. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They've introduced a coding sequence with an influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine and selected for antibiotic resistance. But when they tested the expression, the protein wasn't overexpressed. They looked at the plus strand construct and found a specific sequence issue.

The question gives four options, and I need to figure out which one is the problem. Let's break it down.

First, the construct's coding sequence starts with the ATG, which is the start codon. Then, it has the hemagglutinin tag sequence, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. The plus strand sequence provided is the coding (sense) strand, so the mRNA would be complementary to this, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the construct is a plasmid. The plus strand is the same as the sense strand, which would be the same as the mRNA except for T vs U. So the sequence provided is the coding strand, which would be what the mRNA is based on.

Looking at the sequence, the very beginning is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon. Then comes TAC, which is tyrosine. Wait, that's the start of the HA tag? But wait, the HA tag is a specific peptide sequence. It's usually a short tag, like YPYDHH or something. Wait, the construct has the HA tag added at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence should start with the HA tag's nucleotides, then the GADD45G sequence.

Wait, but looking at the sequence, let me count the first few codons. The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G...

ATG is Met. TAC is Tyr. CCA is Pro. TAC is Tyr again. GAT is Asp.
