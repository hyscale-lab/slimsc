Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, what's parallax? Oh right, the parallax of a star is the apparent shift in its position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The closer the star is, the larger the parallax. So, high parallax means nearby, low means farther away.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, does that mean uniform in space or uniform in some other way? I think when they say uniformly distributed in the sky, it's often assumed that the number density of stars is uniform in space, not on the celestial sphere. So imagine the universe as a uniform cloud of stars, each with same density in every direction.

So, the number of stars per unit volume is constant, let's say n. But the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. Parallax is inversely related to distance. So parallax plx = 1/d, where d is distance. Wait, actually, the formula is plx (in arcseconds) is approximately 1/(distance in parsecs). So yes, plx = 1/d, with d in parsecs.

Now, if I want to find the number of stars per unit plx (like per 1 arcsecond), I need to relate that to the distance. Let me think about how many stars lie in a shell between d and d + dd. The volume of that shell is 4π d² dd (since it's a spherical shell). The number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd, where n is the number density (stars per unit volume).

But we want the number per unit plx. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So, substituting d, the number of stars in a shell is n * 4π (1/plx)^2 (d d). Wait, wait, because if d = 1/plx, then dd is the change in d, which would correspond to a change in plx. Let me see.

Wait, let's express the number as a function of plx. Let's say we have a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The corresponding parallax plx is 1/d, so the change in plx when d changes by dd is
