Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The problem says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Also, the photospheres are in LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, that means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here, I think.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas to the temperature. The formula is something like (n_i / n_j) = exp( - (E_i - E_j) / (k*T) ), where n_i and n_j are the populations of two energy levels, E_i and E_j are their energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this case, the energy difference ΔE is E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Let me denote the excited state as higher energy, so E_i is higher than E_j. So, the ratio for star_1 would be n1_i / n1_j = exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly, for star_2, it's n2_i / n2_j = exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ).

The problem states that in star_1, the excited level is twice as excited as in star_2. Wait, I need to clarify what that means exactly. Oh, wait, the atoms in star_1's photosphere have twice the excitation in a specific level. So perhaps the population ratio is different. Oh, wait, maybe n_i / n_j is twice for star_1 compared to star_2. So, (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j). Or is it the other way around? Let me make sure.

Wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as in star_2. That probably means the population of the excited state is higher, so n1_i is higher than n2_i. But wait, let me think. The ratio n_i/(n_j) is proportional to the excitation. So if in star_1, the ratio is twice that in star_2, then (n1_i/n1_j) = 2*(n2_i/n2_j). Because higher ratio implies more excited state population relative to the ground state.

So, setting up the equation: (n1_i / n1_j) = 2 * (n2_i / n2_j)

From Boltzmann, each ratio is exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So,

exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Wait, no, wait. Let me substitute the ratios. Let me express each ratio as per Boltzmann.

n_i/n_j = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for star_1: n1_i/n1_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T1))

For star_2: n2_i/n2_j = exp(-ΔE/(k T2))

According to the problem, n1_i/n1_j = 2 * (n2_i/n2_j). So,

exp(-ΔE/(k T1)) = 2 * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

Taking natural logs on both sides to simplify:

-ΔE/(k T1) = ln(2) + (-ΔE/(k T2))

Rearranging:

-ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) = ln(2)

Factor out ΔE/(k):

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Wait, let's see: Let's factor ΔE/(k) as a common factor.

So,

ΔE/(k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ] = ln(2)

Let me write it
