Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so let's try to think it through. The question is about a small synthesized peptidic compound. Let's break down the observations and the possible answers.

First, the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound is mostly as expected. But there are two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, the integral suggests that the total is one proton, but why two peaks?

The question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as a cause because of the coupling pattern. So, it's not like they're splitting each other due to neighboring protons. Hmm, what else can cause two peaks for one proton?

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis. The crude compound shows two peaks with equal intensity, same mass. So, same molecular weight but two distinct peaks. Since the mass spec is the same, it's the same compound, but maybe in different forms.

Wait, what could cause that? Maybe isomerism. If the compound exists as a mixture of stereoisomers, like enantiomers or diastereomers.

In NMR, if you have a mixture of enantiomers, the NMR would appear as a single peak because the environments are mirror images and the peaks would overlap. But wait, the question says the NMR shows two peaks. So that can't be enantiomers because they wouldn't split the peaks. Unless... but wait, maybe it's not the same environment. Or perhaps it's diastereomers which have different physical properties.

Wait, diastereomers would have different NMR spectra. So if you have a mixture, each diastereomer would contribute its own set of peaks. But in this case, the NMR is showing two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The two peaks integrate to 1H together. So for each peak, maybe each is 0.5H? Oh wait, no. The integral is 1H total between them. So each is about 0.5H?

Wait, no. They're the same alpha proton, so each peak represents some of that proton. But why would the same proton split into two peaks?

Ah, maybe it's due to exchange or something else. Or perhaps the compound has some sort of
