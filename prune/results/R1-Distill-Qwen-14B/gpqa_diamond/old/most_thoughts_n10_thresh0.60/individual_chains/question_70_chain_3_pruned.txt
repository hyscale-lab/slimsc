Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let's take it step by step.

The question describes several reactions, so I should probably try to identify the compounds involved in each step. Let me list out the given information.

First, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. Hmm, bright red product... That makes me think of something like sulfur or maybe a transition metal compound. Oh, wait, copper-based compounds can be bright red. Like copper(II) oxide is black, but maybe another copper compound? Alternatively, I'm thinking of something like sulfur trioxide, but that's a gas. Alternatively, maybe it's a metal oxide or a metal sulfide?

Wait, another thought: when a solid reacts with gas in a 1:8 ratio to form a red product. Let's think about stoichiometry. 8 equivalents suggest it's a 1:8 molar ratio. So, if A is a metal and B is a diatomic gas, perhaps oxygen (O2) or maybe sulfur dioxide (SO2) or something like that.

Wait, another possibility: if A is a metal like copper, and B is sulfur vapor (S8?), but that's a solid too. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, what about the reaction of a metal with a halogen? If A is Na (solid) and B is Cl2, for instance, but 8 equivalents would be high. Sodium chloride is white, not red. Maybe another metal.

Wait, perhaps the red product is a nitrate. Wait, sodium nitrate is white, potassium nitrate is also white. Hmm. Maybe it's a sulfide. Wait, copper(II) sulfide is black. Not red.

Wait, let me think about the next reaction. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. E is produced when C reacts with D in a 1:2 ratio. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.

Hmm, if C reacts with water to produce A, F, and G. So C is maybe a salt? Or a compound that can hydrolyze into acids. Wait, if F is a strong acid and G a weak acid, perhaps C is an anhydride.

Wait, common anhydrides that when hydrolyzed give two acids. Like sulfuric an
