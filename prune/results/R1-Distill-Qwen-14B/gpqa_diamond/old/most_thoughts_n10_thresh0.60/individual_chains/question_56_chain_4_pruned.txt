Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between states. Hmm, let's see. The question is about the |3,0,0> state decaying to |1,0,0> through two dipole transitions. I remember that in hydrogen, electrons can transition between energy levels, and each transition emits a photon. But wait, dipole transitions... Oh right, dipole transitions are allowed if certain selection rules are followed.

The selection rules for the hydrogen atom, in the non-relativistic theory, are usually Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l can change by one unit, and the magnetic quantum number m can change by zero or ±1. Also, the principal quantum number n can change by any integer, but in multiple steps, I guess.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. It's a 3s orbital because l=0. It needs to go to |1,0,0>, which is 1s. But since it's a two-step process, the intermediate state must be something with l=1 because from l=0 you can only go to l=1 in the first transition (since Δl=±1). So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1, so n can be either 2 or maybe 4? Wait, but n can change by any number as long as energy allows. Wait, but the initial n is 3, so if the first transition goes to n=2, then next transition can go to n=1. Or maybe n=3 → n=4 → n=1? No, because you can't have higher energy when going to lower, but I think the decay is emission, so energy goes down. So from n=3, the first transition probably goes to n=2 since that's the next lower level.

Wait, but the intermediate state must have l=1 because only then can you have a transition from l=0 to l=1. So the first transition goes to a state with l=1. What n would that be? Well, in hydrogen, for n=2, l can be 0,1. So n=2, l=1 is possible. So the first step is 3,0,0 → 2,1, something. Then from 2,1, something → 1,0,0.

Now, the possible m values for the first transition. The initial state has m=0. The selection rule says Δm=0, ±1. So m can go to 0±1, so m= -1, 0, +1 in the intermediate state.

Wait, but then from the intermediate state, which has l=1, you have to go to l=0. So the second transition must have Δl = -1, so that's allowed. Also, the m in the intermediate state can go to m=0, since Δm=0 is allowed as well.

So, for the first transition: |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>, where m can be -1,0,+1.

Then the second transition from |2,1,m> to |1,0,0>. Let's see what m needs to be. The initial for the second transition is m, so m must go to 0. So the selection rule for m is Δm=0, ±1. So from m in the intermediate state, you can go to m-1, m, m+1.

But the final state has m=0. So, for the second transition, m must change to 0. So what m values in the intermediate state allow this? Let's see.

Case 1: Intermediate m=1. Then in the second transition, it can go to m=0 (since 1-1=0). So yes, possible.

Case 2: Intermediate m=0. Then in the second transition, m can stay 0. So that works.

Case 3: Intermediate m=-1. Then in the second transition, m can go to 0 (since -1+1=0). So that also works.

So all three possibilities for the intermediate state's m are allowed.

Now, the problem is about the probability of each possible route. The question lists options A, B, C, D. Let's look at them.

Option A says |3,0,0> → |2,1,0> → |1,0,0> with probability 1/3.

Option D seems similar except the probability is 2/3, but in the description, it's cut off. Wait, the options as given in the question:

A) 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0; probability 1/3

B) 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0; probability 1/4

C) 3,0,0→2,1,-1→1,0,0; probability 1/4

D) ... →2,1,0 →1,0,0; probability 2/3

Wait, looking back at the question, option D is written a bit oddly. It says the first transition is |3,0,0⟩→|2,1,0⟩ and then the next to |1,0,0⟩, with probability 2/3.

But wait, the question is about the transition via two dipole transitions. So each transition is a dipole transition.

Hmm. So each of the possible m states in the intermediate (m= -1, 0, +1) leads to a possible path. So there are three possible paths: each with m=1, m=0, m=-1 in the intermediate state.

But each path has a certain probability. The total probability would be the sum
