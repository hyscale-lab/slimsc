Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and it's given that m is small, and B is 1 Tesla. The transition energy has a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm, I remember that paramagnetism in atoms involves the interaction between the magnetic moment of electrons and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment is due to the spin of the electrons. The coupling term here probably refers to the energy associated with this interaction.

The transition energy ΔE is related to the wavelength of the emitted or absorbed photon. Oh right, the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, the question is asking to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which is the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field, <H>) with the transition energy ΔE. So I need to calculate both and see which is bigger.

First, let's find ΔE. Given λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nanometers. Wait, 1 micrometer is 1e-6 meters, so 0.4861 micrometers is 4.861e-7 meters.

So hc is Planck's constant times speed of light. Let me recall the values: h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is about 3e8 m/s. So hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = let me calculate that. 6.626 *3 is about 19.878, so 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then, ΔE = hc/λ.

Plugging in λ: 4.861e-7 m. So ΔE ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7. Let me compute that.

Dividing 1.9878 by 4.861 gives roughly 0.41, and the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 = 1e-18. So approximately 0.41e-18 J. Wait, but 1e-18 is 10^-18. So 0.41e-18 is 4.1e-19 J.

Hmm, but I can also express this in electron volts because sometimes energies are easier to compare in eV. I remember that 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.1e-19 J divided by 1.602e-19 J/eV is roughly about 2.56 eV. Wait, that's a bit high for a hydrogen transition. Wait, wait, hydrogen's energy levels are in the range of a few eV, but maybe that's for the ground state. Let me think.

Wait, the transition energy for the Balmer series of hydrogen, which corresponds to visible light, is about 10.2 eV? No, wait, no. When an electron falls from a higher energy level to a lower one, the energy emitted is the difference between the two levels. For example, the Balmer-alpha transition (from n=3 to n=2) has a wavelength of about 656 nm, which is red light. Wait, but the question
