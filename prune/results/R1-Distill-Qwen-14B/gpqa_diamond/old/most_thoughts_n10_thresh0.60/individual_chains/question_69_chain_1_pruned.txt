Okay, so I have this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving at a high speed, we have to consider time dilation due to special relativity. Oh right, the observed lifetime (which is longer) depends on the Lorentz factor gamma times the proper lifetime.

The question says that X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime tau0 of 8e-16 seconds. They're asking what minimum resolution is needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. Wait, what does 'resolution' mean in this context? I think it refers to the precision of the measurement, perhaps how well the particle's path can be tracked. Or maybe it's the minimum distance the particle travels before decaying, so that the chamber can detect it.

The energy given is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. So I probably need to find the speed of the particle using its energy and mass, then calculate how far it travels before decaying.

First, let's find the gamma factor. Energy E is related to the rest mass m by E = gamma * m * c². Since E is given as 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV, gamma should be E/(m c²). Wait, but since units are in GeV, and c² would have units of (GeV/c²) * c² = GeV. So perhaps it's just E/(m). Let me think: yes, because E = gamma m c², so gamma = E/(m c²). But if E is in GeV and m is GeV/c², then E/(m c²) would be (GeV) / ( (GeV/c²) * c² ) ) = GeV / GeV = unitless, which makes sense. So gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.918.

Wait, let me calculate that. 27 divided by 3.41. 3.41 times 7 is 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is a bit higher than 27. So 7.92 approximately. So gamma is approximately 7.92.

So the observed lifetime tau is gamma * tau0. So tau = 7.92 * 8e-16 s = 6.336e-15 s.

Then, the particle is moving at a certain velocity. Since gamma is high, the particle is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light. Let me find the velocity beta, which is v/c. We know that gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²). So solving for beta: beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)).

Gamma is about 7.92, so gamma squared is about 62.7. 1/gamma² is about 0.01596. So 1 - 0.01596 is 0.98404. The square root of that is approximately 0.992. So beta is roughly 0.992, meaning v ≈ 0.992c.

Now, the distance the particle travels before decaying is L = v * tau. Let's compute that.

L = v * tau = (0.992c) * (6.336e-15 s).

But wait, c is approximately 3e8 meters per second. So let's compute this:

0.992 * 3e8 m/s = 2.976e8 m/s.

Multiply by 6.336e-15 s:

2.976e8 * 6.336e-15 = ?

Let me compute 2.976e8 * 6.336e-15. 2.9
