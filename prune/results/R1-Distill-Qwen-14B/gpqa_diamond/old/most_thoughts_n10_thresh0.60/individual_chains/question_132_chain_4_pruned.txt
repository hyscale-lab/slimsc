Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Hmm, let me read the question again. The problem says that a solution has a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and one diethylbenzene. I'm a bit rusty on my NMR, but I'll try to work through this step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. For C10H14, the formula is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=4. So four degrees of unsaturation, which could be one ring (benzene, which is three DoU) and one double bond or two rings, but more likely one benzene ring and maybe some substituents without double bonds since all the options are tetramethylbenzenes.

Looking at the aromatic region, the NMR shows two singlets at around 6.7 ppm, each integrating for 1:1. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each compound contributes one signal each. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the solution is a 1:1 mixture, so two compounds. Each compound's aromatic protons would contribute to the spectrum. So if each has their own set of protons, but in the mixture, they show as two singlets. That suggests that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, each giving a singlet. How?

Wait, for a benzene ring with substituents, the protons can split into different multiplets. But if the substituents are arranged in a way that all the aromatic protons are equivalent, they would be a singlet. For example, para substitution, but wait, that's only for two substituents. Wait, maybe in the case where all the substituents lead to only one type of proton.

Wait, so each compound in the mixture has only one type of aromatic proton, each as a singlet, and the two singlets in the NMR are from each compound.

Which of the options have structures that give only one type of aromatic proton?

Looking at the options:

Option A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, wait, 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl would have four methyl groups on the benzene ring. Let me sketch that. So positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. So that's a benzene with methyl groups on adjacent positions, but in a four in a row? Wait, no, benzene is a ring. Positions 1,2,3,4 would be like 1,2,3,4, which is a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution. Hmm. Would that give only
