Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Hmm, let's see what it's about. 

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So when it reacts with NaCN, which is a nucleophile, it's probably a nucleophilic addition to the ketone. 

I remember that in such reactions, the ketone is first converted into a cyanohydrin. The general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin. But wait, what's the role of the reagent A here? Oh right, because NaCN is a source of CN-, but maybe the reaction needs an acid catalyst? Or does it require some other conditions?

Wait, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN typically would require an acid catalyst. Because the mechanism involves the formation of an enol or something. Oh wait, no, the addition of CN- to the carbonyl group. The acid (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, right? So reagent A is probably H3O+.

So first reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + H3O+ → 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense.

Then the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2
