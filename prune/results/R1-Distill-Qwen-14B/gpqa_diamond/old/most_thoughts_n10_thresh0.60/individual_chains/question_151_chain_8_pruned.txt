Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure out the probability of measuring a certain observable. Hmm, let's start by understanding what the question is asking. 

The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait a minute. Oh, wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and they must be normalized. So I should check if the state vector here is normalized. Let me calculate the norm squared. The elements are (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2. So that's 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state isn't normalized. But in quantum mechanics, state vectors must have a norm of 1. So maybe I need to normalize it first. Wait, but when calculating probabilities, I think it's about the projection, so maybe I don't need to normalize the state here because the probabilities would scale accordingly. Or maybe I should normalize it first because the probabilities depend on the state being a unit vector. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the observable is represented by matrix P. Let me write that down. The matrix P has first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix. I need to find the probability of measuring 0 when I measure the observable P.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, observables are Hermitian operators, right? So I should check if P is Hermitian. Let me see. The elements are:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

So the conjugate transpose of P would have elements where the (1,2) entry is 1/sqrt(2), which matches row 2, column 1 of P being 1/sqrt(2). Similarly, (2,3) entry in P is 1/sqrt(2), and in the conjugate transpose, (3,2) would be 1/sqrt(2), which matches
