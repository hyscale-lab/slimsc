Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the minimum energy of this system. Let me try to break it down step by step because I'm a bit rusty on electrostatics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs, which makes each charge about 3.2e-19 C. Hmm, but maybe I don't need the exact value right away.

So, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So I imagine point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at the same distance from P, forming a sort of spherical shell around it. But wait, they're constrained to stay at 2m, but their arrangement isn't specified. But for the potential energy, maybe it doesn't matter because all are equidistant from P.

Wait, the question is about the minimum energy of the system. So I think we're looking for the electric potential energy here. Because in an isolated system, the energy is often related to the potential energy between charges.

Wait, but in systems where charges are placed, the potential energy is the work done to assemble them. So, each charge contributes to the potential energy based on the others.

But wait, the charge fixed at P is one, and the others are
