Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. It's a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem talks about a substance X that incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. When X reacts violently with liquid Y, it releases a gas W. The gas W has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. Also, a precipitate G forms, which upon heating releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. There's another part about a keto acid reacting with X to produce a product with 2 oxygen atoms. Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I'll try to identify each component.

First, the reaction between X and Y gives gas W. The fact that W has equal protons and neutronsâ€”so, the molecule of W has equal p and n. Wait, but if it's a molecule, then each atom in the molecule must have p and n equal? Or maybe the molecule as a whole? Wait, no, probably each molecule. Because if it's a molecule, like H2O, the entire molecule's protons and neutrons? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh wait, wait. If the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons in each atom, or the molecule's total? Wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That could mean the total in the molecule. But that's a bit tricky because molecules can have multiple atoms. Alternatively, perhaps each molecule's constituent atoms have the same number of protons and neutrons. Hmm. Maybe the gas is something like H2, but that's probably not right. Wait, wait. Let me think.

Wait, if the molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, perhaps the molecule is a single atom, because for a molecule with multiple atoms, the count would be more. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is something like CO2, but that's probably not. Wait, maybe it's a diatomic molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. So let's think about possible gases that fit.

Wait, for example, Helium has 2 protons and 2 neutrons (if it's the isotope He-4). But He is a noble gas and is monoatomic. So if W is He gas,
