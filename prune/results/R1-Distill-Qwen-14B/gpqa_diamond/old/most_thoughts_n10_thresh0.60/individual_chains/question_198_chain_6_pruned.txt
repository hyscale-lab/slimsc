Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes with thiocyanate. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given: [Co] is 1e-2 M and [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) are provided for four complexes: β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Wait, but wait, beta usually refers to the formation constant, right? So for each complex, each step adds a SCN- ion.

Wait, so Co exists in different complexed forms. The first complex would be Co(SCN)1^2+, the second Co(SCN)2^(0?), then Co(SCN)3^−, and so on. But I'm not entirely sure about the charges. Well, that's a detail I can probably figure out as I go.

The question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. I think the blue ones are the ones with two SCN- ligands, like Co(SCN)2^0, which I think is called cobalt thiocyanate or something like that. So we need the fraction of Co in the form [Co(SCN)_2]^{0}.

But wait
