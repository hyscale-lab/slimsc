Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the product of the Cope rearrangement for the given compound. Hmm, let's start by recalling what the Cope rearrangement does. From what I remember, the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement that typically occurs in 1,5-dienes. The reaction forms a new six-membered ring, swapping substituents between the two ends of the diene.

Wait, but the starting material here is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene means it's a norbornene structure. The numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 5 and 6. Wait, no, actually, bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene has the double bond between carbons 5 and 6? Or wait, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene usually has the double bond in a specific position. Let me think. The bridge structure is such that the double bond is between the two bridgeheads, maybe.

Wait, the structure of norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene, I think, with the double bond between carbons 1 and 2. But in this case, it's hept-5-ene, so the double bond is elsewhere. Oh wait, no, the
