Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for it. 

The problem says they used EMS mutagenesis and found some changes in the first exon. I remember that exons are the parts of the gene that are expressed in the final protein, while introns are non-coding and spliced out. Since the mutation is in the first exon, which is part of the coding region, it's likely to affect the protein structure.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. I need to figure out which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That probably means the gene product isn't functional anymore, so the compound isn't made. So, I'm looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene function, likely through a premature stop codon or a significant alteration in the protein.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence compared to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATG... which is the start codon methionine. Looking at the first part:

Intact gene: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Wait, so between the start and the next part, what's different? Let me see:

Intact has TTTCTCGC... so positions 4-10: TTTCTCGC.

Mutant 1 has TTCTACGC. So instead of TTTCTCGC, it's TTCTACGC. So positions 4-10 are different. Let me count the letters. Oh, wait, the first part is ATG, then the next three are TTT in intact (positions 4-6), but in mutant 1, it's TTC at positions 4-6 (so T becomes C). Then, the next few nucleotides are different. Let me write this out.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT… TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC… TGA

Wait, so the first part after ATG changes. So the first codon after ATG in intact is TTT (Phe), in mutant 1 it's TTC (also Phe), so no change? Or wait, wait, let me look carefully. No, the first codon is same (TTT vs TTC? Wait, no, the third base is different. Wait, TTT is Phe, and TTC is also Phe. So the first amino acid is same. Then the next codon: in intact, CTC (Leu), but in mutant 1, TAC (which is Tyr). So here, the second codon in the protein changes from Leu to Tyr. So that's a substitution.

But would that cause the gene to stop? Probably not. It's a missense mutation. So the protein would be altered but might still function, perhaps not enough to eliminate the compound.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So the beginning is ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT... So first codon after ATG is TTC (Phe), same as before. Next codon is TAA. Wait, TAA is a stop codon (amber)! Oh, that's a big change. So the second codon would be TAA, which is a stop signal. So the protein would be truncated early. That might disrupt the function of the gene product, leading to the compound not being synthesized. But wait, let me check. The first codon is TTC (Phe), then TAA (stop). So the protein would have only the first amino acid (since ATG is Met, then TTC is Phe, then stop). That would produce a very short, non-functional protein. So that's a nonsense mutation, which likely causes a loss of function.

Wait, but let me check the entire sequence. So intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT... and mutant 2 is ATG TTC TAA GCT... So after ATG, it's TTC (Phe), then TAA (stop). So the gene is now producing a shorter protein. That might disrupt the function.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at this, the beginning is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Intact starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So for mutant 3, after the initial TTT (Phe), the next codon is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val). Wait, but in the intact gene, after TTT, it's CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), etc. So in mutant 3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So again, a missense mutation. So the protein would have a different amino acid at that position. Would that disrupt function? It depends. If the change is in a critical region, maybe, but without knowing the structure, it's hard to say. However, the question is about the most probable way to eliminate the compound, which would require a loss of function. So a missense might not be as effective as a frameshift or a stop codon.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So the beginning is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So for mutant 4, the sequence after TTT is TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr) instead of GCT (Ala) and GGT (Gly) in the intact. Wait, let me see:

In intact, the sequence after ATG is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

So the first three codons are:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Which translates to Met Phe Leu Ala Gly Thr...

Mutant 4 is ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So after Met, Phe, and then TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr). So the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). The fourth codon is GCT (Ala) in both? Wait, in mutant 4, the third codon is TAC, then GCT, then ACT.

Wait, the intact is CTC (Leu) as the third codon. So mutant 4's third codon is TAC (Tyr), which is a different amino acid substitution.

But perhaps looking at whether the reading frame is shifted. Wait, no, all the changes are substitutions, not insertions or deletions. So all the mutants have point mutations, not frameshifts.

So which of these would most likely inactivate the gene? 

Mutant 2 seems to have a stop codon early in the sequence. Let me look again. In mutant 2, after ATG TTC (so first codon Met, second Phe), the next is TAA, which is a stop. So that's a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated protein. If the gene product is nonfunctional, the anti-nutritional compound won't be made, which is what we want.

So the correct answer would be Mutant 2, which is option A.

Wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A) Mutant 2

B) Mutant 3

C) Mutant 1

D) Mutant 4

So option A is Mutant 2. That's the one with the stop codon. So that's the most likely to eliminate the compound.


To determine which mutation is most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify the mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur through a nonsense mutation (introduction of a stop codon) or a significant missense mutation that alters the protein's function. The question provides four mutants with changes in the first exon, and we analyze each:

### Intact Gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

### Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’  
- The first codon after ATG remains the same (TTT → TTC, both Phe).  
- The second codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), resulting in a missense mutation.  
- This does not introduce a stop codon and is unlikely to completely eliminate the gene's function.

### Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’  
- The first codon after ATG remains the same (TTT → TTC, both Phe).  
- The second codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAA, which is a stop codon.  
- This introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

### Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
- The first codon after ATG remains the same (TTT → TTT, both Phe).  
- The second codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), resulting in a missense mutation.  
- This does not introduce a stop codon and is less likely to completely disrupt the gene's function.

### Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’  
- The first codon after ATG remains the same (TTT → TTT, both Phe).  
- The second codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), resulting in a missense mutation.  
- This does not introduce a stop codon and is less likely to completely disrupt the gene's function.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a stop codon (TAA) early in the sequence, leading to a truncated, non-functional protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
