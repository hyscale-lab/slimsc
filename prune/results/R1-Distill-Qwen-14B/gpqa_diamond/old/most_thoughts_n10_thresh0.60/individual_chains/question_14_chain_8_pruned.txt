Alright, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm trying to figure it out. Okay, let's start by breaking down the question.

The question says that they did a ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample using an antibody for the IKAROS transcription factor in human B cells. After sequencing and the usual QC, alignment, and peak-calling steps, they found some peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. The question is asking where these disappearing peaks are likely located.

Hmm, I remember that ChIP-seq is a method to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. So the antibody would bind to the transcription factor, and the peaks would represent where the factor is binding in the genome.

Wait, the main thing here is the difference between two fixation methods: PFA alone vs. PFA+DSG. I think PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. DSG is dithiothreitol, I believe. So, DSG is used to reduce disulfide bonds. Oh, right! Fixation protocols often involve crosslinking agents to preserve protein-DNA interactions. PFA is a common crosslinker, but sometimes other steps are taken to ensure proper fixation.

In some protocols, after crosslinking with PFA, they add DSG to reduce the crosslinks, maybe to make the chromatin more accessible for the sonication step or for the antibody to bind. Alternatively, I remember that PFA can sometimes form very stable crosslinks, especially for proteins that are difficult to isolate. DSG might help digest some of the crosslinks, making the chromatin shearing more effective.

Wait, no, wait. I think I'm mixing things up. Let me think more clearly. PFA is used to crosslink proteins to DNA. But sometimes, the crosslinking can be too strong, or not efficiently reversed, which can interfere with the ChIP process. DSG is often used in the lysis buffer to help digest the crosslinks. So, when you have PFA alone, perhaps the crosslinking is more extensive, leading to more protein-DNA crosslinks. Adding DSG might help break some of those, making it easier to shear the DNA and pull down the protein-DNA complexes.

But back to the question: the peaks in the first experiment (only PFA) were found, but they disappeared when PDA + DSG was used. So why would that happen?

Oh wait, I think I've
