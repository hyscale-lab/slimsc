Okay, so I've got this question about two planets orbiting a star and I'm supposed to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

First, the question gives me a bunch of data. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses with a radius 1.7 Earth radii, and Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with 1.3 Earth radii. Both orbits are circular.

The question mentions something about the transit and radial velocity methods. Oh right, the transit method measures the dip in the star's brightness as a planet passes in front, while radial velocity detects the Doppler shift due to the planet's gravitational pull on the star. But how does that relate to the equilibrium temperature?

Wait, equilibrium temperature is determined by the balance between the incoming stellar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation. The formula I remember is Te = [ (L * (1 - a)) / (16 * π² * σ * D²) ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star. Alternatively, another way to write it is Te = Te_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (M_planet / M_star) )^(-1/2) ) or something like that. Wait, no, maybe a different approach.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula can also be expressed in terms of the star's temperature and radius, and the planet's distance. The star's luminosity is L = 4πR_star²σTeff^4. So substituting that into the equilibrium temperature formula, we get:

Te = [ (4πR_star²σTeff^4 * (1 - a)) / (16πσ D²) ) ]^(1/4)

Simplify that:

Te = [ (R_star² Teff^4 (1 - a) ) / (4 D²) ) ]^(1/4 )

Which simplifies further to:

Te = Teff * ( R_star / (2 D) )^(1/2) * (1 - a)^(1/4 )

Wait, but I think I might have messed up the exponents. Let me double-check.

Wait, if I take the star's luminosity L = 4πR^2 σ T_eff^4. Then the planet receives L/(4π D^2) per unit area, which is L/(4π D^2) = (R^2 σ T_eff^4) / D^2. The planet's cross-section is π R_p^2, but the energy it absorbs is (L/(4π D^2)) * π R_p^2 * (1 - a) ) per unit time. The planet radiates as a blackbody with area 4π R_p^2, so the power radiated is 4π R_p^2 σ Te^4.

Setting them equal: (L/(4π D^2)) * π R_p^2 (1 - a) = 4π R_p^2 σ Te^4.

Simplify:

(L * (1 - a)) / (4 D^2) ) = 4 σ Te^4

Then, replacing L with 4π R^2 σ T_eff^4:

(4π R^2 σ T_eff^4 (1 - a)) / (4 D^2) ) = 4 σ Te^4

Simplify numerator and denominator:

(π R^2 T_eff^4 (1 - a)) / D^2 = 4 σ Te^4

Divide both sides by σ:

(π R^2 T_eff^4 (1 - a)) / (4 σ D^2 ) ) = 4 Te^4

Wait, maybe I should approach the equilibrium temperature formula from a different angle. The formula I remember is Te = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

But maybe a better approach is to think about the ratio between the two planets. Since both planets orbit the same star, and assuming same albedo, (1 - a) is the same for both, so it cancels out. So the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures would only depend on their distances from the star.

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (D2 / D1) * (R_star1 / R_star2 )^2 ) / (other terms? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature for each planet is:

Te = ( (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π² σ D²) )^(1/4 )

Since L is same for both planets (same star), and a is same (given same albedo), the ratio of Te1 to Te2 is (D2 / D1 )^(-1/2 )

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So if I can find D1 and D2, the distances of the two planets from the star, I can find the temperature ratio.

But how do I find their distances? The question gives data about the Doppler shifts. The radial velocity method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The maximum Doppler shift (wavelength shift) depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital period. Wait, but the question gives the maximum shift in the forbidden line at 6300 Å.

Wait, the forbidden line [OI] is at 6300 Å. The shift is given for each planet. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, 0.04 Å.

Wait, the Doppler shift (Δλ/λ) is related to the velocity. The radial velocity (v) is given by v = c * (Δλ / λ). Here, λ is the wavelength of the spectral line, so 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 and 0.04 Å, so the velocities are v1 = (0.03 /6300) * c and v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c.

But wait, the radial velocity method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1/(1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (2π G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star )^(2/3) (1 + M_p / M_star )^(1/3) ) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to consider that for each planet, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) )) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But without knowing the orbital periods, this might be tricky. Alternatively, since both planets orbit the same star, perhaps their semi-major axes are related to their masses and the Doppler shifts.

Wait, the Doppler shift (K) is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (P^( -1/3 )) * sin i. Since the orbits are coplanar and edge-on (transit implies sin i ≈ 1), so sin i ≈ 1.

But wait, the mass function comes into play here. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e^2 )^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since e is zero (circular orbits), and M_p << M_star, this simplifies to:

K = ( (27 pi G) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

But without knowing the periods, I might need another approach. Wait, the transit method gives the planet's period via the duration of the transit and other factors, which might not be provided here. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the Doppler shift is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1 / sqrt(D) ), but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about Kepler's third law.

Kepler's third law: (D^3) / (P^2) = G (M_star) / (4 pi² )

So P^2 = (4 pi² D^3) / ( G M_star )

Thus, P is proportional to D^(3/2) / sqrt( M_star )

But the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / (P^(1/3) )) )

So let's substitute P in terms of D.

P = (4 pi² D^3/(G M_star )) )^(1/2 )

So P^(1/3 ) = [ (4 pi² D^3 )/( G M_star ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Hmm. Maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps since both planets are detected via RV, and their K (Doppler shifts) are given, we can find the ratio of their semi-major axes or distances.

Wait, the Doppler shift K is directly proportional to the ratio (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since the star's mass is the same for both, and without knowing the periods, but perhaps if the periods are the same (they don't say), but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shifts are given as maximum shifts, so for each planet, K1 and K2 are known.

So K1 = 0.03 Å / 6300 Å = 0.03 / 6300 = 1e-5 (approx). Similarly, K2 = 0.04 /6300 ≈ 1.587e-5.

Wait, but K is in velocity units, so let me compute the velocities.

c is about 3e5 km/s, which is 3e8 m/s. 1 Å is 1e-10 meters.

So for Planet1:

Δλ = 0.03 Å, λ = 6300 Å.

v1 = c * (Δλ / λ ) = (3e5 km/s) * (0.03 / 6300) = 3e5 * 0.03 / 6300 km/s.

Wait, let me compute that. 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = 3e-5 /6.3e3 = approx 4.76e-9.

Wait, 0.03 / 6300 = 3e-5 / 6.3e3 = (3 /6.3 ) * 1e-8 = 0.476e-8 = 4.76e-9.

So v1 = 3e5 km/s * 4.76e-9 = approx 1.428e-3 km/s = 1.428 m/s.

Similarly, for Planet2:

Δλ = 0.04 Å, so v2 = 3e5 * (0.04 /6300 ) km/s.

0.04 /6300 =4e-5 /6.3e3 = approx 6.349e-9.

v2 = 3e5 *6.349e-9 = approx 1.905e-3 km/s = 1.905 m/s.

So K1≈ 1.428 m/s, K2≈1.905 m/s.

But how does K relate to the planet's distance? I think the formula for K is:

K = (v * sin i) = [ (G (M_p) ) / (4 pi² (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 2 pi / P ) )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula correctly. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (2 pi G ) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star, we can approximate (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ≈ M_star^(2/3).

So K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / (P c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i ) / M_star^(2/3 )

But again, without knowing P, it's tricky. But perhaps we can relate the two planets using their K values.

Let me write the equation for K1 and K2.

For Planet1:

K1 = ( (2 pi G ) / (P1 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p1 sin i ) / M_star^(2/3 )

Similarly for Planet2:

K2 = ( (2 pi G ) / (P2 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p2 sin i ) / M_star^(2/3 )

Taking the ratio K2/K1:

K2/K1 = [ (M_p2 / M_p1) * (P1 / P2 )^(1/3) ) ] 

Because the other terms are same for both.

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² G M_star )^(-1) * (4 pi² D^3 )

Wait, sorry, Kepler's third law is:

P² = (4 pi² / (G M_star )) ) * D^3 

So D^3 = ( G M_star P² )/(4 pi² )

Which means D is proportional to ( M_star P² )^(1/3 )

But since D is the semi-major axis, which for circular orbits is the same as the orbital radius. So D1 = ( G M_star P1² / (4 pi² ) )^(1/3 )

Similarly D2 = ( G M_star P2² / (4 pi² ) )^(1/3 )

Taking the ratio D2/D1 = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

Wait, because D is proportional to P^(2/3) (when M_star is fixed).

So D2/D1 = (P2/P1 )^(2/3 )

Wait, going back to the K ratio:

K2/K1 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

But from D, since D1 and D2 are related to P1 and P2, perhaps I can express P in terms of D. Because P² is proportional to D^3 / M_star.

Wait, P = sqrt( (4 pi² D³ )/( G M_star ) )

So P is proportional to sqrt( D³ / M_star )

Which is P = (D^(3/2)) / sqrt( M_star )

So, P1 = (D1^(3/2)) / sqrt( M_star )

Similarly, P2 = (D2^(3/2)) / sqrt( M_star )

Taking the ratio P2/P1 = (D2/D1)^(3/2 )

So now, back to the K ratio expression:

K2/K1 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * ( P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Substituting P1/P2 = (D1/D2)^(3/2 )

So:

K2/K1 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * (D2/D1 )^( (3/2) * (1/3) ) )

Simplify the exponent: (3/2) * (1/3) )= 1/2

So:

K2/K1 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * sqrt( D2/D1 )

But we can solve for D2/D1.

Let me rearrange the equation:

K2/K1 = (M_p2 / M_p1) * sqrt( D2/D1 )

So,

sqrt( D2/D1 ) = ( K2/K1 ) / ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Square both sides:

D2/D1 = [ ( K2/K1 )^2 * ( M_p1^2 ) ) ] / ( M_p2^2 )

So,

D2/D1 = ( ( K2/K1 )^2 ) * ( M_p1^2 ) / ( M_p2^2 )

Plugging in the values:

K2 is approximately 1.905 m/s, K1 is 1.428 m/s.

So K2/K1 = 1.905 /1.428 ≈ 1.334.

M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5 Earth masses.

So,

D2/D1 = ( (1.334)^2 ) * (7^2)/(5^2 )

Compute each part:

1.334 squared is approximately (4/3)^2 ≈ 1.7778. Let me compute 1.334^2: 1.334 *1.334.

1.3 *1.3=1.69, 0.034^2≈0.001156, cross terms 2*1.3*0.034= 0.0884. So total ≈1.69 +0.0884 +0.001156≈1.77956. So about 1.78.

Then (7/5)^2 = (49/25) = 1.96.

So,

D2/D1 = 1.78 * 1.96 ≈ 3.4808.

So D2 is about 3.48 times D1.

Wait, that's the ratio. So D2/D1 ≈3.48.

But wait, let me check the calculation again.

Wait, K2/K1 is 1.905/1.428. Let me compute that more accurately.

1.905 /1.428 ≈ ?

Well, 1.428*1.333 is approx 1.9, because 1.428 *1.333 ≈1.428*(4/3)=1.904.

Exactly, 1.428 *4/3=1.904. So K2/K1 is 4/3 ≈1.3333.

So that makes K2/K1 =4/3.

So putting that into the equation:

D2/D1 = ( (4/3)^2 ) * (7^2)/(5^2 )

(4/3)^2=16/9.

7²=49, 5²=25.

So,

D2/D1 = (16/9 ) * (49/25 ) = (16*49)/(9*25) = 784 / 225 ≈3.4844.

So D2 is about 3.4844 times D1.

Wait, but this is D2/D1, which is the orbital distance of Planet2 compared to Planet1. So Planet2 is farther away.

Now, going back to the equilibrium temperature equation. The ratio Te1/Te2 is sqrt( D2/D1 ), because earlier we saw:

Te = Teff * sqrt( R_star/(2 D) ) * ... but wait, let me re-express the ratio.

From earlier, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( D2/D1 ) because the equilibrium temperature is proportional to sqrt( R_star / D ), and R_star is the same for both.

Wait, the equilibrium temperature formula, when simplified, gives Te proportional to sqrt( R_star / D ). So:

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( R_star/(D1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(D2) ) ) = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

So with D2/D1 =3.4844, Te1/Te2= sqrt(3.4844)≈1.866.

Wait, wait that can't be right. Because if D2 is larger than D1, Planet2 is farther away, so its equilibrium temperature should be lower than Planet1's, so the ratio Te1/Te2 should be greater than 1. But the options don't have any ratio above 1.3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio.

Wait, let me re-examine.

The equilibrium temperature is given by:

Te = Teff * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 )

Since (1 - a) is same for both, the ratio is:

Te1/Te2 = sqrt( (R_star / D1 ) / ( R_star / D2 ) ) ) = sqrt( D2 / D1 )

Which is the same as sqrt(D2/D1).

So with D2/D1 =3.48, Te1/Te2 = sqrt(3.48) ≈1.866.

But looking at the options, the highest ratio is 1.30 (option B). So this suggests I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe I have the ratio backwards. Because if D2 is larger than D1, Planet2 is farther, so Te2 should be lower than Te1, so Te1/Te2 is greater than 1.

Wait, but in this calculation, it's about 1.86, but the options don't have that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the K ratio approach.

Wait, let's go back to the beginning. Another approach: what if I find the ratio of the distances using the Doppler shifts and the masses.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * ( 1 / ( (P (1 - e^2 ))^(1/3) ) )

Assuming e=0 and sin i=1 (edge-on), and M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ (G M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) ) )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 pi² D³ )/( G M_star )

So P = sqrt( (4 pi² D³ )/( G M_star ) )

So P^(1/3 ) = [ (4 pi² D³ )/( G M_star ) ]^(1/6 ) = (4 pi² )^(1/6 ) * D^(1/2 ) / ( G^(1/6 ) M_star^(1/6 ) )

Putting that back into the K equation:

K ≈ (G M_p )/( M_star^(2/3) ) * [ G^( -1/6 ) M_star^( -1/6 ) D^( -1/2 ) (4 pi² )^( -1/6 ) ) ]

Simplify exponents:

G: (1) - (1/6) = 5/6 G^(5/6 )

M_p: M_p.

M_star: ( -2/3 - 1/6 ) = -5/6 M_star^(-5/6 )

D: -1/2 D^(-1/2 )

(4 pi² )^(-1/6 )

So K ≈ [ G^(5/6) M_p ] / [ M_star^(5/6) D^(1/2) ) ] * (4 pi² )^(-1/6 )

Hmm, perhaps it's better to express K in terms of D.

But perhaps an easier approach is to express K as proportional to (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(D) )

Wait, let's see. From the equation above, K is proportional to M_p / ( M_star^(2/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(D) )

Because the denominator has D^(1/2), so 1/sqrt(D).

So K ∝ (M_p) / ( M_star^(2/3) sqrt(D) )

Which can be rearranged to sqrt(D) ∝ M_p / ( K M_star^(2/3) )

So sqrt( D ) is proportional to (M_p ) / ( K )

Thus, D is proportional to ( M_p² ) / ( K² )

So for the two planets,

D1 ∝ (M_p1²) / (K1² )

D2 ∝ (M_p2² ) / ( K2² )

So the ratio D2/D1 is [ ( M_p2² / K2² ) ] / [ ( M_p1² / K1² ) ]

Which is ( M_p2² / M_p1² ) * ( K1² / K2² )

Plugging in the numbers:

M_p1 =7, M_p2=5.

K1=1.428 m/s, K2=1.905 m/s.

So,

D2/D1 = (5^2 /7^2 ) * ( (1.428 )^2 / (1.905)^2 )

Compute each part:

(5/7)^2 =25/49 ≈0.5102.

(1.428 /1.905 )^2 = (approx 0.75)^2 = 0.5625.

Wait, 1.428 /1.905 ≈0.75.

So,

D2/D1≈0.5102 *0.5625≈0.287.

Wait, that's different from what I had earlier. So D2 is about 0.287 times D1, meaning D1 is larger.

Wait, this is conflicting with the earlier result. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Let me re-express K ∝ (M_p) / [ M_star^(2/3) sqrt(D) ]

Thus, K = C * ( M_p ) / ( M_star^(2/3) sqrt(D) )

Where C is a constant including other terms.

So solving for D:

D = ( C * M_p )^2 / ( K² M_star^(4/3) )

Wait, perhaps not. Let me solve for D.

Rewriting K = C ( M_p ) / ( sqrt(D) )

Then sqrt(D ) = C M_p / K

So D = ( C M_p )² / K²

But since C includes M_star^(2/3 ), I think the correct expression would be:

D = ( ( M_p ) / ( K ) )^2 * ( M_star^(-4/3) ) )

So D1 is proportional to (7^2 ) / (K1^2 ) * (1.5^(-4/3) )

Same for D2: proportional to (5^2 ) / K2^2 * (1.5^(-4/3) )

So the ratio D2/D1 is [ (5^2 / K2^2 ) ] / [ (7^2 / K1^2 ) ]

Which is (25 /25 ) * ( K1^2 / K2^2 ) = (25/49) * ( (1.428)^2 / (1.905)^2 )

Wait, no: D2/D1 = (5^2 / K2^2 ) / (7^2 / K1^2 ) = (25/49) * ( K1^2 / K2^2 )

Which is (25/49) * ( (1.428)^2 / (1.905)^2 )

Compute this:

25/49 ≈0.5102.

(1.428 /1.905 ) ≈0.75, as before.

So (0.75)^2=0.5625.

So 0.5102 * 0.5625 ≈0.287.

So D2/D1≈0.287, meaning D2 is about 28.7% of D1. So Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Wait, this is different from the previous result where D2 was larger. Now I'm getting D2 is smaller. But which is correct?

I think the earlier approach must have a mistake because the K formula gave a different ratio, but perhaps the correct approach is the second one, because when K is higher, the planet is closer. Because a closer planet would cause a larger Doppler shift for the same mass.

Wait, think about K: a planet closer in would have a shorter orbital period, so the star's velocity would be higher for the same mass, leading to a larger K. So if K2 > K1, then Planet2 is closer than Planet1. So D2 < D1.

So according to this, D2/D1 is about 0.287, so D1 is larger than D2.

So Te1/Te2 = sqrt( D2/D1 ) = sqrt(0.287 ) ≈0.536.

Which is approximately 0.53, which is option C.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures (Planet1 to Planet2) is approximately 0.53, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_e = T_{\text{eff}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2D}} \cdot (1 - a)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the terms \(T_{\text{eff}}\), \(R_{\text{star}}\), and \((1 - a)\) cancel out when taking the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Thus, the ratio depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances from the star:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
\]

To find \(D_1\) and \(D_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{M_{\text{star}}^{2/3} \sqrt{D}}
\]

Rearranging for \(D\), we get:

\[
D \propto \frac{M_p^2}{K^2}
\]

For Planet1 and Planet2, the distances are proportional to:

\[
\frac{D_2}{D_1} = \frac{\left(\frac{M_{p2}^2}{K_2^2}\right)}{\left(\frac{M_{p1}^2}{K_1^2}\right)} = \frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} \cdot \frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, \, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)
- \(K_1 = 1.428 \, \text{m/s}, \, K_2 = 1.905 \, \text{m/s}\)

First, calculate the mass ratio squared:

\[
\frac{M_{p2}^2}{M_{p1}^2} = \frac{5^2}{7^2} = \frac{25}{49} \approx 0.5102
\]

Next, calculate the velocity ratio squared:

\[
\frac{K_1^2}{K_2^2} = \frac{(1.428)^2}{(1.905)^2} \approx \frac{2.04}{3.63} \approx 0.5625
\]

Now, compute the distance ratio:

\[
\frac{D_2}{D_1} = 0.5102 \cdot 0.5625 \approx 0.287
\]

Thus, \(D_2 \approx 0.287 \cdot D_1\), meaning Planet2 is closer to the star than Planet1.

Finally, substitute \(D_2/D_1\) into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{e1}}{T_{e2}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

This corresponds to a ratio of approximately 0.53. Therefore, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.53 times that of Planet2.
