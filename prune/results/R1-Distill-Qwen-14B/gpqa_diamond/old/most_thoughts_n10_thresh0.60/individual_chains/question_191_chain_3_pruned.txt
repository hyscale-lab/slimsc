Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me break it down. So, cyclohexanone ring, with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (that's -CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is like CH2-C(CH2) with a double bond? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent from the double bond. Let me draw it: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituent is on C2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Wait, no. Prop-1-en-2-yl should be CH2–C(=CH2)–? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as -CH2-C(CH2) with the double bond. Alternatively, it's an allyl group attached at the middle carbon. Wait, maybe it's the group where the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 2. So it's CH2-CH2-CH3
