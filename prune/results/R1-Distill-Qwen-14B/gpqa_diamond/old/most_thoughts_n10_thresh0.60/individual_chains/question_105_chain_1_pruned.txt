Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun, with some spots on it. These spots are affecting the star's brightness as observed from Earth because the star is rotating. The question is comparing this situation to the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet. I need to find out what the radius of such an exoplanet would be relative to the star to produce the same brightness change.

Hmm. Let me break down the problem. So, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So the spots are at 5000K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view from our perspective. This causes the observed brightness to vary. The same effect is when a planet transits a star, blocking some light and causing a dip in brightness. The question is asking, what size planet would cause the same dip as these spots do.

Wait, but the question says the star is not covered by spots in the comparison scenario. So I have to calculate the planet's radius that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve as the spots do.

I remember the basic concept of the transit method: the change in brightness (the dip) is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The formula I've heard is (Rp/Rstar)^2, since area scales with the square of the radius.

But wait, this star isn't just having a planet transit; it has spots. So the variation due to the spots is a bit different. The question is about the same amplitude in brightness variation. So I need to find the equivalent planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about how spots affect the light curve. When a spot is facing us, it contributes less light than the surrounding area because it's cooler. As the star rotates, the spots move into and out of view. The maximum effect is when the spot is fully visible, blocking (or in this case, dimming) the maximum area.

But wait, the filling factor is 20%. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the visible surface covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, the total spotted area would be 20% of the hemisphere's surface. But the star's total surface is 4 * pi * R^2, but since only one hemisphere is spotty, the total spotted area is 20% of (2 * pi * R^2 / 2) = 20% of pi R^2. Wait, no, the hemisphere's area is (2 pi R²)/2 = pi R². So the filling factor is 0.2 times that, so 0.2 * pi R². 

Wait, maybe I should clarify: the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface (as seen from Earth) that is covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is
