Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. I remember something about thermal reactions, maybe like dehydrohalogenation or elimination, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait. When alkenes are heated, sometimes they can undergo elimination reactions, right? Like if there's a neighboring group or something that can form a more stable double bond.

The compound in question is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Let me try to draw its structure. Non means nine carbons. So, the main chain is nine carbons long. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6. So, numbering from one end: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9. So double bonds between 2-3 and 6-7. And the substituent is a butyl group at position 5. Wait, but butyl is four carbons. So at position 5, substituent is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2- group? Wait, but wait, butyl is actually CH2CH2CH2CH3 as a substituent. Wait no, butyl is a four-carbon chain attached. So the structure is nona-2,6-diene, with a butyl group on carbon 5.

Wait, let me think. The structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, nona has nine carbons, so the base chain is nine carbons with two double bonds at 2 and 6. So the structure should be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that would be 10 carbons. Maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, wait. Let me count again.

Wait, nona is nine carbons. So positions 1 to 9. So the structure is:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9

Double bonds at 2-3 and 6-7. So positions
