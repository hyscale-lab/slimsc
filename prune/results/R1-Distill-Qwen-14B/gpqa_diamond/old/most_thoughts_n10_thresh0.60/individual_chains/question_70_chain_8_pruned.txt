Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The problem describes a series of reactions and some properties of the products. The goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E.

First, let's list out the information given.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Hmm. Let me think about each reaction and what the compounds could be.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. So, the molar ratio is 1 A to 8 B. Maybe A is something that when combined with B in a 1:8 ratio gives a product. I'm thinking of metal and non-metal combinations. Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen or something else.

Wait, bright red product C. That makes me think of something like copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate, which is blue, but maybe something else. Oh wait, maybe C is a nitride or something else. Or perhaps C is a compound with a metal and a non-metal in a high oxidation state.

Alternatively, think about the reaction where a metal reacts with a halogen. For example, aluminum reacts with chlorine gas. But aluminum is a metal and might form AlCl3. But I'm not sure about the stoichiometry. Let me think: for aluminum and chlorine, the reaction is 2Al + 3Cl2 → 2AlCl3. So that's 2 equivalents of Al to 3 of Cl2. That doesn't match the 1:8 ratio. So maybe not that.

Another possibility: maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). Reaction would be 2Na + Cl2 → 2NaCl. But that's 2:1, not 8:1. Doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe A is something else. What about sulfur? No, the product would likely be something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is something like O2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide? Hmm
