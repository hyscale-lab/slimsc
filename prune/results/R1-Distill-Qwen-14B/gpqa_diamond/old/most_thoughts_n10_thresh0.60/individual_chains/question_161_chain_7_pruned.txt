Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electron microscopy question. Let me read through the problem carefully.

Mike is working with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. The setup involves creating an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because in electron microscopy, gas can cause scattering of electrons, right? So a vacuum reduces this scattering, leading to better image resolution.

But even with the pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them. Mike calculates the mean free path of these gas molecules, which is λ1. The mean free path depends on factors like pressure, temperature, and the volume of the compartment.

Now, when Mike turns on the electron beam, he notices something strange. The mean free path changes from λ1 to λ2. The question is, what can we conclude about λ2?

Hmm. I remember that the mean free path (MFP) in a gas is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It's given by the formula λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density and d is the average collision diameter.

But wait, in this case, the MFP is calculated under vacuum conditions, so λ1 is based on the existing gas particles in the ultra-high vacuum. But when the electron beam is on, something changes.

Wait, the electron beam is a source of energy. When the high-energy electrons (1000 kV is 1 million volts, so they're really energetic) pass through the gas molecules, they might cause some effects. Like, maybe they ionize the gas molecules or cause them to break apart. Or perhaps the gas molecules are heated?

Wait, but the problem says the temperature remains the same. So it's not about thermal expansion. So, what else could cause the mean free path to change?

Oh! Wait, when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules might start to conduct electricity. High-energy electrons can cause gas molecules to ionize, leading to a current. But wait, in an ultra-high vacuum, the conductivity is usually very low unless there's a lot of ionization.

Alternatively, maybe the electrons are causing the gas molecules to scatter more. Wait, but the initial MFP was λ1, and now it's λ2. So how does scattering affect the MFP?

Wait a second, the
