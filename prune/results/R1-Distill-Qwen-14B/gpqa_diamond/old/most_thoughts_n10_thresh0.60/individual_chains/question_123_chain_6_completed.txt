Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the movement of its ejecta. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, so the two frames are moving relative to each other. The ejecta sees the Galaxy moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, right? Because inertial frames are non-accelerating, so their relative motion is constant.

The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, time is different in each frame because of time dilation. So I need to consider how time passes in each frame.

I remember that in special relativity, time dilation occurs when two observers are moving relative to each other. The formula is t' = gamma * (t - (v x)/c²), but since the movement is along the x-axis, and the events are at the same point, maybe the formula simplifies.

Wait, in this case, the two frames are moving at a constant velocity relative to each other. So for events that happen at the same point in one frame, like the passage of time in the ejecta's frame, the time in the other frame will be dilated.

The time experienced in the Galaxy frame (t) and the ejecta frame (t') are related by the Lorentz factor gamma. The formula is t = gamma * t', where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v = 60,000 km/s. So from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy. So which frame is which in the time dilation equation?

Hmm. Let's clarify. Let's say in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center. In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving at velocity v towards the ejecta. Both frames are inertial, so the relative velocity is v.

In the problem, 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame (t'). I need to find the time that passes in the Galaxy's frame during this period. Because from the Galaxy's perspective, the ejecta is moving, so the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation.

Wait, wait. The time in the moving frame (ejecta's) is shorter than the stationary frame (Galaxy's) if the events occur at the same location. Because in the ejecta's frame, the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) are happening at the same place (the ejecta's position). So from the Galaxy's perspective, the time between these events is longer.

So the formula would be t = gamma * t', where t' is the proper time (50 seconds) and t is the dilated time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but wait—no, proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events occur at the same place. So in this case, the 50 seconds in the ejecta frame (S') is the proper time because the start and end are at the same point in S'. So the Galaxy's frame (S) would see a longer time.

So first, let's compute gamma. The velocity v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that into meters per second for consistency. 60,000 km/s = 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, that's way higher than the speed of light. Oh wait no, the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 m/s is 0.2c, since 0.2 * 3e8 is 6e7. So v = 0.2c.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let's compute that.

v = 0.2c → v²/c² = 0.04.

So 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. Square root of 0.96 is approximately 0.98. Let me calculate it more accurately.

sqrt(0.96) = approximately 0.9798. So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

Wait, more accurately, let me compute sqrt(0.96). Let's compute 0.9798^2: 0.9798 * 0.9798.

Well, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So 0.9798 is a bit less than 0.98, so perhaps 0.9798^2 is about 0.96, exactly. Hmm, 0.9798 squared is 0.96, because:

(0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98² minus 2*(0.98)*(0.0002) + (0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ 0.960008. Oh, wait, but 0.96 is the target. Hmm, perhaps I should just compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) = 0.9798 approximately.

So gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. Let's keep more decimals for better precision. Let's compute it exactly.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020623698...

So gamma ≈ 1.0206237.

Then, t = gamma * t' → t = 1.0206237 * 50 seconds ≈ 51.031185 seconds.

Wait, but wait. Is this correct? Because in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. From the Galaxy's frame, that's longer. So the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, and the distance the ejecta travels is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, so in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v = 0.2c, and the time taken is 51.031185 seconds. So the distance is v * t.

Wait, v is 6e7 m/s. Let's calculate that.

v = 6e7 m/s = 60,000 km/s.

t ≈ 51.031185 seconds.

So distance = 60,000 km/s * 51.031185 s = 60,000 * 51.031185 km.

Let me compute that: 60,000 * 51.031185 = 60,000 * 51 + 60,000 * 0.031185.

60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000 km.

60,000 * 0.031185 = 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800; 60,000 * 0.001185 = 71.1. So total 1,800 +71.1 = 1,871.1.

Total distance ≈ 3,060,000 + 1,871.1 ≈ 3,061,871.1 km.

Looking at the options, the options are:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Wait, the calculated distance is approximately 3,061,871 km, which is around 3,060,000 km when rounded to the nearest million. So option D is 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the time dilation part. Because the problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So t' = 50 s. So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206237 * 50 ≈ 51.031185 s.

Then, distance in the Galaxy's frame is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.031185 s = 60,000 * 51.031185 ≈ 3,061,871.1 km.

But wait, the options don't have 3,061,871, but option D is 3,060,000. Hmm, perhaps the approximation of gamma is a bit off. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.2c.

v² = 0.04 c².

1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) = 0.9798 exactly? Let me compute it better.

sqrt(0.96) = 0.9798... Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 0.9798^2: 0.9798 * 0.9798.

Let me compute 0.97^2 = 0.9409.

0.9798 is 0.97 + 0.0098.

Let's compute (0.97 + 0.0098)^2 = 0.97^2 + 2*0.97*0.0098 + 0.0098^2.

0.97^2 = 0.9409.

2 * 0.97 * 0.0098 = 2 * 0.97 * 0.0098 = 0.97 * 0.0196 ≈ 0.019012.

0.0098^2 = 0.00009604.

Adding up: 0.9409 + 0.019012 = 0.959912 + 0.00009604 = 0.96000804.

So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798, but let's compute more accurately.

Wait, since 0.9798^2 is about 0.960008, which is just a bit over 0.96. So the actual sqrt(0.96) is about 0.97979589... Let me confirm with a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation, we can use the Taylor expansion or another method. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the initial approximation is sufficient.

So gamma is approx 1.0206237.

So t = 50 * 1.0206237 = 51.031185 s.

So the distance is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.031185 s = 60,000 *51.031185 = let me compute that.

51.031185 *60,000 = 51.031185 *6e4.

51 *60,000 = 3,060,000.

0.031185 *60,000=1,871.1.

So total is 3,061,871.1 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. The calculated value is 3,061,871.1 km, which is approximately 3,062,000 — but the closest option is D.

But wait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in the Galaxy's frame. Alternatively, perhaps I got the frames mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says: What distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The time that passes in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So the distance is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the time calculation. Let me think again. The time in the Galaxy's frame (t) is longer than the time in the ejecta's frame (t').

So t = gamma * t' → t = 50 * gamma.

Wait, but I think I did that correctly before.

Wait, another approach: In the ejecta's frame, the supernova ejecta is at rest, and the Galaxy is moving towards it at v=60,000 km/s. The time measured in the ejecta's frame is t' = 50 s. The Galaxy frame sees this event as taking longer due to time dilation.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the time is t = gamma * t' → which is about 51.03 seconds.

So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v * t.

Wait, no. Wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v=60,000 km/s, so the distance is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame.

So distance = v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.031185 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.031185 = 3,061,871.1 km.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is D: 3,060,000 km. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the distance in the ejecta's frame. No, the question clearly states "the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame".

Wait, perhaps I should think about the problem from another perspective. The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is x = v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But wait, alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the velocity addition formula. Hmm, but no, I think the time dilation approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds of the ejecta frame.

Wait, no. The 50 seconds are in the ejecta frame. So the Galaxy's frame would see more time passing. So t = gamma * t' → t = 50 * gamma.

So that's correct. So the distance is v * t = v * gamma * t'.

But perhaps the problem is suggesting that the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy, but the time in the ejecta's frame is 50 seconds. So the distance as per the Galaxy's frame is v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer.

So with the calculations as before, the distance is about 3,061,871 km, which is approximately 3,062,000 km. But the options don't have that. The closest option is D, 3,060,000 km. But perhaps the exact calculation with more precise gamma would give a number closer to 3,060,000.

Wait, perhaps we can compute gamma more accurately.

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e7 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So v/c = 0.2.

So beta = v/c = 0.2.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Compute sqrt(0.96) accurately.

We can use the Taylor expansion for sqrt(1 - x) around x=0. But 0.96 is 1 - 0.04, so x=0.04.

sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 - x³/(16) - ... So for x=0.04.

sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 - (0.04/2) - (0.04²)/8 - (0.04³)/(16).

Compute each term:

First term: 1.

Second term: 0.04/2 = 0.02 → 1 - 0.02 = 0.98.

Third term: (0.04)^2 = 0.0016. Divided by 8: 0.0002 → subtract that: 0.98 -0.0002 = 0.9798.

Fourth term: (0.04)^3 = 0.000064. Divided by 16: 0.000004. So subtract that: 0.9798 - 0.000004 → 0.979796.

So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.979796.

Thus, gamma = 1 / 0.979796 ≈ 1.0206237.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206237.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206237 * 50 = 51.031185 s.

So the distance is v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.031185 s → 6e4 *51.031185 = let's compute this exactly.

51.031185 *60,000:

Compute 51 *60,000 = 3,060,000.

0.031185 *60,000 = 1,871.1.

So total is 3,060,000 + 1,871.1 = 3,061,871.1 km.

The options are:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Hmm, 3,061,871 is 3,061,871 km. The options don't have that, but D is 3,060,000 km. Perhaps I made a mistake in computation, or maybe the question expects us to ignore the time dilation and just compute distance as v*t' = 60,000 *50 = 3,000,000 km, which is option B.

Wait, but that approach would be incorrect. Because in the Galaxy's frame, the time is longer, so the distance should be higher than 3,000,000 km. So 3,000,000 would be the distance if the time in the Galaxy's frame was 50 seconds, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the direction of motion. Let me think again.

In the ejecta frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v. So the time for the event (ejecta moving towards the Galaxy) is 50 seconds in S'. So in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy at velocity v.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the time t, which is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, so I think the correct approach is to compute the time in the Galaxy's frame and then multiply by velocity.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the length contraction formula. But I'm not sure. Another approach: the distance traveled in S (Galaxy) is x = v * t, where t is the time in S.

But to find t in S, given that t' =50 s in S', we can use the Lorentz transformation.

In the S' frame (ejecta), the event is at x'=0 (same point) at t'=0 and at t'=50 s. So the coordinates are (x', t') = (0,50).

We can transform this to the S frame (Galaxy) using the Lorentz transformation.

The Lorentz transformations are:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c²)

x = gamma (x' + v t')

Since x' = 0, and t' =50 s,

t = gamma * t'

x = gamma * v * t'

So the distance x is gamma * v * t'.

Which is the same as v * t, where t = gamma t'.

So yes, same result.

So x = v * gamma * t' = (6e4 km/s) * (1.0206237) * 50 s.

Wait, wait, no: x = gamma * v * t' → because substituting x' =0 and t'=50.

So x = gamma * v * 50 s.

So x = (1.0206237) * 60,000 km/s *50 s.

Compute 60,000 *50 =3e6.

Multiply by 1.0206237: 3e6 *1.0206237 = 3,061,871.1 km.

So the answer is approximately 3,061,871 km. But the options don't have this. The closest is D) 3,060,000 km.

But why isn't the option matching exactly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me do it more accurately.

Compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96).

Compute sqrt(0.96) exactly:

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) using a better method. Let's use the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me find x such that x^2 = 0.96.

We can start with x0=0.98.

Compute x1 = (x0 + 0.96/x0)/2.

x0 =0.98; x0^2=0.9604.

x1 = (0.98 + 0.96/0.98)/2.

Compute 0.96 /0.98: 0.96 ÷ 0.98 ≈ 0.9795918.

So x1 = (0.98 + 0.9795918)/2 = (1.9595918)/2 = 0.9797959.

Now compute x1^2: (0.9797959)^2.

Compute 0.97^2 = 0.9409.

0.9797959^2: let's compute step by step.

= (0.97 + 0.0097959)^2 = 0.97^2 + 2 * 0.97 * 0.0097959 + (0.0097959)^2.

0.97^2=0.9409.

2*0.97*0.0097959 ≈ 2 * 0.97 * 0.0098 ≈ 0.019012.

(0.0097959)^2 ≈ 0.00009595.

Adding up: 0.9409 +0.019012 = 0.959912 + 0.00009595 → approximately 0.96000795.

So x1^2 =0.96000795, which is slightly more than 0.96. So the next iteration:

x2 = (x1 + 0.96/x1)/2.

x1 =0.9797959.

Compute 0.96 / x1 ≈ 0.96/0.9797959 ≈ 0.98020.

So x2 = (0.9797959 + 0.98020)/2 = (1.9599959)/2 ≈ 0.97999795.

Compute x2^2: (0.97999795)^2.

Again, compute (0.98 - 0.00000205)^2.

But perhaps I'll just accept that this is close enough, so sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798.

So gamma is 1/0.9798 ≈ 1.0206237.

So the distance is about 3,061,871 km, which is not exactly any of the options. The options are A, B, C, D as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to neglect time dilation, which would be a mistake, but perhaps that's what the question is doing.

If we neglect time dilation, then the distance is v * t' =60,000 km/s * 50 s =3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's incorrect because it ignores relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a non-relativistic approach, but that's unlikely as the velocity is 60,000 km/s which is 0.2c, so relativistic effects are significant.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial assumption. Let me think again: from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is approaching at v.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v. So the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame is longer.

But perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta moves in its own frame, which is zero, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. The question is clear: the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving for a longer time, so the distance is v multiplied by that longer time.

So back to the calculation, the correct distance is approximately 3,061,871 km. The options don't have this, but option D is 3,060,000 km, which is very close. It's possible that the problem expects us to approximate gamma as 1.0206, and multiply 50 by this to get 51.0312 seconds, leading to 60,000 * 51.0312 = let's compute.

51.0312 * 60,000 = ?

51 *60,000=3,060,000.

0.0312 *60,000=1,872.

So total is 3,060,000 +1,872=3,061,872 km.

Hmm, perhaps the options are rounded. So the exact answer is approximately 3,061,871 km, which is 3,061,871 km. The options don't have this, but the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. But that's over 1,871 km off, which is a big gap. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v, so the time measured in the ejecta's frame is the proper time. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that in the ejecta's frame, the distance the Galaxy travels is v * t', but in the Galaxy's frame, the distance the ejecta travels is v * t, where t = gamma t'.

Wait, but that's exactly what I did earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting to use the relativistic velocity addition formula, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Wait another thought: When the ejecta is moving towards the center at v in the Galaxy's frame, the distance it covers is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is t = gamma t'. So yes, same as before.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. The calculation seems correct, but the options don't have the exact value. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial conversion from km/s to m/s. Let me check: 60,000 km/s is 60,000 × 1000 m/s =6e7 m/s. Which is 0.2c, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the answer in a different way. Let me think: 60,000 km/s multiplied by 50 seconds gives 3e6 km, but that's without considering time dilation. But that's option B.

But that's incorrect because the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer, so the correct distance is longer than 3e6 km. So option D is the only option higher than 3e6, so the correct answer must be D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion between the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy, considering time dilation due to their relative velocity. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), and the problem specifies that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's reference frame (\( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \)). The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relative Velocity and Time Dilation**:  
   The two frames (ejecta and Galaxy) are inertial and moving at a relative velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at this speed. Time dilation occurs, and the relationship between the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) and the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is given by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]  
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( v = 0.2c \), we calculate \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. **Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Using the time dilation formula, the time in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Distance Traveled in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is given by:  
   \[
   x = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   x = 60,000 \cdot 51.03 \approx 3,061,871 \, \text{km}
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance is approximately \( 3,061,871 \, \text{km} \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). This matches the closest option provided.

**Answer: D**
