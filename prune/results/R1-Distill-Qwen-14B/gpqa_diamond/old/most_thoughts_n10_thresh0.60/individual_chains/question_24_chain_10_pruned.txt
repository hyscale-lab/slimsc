Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem says that there's an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated under severe conditions with platinum, they both give the same substance Z, a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Z is part of mixture Y and is a solvent. Importantly, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's probably already saturated. Also, mixture X doesn't have any conjugated multiple bonds.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine water. That usually indicates the presence of alkenes (double bonds) because alkenes react with bromine water, causing it to decolorize. So X has two liquids, both probably alkenes or one with some unsaturated bonds.

Then, when X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a reaction to form Y. This reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids. Oh, but the question says the reaction is a disproportionation, so perhaps each of the two reactants in X undergoes disproportionation? Alternatively, maybe one of them does. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure about that. 

Disproportionation involves a single species undergoing oxidation and reduction. So for example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, oxygen in H2O2 is both oxidized and reduced. So if X is a mixture, perhaps each component undergoes such a reaction, but I'm not certain.

The resulting mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, meaning it's probably saturated—no double bonds. So Y's components are likely alkanes or have single bonds only.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y gives the same substance Z. Hydrogenation adds hydrogen across double bonds. So if X has double bonds, hydrogenation would add H2 and form alkanes. Similarly for Y, but Y already doesn't have double bonds, so maybe it doesn't change much? Wait no—Y is a mixture of two liquids that don't have double bonds. So when hydrogenated, perhaps Z is formed from both.

Wait, but X has two liquids. When you hydrogenate them, you get Z. Likewise, Y has two liquids, but when hydrogenated, you also get Z. So Z must be a product that both X and Y can form upon hydrogenation.

Z is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% hydrogen by mass. Let's compute its molecular formula. The mass percent of H is 14.28%, so C must be 85.72%. 

Assuming the molecular formula is CnHm. The mass of H is 14.28%, which is approximately 1/7. So 14.28 is roughly 1/7 of 100. So 14.
