Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the chemist does two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene with the same treatment. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one achiral and one chiral. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's often used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA typically forms epoxides. But wait, the reaction steps after that are important too. Oh right, after epoxidation, sometimes they treat with aqueous acid, which could lead to ring-opening of the epoxide.

Wait, so what's the process here? The initial step is epoxidation, then acid workup. Let me think about what that does. Epoxidation adds an oxygen bridge across the double bond, forming an epoxide. Then, in acidic conditions, the epoxide can undergo ring-opening. But how does that happen? The acid would protonate the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, but the mechanism could be either SN1 or SN2. For smaller epoxides, like those from alkenes, the ring-opening under acidic conditions tends to be... I think it's typically an acid-catalyzed ring opening via a cyclic transition state, leading to trans diol formation. Oh wait, noâ€”wait, wait. Wait, when epoxides are treated with aqueous acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4, the ring opens to form a diol. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the starting epoxide's structure.

Wait, so the starting material is (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene. Each will form an epoxide. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the epoxide formation. mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the addition would be syn. So, the configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene,
