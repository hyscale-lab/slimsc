Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state. The state given is (3i, 4). Hmm, wait, I think that's a two-component vector, right? So maybe it's a column vector like [3i; 4], because in quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as two-element vectors.

The options are all expressions involving hbar, which is the reduced Planck's constant. The possible answers are A) -12ℏ/25, B) 12ℏ/25, C) 25ℏ/2, D) -25ℏ/2. So I'm guessing the expectation value will be one of these.

I remember that the expectation value of an observable is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix (or the operator) multiplied by the state vector. Oh right, the formula is <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, what's σ_y again? Oh, the problem gives it as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y is the Pauli y-matrix.

So first, let me write down the state vector ψ. It's given as (3i, 4), which I think is a column vector:

ψ = [ 3i ]
      [ 4 ]

Wait, but wait, the state is (3i,4), so maybe it's (3i,4) as a row vector. Oh wait no, in quantum mechanics, the spinor is a column vector. So ψ is [3i; 4]. But wait, wait, another possibility: sometimes states are represented as row vectors, but I think the standard is column vectors, so ψ is a column vector with first component 3i and second 4.

But wait, actually, when you have a state written as (a, b), it's often a row vector, but when you calculate expectation values, you take the conjugate transpose, so ψ† is (a*, b*). So perhaps ψ is a row vector, but the notation can be a bit ambiguous. Hmm, perhaps I should make sure.

Wait, the σ_y matrix is 2x2, so ψ must be a
