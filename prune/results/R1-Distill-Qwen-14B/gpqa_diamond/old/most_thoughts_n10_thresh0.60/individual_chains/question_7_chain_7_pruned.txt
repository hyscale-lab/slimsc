Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the energy at which a gamma-ray's lifetime in the universe is limited by the process of annihilating with a CMB photon to produce electron-positron pairs. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are all in the GeV range, so I guess the answer is going to involve some high-energy physics.

Wait, I remember something about photon-photon interactions. The process in question is γ + γ → e+ + e-. This is relevant for high-energy gamma-rays because they can interact with the CMB photons. When they do, they produce electron-positron pairs. So, the lifetime of these gamma-rays is determined by how often they undergo this annihilation process. If the annihilation rate is high, the gamma-rays won't travel far before they're annihilated, hence their lifetime is limited.

I think the key here is to find the energy where the mean free path of the gamma-ray becomes comparable to the size of the universe, which would limit its lifetime. The mean free path is the average distance a gamma-ray travels before annihilating. The lifetime τ is related to the mean free path λ by τ = λ / c, where c is the speed of light.

So, how do we calculate the annihilation rate? The annihilation cross-section probably plays a role here. The cross-section σ would determine the probability of the interaction. The rate Γ (annihilation rate) is given by the product of the cross-section σ and the photon density n of the CMB.

Wait, the photon density n is the number of photons per unit volume. For the CMB, I recall that the photon density is about 411 photons per cubic centimeter. But wait, the CMB is a blackbody with a temperature of about 2.7 K. The number density can be calculated using the formula for blackbody radiation: n = (8π g*) (k_B T)^3 / (h^3 c^3), where g* is the number of degrees of freedom. For photons, g* = 2, because they have two polarizations. So yeah, n is about 411 cm^-3, which is 4.11e8 m^-3, since 1 cm^3 is 1e-6 m^3. Wait, 411 photons/cm³ is 411 per 1e-6 m^3, so 411e6 per m³, which is 4.11e8 m^-3. Right.

So, the annihilation rate Γ is σ * n * v, where v is the relative velocity of the gamma and CMB photon. Wait, but in the frame where the CMB is isotropic, what's the typical velocity? Well, for high-energy gamma-rays, the CMB photons are moving much slower in the opposite direction. So the relative velocity would be roughly the speed of the gamma-ray, v ≈ c. Alternatively, considering the Doppler effect.

Wait, but in the center of mass frame, the photon energies would matter. Alternatively, perhaps we can work in the rest frame of the CMB. The gamma-ray has energy E, and the CMB photon has energy E_cm ~ k_B T_CMB, which is about 1e-3 eV (as given). So the energy of the CMB photon is much less than that of the gamma-ray.

But in any case, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is probably a function of the center-of-mass energy. The process is significant when the combined energy is enough to produce the electron-positron pair. The threshold for this process is when the total energy in the center of mass frame is at least twice the electron mass, which is about 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. So, if the gamma-ray and CMB photon together have enough energy, the interaction can proceed.

So, the condition is that the sum of the energies in the center-of-mass frame is at least 1.022 MeV. Alternatively, the product of the photon energies must be at least (m_e c²)^2 / 4, because in the threshold condition, E1 * E2 = (m_e c²)^2 /4, where E1 and E2 are the photon energies in the center-of-mass frame. Or wait, I think the threshold condition for two photons is when their combined energy in the center-of-mass frame is 2 m_e c². Let me think about it.

Wait, the production of e+ e- requires that the center-of-mass energy sqrt(s) should be at least 2 m_e c². So, sqrt(s) = 2 m_e c². The square of the center-of-mass energy is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since photons are massless, E = pc, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 cos²θ, where θ is the angle between the two photons. Wait, but that's complicated. Alternatively, for the threshold condition, the two photons must be moving directly towards each other (head-on collision) to minimize their combined energy. So the angle is 180 degrees, which makes the calculation easier.

So, the threshold condition for γγ → e+ e- is given by:

(E_cm)^2 = (E1 + E2)^2 - (|p1| c + |p2| c)^2 cos²(180) 

Wait, maybe it's easier to consider that when the photons are moving directly towards each other, their momenta add up in
