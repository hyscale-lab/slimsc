Okay, so I'm faced with this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take it slow and think it through.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. Then, we need to determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in product 4.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Cyclohexanone treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1.
2. Product 1 heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to form product 2.
3. Product 2 treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine to form product 3.
4. Product 3 treated with Lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (LiAlH(LiAlH(tert-BuO)3)) to form product 4.

And the question is about the number of distinct hydrogen atoms in product 4.

Alright, let's break down each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone + Br2. I remember that cyclohexanone can undergo bromination, likely via an electrophilic addition. But wait, bromine in what conditions? Oh, right, when you add bromine to a ketone, it's a bromination of the carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Bromine might add across the carbonyl, but I think it's more likely that this is a bromohydrin formation, but no, wait, bromine could add in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps it's a diaddition. Wait, another possibility: in the presence of a base, maybe it's an enolate formation, but without a base, perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, cyclohexanone is treated with bromineâ€”probably a diaddition to the carbonyl group. The carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group, but wait, no. Alternatively, the Br2 might add as an electrophilic attack. Wait, when ketones are treated with Br2, it's usually a diaddition to the carbonyl. So cyclohexanone would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. Or wait, maybe it's cyclohexanone adding Br across the carbonyl, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: the bromine
