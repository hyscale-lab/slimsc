Okay, so I've got this question about which stars can be detected using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. The detectability condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let me try to think through this step by step.

First, I should probably understand what factors affect the S/N ratio. From what I remember, the S/N depends on the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the size of the telescope (which affects the amount of light collected), and the efficiency of the spectrograph.

ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for the ESO telescopes. I think it's optimized for high precision measurements, like detecting exoplanets via the radial velocity method. The VLT has 8m mirrors, so each telescope is pretty big, which should help collect a lot of light.

The formula for S/N ratio might be something like S/N = (flux * sqrt(exposure time)) / noise. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I remember that S/N increases with the square root of exposure time and the area of the collecting mirror. But the specifics are a bit fuzzy.

Wait, I think there's a formula related to photometric magnitude. The S/N for a star can be calculated using the formula: S/N = 5 * sqrt(10) * 10^(-0.4*(m - m_min)) * sqrt(t) * (D / 10 pc)^2 * (efficiency) ?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between apparent magnitude and S/N. The apparent magnitude determines how much flux the telescope receives. Each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness. So if two stars differ by 5 magnitudes, one is 100 times brighter.

ESPRESSO's performance depends on the brightness of the star. I remember reading that ESPRESSO can reach S/N ratios of 10 for very bright stars in short exposures, but for fainter ones, longer times are needed.

The question gives each star's absolute magnitude (Mv) and distance. Absolute magnitude is how bright the star would appear at 10 parsecs. So to find the apparent magnitude (mv), I can
