Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these enthalpy of formation calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound: (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure first. Wait, maybe I should just count the number of each type of bond because that's probably what I'll need for the calculation.

I remember that the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies. The formula I think is: Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies for all bonds broken) minus (sum for bonds formed). Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Oh right, the standard formula is:

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

But wait, no, actually, for the molecule, you're considering the bonds formed and broken. So when forming the molecule from its constituent atoms, you break all the bonds in the elements (like C-C and C-H in carbon and hydrogen molecules) and then form the bonds in the target molecule.

Wait, no, maybe I should think of it as the enthalpy of formation is the energy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon, it's when you take carbon (maybe in the form of graphite) and hydrogen (H2 gas) and combine them to form the compound.

But the problem gives me bond energies, not the enthalpy of formation values. So I think the approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the bond energies provided.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated by subtracting the sum of the bond energies of all bonds in the compound from the sum of the bond energies of the elements as they exist in their standard states.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The standard way to calculate enthalpy of formation using bond energies is:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of reactant bonds broken)] - [Σ (Bond energies of product bonds formed)]

But wait, actually, the correct formula is that the enthalpy of formation of the molecule is the energy required to break all bonds in the elements minus the energy released when the
