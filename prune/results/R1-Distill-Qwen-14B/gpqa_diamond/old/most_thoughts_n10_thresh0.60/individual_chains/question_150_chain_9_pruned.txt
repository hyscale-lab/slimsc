Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me read it carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to find out the final product from the options provided.

First, let's look at the NMR data. The peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm, triplet (t), 1H. That's a high chemical shift, probably an aldehyde proton. Wait, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So this could be an aldehyde.

- 6.98 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. These are probably aromatic protons, maybe part of a para-substituted ring. Because doublets in aromatic regions often suggest coupling with one neighboring proton.

- 6.51 ppm, doublet, 2H. Also aromatic, possibly another set of protons that are adjacent or in a different substitution pattern.

- 6.27 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could be due to exchange with something, maybe hydroxyl protons, but wait, those are usually even broader and maybe split into other patterns. Alternatively, these could be protons next to an electron-withdrawing group, like in an enol tautomer.

- 3.66 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. This is a downfield shift for CH2 groups. Maybe it's next to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. So maybe a CH2O group or something similar.

Now, putting this together. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. 

Degrees of unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So, DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, wait, formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So (2*8 +2 -9 +1)/2 = (18-9 +1)/2= (
