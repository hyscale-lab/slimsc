Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let's try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem gives me a Lagrangian term: L(y) = -λf f(y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that correctly. Oh, right! The interaction term is probably something like λ times something. But wait, the exact form might not be critical for figuring out the decay modes. The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. I need to find which decay options are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

First, understanding boson decays. Since X is a boson, its decay products must be fermions because the interaction term involves ψ_f, which are fermions. So X can decay into a pair of fermions. The possible fermion pairs depend on the mass of X and the masses of the fermions.

The question is about which fermion-antifermion pairs X can decay into. So I need to look at the possible pairs and their masses.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So the sum of the masses of the fermion and antifermion must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because for a decay to be allowed, the rest mass of the parent must be at least the sum of the rest masses of the decay products. Since we're talking about fermions, each pair would have a rest mass of 2m (since each particle has mass m, and they're a pair). Wait, no, for a pair, the total mass is m_fermion * 2? Wait, no, each fermion has mass m, and the pair is a fermion and an antifermion. So the combined rest mass is 2m (because each has m, but the antiparticle has the same mass). So the condition is 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

So m_fermion ≤ m_X / 2. Since m_X is 6 GeV, m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV. So any fermion with mass less than or equal to 3 GeV can be a decay product.

Now, let me think about the masses of the known fermions. Let's list them:

Leptons:
- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV

Quarks:
- Up (u): about 2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down (d): ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s): ~100 MeV (0.1 GeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top (t): ~173 GeV (way higher than 3 GeV)
So for each fermion:

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → yes, 2m_e = 0.001 GeV < 6 GeV. So e+ e- is allowed.
Muon: 0.105 → 2m_mu = 0.21 GeV <6 → allowed.
Tau: 1.78 → 2*1.78=3.56 GeV. Wait, 3.56 is more than 3 GeV. Because X is 6, so 2m has to be ≤6. So 3.56 is less than 6? Wait wait, 2m_fermion must be ≤ m_X. So 2m_fermion ≤6 → m_fermion ≤3.

Tau's mass is ~1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So 2m_tau is 3.56 GeV which is less than 6 GeV. So tau pair
