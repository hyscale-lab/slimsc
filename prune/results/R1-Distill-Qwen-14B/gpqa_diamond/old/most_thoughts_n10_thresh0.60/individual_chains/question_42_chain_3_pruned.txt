Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to figure out what I need to do. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the problem. Oh well, maybe it's just a way they found the planets, so I don't need to worry about the method itself.

The problem gives me ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets and ratios of their masses. I need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. Oh, right, orbital period scaling—I remember Kepler's third law is involved here. That's the one where the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, but that's for the same star, right?

Wait, the given data includes equilibrium temperatures. I remember the equilibrium temperature formula is Te = T_star * ( (L / (16 * pi * sigma * a^2) )^(1/4) ), but wait, maybe more accurately, it's T = T_sun * ( (1 / sqrt(a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) ). Or wait, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Hmm, maybe I should think about the equilibrium temperature as inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the distance. But in this problem, all planets are around the same star, so the star's luminosity and radius are the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature would be inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis.

So, if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, T2 that of Planet2, etc., then T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, wait, no. Because T is proportional to (L/(16 pi sigma a^2))^(1/4). So if L and sigma are constants, T = (L/(16 pi sigma))^(1/4) * (1/(a^2))^(1/4) ) = (L/(16 pi sigma))^(1/4) * (1/a^0.5 ). So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because if a is larger, the temperature is lower. So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

Given that, let's look at the given data. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So T1 / T2 = 1.4. But T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T1 / T2 = sqrt(a2 / a1 ). So 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1 ), which implies a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So a2 is about 1.96 times a1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me do that again. T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T1 = (1/sqrt(a1)) * C, where C is a constant. T2 = (1/sqrt(a2)) * C. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So given T1/T2=1.4, that would mean sqrt(a2/a1) =1.4. Squaring both sides, a2/a1=(1.4)^2=1.96. So a2 is about 1.96 times a1. So a2=1.96 * a1.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let's think: if a planet is farther away (larger a), its equilibrium temperature should be lower because it's getting less flux. So T1 is higher than T2, so a2 must be larger than a1. Because T1 is higher, so a2 must be larger—so a2 is about 1.96 times a1. That makes sense.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So T2/T3=2.3. Again, T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a), so T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2). So 2.3= sqrt(a3/a2), so a3/a2=(2.3)^2=5.29. So a3=5.29 * a2.

So now, let's compute a3 in terms of a1. Since a2=1.96 a1, a3=5.29 * a2=5.29 * 1.96 a1. Let me compute that. Let's see: 5.29 * 1.96. Let's compute 5 times 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is 9.8 +0.5684=10.3684. So a3≈10.3684 a1.

Wait, but wait, let me check: 5.29 times 1.96. Let me compute 5.29 * 2 is 10.58, minus 5.29 * 0.04 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). Wait, 0.04 *5.29 is 0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.211
