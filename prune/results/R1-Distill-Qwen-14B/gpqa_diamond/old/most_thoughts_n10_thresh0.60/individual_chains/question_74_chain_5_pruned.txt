Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question says that we have an atom whose decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. But wait, that's a bit confusing because I remember that radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? It follows an exponential decay model, so the probability is continuous and doesn't have a fixed percentage in a specific time frame like that. Hmm, maybe the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky.

So, the setup is that we have an atom, and we know that the probability of it decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. So, the decay constant 位 is probably being calculated based on that. Then, after 50 minutes, it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, the next 150 minutes from when? Oh, I think the 50 minutes have passed since we started monitoring, and now we're looking into the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, no, the question is about the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So, the time elapsed is 50 minutes, and we need the probability that it decays in the subsequent 150 minutes.

Wait, but how does the decay work? The decay is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, the fact that 50 minutes have passed without decay doesn't change the probability for the next period. So, maybe the 32% is the probability in 100 minutes. So, how does that translate into the decay constant?

Let me think. The standard decay formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-位t), where N(t) is the number remaining after time t. The probability of decay by time t is 1 - e^(-位t). So, given that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32% (0.32), I can set up the equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-位*1
