Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it says.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, and their radial velocities are 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. The question is about the luminosity ratio of Star_1 to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Right, so luminosity is proportional to R squared times temperature to the fourth power.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. Oh, wait, the peak wavelength for a black body is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So, same λ_max means same T. Oh, okay, so T1 = T2.

But wait, wait. Oh, no, wait. The stars are moving, right? Because they have radial velocities. The radial velocity could affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. So the observed wavelength might not be the same as the emitted one. Oh, but the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So the observed λ_max for both is the same. So, but the stars themselves might have different temperatures because of their velocities.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. So, we need to take into account the Doppler shift. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength will shift.

The formula for Doppler shift is λ_observed = λ_emitted * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ), but wait, no, I think the relativistic Doppler shift is different. Oh, right, the relativistic Doppler effect formula is: λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) ), where v is the radial velocity.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think. When the source is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer (redshifted). If moving towards, it's shorter (blueshifted). The formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving with velocity v along the line of sight is:

λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) )

Wait, but that's for transverse velocity? No, wait, the formula I have is when the source is moving directly towards or away. So for source moving away, v_r is positive, but in the denominator. So, let me get this right.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the approximation when v is much smaller than c. Since the velocities given are
