Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It involves two reactions, and I need to figure out the major products A and B. Then, I'll match them with the options given.

First, let me read the question carefully. The reactions are:

1. 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol reacting with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A.
2. (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol reacting with acetyl bromide in the presence of a base (LDA) to give product B.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible A and B products.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol + THF, KH, H+ â†’ A.

Hmm, I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH (potassium hydride) is a strong base. Wait, but I think in some cases, especially with alcohols, when you have a strong base like KH, it can deprotonate the alcohol to form an alkoxide. But wait, the compound is a spiro alcohol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected at a single atom, right? So the structure is a spiro compound with a vinyl group.

Wait, the starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the spiro rings are nonane-based, I think. Let me visualize: the spiro has a three-membered ring and a five-membered ring connected at the same carbon. The 1-position is where the vinyl group is attached, and there's an alcohol (-OH) also at that position. So the structure is a spiro alcohol with a double bond nearby.

When treated with a strong base like KH, which is a deprotonating agent, the alcohol will be deprotonated to form an alkoxide. But then, when H+ is added later, what happens?

Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Another possibility is that in THF and with a strong base like KH, the base abstracts a proton, leading to some kind of elimination. Wait, but the starting material is an alcohol with a double bond nearby. Maybe it's an E2 elimination? But wait, the conditions
