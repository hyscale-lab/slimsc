Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says there are five exoplanets discovered using the TTV method. They're in orbital resonance and have orbital periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. I need to find the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. And all have the same albedo, so that's one variable I don't have to worry about.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * ( (L_star / (16 * π * σ * a^2) )^0.5 ), but maybe a simpler version. Oh right, the effective temperature of a planet is given by the formula T = T_earth * ( (T_e / T_s)^0.5 ) * ( a / a_e )^0.5 ), where T_e is Earth's effective temperature, T_s is the Sun's effective temperature, a_e is Earth's semi-major axis, and a is the planet's semi-major axis.

Wait, but another approach. The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ), but wait, no, that's not quite right. Oh wait, the inverse square law comes into play because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. The formula I think is T_planet = T_star * ( L_star
