Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question has two parts. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B and water to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

And the options are A, B, C, D, each giving different reagents for A and B.

Hmm. So I need to figure out what reagents A and B are.

Starting with the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. And NaCN is sodium cyanide. I remember that when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it undergoes a substitution reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, wait. Wait, ketones typically react with something like HCN in the presence of acid to form a cyanohydrin. So the product would have an alcohol and a nitrile group.

But in this case, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. The nitrile group is on the second carbon, and there's a hydroxyl group on the same carbon. So the starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and reagent A leads to this product.

Wait, I think the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin. So the general reaction is ketone + HCN (or maybe CN-) in acidic conditions. So the mechanism is that the ketone would react with CN- as the nucleophile. But to get the H, maybe it's under acidic conditions.

Wait, but NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but in a basic solution. Oh, but the reaction might require acid. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the presence of acid, the ketone might get protonated, making it more electrophilic, allowing CN- to attack. So the reagent A is probably H3O+ (acid) to protonate the ketone.

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+. Looking at the options, options A and B
