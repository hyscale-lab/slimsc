Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are given, and I have to pick the correct one.

Hmm, expectation values. Right, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So for an operator A, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, where |ψ⟩ is the state vector.

So the given state is |ψ⟩ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me write this state in terms of a vector. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, they form an orthonormal basis. So maybe I can express the state as a column vector.

Wait, right. Usually, |↑⟩ is represented as [1; 0] and |↓⟩ as [0; 1], assuming the standard basis. So the state ψ would be [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] transpose. Let me double-check the coefficients: 0.5^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 3/4 = 1, which is good because it's normalized.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. Let's break this down. σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. I remember that the Pauli matrices are:

σz = [[1, 0], [0, -1]]
σx = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]

So, let's compute each part separately. First, 10σz would be 10 times the σz matrix:

10σz = [[10*1, 0], [0, 10*(-1)]] = [[10, 0], [0, -10]]

Then, 5σx is 5 times σx:

5σx = [[0, 5], [5, 0]]

So the entire operator is 10σz +5σx, which would be element-wise addition of these two matrices.

Adding them together:

[[10+0, 0+5], [0+5, -10+0]] = [[10,5],[5,-10]]

So the matrix for the operator is M = [[10,5],[5,-10]]

Now, to find the expectation value ⟨ψ| M |ψ⟩.

Since |ψ⟩ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2], the bra vector ⟨ψ| is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], right? Because it's the conjugate transpose, and since the coefficients are real here, it's just the transpose.

So, ⟨ψ| M |ψ⟩ can be calculated as [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * M * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute M * |ψ⟩:

M * |ψ⟩ = [[10,5],[5,-10]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] 

Calculating each component:

Top component: 10*(0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) =5 + (5 sqrt(3))/2
Bottom component:5*(0.5) + (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) =2.5 -5 sqrt(3)

Wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, top: 10 * 0.5 is 5. 5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (5 sqrt(3))/2. So top component is 5 + (5√3)/2.

Bottom: 5 *0.5 is 2.5, and (-10)*(sqrt(3)/2) is -10*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 sqrt(3). So bottom component is 2.5 -5√3.

So M|ψ⟩ = [5 + (5√3)/2, 2.5 -5√3]^T.

Now, ⟨ψ| M |ψ⟩ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by this vector.

So, let's compute the dot product:

= 0.5*(5 + (5√3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5√3)

Let me compute each term.

First term: 0.5*(5) = 2.5; 0.5*(5√3/2) = (5√3)/4.

Second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*2.5 = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2; (sqrt(3)/2)*(-5 sqrt(3)) = (-5 *3)/2 = (-15/2).

So adding all components:

2.5 + (5√3)/4 + (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 - 15/2.

Combine like terms.

The numerical terms: 2.5 -7.5 = -5.

Wait, wait. Let's compute each part.

Wait, 0.5 *5 is 2.5. 0.5*(5√3/2) is (5√3)/4.

Then, sqrt(3)/2 * 2.5 is (2.5√3)/2, which is (5√3)/4.

And sqrt(3)/2 * (-5√3) is (sqrt(3)*-5 sqrt(3))/2 = (-5 *3)/2 = -15/2 = -7.5.

So putting it all together:

= [2.5 + (5√3)/4 + (5√3)/4 ] + (-7.5)

Combine the √3 terms: (5√3 +5√3 )/4 = (10√3)/4 = (5√3)/2.

So, it's 2.5 + (5√3)/2 -7.5.

2.5 -7.5 is -5.

So now, the expression is -5 + (5√3)/2.

Wait, let me compute that numerically.

√3 is approximately 1.732.

So (5√3)/2 ≈ (5 *1.732)/2 ≈ (8.66)/2 ≈4.33.

So, -5 +4.33 ≈-0.67.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in computation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, let's compute each term again.

Wait, the first term is 0.5*(5 + (5√3)/2) =0.5 *5 =2.5, 0.5*(5√3/2)= (5√3)/4 ≈ (5*1.732)/4 ≈8.66/4≈2.165.

Then, the second term: (sqrt(3)/2)*(2.5 -5√3) = sqrt(3)/2 *2.5 = (2.5 sqrt(3))/2 ≈ (4.33)/2 ≈2.165.

And sqrt(3)/2 * (-5√3) = (sqrt(3)*-5 sqrt(3))/2 = (-5*3)/2 =-15/2 =-7.5.

So adding all up:

First part: 2.5 +2.165 =4.665.

Second part: 2.165 -7.5 = -5.335.

So total:4.665 -5.335 = -0.67.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which is -0.7 up to one decimal place.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because another approach is to compute the expectation value using the eigenstates.

Wait, another way: since the state is a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are eigenstates of σz, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation of σz and σx separately, then combine them.

Yes, that's another approach. Let me try that.

The expectation value of σz is: ⟨ψ| σz |ψ⟩.

Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively, the expectation value is |a|^2*(1) + |b|^2*(-1), where a and b are the coefficients of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ in |ψ⟩.

In our state, a=0.5, so |a|^2=0.25. b= sqrt(3)/2, so |b|^2=3/4=0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩= 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz is 10 * (-0.5) =-5.

Now, the expectation value of σx. Hmm, that's a bit trickier. Because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are not eigenstates of σx. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Alternatively, we can compute it using the matrix approach.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx in the standard basis is:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]

So, to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, which is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] σx [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Let me compute that.

Multiplying σx by |ψ⟩: 

σx |ψ⟩ = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5]

Then, the bra vector [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] multiplied by this gives:

0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5) = (0.5 sqrt(3))/2 + (0.5 sqrt(3))/2 = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

Wait, that's about 0.866, which is approximately 0.866.

So the expectation value of σx is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So, the expectation value of 5σx is 5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ≈5 *0.866 ≈4.33.

Then, the total expectation value is 10σz +5σx: which is (-5) +4.33 ≈-0.67, same as earlier.

So again, that gives us about -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C.

Wait, but why earlier when I calculated the matrix approach, I got approximately -0.67? Because in the first method, I did the full calculation, and got around -0.67. So this aligns with the second method.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as \( \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle \).

### Step 1: Expectation value of \( \sigma_z \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) of \( \sigma_z \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) in \( |\psi\rangle \) are \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), respectively. The probabilities are \( |a|^2 = 0.25 \) and \( |b|^2 = 0.75 \). Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |a|^2(1) + |b|^2(-1) = 0.25(1) + 0.75(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5
\]

The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot \langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5
\]

### Step 2: Expectation value of \( \sigma_x \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is \( \sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \). To compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \), we use the state \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \). The expectation value is:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_x |\psi\rangle \):

\[
\sigma_x |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}
\]

Now, compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | \sigma_x | \psi \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

The expectation value of \( 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33
\]

### Step 3: Total expectation value
The total expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = \langle 10\sigma_z \rangle + \langle 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **C) -0.7**.

Answer: C
