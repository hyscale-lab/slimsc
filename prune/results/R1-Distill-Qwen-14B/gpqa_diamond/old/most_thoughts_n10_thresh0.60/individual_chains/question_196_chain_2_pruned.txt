Okay, so I've got this question about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. So, in the non-relativistic case, I remember that the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Setting them equal: (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv² → v = sqrt(kA²/m). So that's option C, but wait, this is relativistic, so the speed can't be that. Because in relativity, kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore.

In relativity, the kinetic energy is given by (γ-1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So I need to set the total energy equal to the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy.

Wait, the total energy in the oscillator would be the sum of the potential and kinetic. But in the non-relativistic case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². But in the relativistic case, it's different. Or wait, is the potential energy still the same? The question says it's a harmonic oscillator obeying Hooke's law, F = -kx. So the potential energy is (1/2)kx², I think, same as before.

So at maximum displacement, x = A, so potential energy is (1/2)kA². At that point, the kinetic energy is zero. But wait, that's the potential energy maximum. The maximum kinetic energy occurs at the equilibrium point (x=0), where all energy is kinetic. But wait, no—in the potential, the maximum speed would be when the potential is zero, because that's when all the energy is converted to kinetic, but wait, that's the case for non-relativistic. But in the relativistic case, the energy is different.

Wait, no, actually, the total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) should be conserved, right? So the total energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At x=0, all energy is kinetic. At x=A, all is potential.

But wait, the potential energy is (1/2)kA²
