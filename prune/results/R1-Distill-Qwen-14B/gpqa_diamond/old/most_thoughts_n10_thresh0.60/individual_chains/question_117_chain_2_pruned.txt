Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but let me think this through.

The question lists four compounds and asks which show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a molecule has chiral centers, right? Or maybe it's about geometric isomerism? Wait, no, optical isomerism is specifically about the presence of chiral centers leading to enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. So if a molecule has a chiral center, it can exhibit optical activity, meaning it can rotate plane-polarized light.

Wait, but I remember that sometimes molecules without chiral centers can still show optical isomerism if they have some kind of stereogenic element, like in allenes or if they have a plane of symmetry that's not present in the mirror image. But I think the main point is chiral centers here.

Alright, let's look at each compound one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. So this is a biphenyl structure, which is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, the substituents are nitro groups and carboxylate esters. So each ring has a nitro at position 6 and a carboxylate ester at position 2. The biphenyls are connected at 1 and 1' positions. So the structure is symmetrical? Let me imagine it. The two rings are connected such that each has a nitro and a carb ester. But wait, because the biphenyl is a single bond, it can rotate, so unless the substituents are arranged in such a way that they create a chiral center, but wait, the substituents are on each ring but the central bond allows for rotation. Hmm, but if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule as a whole lacks a plane of symmetry, could it be chiral?

Wait, another thought: if the substituents on each ring are in positions that make the arrangement asymmetric. So let's think about the substituents. Each ring has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So for each ring, numbering clockwise, substituents are 2 (COOCH3) and 6 (NO2). Wait, but on the biphenyl, the positions 2 and 6 are on each ring. So each ring has two groups at 2 and 6. So if the substituents are arranged in a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical, maybe the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but the central bond is a single bond, so will there be free rotation? If so, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Unless the substituents are arranged such that even with rotation, the molecule remains chiral.

Wait, no. Because if the substituents are in positions that allow for the molecule to have a plane of symmetry, then it's not chiral. But if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry, then it's chiral. But wait, in this case, each ring is symmetrical? Let me think: each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate. For a single ring, substituents at 2 and 6 would make the ring symmetrical because 2 and 6 are across from each other. So each ring is a para-substituted benzene. So each ring is symmetrical on its own. But when connected as biphenyl, how?

Wait, the biphenyl is a single bond between the two rings. So the two rings are connected at positions 1 and 1'. So each ring is a benzene with substituents at positions 2 (carboxylate) and 6 (nitro). So each ring is symmetrical in itself. When connected, would the entire molecule be symmetrical? Because if you rotate the central bond, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the bond.

Wait, but if the substitu
