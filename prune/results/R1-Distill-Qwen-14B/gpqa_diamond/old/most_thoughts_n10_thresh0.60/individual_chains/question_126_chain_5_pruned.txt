Okay, so there's this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. Let's see what the question says.

The problem involves two reactions, and after both are done, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. We're supposed to find out how many peaks each will show.

Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one has a ketone at position 3. When reduced, that becomes a secondary alcohol. Let me write that structure.

Original compound: (S) configuration at C5, which is the methoxy group. The structure is CH3-C(O)-CH(CH2CH2OCH3)CH2. Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as:

The molecule is hexan-3-one: so positions 1 to 6. The carbonyl is at C3. So, structure is CH2CH2C(O)CH2CH2OCH3? Wait, no. Let me get the structure right.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3. Wait, no. Hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps more accurately, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH2OCH3) ? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the given compound is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the carbonyl is on C3, and on C5 there's a methoxy group.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, let me count the carbons. Hexan means six carbons. So positions 1 to 6.

1: CH3-
2: CH2-
3: C=
