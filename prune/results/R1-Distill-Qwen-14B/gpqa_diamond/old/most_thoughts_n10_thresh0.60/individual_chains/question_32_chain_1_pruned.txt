Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and calculating the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me think through how to approach this.

The question says the speed is 0.96c. I remember that at such high speeds, relativistic effects become significant. So I probably need to use the relativistic energy equations.

First, I should figure out what the nucleus is. It says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So the isotope would be Li-6 because it has 3 neutrons. Oh wait, no—wait, lithium has an atomic number Z of 3. So normally, Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making it mass number 6. But wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons. So number of neutrons is 3. Let me double-check. For lithium, the common isotopes are Li-6 and Li-7. Li-6 has 3 neutrons, right.

So the nucleus is lithium-6. So I need to find its rest mass. To calculate relativistic energy, I think I need the rest mass energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Wait, but the question is specifically about the kinetic energy, or the total energy? Hmm, the problem says the energy of the RHIC. RHIC accelerators typically provide the kinetic energy, but sometimes they give the total energy. Wait, I'm a bit confused.
