Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the possible decay channels of a boson X with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf f-bar ψf (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψf(y). Wait, maybe I should parse that more carefully.

Wait, Lagrangian terms usually describe the interaction between fields. So in this case, X is a bosonic field, and ψf is a fermion field. The interaction term looks like λ times some fermion fields multiplied by X. So perhaps this is a Yukawa-like interaction, where the boson X couples to fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it can produce fermion-antifermion pairs. The possible decays would be into any fermions whose mass is less than half of X's mass because each fermion must have energy at least equal to their rest mass energy. Since X is 6 GeV, the maximum mass for each fermion pair is 6 GeV / 2 = 3 GeV.

So I need to figure out which fermions have masses less than or equal to 3 GeV. Let me list the known fermion masses:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): around 0.0035 GeV (but in reality, about 2.2 MeV)
- Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV (5 MeV)
- Strange (s): ~0.1 GeV (100 MeV)
- Charm (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom (b): about 4.5 GeV
- Top (t): way heavier, around 173 GeV

Wait, so the fermion pairs must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV. But for each pair, each fermion must be at most 3 GeV because each would take at least their rest mass energy.

Looking at the fermions:

- e, mu, tau: e and mu are way below 3 GeV. Tau is 1.78 GeV, so their pairs are allowed.
- Quarks: u, d, s, c. Let's see their masses. The u and d are negligible, so their pairs (uū, dd) are allowed. S is around 0.1 GeV, so s s-bar is allowed. Charm is 1.5 GeV, so c c-bar would require each c is 1.5 GeV, which is below 3 GeV. So that's allowed.

What about the b quark? Its mass is 4.5 GeV. If X is 6 GeV, then 6 GeV needs to split into two b quarks, each requiring 4.5 GeV, but 4.5 * 2 = 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar because 4.5 > 3 GeV. So bb̄ is not allowed.

Similarly, top quark is 173 GeV, way too heavy. So t t-bar is impossible as well.

So possible fermions for decay are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c. So the possible decay channels are:

X → e+ e-
X → μ+ μ-
X → τ+ τ-
X → u ū
X → d d̄
X → s s̄
X → c c̄

Wait, but wait, what about the tau? Tau is about 1.78 GeV, so each tau would be well under 3 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

But what about the options given? Let's look at the options.

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, e+ e−. So this includes b b̄, which we said is not allowed because 4.5*2=9>6.

Option B: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-. But they have c, which is allowed, but not b. So this seems possible.

Option C: includes c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, tau, mu, e. But t is way too heavy—can't be. So C is out.

Option D: includes b, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. Again, includes b which is too heavy.

So the correct options must be the ones that don't include b or t.

Looking back, the allowed are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So which option includes these but excludes b and t?

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones except for the heavy ones.

But wait, what about the mass of the X boson? If X is 6 GeV, and the c quark is about 1.5 GeV, then c and c̄ would need 3 GeV each— wait, no, wait. Each fermion can have up to 3 GeV. So if the fermion is 1.5 GeV, then two of them would sum to 3 GeV, which is exactly half of 6 GeV. So that's allowed. Similarly, for tau, each is about 1.78 GeV, so two would be 3.56 GeV, which is more than 3 GeV. Wait, wait a second—oh no, wait. Because when a boson at rest decays into two particles, each must have energy at least their rest mass, but their combined rest mass must be less than or equal to the boson's mass.

Wait, the rest frame of X: the total rest mass of the decay products must be ≤ m_X.

So for fermion pair f and f-bar, the invariant mass s is m_f * 2, because each has mass m_f. So for X to decay into f f-bar, the condition is 2 m_f ≤ m_X.

So for X (6 GeV), 2 m_f ≤6 GeV → m_f ≤3 GeV.

So which fermions have m_f ≤3 GeV?

e: yes, m=0.0005 GeV
mu: 0.1 GeV
tau: 1.78 GeV → 2*1.78 =3.56 GeV which is greater than 6 GeV? Wait no, wait:

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the sum of the two fermions' rest masses must be ≤ m_X. Since each has m_f, two of them sum to 2 m_f. So 2 m_f ≤ m_X → m_f ≤ m_X / 2 = 3 GeV.

So any fermion with mass ≤3 GeV can be produced.

Tau has a mass of ~1.78 GeV, which is less than 3 GeV. So tau pair is allowed.

Charm is 1.5 GeV, so 2*1.5=3 GeV, which is exactly the limit. So allowed.

Bottom is 4.5 GeV, which would require 2*4.5=9 GeV, which is way over 6, so not allowed.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the decay channels are X → e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u ū, d d̄, s s̄, c c̄.

Now looking at the options:

Option B includes c, s, u, d, tau, mu, e. So that's all the allowed ones.

Option A includes b and others but misses c, so no.

Option C includes t, which is not allowed.

Option D includes b, which is not allowed.

So the correct answer should be option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction Lagrangian describes a Yukawa-like coupling between \( X \) and fermions, allowing \( X \) to decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. For a decay \( X \to f\bar{f} \) to be kinematically allowed, the total rest mass of the fermion pair must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq m_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( m_X \) is the mass of the boson. Since \( m_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \), the condition becomes \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Allowed Decays:
1. **Electron (\( e \)):** \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
2. **Muon (\( \mu \)):** \( m_\mu \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
3. **Tau (\( \tau \)):** \( m_\tau \approx 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 2m_\tau = 3.56 \, \text{GeV} < 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
4. **Up quark (\( u \)):** \( m_u \approx 0.0035 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
5. **Down quark (\( d \)):** \( m_d \approx 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
6. **Strange quark (\( s \)):** \( m_s \approx 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
7. **Charm quark (\( c \)):** \( m_c \approx 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed, as \( 2m_c = 3 \, \text{GeV} \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
8. **Bottom quark (\( b \)):** \( m_b \approx 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
9. **Top quark (\( t \)):** \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed, as \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).

### Allowed Decay Channels:
The boson \( X \) can decay into the following fermion-antifermion pairs:
- \( X \to e^+ e^- \),
- \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \),
- \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \),
- \( X \to u\bar{u} \),
- \( X \to d\bar{d} \),
- \( X \to s\bar{s} \),
- \( X \to c\bar{c} \).

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A:** Includes \( X \to b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B:** Includes \( X \to c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \), which are all allowed decays. This option is correct.
- **Option C:** Includes \( X \to t\bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This option is incorrect.
- **Option D:** Includes \( X \to b\bar{b} \), which is not allowed. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Answer: B
