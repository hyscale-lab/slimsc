Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can get tricky. Let me take it step by step. The question is about finding the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So the structure should be a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromo group, and position 5 has a nitro group. The acetone (ethanone) is attached to the benzene ring at position 1 because it's 1-phenyl.

Wait, no, wait. The substituents in the phenyl group are on the benzene, but the ethanone is attached to the benzene. So the benzene ring has three substituents: one at position 1 (the ketone group), one at position 3 (bromo), and one at position 5 (nitro). So the benzene ring looks like this: positions 1 is the ketone (O=C-), position 3 is Br, and position 5 is NO2.

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so numbering can be a bit confusing. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the ketone group at position 1. Then, the bromo group is at position 3 (two carbons away in the meta position relative to the ketone), and the nitro is at position 5 (four positions away, but perhaps that's para to bromo? Or maybe it's meta to the ketone as well.)

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the substituents as being meta to each other. Let me sketch it out mentally. Benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (O=C-), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, the positions are 1, 3, and 5, which are all meta to each other. That makes sense because meta substituents are possible in this structure.

So the target molecule is a tri-substituted benzene with a ketone, bromo, and nitro groups in the 1,3,5 positions.

Now, the question is about the reaction sequence starting from benzene. So the steps will involve various substituents being added to the benzene ring.

Let me think about the order of adding substituents. Because each substitution reaction can affect the next based on directing effects, the order matters.

The functional groups we're adding are:

- Bromo (Br)
- Nitro (NO2)
- Ketone (O=C-CH2CH3?)

Wait, no. The ketone is attached directly to the benzene ring as a substituent. So the phenyl group is attached to the ketone. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-CH3? Or wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but as a substituent on the benzene, it's Ph-C(O)-CH3. Wait, no: ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-, so when attached to benzene, it's Ph-C(O)-CH3? Or maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but when attached as a substituent, the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH2CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is propan-2-one? No, wait. Let me correct that. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, which is also known as acetone. But wait, the structure would be (CH3)2CO, so if the benzene is attached to the carbonyl group, it's Ph-C(O)-CH3. So the substituent is a ketone group, specifically an acetyl group attached to the benzene.

So the benzene has the substituents: Acetyl (O=C-CH3) at position 1, Br at position 3, and NO2 at position 5.

Wait, but when adding substituents to benzene via electrophilic substitution, each substituent directs the next substitution based on whether it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing.

The ketone (acetyl group) is a deactivating group because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. It is meta-directing. Similarly, nitro groups are strong meta directors. Bromine is ortho/para director but deactivating because it's an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity).

So the order in which we introduce these groups will determine where each substituent ends up.

Let me outline the possibilities.

Option A: The steps are CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acetylation), then Br2/FeBr3, then HNO3/H2SO4, Fe/HCl, HNO3/H2SO4, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts acetylation requires the ring to be activated. Benzene is activated, but once you add a deactivating group, subsequent reactions may not proceed easily.

Wait, perhaps I should plan the order of adding substituents.

If we first add the acetyl group (as it's an activating group?), wait, no. Friedel-Crafts acetylation is for activating rings. Benzene is activated enough for that. Once the acetyl is added, the ring becomes deactivated (since acetyl is deactivating), so adding other groups would be harder.

So, perhaps the acetyl group is introduced first. Then, nitration and bromination would have to compete, but since acetyl is meta-directing, adding nitro and bromo would go into specific positions.

Wait, but wait a second. The target has the acetyl, bromo, and nitro groups. So if we add acetyl first, then nitro and bromo.

But let me think: the acetyl group is meta-directing. So if I nitrate after acetylation, the nitro group would go into the meta position relative to the acetyl. Then, bromination would occur in which positions? Depending on the existing substituents.

But I need to get the substituents in the 1,3,5 positions. So perhaps the acetyl is added first, then nitro, then bromo.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivator. So after adding nitro, it's hard to add another group. So maybe the bromine comes before the nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is introduced first, then the acetyl, but that might not work because nitro is a strong deactivator, making the ring less reactive towards Friedel-Crafts (which requires an activated ring).

So, first step: Acetylation of benzene with CH3COCl and AlCl3. This adds the acetyl group to the benzene ring.

Now, the ring has an acetyl group, which is a meta director. Next, let's add the nitro group. Where would it go? Since the acetyl is meta-directing, the nitro would enter in the meta position relative to the acetyl. So that's position 5 if the acetyl is position 1.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about numbering. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the acetyl group at position 1. Then, the meta positions to that would be positions 3 and 5 (since benzene is a ring of six, so positions 1, 3, 5 are all meta to each other). Wait, no. On a benzene ring, each position is separated by two carbons. So position 1, then position 3 is two positions away, that's meta. So if the acetyl is at position 1, nitro would go to position 3 or 5, depending on where we direct.

Wait, but if we have only one substituent (the acetyl), then the nitration would typically occur in two possible meta positions. But when multiple substituents are present, their directing effects can influence where the next group goes.

Wait, but after acetyl, let's nitrate. Acetyl is meta directing, so nitro would go into position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3 for this example.

Then, the next substituent we want is bromine. Now, the acetyl is at 1, nitro at 3. What's the directing effect now? Acetyl is deactivating and meta directing. Nitro is deactivating and meta directing. But which substituent has a stronger directing effect?

In such cases, the strongest directing group (the most deactivating) usually directs the incoming electrophile. Wait, no, actually, the position of the substituents and their directing effects can lead to the incoming group going into a certain position. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the next substituent goes into the remaining meta position.

Wait, but perhaps after acetylation and nitration, the bromine would go into position 5, which is the remaining meta position relative to the acetyl. Or maybe it's directed by the nitro group, which is at position 3. The nitro group is meta directing, so the bromine would go into position 5 (two positions away from nitro) or position 1, but position 1 is already occupied by acetyl.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the possible options given and try to deduce the correct order.

Looking at the options, each option has a sequence of reactions.

Option A: i) Friedel-Crafts acetylation, ii) Br2/FeBr3, iii) HNO3/H2SO4, iv) Fe/HCl, v) HNO3/H2SO4, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts is step i. Then step ii is bromination. So after acetylation, benzene has the acetyl group. Then bromine would add where? Acetyl is meta directing, so bromine adds in the meta position, say position 3.

But then step iii is nitration. After acetyl and bromine, the ring has two substituents: acetyl (1) and Br (3). Now, the acetyl is deactivating and meta directing, and Br is deactivating but ortho/para directing. So when nitrating, where would the nitro group go?

The acetyl at 1 is meta directing, so it would direct towards positions 4 and 6 (if considering the acetyl as the main director). But the Br at position 3 is ortho/para directing. So the nitro could end up in position 4 (meta to acetyl) or ortho to Br (position 2 or 4). Wait, position 4 is meta to acetyl (position 1) and para to Br (position 3). So perhaps the nitro would go to position 4, but that would leave the substituents at 1,3,4. But our target has substituents at 1,3,5. So this might not be the right path.

Alternatively, maybe after acetylation and bromination, nitration occurs in a way that the nitro group ends up in position 5. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the directing effects. The acetyl group is a stronger director than Br? Or vice versa? Acetyl is a meta director, Br is ortho/para. So when multiple groups are present, the most activating group tends to dominate, but in this case, both are deactivating. Hmm, perhaps the acetyl's meta direction would take priority, so the nitro would go to position 5.

Wait, but that's assuming that the acetyl is the dominant director. Alternatively, the Br might direct the nitro to position 2 or 4.

This is getting complicated. Maybe let me look at the target structure: substituents at 1,3,5. So perhaps the acetyl is at 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5.

To get that, perhaps the nitro has to be added last, because adding nitro after Br (which is in position 3) might direct it to position 5.

Wait, but nitro is a strong meta director. So if I have substituents at 1 (acetyl) and 3 (Br), maybe the nitration would go to position 5, which is meta to the acetyl and para to the Br. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the nitro group before the acetyl. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating ring. Nitro groups deactivate the ring, making it less reactive towards electrophilic substitution, so adding acetyl after nitro might not work.

Wait, another approach: the target has three substituents. Let's consider the order in which they are added.

Possibility 1: Acetyl first, then Br, then nitro.

But as discussed, after acetyl and Br, nitration would be directed by both. Maybe the nitro ends up in the correct position.

Possibility 2: Br first, then nitro, then acetyl. But after Br and nitro, the ring is highly deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Possibility 3: Nitro first, then Br, then acetyl. But nitro deactivates, making Friedel-Crafts hard.

Possibility 4: Nitro first, then acetyl, then Br. Wait, nitro deactivates, so Friedel-Crafts (acetylation) might not work.

So perhaps the correct order is acetyl first, then nitro, then Br. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option A has acetylation first, then bromination, then nitration. So the substituents would be 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), then where is the nitro added? Let's think again. After acetyl (1) and Br (3), nitration would occur. The directors are acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para). So the nitro would go into position 4 (meta to acetyl) or position 5 (which is para to Br). Wait, para to Br would be position 6 (if Br is at 3, then para is position 6, but position 6 is also meta to acetyl at 1). Alternatively, perhaps the nitro goes to position 5, which is meta to acetyl (position 1) and para to Br (position 3). Because from position 3, para is 6, but position 5 is meta to 3. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would go to position 5 because it's meta to the acetyl and para to the Br. So that would give substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). That's exactly what we need. So the order would be:

1. Acetylation (CH3COCl/AlCl3) → acetyl at position 1.

2. Bromination (Br2/FeBr3) → Br at position 3 (meta to acetyl).

3. Nitration (HNO3/H2SO4) → nitro at position 5 (meta to acetyl and para to Br).

But wait, let me check if that's the case. So after acetyl and Br, nitrating would see the acetyl directing to positions 3 and 5, but Br is at 3, so the nitro would go to 5.

Yes, that would work. So the substituents would be at 1, 3, and 5.

Wait, but let me see what the options say. Option A has steps i) acetylation, ii) Br, iii) nitration. So after that, would the substituents be in the correct positions? If yes, then this sequence could work.

But wait, looking at option A, after nitration, steps iv) through vii) are done. That seems confusing. Because in the target molecule, there's only three substituents: acetyl, Br, and nitro. But the options have more steps, perhaps involving other reactions.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look again at the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5.

So, the substituents are correctly positioned.

But looking at the reaction steps in option A, after the initial acetylation, bromination, and nitration, there are more steps: iv) Fe/HCl, v) HNO3/H2SO4, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because we already have the nitro group. So perhaps the option is not correct. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after some other steps.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to introduce the nitro group before the acetyl. But as I thought earlier, nitro is a strong deactivator, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't work. So perhaps that's not possible.

Another possibility: The nitro and Br are added in a way that allows the acetyl to be introduced in the correct position.

Wait, perhaps the steps are: nitro group first, then Br, then acetyl. But again, nitro would deactivate the ring, making acetylation difficult.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the substituents step by step.

First, adding the acetyl group via Friedel-Crafts. So step i is acetylation. Now, the ring has an acetyl group (position 1). Next, bromine is added, which goes into the meta position relative to acetyl (position 3). Then, nitration is done. The acetyl is meta-directing, and the nitro would go into the meta position relative to acetyl, which is position 5. So now substituents are at 1,3,5. So that's correct.

So, the steps would be: acetylate, brominate, nitrate. That matches the first three steps of option A. So in option A, after that, what happens? Steps iv) to vii) involve Fe/HCl, HNO3, NaNO2, H3PO2, which don't seem necessary. Because the target only has three substituents. So perhaps option A is not the correct one because after step iii, we have the correct structure, but the rest of the steps in option A might be adding more groups, which would complicate things.

Wait, but the target molecule has only three substituents, so the reaction steps should stop after adding them. So perhaps option A is not the correct one because it includes extra steps beyond what's needed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps in the options. Let me look at option B.

Option B: i) Br2/FeBr3, then HNO3, then CH3COCl, then HNO3, Fe/HCl, NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2.

So first, bromination of benzene gives bromobenzene. Then nitration. Then acetylation. Then nitration again? That seems odd because we already have a nitro group. Maybe not.

But this would lead to multiple nitro groups, which isn't needed. So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option C: i) HNO3/H2SO4, then Fe/HCl, then CH3COCl, then Br2, then HNO3, etc. So nitration first. But nitro is a deactivator, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So after nitration, adding acetyl via Friedel-Crafts might not work. So option C probably isn't correct.

Option D: i) HNO3, then Fe/HCl, then NaNO2/HCl, H3PO2, then Br2, then CH3COCl, then HNO3. Hmm, that seems a bit messy. The initial steps involve nitration, then some reactions that might involve diazotization, like a Sandmeyer reaction perhaps? But I'm not sure. But after that, adding Br and acetyl? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps differently. The target is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. So in terms of synthesis, perhaps the acetyl is introduced first, followed by nitro, then bromo.

Wait, but earlier analysis suggests that after acetylation (step i), bromination (step ii), and nitration (step iii), we get substituents at 1,3,5, which would be correct.

So option A's first three steps would achieve that. But then why are there more steps? Let me look at option A's steps again.

Option A's steps:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylate benzene.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate. Acetyl is meta director, so Br goes to position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate. Acetyl is meta, so nitro goes to position 5.

So after step iii, the compound has substituents at 1 (acetyl), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). So that's the target. So why are there more steps in option A?

Looking at the full sequence:

i) Acetylate → benzene to acetophenone.

ii) Brominate → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) Nitrate → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. Which is our target.

So steps iv) to vii) in option A are Fe/HCl, then HNO3, then NaNO2/HCl, then H3PO2.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. After getting the target, why would they do more reactions? So perhaps option A is not the correct one.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the target isn't the final product. Let me read the question again.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, that's the same as 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone. So, after steps i, ii, iii, we have the target. So the rest of the steps in option A would be unnecessary, and perhaps the product would be altered.

So, perhaps option A is not the correct sequence.

Alternatively, maybe the initial steps are correct, but the other steps are part of a purification or workup. But in the context of a synthesis problem, the correct sequence should produce the target without extra steps that change the structure.

So perhaps the correct option is option C, but wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct order is to nitrate first, then acetylate, then brominate. But as I thought earlier, nitro deactivates, making Friedel-Crafts difficult.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the acetyl group is added after the nitro group. But how?

If we first nitrate benzene, getting nitrobenzene. Then, acetylation via Friedel-Crafts is difficult because nitro is deactivating. But maybe under certain conditions, it's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added via a different method, like using a directing group.

Wait, perhaps the acetyl is introduced via a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the nitro is introduced after the acetyl, which is possible.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is acetyl → nitro → bromine.

So, let's consider option A. After acetylation (step i), bromination (step ii), nitration (step iii) gives the substituents at 1,3,5. So that's correct.

But why does option A have more steps? Let me read the question again. The question asks for the sequence that leads to the high-yield synthesis. So perhaps the extra steps in the options are for some other purpose, but the correct sequence would end after step iii.

But looking at the options, each option has seven steps. So perhaps the target is not the end product, but an intermediate, and the subsequent steps might be part of a larger synthesis. But the question states that the target is the final product, so perhaps the correct sequence is the first three steps of option A, and the rest are not needed. But none of the options stop at step iii. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the steps after iii in option A are for substituting or modifying existing groups. But that would change the structure, which we don't want.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is not the product of the first three steps. Let me think about the substituents again. Maybe I got the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps the ketone is at position 1, the bromo at position 3, and the nitro at position 5. So we have all three substituents. So, as per the correct reaction steps, the first three steps of option A are correct, but the remaining steps must not alter the structure. But looking at steps iv) to vii) in option A: iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reducing something, like Fe/HCl could be for dissolving metal reduction. Then v) HNO3 again, which would add another nitro group, which we don't want. So that's not good.

So perhaps option A is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is nitration first, then bromination, then acetylation. But I'm not sure.

Let me think about another approach. The target molecule has three substituents: Br, NO2, and Acetyl. The order to add them:

Because nitro is a strong deactivator, perhaps it's added last. Because if you add it early, the ring becomes too deactivated for further substitution.

So, perhaps the order is: acetyl first, then Br, then NO2.

Which would correspond to option A's steps i, ii, iii. So the target is achieved after step iii. So why do the other steps in option A exist?

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read the question again.

The question is which sequence of reactions would lead to the high-yield synthesis of the target. The options list seven steps each. So the correct answer must be the sequence that, when followed, produces the target molecule.

Looking back, option A's first three steps might produce the target, but the other steps could be doing something else, perhaps leading to a different product.

Wait, let me think about each option's steps.

Option A:

i) Acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) HNO3 → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (target).

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe dissolving metal reduction? But on what?

Wait, if we have 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone and treat it with Fe/HCl, maybe the nitro group is reduced to amine. Then, HNO3 would nitrate again. That would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

So option A's steps after iii would change the product, which is not wanted.

So perhaps option B is not correct.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro group added. Where? Since bromobenzene is para/ortho directing, nitration would occur at para to Br, which is position 4. So structure is 4-nitro-bromo-benzene.

Wait, but the target needs substituents at 3 and 5. So perhaps after nitration, the substituents are at position 4 (nitro) and 1 (Br, assuming bromobenzene has Br at position 1). Then step iii is acetylation.

But acetyl needs to be added where? Acetylation is an electrophilic substitution. Bromobenzene's Br is at 1, nitro at 4. So the acetyl would be directed by both. But I'm not sure, but this seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is the correct one.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → Fe and HCl, perhaps reducing the nitro group to amine. So we get aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetylation of aniline. But aniline is a strong activating group, but it's a primary amine. Wait, acetylation of aniline would require Friedel-Crafts, but aniline is strongly activating, so perhaps the acetylation is possible. But wait, Friedel-Crafts acetylation typically doesn't work on aniline because the amine is too activating, leading to over-reaction, or because the amine's lone pair attacks the AlCl3, making it ineffective. So perhaps this step is not feasible, so option C is incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a Sandmeyer reaction? But H3PO2 is a reducing agent, not typically used for substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's for something else.

Wait, perhaps the steps are for introducing substituents in a different way. But this is getting too vague.

Let me think about another angle. The target has a nitro group at 5 and bromo at 3. So perhaps the nitro group is added after the bromo group.

Wait, but if the acetyl is added first, then bromo, then nitro.

So the initial steps are acetylation, bromination, nitration. Which gives the correct substituents.

So in option A, steps i, ii, iii give the correct product. But why are there steps iv and beyond? There must be a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the target is not the product after step iii. Let me check the structure again.

Wait, after step iii in option A, the product is 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone, which is the target. So the subsequent steps in option A would alter the structure, which is not desired. So option A is not correct.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the directing effects again.

Another approach: Let's think about each substituent's position relative to where they could be added.

The target has substituents at positions 1,3,5. So the acetyl is at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So, during synthesis, each substituent should be added in a way that directs the next group to the correct position.

Let me imagine that the acetyl is added first. Then, the bromo is added in the meta position (3). Then, the nitro is added in the meta position relative to the acetyl, which is position 5.

So steps: acetyl → bromo → nitro.

Which matches the first three steps of option A.

But option A's steps continue, which would change the structure. So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that can't be the case.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that option A's steps beyond iii are part of the synthesis. Perhaps the target is formed in a later step, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the nitro group is added after the bromine, but the nitration requires a different position.

Wait, perhaps after acetylation and bromination, the nitration occurs in the position 5, which is correct.

So, after step iii, we have the target. So the correct option would be whichever includes steps i, ii, iii, and no further steps that would modify the structure.

But all the options have seven steps. So perhaps the correct option is option A, but only the first three steps are relevant, and the rest are extraneous. But that can't be, as the options are given as a full sequence.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction steps. Let me think about option A's steps:

i) Acetylation.

ii) Bromination.

iii) Nitration.

iv) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction, but of what? Perhaps the nitro group is reduced to amine.

v) HNO3 → nitrate again, which would add another nitro group, which is not desired.

So that's not good.

Hmm, this is getting really complicated. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me think about the nitro group. Nitro groups are typically introduced via nitration, which requires a ring that's activated. But since nitro is deactivating, once added, it makes the ring less reactive. So to add another substituent, the ring must have an activating group present.

Wait, in the target, the acetyl group is present, which is a deactivating group, but it's a meta director. So after adding nitro and acetyl, perhaps the bromine is added in a position directed by the acetyl.

Wait, let me think of the order as nitro first, then acetyl, then bromo. But as mentioned earlier, acetylation after nitro is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added after nitro, but using a different method, like using a directing group.

But I'm not sure.

Another thought: Maybe the acetyl is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, which requires a strongly activated ring, perhaps after nitration and bromination. But I'm not familiar with such a process.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetyl is added last, using a different directing group. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to add the nitro group first, then the bromine, and then the acetyl. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Wait, if nitro is added first, the ring is deactivated. Then adding bromine would be difficult. Plus, the nitro is a meta director, so the bromine would go into a meta position relative to nitro. Then, acetylation would be difficult because the ring is deactivated.

This seems unlikely.

Hmm. This is getting too complicated, and I'm not making progress quickly. Let me try to think of each option's steps and where the substituents would end up.

Option A:

i) Acetyl → position 1.

ii) Br → position 3.

iii) Nitro → position 5.

So after step iii, target is achieved. But steps iv onward: Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine, which would change the substituent. So option A is not correct.

Option B:

i) Br → position 1.

ii) Nitro → position 4 (para to Br).

iii) Acetyl → where? The directors are Br (ortho/para) and nitro (meta). So acetyl might go into position 3 (meta to nitro) or position 2 or 6 (ortho to Br). Wait, if the substituents are at 1 (Br) and 4 (nitro), the acetyl could go to position 3, which is meta to nitro and ortho to Br. But I'm not sure.

Then step iv) nitrate again → another nitro group, which is not desired.

Option B seems to lead to incorrect positions and extra nitro groups.

Option C:

i) Nitro → position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

iii) Acetylation → where? Aniline is a strong activating group, so acetylation would occur in the ortho or para positions relative to the amine. So acetyl could end up at position 3 or 5. Then step iv) Br2 → bromination would be directed by the amine (activating, ortho/para) and the acetyl (meta). So perhaps Br would go into position 5 (if acetyl is at 3) or position 3 (if acetyl is at 5). But I'm not certain.

This seems messy, and I'm not confident.

Option D:

i) Nitro → position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a reaction like the Bechamp reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, H3PO2 is a reducing agent, maybe used for something else.

v) Br2 → brominate.

vi) Acetylation → where?

vii) Nitration → again, which would add another nitro.

This seems to complicate matters further.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Based on my earlier analysis, the correct order should be acetyl first, then Br, then nitro. So option A's first three steps are correct. But since the rest of the steps in option A are unnecessary and would alter the product, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only the first three steps are needed. But the options don't allow for that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the target requires only three substituents. Let me recheck the target structure. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the substituents are acetyl (position 1), Br (3), and nitro (5). So three substituents in total.

Looking back, perhaps the correct option is option A, and the rest of the steps are perhaps for working up or isolating the product, but not changing the structure.

Wait, but Fe/HCl is a strong reducing agent. If the nitro group is present, Fe/HCl would reduce it to an amine. So after step iii in option A, if we proceed with step iv, the nitro group would be converted to amine, which is not desired.

So option A's steps after iii would change the structure, making it incorrect.

So perhaps none of the options are correct, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I have to think differently. Let me think about the order of the substituents based on their activating or deactivating nature.

The acetyl group is deactivating (meta director), Br is deactivating (ortho/para), and nitro is deactivating (meta). So adding them in the order of most activating to least is not possible because all are deactivating. Alternatively, perhaps the order should allow each substituent to direct the next into the desired position.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is nitro first, then acetyl, then Br. But as I thought earlier, acetylation after nitro is difficult.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is Br first, then acetyl, then nitro.

Let me think: benzene → bromobenzene (step i: Br2/FeBr3). Then acetylation (step ii: CH3COCl/AlCl3) → now acetyl is at position 3 (meta to Br). Then nitration (step iii: HNO3) would be directed by acetyl (meta) and Br (ortho/para). Where would the nitro group go? If acetyl is at 3, and Br at 1, then the nitro would go to position 5 (meta to acetyl and para to Br). Which is correct.

So the substituents would be:

Br at 1, acetyl at 3, nitro at 5. But the target requires acetyl at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the correct sequence is bromine first, then acetylation, then nitration, but that would put substituents at 1 (Br), 3 (acetyl), 5 (nitro). Which is not the target's structure, which has acetyl at 1.

So that doesn't work.

Wait, perhaps after bromobenzene (Br at position 1), acetylation occurs at position 3 (meta to Br), making 3-acetyl-1-bromobenzene. Then nitration would occur at position 5 (meta to acetyl and para to Br). So substituents at 1 (Br), 3 (acetyl), 5 (nitro).

But this would make the acetyl at position 3, which is not the target's position 1. So that's incorrect.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here.

Another approach: Let me think about the ortho, meta, para positions. The benzene ring has six positions. Let me number them as follows:

1 : position where acetyl is attached.

3 : position where Br is attached.

5 : position where nitro is attached.

So the substituents are at 1,3,5, all meta to each other.

To achieve this, the first substituent (acetyl) must be added, then the next (Br) must be added in the meta position of acetyl, then the nitro added in the meta position of acetyl (which is 5, assuming acetyl is at 1).

So the correct order is acetyl → Br → nitro.

Which is the first three steps of option A.

But as before, option A's later steps would change the structure.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the steps in the options. Let me look again.

Option A:

i) acetylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br → 3-bromoacetophenone.

iii) nitration → 3-bromo-5-nitroacetophenone (target).

iv) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduce Br to something else? But that would change the substituent.

So option A's steps after iii would alter the product, making it incorrect.

So perhaps the correct answer is none of the options. But that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point. The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ketone is at the benzene ring's position 1. So the substituent is a phenyl group attached to the ketone, but no, wait, the structure is Ph-C(O)-CH3. So the ketone is directly attached to the benzene.

So the substituents are on the benzene ring. So the acetyl is part of the benzene substituent.

Wait, no, the benzene is attached to the ketone. So the substituents on the benzene are Br and nitro. So the structure is:

Ph-C(O)-CH3, where Ph is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl.

So in this case, the acetyl is at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So, to get this structure, perhaps the acetyl is added first, then Br, then nitro.

Which is what option A's steps i, ii, iii do.

So, the correct answer must be option A, despite the confusion about the extra steps.

Wait, maybe the extra steps in option A are part of a workup or protecting groups, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misreading the steps.

But given the options, the only one where the substituents are added in the correct order (acetyl, Br, nitro) is option A. So I'll go with option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: an acetyl group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. These substituents are all meta-directing, and their positions are determined by the sequence of reactions.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acetylation introduces the acetyl group at position 1 on benzene.
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3, which is meta to the acetyl group.
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ introduces the nitro group at position 5, which is meta to the acetyl group and para to the bromine.
   - After these three steps, the target molecule is formed. However, the remaining steps (iv–vii) involve reactions that would alter the structure (e.g., reduction of the nitro group to an amine), making them unnecessary for the synthesis of the target molecule.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step i**: Bromination adds bromine at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 4 (para to bromine).
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acetylation would place the acetyl group at position 3 (meta to nitro and ortho to bromine).
   - This sequence does not lead to the correct positions for the substituents (1, 3, 5), and additional steps would not correct this issue.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acetylation would place the acetyl group at position 3 (meta to the amine).
   - Subsequent steps would not achieve the correct positions for the substituents.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl and subsequent reaction with H₃PO₂ would not lead to the correct substituent positions.
   - Additional steps would not achieve the desired structure.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule is **Option A**, as the first three steps (acetylation, bromination, and nitration) place the substituents at the correct positions (1, 3, 5). While the remaining steps in Option A are unnecessary and would alter the product, they are included in the given options. Therefore, **Option A** is the best choice.
