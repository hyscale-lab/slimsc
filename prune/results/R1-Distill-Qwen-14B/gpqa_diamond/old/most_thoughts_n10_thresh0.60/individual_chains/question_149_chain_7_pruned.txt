Okay, so I've got this question about an NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, let's try to break it down.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum looks okay except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, it's not a splitting due to coupling because the coupling pattern rules that out. Wait, why would coupling not explain it? Oh, right, because spin-spin coupling (like between adjacent protons) would usually cause splitting into multiple peaks, not two separate peaks for the same proton. So maybe it's something else.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So in LC-MS, each peak is a different compound. But same mass? Oh, same molecular weight, so they have the same molecular formula. So what could cause two peaks with same mass?

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. Hmm, a precursor would have a different mass, right? Like, the starting material before a reaction. So if the molecule is a peptide, the precursor might be the previous peptide before the last addition. But the mass spec shows same mass, so probably not a different molecule. So A might not be the answer.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so they have same mass. In LC-MS, if the column is chiral, you might see separate peaks. But if it's a regular column, it might not separate them because they have same physical properties except for chirality. Wait, but LC-MS can sometimes not separate enantiomers because they might elute at the same time. Unless the column is chiral. But the question says they are clearly defined, so maybe it is a chiral column. But in NMR, enantiomers would have same shifts because the environments are same. So why two peaks in NMR? Oh wait, the NMR shows two peaks for same alpha proton. Enantiomers would not cause that because their structures are mirror images, so the alpha proton's environment is same. So same shifts and integrals. But here, the integrals add up to 1H. Enantiomers would each contribute equally, so their peaks would sum to the same. Wait, but if it's a 50-50 mix
