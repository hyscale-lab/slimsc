Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to parse it step by step. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

First, the setup: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think that means |alpha> can be written as a linear combination of the spin-up and spin-down states in the z-basis. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i) respectively, but since it's proportional, we'll need to normalize it later.

The question asks for two things: the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator.

The operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, wait. So it's a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 systems (up and down). Let me write that matrix out.

For a 2x2 matrix, the elements are:
A_11 = 0 (since i=j=1)
A_12 = ħ/2 (i=1, j=2)
A_21 = ħ/2 (i=2, j=1)
A_22 = 0 (i=2, j=2)
So the matrix looks like:
[ 0, ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2, 0 ]

Wait, that's an anti-diagonal matrix. I remember that such matrices are related to spin operators in different directions. Oh wait, for example, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], but here the off-diagonal elements are ħ/2 instead of 1. So maybe this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are defined such that σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z=diag(1,-1). So the operator in question is (ħ/2) σ_x. Because when you multiply σ_x by ħ/2, you get exactly the matrix here.

Now, the eigenstates of σ_x are |+x> and |-x>, which are the eigenstates of the X operator. So the operator A in this problem is (ħ/2) σ_x, so its eigenstates are the same as σ_x, just scaled by a factor.

So the eigenstates of A are |+x> and |-x>, and the eigenvalues would be (ħ/2) times the eigenvalues of σ_x. Since σ_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1, the eigenvalues for A would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Actually, the operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x, so the eigenvalues are (ħ/2)*1 and (ħ/2)*(-1). So yes, eigenvalues are ±ħ/2.

So the problem is to find the probability of measuring +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 when we measure the operator A on the state |alpha>, and also find the expectation value (average) of A.

So first, I need to write the state |alpha> in the eigenbasis of A, which is the x-basis (|+x> and |-x>). Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to express |alpha> in the x-basis and find the coefficients, which would directly give the probabilities.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with expectation values and probabilities, perhaps we can use the general method where:

The probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the amplitude when the state is projected onto the corresponding eigenstate.

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Normalize the given state |alpha>. The state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, so I'll find the normalization constant.

2. Express |alpha> in the x-basis (eigenstates of A). Alternatively, express the eigenstates of A in the z-basis, then project |alpha> onto them.

3. The probabilities will be the squared magnitudes of these projections.

4. The expectation value is the sum of each eigenvalue multiplied by its probability.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute the expectation value using the operator's matrix representation.

Wait, since the eigenstates of A are known, perhaps it's better to proceed that way. Let me think.

First, let's normalize |alpha>.

The given state is |alpha> = a |up> + b |down>, where a = (1+i), b = (2 - i).

The norm is |a|^2 + |b|^2.

Calculating |1+i|²: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

|2 - i|²: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 + 1 =5.

So total norm is 2 +5 =7. So the normalized state is |alpha_normalized> = (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the eigenstates of A (which is (ħ/2) σ_x) are |+x> and |-x>, which are:

|+x> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|–x> = (|up> – |down>)/sqrt(2)

Wait, no, wait. The eigenstates of σ_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), because σ_x swaps |up> and |down>.

Alternatively, another representation: σ_x |up> = |down>, so the eigenstate |+x
