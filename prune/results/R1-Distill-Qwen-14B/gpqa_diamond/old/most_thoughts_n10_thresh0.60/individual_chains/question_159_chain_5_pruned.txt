Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in near-infrared and optical. The flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I remember something about the Lyman-alpha forest or emission lines in quasars. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the rest frame. But quasars often have emission lines that are redshifted because they're moving away from us or because the universe is expanding.

Wait, the peak is at 790 nm. If that's the Lyman-alpha line, then the redshift z would be (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So let me compute that. Observed is 790 nm, rest is 121 nm. 790 / 121 is approximately 6.5289. Subtract 1, so z is about 5.5289. So z is around 5.5.

Wait, but wait a second. Near-infrared goes up to about 2500 nm, so 790 is near the optical, but I'm not sure if that's the right line. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman limit? No, the Lyman limit is about 91 nm, so that doesn't fit. Oh, unless I'm mixing up the series or lines. Wait, the Balmer series is in the optical. The Balmer-alpha line is H-alpha at about 656 nm. So if the peak is at 790, that's longer than H-alpha. Hmm, maybe it's a different line.

Wait, maybe it's the Lyman series. Lyman-alpha is 121 nm. If it's observed at 790, that's a big redshift. So z would be (790/121) - 1 ≈ 6.5289, so z≈6.5. Wait, but wait, that's a very high redshift. High-z objects are very far away.

But the question is about the comoving distance at scale factor a=1 (which is now). So the comoving distance is the distance to the quasar when the universe was at scale factor a, which for a=1 is now. Wait, no,
