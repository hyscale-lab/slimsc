Okay, so I have this question about qPCR results and I need to figure it out. Let me think through what I know.

First, the scenario: a scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and ran it with three technical replicates on serially diluted samples. The efficiency was 100%, which I remember means the reaction is perfect, so each cycle doubles the DNA. The R² was 1, so the data fit the curve perfectly, and the slope was -3.3.

Looking at the data, the Ct values are decreasing as the concentration increases. That makes sense because higher concentrations should reach the threshold sooner (lower Ct). Each dilution is a ten-fold decrease, right? So 100,000 to 10,000 is ten times less, then 1,000, etc.

The question is about the discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D.

Option A says qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. But wait, the efficiency is 100% and R² is 1, so the curve worked. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Ct values don't align with target amounts. But the data shows a clear trend—higher concentration gives lower Ct. Each dilution step is 10x, and the Ct is about 3.3 cycles higher each time. Since the slope is -3.3, I think this is correct because the slope in the formula is related to efficiency. Since efficiency is 100%, the calculation is log2(10) ≈3.32, which matches the slope. So the Ct's do agree with the amount, so B might not be the right answer.

Option C: Ten-fold dilution is more than 3.3 cycles. Hmm, 3.3 cycles is about log2(10) because 2^3.3 is about 10. So that's correct. A ten-fold dilution should cause a decrease in Ct by about 3.3. Looking at the data, each step's Ct is about 3.3 higher than the next. For example, 100000 to 10000: 33.9 to 30.6. 33.9 -30.6 is about 3.3. Similarly, 30.6 to 27.3 is 3.3. So this is correct and not a discrepancy. So C is not the issue.

Option D: The deviation between technical replicates is more than 0.3. Looking at each Ct set: 

At 100000: 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The differences are 0.3, 0.6. The max deviation from the mean is 0.3 (33.9 vs 34.2 is 0.3). Similarly, 10000: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Each is 0.3 apart. The same goes for the others. So the deviations are within 0.3, which is acceptable. So D is not the problem.

Wait, but the question is about the discrepancies in his results. Looking back at the question, the options are about why the results are as they are. But all the data seems consistent. The Ct values are as expected. So what's the issue?

Wait, the question is asking which option explains the discrepancies in his results. But all the data seems to fit the expected curve. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, looking back, the data shows that at each dilution, each replicate Ct is different by about 0.3. The scientist is using three technical replicates, which are replicates within the same sample. The Ct values should have a low variance because technical replicates are expected to be very close. So the maximum deviation in each set is about 0.3, which is acceptable. So D says the deviation is more than 0.3, but in this case, it's exactly 0.3 or less. So D is not the reason. Therefore, the question's discrepancies must be elsewhere.

Wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. Let me re-read the question. He got the Ct values as given. The options are about why there are discrepancies. But all his results are consistent with the expected curve, so why are there discrepancies?

Wait, maybe the question is pointing out that the Ct values are decreasing with higher concentrations, which is correct, but the options are more about the possible issues. Alternatively, maybe the issue is that the Ct values don't vary as expected with dilution.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the Ct values are varying more than expected. But in the data, each dilution step is exactly 3.3 cycles. So for example, 100,000 to 10
