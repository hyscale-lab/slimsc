Okay, so I've got this problem here about stars and their elemental abundances. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. But wait, the mass might not be directly relevant here because the question is about elemental abundances. Hmm, let me focus on the abundance data given.

The data provided is:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex for Star_2
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex for Star_1
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex for Star_2

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = 7 -12 = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5)

I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2's photospheres, so [Si/Star_1]/[Si/Star_2]?

Wait, no, the ratio is [Si_1/Si_2] or [Si_1]/[Si_2] in their respective photospheres. Or maybe the question is the ratio of silicon in each star relative to the Sun, but wait, the question says "the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2." So it's [Si_1 / Si_2].

Wait, actually, the question says, "the ratio of silicon atoms in the
