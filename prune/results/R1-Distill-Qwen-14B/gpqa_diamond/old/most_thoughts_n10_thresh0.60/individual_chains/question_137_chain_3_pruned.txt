Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember that cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons are types of particle accelerators. The key here is to figure out how many revolutions the proton makes before it reaches a certain kinetic energy. 

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, T≈0. Then it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0], and the given data is Φ0 = π/4, U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on how synchrocyclotrons work. I think they use a magnetic field and an electric field that changes with time to accelerate the particles. Oh right, the particles move in a magnetic field, and each time they complete a half-revolution, they get a kick from the electric field. So the number of revolutions would be related to how many times they're accelerated.

The kinetic energy gained by the proton must be related to the voltage. Since the voltage is alternating, the protons are accelerated each time the electric field is in the right direction. So each time the voltage goes through a cycle, the proton gets a certain amount of energy added.

Let me think about energy gain. The energy per revolution comes from the voltage. For each half-cycle (because the voltage changes direction), the proton is accelerated once. Oh wait, no, in a cyclotron, the particles are accelerated each time they pass through the electric field region, which happens once per revolution. Wait, no, in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates direction as the particles go around, so each time they pass through the gap, they get a kick. So the acceleration occurs every half-period of the alternating voltage. Hmm, I might have to get this straight.

Wait, the cyclotron's electric field alternates with frequency ν, and the particles make revolutions with some frequency. For a cyclotron, the frequency of revolution is determined by the magnetic field and the mass of the particle. But in a synchrocyclotron, they use a different approach because the velocity isn't non-relativistic anymore, I think.

Wait, but the problem mentions two accelerations. Oh, maybe each time the voltage completes a cycle, two accelerations happen? Or perhaps each cycle corresponds to one acceleration. Wait no
