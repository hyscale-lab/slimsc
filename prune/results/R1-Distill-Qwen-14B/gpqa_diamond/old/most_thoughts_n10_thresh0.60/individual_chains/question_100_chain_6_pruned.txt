Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because reaction mechanisms can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, the molecular formula for C3H6... I think that could be either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, wait, noâ€”wait, propene is C3H6, right? Because propene is CH2=CHCH3. Oh, but wait, cyclopropane is also C3H6. Oh, but wait, the first step is bromination in the presence of CCl4. That sounds like a typical addition reaction for alkenes, not cyclopropane. So A is probably propene. Because cyclopropane is more likely to undergo ring-opening reactions or other types of substitutions, I think.

So, Compound A (C3H6) is propene. It undergoes bromination in CCl4, which is a solvent. For propene, bromination in CCl4 is likely an addition reaction across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) reacts with Br2 in CCl4 to form 1,2-dibromopropane? Or maybe 1,1-dibromopropane? Wait, no, when alkenes react with bromine in CCl4, they do an anti-addition, so it's a dibromide. The product would be 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3). So that's compound B.

Next, compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions, like dehydrohalogenation. So, in this case, since B is 1,2-dibromopropane, treating it with alcoholic KOH would cause two elimination steps, perhaps. Wait, no, maybe it's a dihalide. Wait, let's think: 1,2-dibromopropane has two Br atoms on adjacent carbons. When treated with KOH (alcohol), it should undergo elimination. Each Br can be removed, and since they're on adjacent carbons, the elimination would form a double bond. So it would lose HBr twice, forming an alkene. Wait, but wait, when you have a dihalide, elimination can form an alkene. So, the product would be propene again? No
