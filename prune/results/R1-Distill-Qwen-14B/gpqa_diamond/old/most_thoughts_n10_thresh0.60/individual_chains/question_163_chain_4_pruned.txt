Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that when a hydroxide reacts with an acid, they typically neutralize each other. So I think this is a neutralization reaction.

The problem says we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3, and we need to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution using a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. We need to find the minimum volume of the acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I should probably figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 would help here. Iron has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me check my calculation: 0.1 / 106.85 is approximately 9.36e-4. Yeah, that's correct.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, right? So when it reacts with a strong acid like HCl, which is monobasic, the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but the stoichiometry might be important here. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of H+.

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M HCl. The molarity is moles per liter. So, the volume V needed is moles / concentration.

Volume V = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me look again.

The options are:
A) 32.14 cm³
B) 30.09 cm³
C) 28.05 cm³
D) 20.40 cm³

So 28.08 is close to option C, which is 28.05. So the minimum volume of acid is approximately 28.05 cm³. That would be the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part is finding the pH of the resulting solution. After the reaction, we'll have a solution of Fe^3+ ions in water. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid, meaning it can hydrolyze in water to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

The reaction would be: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

To find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of H+ ions from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

First, let's find the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³, and the moles of Fe^3+ produced are equal to the moles of Fe(OH)3 dissolved, which is 0.000936 mol.

Concentration of Fe^3+ = moles / volume (in liters) = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me think again. No, the total volume would be 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L. So yes, 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Now, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ depends on its concentration and its hydrolysis constant. But wait, I don't remember the exact K for Fe^3+. Maybe I can look for typical Ka values. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the hydrolysis constant from the given data.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the hydrolysis is significant and use the formula for a weak acid. Let me think.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + H2O ↔ Fe(OH)^2+ + H+. Wait, no, more accurately, the hydrolysis produces H3O+ because it's a protonation. So Fe^3+ acting as an acid, donating a proton to water.

The hydrolysis equation is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to think that each Fe^3+ can donate three protons, but that's complicated. Alternatively, maybe the hydrolysis can be considered in steps, but perhaps it's easier to look for the hydrolysis constant, K_h, for Fe^3+.

I recall that the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+ is quite large, making it a strong enough acid to produce a low pH.
