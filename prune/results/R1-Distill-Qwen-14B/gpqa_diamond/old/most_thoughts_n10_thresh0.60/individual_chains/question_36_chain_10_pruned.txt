Alright, so I've got this question about absorption lines in the Milky Way. Hmm, I remember that absorption lines are used to determine the composition and properties of the interstellar medium. Let me think about what each part of the question means.

The question says the structures are at about 2.1 gigaparsecs away. Wait, that's pretty far. But wait, wait, the absorption line energy is 3.9 micro electron volts. Micro is 1e-6, so 3.9e-6 eV. That's a really small amount of energy. 

I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by E = hc/λ. Lower energy means longer wavelength. In the electromagnetic spectrum, lower energy corresponds to infrared or radio waves. Oh wait, but absorption lines are usually in the visible or UV, but maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach: different components of the interstellar medium emit or absorb certain wavelengths. The interstellar medium has different phases: cold and warm, atomic and molecular. 

Cold molecular clouds, I think, are related to things like CO (carbon monoxide) lines, which are in the mm range. Those are pretty low energy, right? If the energy is 3.9e-6 eV, that's 3.9 micro eV. Wait, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 joules, but maybe I should think in terms of photon energy and wavelengths.

Let's calculate the wavelength. E = hc/λ. Let's see, h is Planck's constant ~4.135667696e-15 eV·s, c is speed of light ~3e8 m/s. But perhaps using E in eV and wavelength in Angstroms or something.

Wait, E in eV is 3.9e-6 eV. So E = hc/lambda => lambda = hc/E. Let's compute hc in eV·Angstrom. Hmm, I remember that hc is approximately 12400 eV·Angstrom. So lambda = (12400 eV·Å) / (3.9e-6 eV) )= 12400 / 3.9e-6 = 12400 / 0.0000039 ≈ 3.18e9 Angstroms. Wait
