Okay, so I'm looking at this astronomy problem, and I need to figure out the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the spotted star. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere with a 20% filling factor. Filling factor means the fraction of the hemisphere's surface covered by spots. Wait, so if one hemisphere is covered, and the filling factor is 20%, that means 20% of that hemisphere is spots. So, the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2πR²) / 2? Wait, no. Wait, the hemisphere's area is 2πR², right? Because a sphere's surface area is 4πR², so a hemisphere is half that. So, the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Actually, wait, the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface? Or just the hemisphere? Hmm, the question says one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. Oh, maybe it's 20% of that hemisphere. So, spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area.

The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. So, spots are at 5000K. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing changes in brightness. The question states that this setup can resemble an exoplanet transit, so we're supposed to compare the brightness dip from the planet blocking the starlight to the dip from the spots.

Wait, but in this case, the star has spots that are cooler. So when the spots are facing us, the star's brightness would decrease because the spots are darker. But when the star isn't spotted (the other hemisphere is spot-free, same as the star's Teff), the brightness would be higher. So the variation in brightness would be a periodic dip as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But the question is asking, if instead of spots, there's an exoplanet transiting, what size exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So we're to find R_planet / R_star such that the dip
