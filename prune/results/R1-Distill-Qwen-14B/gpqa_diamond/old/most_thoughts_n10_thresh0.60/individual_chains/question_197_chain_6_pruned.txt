Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the spectroscopy stuff yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

So the question is about Compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. The task is to identify the final product from the given options. The options are all different organic compounds, so I'll need to figure out what Compound X is first before determining the reaction product.

Let's look at the given data. The IR spectrum has strong peaks at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But the presence of a peak around 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group (like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid). The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions could be aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, maybe it's an aromatic compound with a carbonyl group and some substituents.

Now the 1H NMR data:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which usually points to an -OH proton, perhaps from a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH is usually broad and around 10-12 ppm. But I remember that sometimes other protons can show up around there, but for now, let's tentatively say it's a carboxylic acid proton.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes a conjugated carbonyl or an aldehyde proton can be around 9-10 ppm, but the broadness suggests it's more likely an -OH. So perhaps the compound has a carboxylic acid group.

Looking at the other peaks:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): Aromatic protons. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. So maybe it's a para-substituted benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. Like in a para-substituted benzene, each H has two equivalent neighbors, but if it's a substituent in the para position, maybe it's part of a substituent like a substituent on the ring, such as a group attached to a benzene ring, leading to a doublet.

Wait, in para-substituted benzene rings, the protons are often doublets when there's another substituent that causes coupling. Wait, maybe the ring isn't para, but perhaps the substituent has adjacent Hs. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's think further.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, possibly the other set of aromatic protons. So if the benzene ring is para-substituted, say with two substituents, the protons on either side could be split into two doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a meta substitution, but that might give more complex splitting. Hmm.

Wait, no, wait. Another possibility: the two doublets could be from a para-substituted benzene ring where each substituent has its own set of Hs. For example, if there are two substituents on the benzene ring, each causing the adjacent Hs to couple. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think about the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So that would have a benzoic acid group (so a COOH attached to the benzene ring at position 4), and a sec-butyl group attached at position 4 as well? Wait, no, wait. Wait, benzene is symmetric, so position 4 is the same as position 1 in a way, but perhaps the substituents are in the para positions. Hmm, maybe not. But perhaps the benzene has two substituents, one being the COOH and the other being a sec-butyl group. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the para position relative to each other.

But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Let me go back.

The NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, 3H. That suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group, because a triplet at the end of the chain is the CH3 group attached to a CH2 that's next to another CH2. So for example, in a (CH2)nCH3 group, the last CH3 is a triplet if n=2. So like a propyl chain, but perhaps part of a larger structure.

Looking at the other peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe a CH adjacent to some substituents. Could be part of a CH group connected to something else, maybe a branching point.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Another multiplet, perhaps a CH2 group next to a branching point or near a carbonyl group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet with 3H, which is characteristic of a CH3 group attached to a CH
