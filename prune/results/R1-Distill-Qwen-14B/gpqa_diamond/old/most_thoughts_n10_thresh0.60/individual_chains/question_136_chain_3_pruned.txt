Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². The magnitude is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I'm supposed to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin. And then choose the correct answer from the options given.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that there's a relationship between the divergence of a vector field and its flux through a surface. Oh right, Gauss's Law! Or wait, maybe it's more general than that. Gauss's Law relates the divergence to the flux through a closed surface, which makes me think about the integral of the divergence over the volume.

Wait, the divergence theorem states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field through the surface enclosing that volume. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA, where n is the outward normal vector to the surface.

In this case, the surface is a sphere of radius R. And the vector field f has only a radial component, so when we take the flux through the sphere, it simplifies because the field is radial everywhere.

So first, let's think about the divergence of f. Maybe I should compute ∇·f in spherical coordinates since the field is given in spherical coordinates.

The vector field f has only a radial component, let's denote it as f_r. So in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a vector field with components (f_r, 0, 0) is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). Because the other terms (like the angular components) are zero here.

So f(r) is 1/r², so f_r = 1/r². Let's plug this into the divergence formula.

∇·f = (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Simplify the term inside the derivative first. r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇·f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin. Wait, but wait a minute, if f(r) is 1/r², that suggests that the field is like the electric field of a dipole or something, but dipole fields have different behavior. Or is this similar to the electric field of a point charge?

Wait, no. The electric field of a point charge is proportional to 1/r², but the divergence of that is a delta function at the origin. Because when r is not zero, the divergence is zero, but the flux isn't zero. Oh wait, right! For a point charge, the divergence would be zero everywhere except at r=0, but the flux through a surface enclosing the origin is non-zero. So in the case of a point charge, the divergence would involve Dirac delta functions, but when the field is 1/r², is that similar?

Wait, the divergence we just calculated is zero except at r=0. But when you integrate the divergence over the volume, because the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin
