Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Hmm, let's think through each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is incorrect, so all options are correct except one. Let's start with Option A.

Option A says that SARS-CoV-2's nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN work as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The ExoN domain binds to nsp10, making an active exonuclease. Wait, I remember that nsp10 and nsp14 form a complex. Oh right, nsp14 has an ExoN domain, and it pairs with nsp10 to form an active exonuclease. They function as a heterodimer, so A sounds correct. But wait, the statement says it prevents breakdown of dsRNA. Wait, ExoN is an exonuclease, so wouldn't it break down RNA? Wait, or is it the other way around. Hmm, perhaps nsp14/ExoN is involved in RNA editing or repair. Wait, I think the ExoN domain is an endonuclease or exonuclease. Oh wait, the nsp14 is the exonuclease, and nsp10 is a cofactor. So they form a complex that can repair mismatches, maybe in the viral RNA. So A's statement seems correct.

Option B: ORF3a triggers caspase-8
