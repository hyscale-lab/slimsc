Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The first part of the question says cyclohexanone is treated with LDA at low temperature, followed by benzaldehyde. Then the mixture is acidified to form product 1. I remember that LDA is a strong base, usually used to deprotonate compounds. Cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens, which are the hydrogens on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl group. LDA would deprotonate the alpha position, right? So it would form an enolate.

Wait, what's the structure of cyclohexanone? It's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. So the alpha carbons are the ones next to the carbonyl. Deprotonating would form an enolate, which is a strong base. Then, benzaldehyde is added. Benzaldehyde has a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group, so it's an aldehyde.

I think this is an aldol addition or maybe a conjugate addition. Oh wait, the enolate from cyclohexanone would attack the carbonyl of benzaldehyde. Since LDA is such a strong base, maybe it's a more controlled reaction. So the enolate (the cyclohexanone part) would attack the benzaldehyde. That would form a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, the enolate would have a negative charge on the alpha carbon. Benzaldehyde has
