Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Also, their radial velocities are given: Star_1 is stationary (0 km/s) and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. 

They assume the stars are black bodies and compute the luminosity. The question is asking by what factor Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star depends on its radius and temperature. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. So I think the key here is to find the temperatures of both stars and then compute their luminosities.

Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right! The peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K). So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature.

Wait, but wait. But wait a second. Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. Radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! When a star moves towards us, the light is blueshifted; when it moves away, it's redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be different from the rest wavelength.

But the problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So I think that refers to the observed wavelength. So I need to correct for the Doppler shift when calculating the actual temperature of Star_2.

Wait, let me clarify. The star emits at a certain wavelength, but due to its motion, the observed wavelength is shifted. The question says that the observed wavelengths
