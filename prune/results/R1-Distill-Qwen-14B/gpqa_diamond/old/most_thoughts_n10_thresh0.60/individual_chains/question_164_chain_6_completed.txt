Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The question is about two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with certain periods. System_1's period is 2 years, and system_2's is 1 year. The radial velocity (RV) observations show that in system_1, the stars have velocity amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The problem asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, considering the mass of each system as the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the velocity amplitude is related to the mass ratio. Also, Kepler's laws come into play here, especially since we're dealing with orbital periods and masses.

Wait, so Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit, divided by the sum of the masses. But wait, in binary systems, each star orbits the common center of mass. The formula I think is (P^2 * G) / (4π²) = (a₁ + a₂)^3 / (M₁ + M₂), where a₁ and a₂ are the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits, and M₁, M₂ their masses.

But how do radial velocities tie into this? Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift as the stars move towards and away from us. The velocity amplitude (K) is the maximum speed of each star in the binary system. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's closer to the center of mass. So the mass of a star is inversely proportional to its velocity amplitude. That is, M₁/M₂ = (K₂)/(K₁), where K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity.

Wait, let me think about that. If star A is more massive, it's moving slower because it's orbiting a smaller circle. So if system_1 has stars with velocities 10 and 5, the mass ratio M1/M2 should be (5/10) = 0.5. Because the more massive star (which has the smaller velocity) would be M1, and the smaller mass would be M2. So M1 is half of M2 in system_1.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocity amplitudes are 15 and 10. So their mass ratio is 10/15 = 0.666..., meaning M1 is two-thirds of M2 in system_2. Or wait, maybe the other way around. Let me get this right.

Wait, the mass ratio q is M2 / M1. Oh wait no, the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So, the formula is M1 / M2 = K2 / K1. So for system_1, K1 is 10 and K2 is 5. So M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 is half the mass of M2 in system_1. Wait that can't be right because if M1 is bigger, its velocity would be smaller. No, wait: if M1 is more massive, then it's moving slower. So the velocity amplitude is smaller.

So, if in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5, which star is more massive? The one with 5 km/s, because it's moving slower. So M1 (the more massive one) has K1 =5 and M2 has K2=10. So M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1) =10/5=2. So M1 is twice as massive as M2 in system_1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 2M2 + M2 = 3M2. So system_1's mass is 3M2.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me think again. The mass function says that (M2 sin i) / (M1 + M2)^2 = (K1^3 P) / (2π G), but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, for a binary system, the two stars' velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if the more massive star has a lower velocity, the mass ratio is M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So in system_1: K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So M1/M2 =5/10=0.5. So M1 is half of M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 =1.5 M2.

In system_2, K1 is 15, K2 is 10. So M1/M2 =10/15= 2/3≈0.6667. So M1 is 0.6667 * M2. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = (2/3)M2 + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but wait: let's get the stars right. Let's call them Star A and Star B in each system. For system_1, Star A's velocity is 10 km/s, Star B's is 5. So Star B is more massive than Star A because it's moving slower. So M_B > M_A. So M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A =5/10=0.5. So M_A =0.5 M_B. So M_total for system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B =1.5 M_B.

Similarly, for system_2, Star A has 15, Star B has 10. So M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A =10/15=2/3. So M_A = (2/3) M_B. So their total mass is (2/3 M_B) + M_B = (5/3) M_B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because the way I'm assigning the velocities to each star is important. But perhaps each binary system's total mass can be determined using the velocity semi-amplitudes and the period.

Wait, another approach: Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the total separation between the two stars. But a is the sum of the semi-major axes of the two stars' orbits around the center of mass: a = a1 + a2.

Another formula I recall is that the velocity amplitude K is related to the mass of the companion. Specifically, K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, from the radial velocity perspective, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ) = (K1^3 P) / (2π G)

But without knowing the inclination angle i (which is usually around 90 degrees for an eclipsing binary, so sin i ≈1), perhaps we can assume that i is the same for both systems, so it cancels out when taking the ratio. But wait, the problem states that the eclipses are observed, so the inclination is near 90 degrees, so sin i is 1.

But maybe even without knowing i, since both systems are eclipsing, perhaps we can assume that the inclination is the same for both, or at least that sin i is 1 in both cases, so it's irrelevant.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider that the mass ratio q = M2/M1. So for each system, the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1 = q. Because the more massive star moves slower, so lower K.

So for system_1, K1 =10, K2=5. So the mass ratio q = K1/K2 =10/5=2. So M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1=3 M1.

For system_2, K1=15, K2=10. So q =15/10=1.5. So M2=1.5 M1. Total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 +1.5 M1=2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again: For each binary system, the velocities are inversely proportional to the masses. So, K1 (for star 1) is proportional to M2, and K2 is proportional to M1. So K1/K2 = M2/M1 = q.

So in system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So q=10/5=2. So M2 =2 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1=3 M1.

In system_2, K1=15 and K2=10. So q=15/10=1.5. Thus, M2=1.5 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2= M1 +1.5 M1=2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait. Let's clarify: for each system, the masses are M1 and M2, and the velocity amplitudes are K1 and K2. So K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 the velocity of star 2.

Since M1 * a1 = M2 * a2 (because they orbit the same center of mass), the ratio a1/a2 = M2/M1 = K2/K1. So, a1 = (M2/M1) a2.

And because the orbital period is the same for both stars, the orbital velocities are v = 2π a / P. So v1 = 2π a1 / P, v2=2π a2 / P.

So, v1 = (M2/M1) v2.

But v1 is K1 and v2 is K2. So K1 = (M2/M1) K2. So M2/M1 = K1/K2.

So for system_1, K1=10, K2=5 → M2/M1=10/5=2 → M2=2 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K1=15, K2=10 → M2/M1=15/10=1.5 → M2=1.5 M1.

So in system_1, M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. So M1 = (M_total)/3.

In system_2, M_total = M1 + M2 = M1 + 1.5 M1 = 2.5 M1.

But wait, wait a second: each system's M1 and M2 are their own. So system_1 has its own M1 and M2, and system_2 has its own M1' and M2'. So we can't directly compare M1 of system_1 to M1' of system_2. Instead, perhaps we should express each system's total mass in terms of their own parameters and then find the ratio.

Wait, but the problem is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So we need to compute (M_total_1)/(M_total_2).

But how? Because each system's total mass depends on their velocity amplitudes and their periods.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the total mass of a binary system can be determined using the formula derived from Kepler's third law and the radial velocities.

The formula for the total mass (M) is given by:

M = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G ) )^(1/1) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should look up the formula. Wait, I think the formula for the total mass (M) is:

M = ( (K1^3 * P ) / (2 π G) )^(1/1) * (1 + q)^2 ) / q,

where q is the mass ratio, q = M2/M1.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.

Alternatively, let me think about the mass function. The mass function is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

And from radial velocities, f(M) can be calculated using:

f(M) = (K1^3 P ) / (2 π G )

But since both systems are eclipsing, i is about 90 degrees, so sin i = 1. So f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P )/(2 π G )

But I'm not sure about the exact formula, but perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses of the two systems.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe another approach: using the fact that for each binary system, the product of the velocity amplitude and the mass of the companion gives a term related to the total mass.

Alternatively, the total mass M can be expressed in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Another formula I found online once is:

M = ( (4 π²) / (G) )^(1/3) * (a1 + a2) / P^(2/3)

But a1 + a2 is the separation, which is related to the velocities and the period.

Wait, but perhaps using the relation between velocity and the mass, and the period, we can find the total mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (G) ?

Wait, no, let me think about the formula for M in terms of velocities. The total mass can be found using the formula:

M = ( ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2 π G) )^(3/2) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the mass function is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) = (K1^3 P ) / (2 π G )

But without knowing the inclination, how can I proceed? Since both are eclipsing binaries, perhaps we can assume sin i =1 for both, so f(M) is the same as (M2^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 )

But I'm not sure how to relate this to the total mass. Perhaps, since I'm to find the ratio of the total masses, I can express each system's total mass in terms of their velocity amplitudes and periods.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the ratio of the total masses can be found using the ratio of their velocity amplitudes and periods.

Wait, I think the formula for the mass function can be used for this. Let me write it down.

The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K^3) * P ) / (2 π G )

where K is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity.

But wait, I think K is the semi-amplitude of one of the stars. But in the formula, perhaps it's the companion's velocity, not the star's own. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should look for a more precise formula.

Alternatively, the formula for the mass function when you have both stars' velocities is perhaps more involved. Oh wait, perhaps I can write the mass function for each star.

Wait, for each star in the binary system, the mass function is the same. So for star 1, f(M) = (K1^3 P )/(2 π G ), and for star 2, f(M) = (K2^3 P )/(2 π G ). But these two expressions are equal, because the same mass function applies to both.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the mass function depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that for each star, the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitudes of each star. So,

f(M) = ( (K1 P ) / (2 π G ) )^(1/3) * (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: for each system, the mass function gives a lower limit on the mass of the companion. But perhaps I can proceed by considering that for each system, the sum of the masses can be determined if I can find the ratio of the masses and the period.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass ratio for each system and then use the period to find the total mass.

In system_1, the velocity amplitudes are 10 and 5. So the mass ratio q = M2/M1 = K1/K2 =10/5=2.

So M2 = 2 M1 → M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1=3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2, K1=15, K2=10 → q=15/10=1.5 → M2=1.5 M1.

So M_total_2 = M1 + M2 = M1 +1.5 M1=2.5 M1.

Wait, but wait: the M1 here refers to each system. So system_1's M1 is its own M1, and system_2's M1 is its own. So it's not the same M1. So perhaps I should express both systems' total masses in terms of their respective M1.

But that's not directly helpful. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, considering the formula that relates the period, the velocity amplitudes, and the masses.

The formula for the orbit is:

(M1 + M2) = ( (4 π²) / (G) )^(1/3) * (a1 + a2) / P^(2/3)

But a1 + a2 is the separation between the two stars, which can be found using the velocities and the period.

Since the orbital speed is v = 2π a / P, so a = v * P / (2π).

So a1 = K1 * P/(2π), a2= K2 * P/(2π).

So a1 + a2 = (K1 + K2) * P/(2 π).

Substituting back into the mass formula:

M_total = (4 π² / G )^(1/3) * ( (K1 + K2) P/(2 π) ) / P^(2/3)

Simplify this:

M_total = (4 π² / G )^(1/3) * ( (K1 + K2) P )/(2 π) ) * P^(-2/3)

Which becomes:

M_total = (4 π² / G )^(1/3) * (K1 + K2) P^(1/3) )/(2 π )

Simplify the exponents:

P^(1/3) comes from the (K1+K2)*P term. Let me compute this step by step.

Wait, let's compute the exponents correctly:

The term (K1 + K2) * P / (2 π) is multiplied by P^(-2/3) in the denominator.

So the entire expression becomes:

(4 π²/G )^(1/3) * (K1 + K2) P^{1} / (2 π) * P^{-2/3} )

Which is (4 π²/G )^(1/3) * (K1 + K2) P^{1 - 2/3} / (2 π )

1 - 2/3 is 1/3, so:

= (4 π²/G )^(1/3) * (K1 + K2) P^{1/3} / (2 π )

Now, let's factor this expression. Let's group the constants and the terms with P and (K1 + K2).

Let me write this as:

M_total = [ (4 π²)^(1/3) ) / ( (G)^{1/3} * 2 π ) ] * (K1 + K2) * P^{1/3}

Simplify the constants:

(4 π²)^(1/3) = 4^{1/3} π^{2/3}

Denominator: 2 π = 2 π^{1}

So the entire constant factor is:

4^{1/3} π^{2/3} / ( G^{1/3} * 2 π )

Which can be written as:

(4^{1/3} )/(2) ) * ( π^{2/3} ) / ( π ) ) * (1/ G^{1/3} )

Simplify each part:

4^{1/3} /2 = (2^2)^{1/3} / 2 = 2^{2/3} / 2 = 2^{2/3 -1} = 2^{-1/3}.

π^{2/3}/π = π^{(2/3 -1)} = π^{-1/3}.

So the constant factor becomes:

2^{-1/3} * π^{-1/3} / G^{1/3} )

Which is ( 2 π G )^{-1/3}.

So putting it all together:

M_total = (2 π G )^{-1/3} * (K1 + K2) P^{1/3}.

So,

M_total = ( (K1 + K2) * P )^{1/3} / (2 π G )^{1/3} )

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Alternatively, perhaps the expression can be written as:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G ) )^(1/3)

Wait, because if I cube M_total, I get:

M_total^3 = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / (2 π G )

So,

M_total = [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G) ]^(1/3)

So, M_total is proportional to ( (K1 + K2) * P )^{1/3 }.

Wait, but wait, this suggests that the total mass is proportional to (P (K1 + K2)^3 )^{1/3}.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2) * P^{1/3}.

But regardless, perhaps the key point is that for each system, M_total is proportional to (K1 + K2) * P^{1/3}.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

If M_total is proportional to ( (K1 + K2) * P )^{1/3 }, then the ratio of the total masses would be:

(M_total_1 / M_total_2) = [ ( (K1_1 + K2_1) P_1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2) P_2 ) ]^{1/3 }

Because the constants (like 2 pi G) cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, let's compute this.

For system_1:

K1 + K2 =10 +5 =15 km/s.

P_1=2 years.

For system_2:

K1 + K2=15 +10=25 km/s.

P_2=1 year.

So,

(M_total_1 / M_total_2) = [ (15 * 2 ) / (25 * 1) ) ]^{1/3} = [ (30)/(25) ) ]^{1/3} = (6/5 )^{1/3} ≈ (1.2 )^{0.333...}.

Approximately, cube root of 1.2 is about 1.06, because 1.06^3 = approx 1.191, which is close to 1.2.

Wait, 1.06^3 = 1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236; 1.1236 *1.06 ≈1.191. So cube root of 1.2 is about 1.06, so M_total_1 is about 1.06 times M_total_2. So system_1 is about 6% more massive than system_2.

But looking at the options:

Options are A) 0.4, B)0.6, C)1.2, D)0.7.

Wait, but wait, my calculation gives M_total_1 ≈ 1.06 M_total_2. So system_1 is more massive by a factor of about 1.06, which is close to 1. So none of the options are near that, except perhaps option C is 1.2, which is higher than my calculation.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the mass function for each star, and then find the total mass from that.

Wait, another approach: For each system, the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (2 π G ), where K is the semi-amplitude of one component.

But the mass function relates to the actual mass as f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i)/((M1+M2)^2).

Assuming i=90 degrees, sin i=1, so f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But without knowing the individual masses, perhaps it's hard to find the total mass. However, perhaps for each system, the total mass can be found in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Wait, another formula I found: The total mass of the binary system is:

M = ( (K1 + K2) )^3 * P / (2 π G ) )^{1/3}

Wait, perhaps that's where I was getting earlier.

So,

M = [ (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2 π G) ) ]^{1/3}

So, M is proportional to ( (K1 + K2) * P )^{1/3 }.

So, for system_1:

K1 + K2 =15 km/s, P=2 years.

So,

M1 = [ (15)^3 * 2 ]^{1/3 } * [ 1/(2 π G) )^{1/3 } ]

For system_2:

K1 + K2=25 km/s, P=1 year.

M2= [ (25)^3 * 1 ]^{1/3 } * [ 1/(2 π G) )^{1/3 } ]

So the ratio M1/M2 is [ (15^3 *2)/(25^3 *1) ]^{1/3 }

= [ ( (15^3 *2 ) ) / (25^3 ) ) ]^{1/3 }

Simplify numerator and denominator:

15^3 = 3375, 25^3=15625.

So,

= [ (3375 *2 ) / 15625 ) ]^{1/3 } 

= [ (6750) / 15625 ) ]^{1/3 }

6750 /15625 = 6750 ÷ 15625 = let's compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25=270; 15625/25=625.

So 270/625 = 0.432.

So,

M1/M2 = (0.432 )^{1/3 }.

What's the cube root of 0.432?

Approximately, since 0.7^3 is 0.343, 0.73^3 ≈ 0.73 * 0.73 = 0.5329; 0.5329 *0.73≈ 0.389.

Wait, 0.73^3 is about 0.389, which is less than 0.432.

0.75^3=0.421875.

Wait, 0.75^3= (3/4)^3=27/64≈0.421875.

0.432 is a bit higher. So 0.432 is about 0.421875 +0.010125.

So the cube root of 0.432 would be approximately 0.75 + a small delta.

Let me compute 0.75^3=0.421875.

0.753 → 0.421875.

0.76^3 = ?

0.76 *0.76=0.5776; 0.5776 *0.76 ≈ 0.438976.

That's about 0.439, which is higher than 0.432.

So, 0.76^3= ≈0.439.

We have 0.432 between 0.75^3 and 0.76^3.

Compute at what x between 0.75 and 0.76, x^3=0.432.

Let me compute 0.755^3:

0.755 * 0.755 = ?

0.75^2=0.5625, 0.005^2=0.000025, and 2 *0.75*0.005=0.0075.

So (0.75 +0.005)^2 =0.75^2 + 2*0.75*0.005 +0.005^2 = 0.5625 +0.0075 +0.000025=0.570025.

Now, 0.755 * 0.755 *0.755 = (0.570025) * 0.755.

Compute 0.57 * 0.755 ≈

0.5 *0.755=0.3775,

0.07 *0.755=0.05285.

Total ≈ 0.3775 +0.05285=0.43035.

So 0.755^3 ≈0.43035, which is very close to 0.432.

So cube root of 0.432 is approximately 0.755.

So, M1/M2 ≈0.755.

Which is about 0.76, which would be approximately option D) ~0.7.

But wait, the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if M1 is approximately 0.755 times M2, that would imply that system_1 is about 0.755 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.755, which would mean that system_2 is about 1.324 times more massive than system_1.

But wait, the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if M1 is 0.755 M2, then system_1 is less massive than system_2, so the factor is less than 1. The options include 0.7 as option D, which is about 0.755.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation. Because earlier when I thought that the total masses were 3 M1 and 2.5 M1, I thought system_1 was more massive, but perhaps that was incorrect because I was mixing the M1's.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it by considering the mass function and the fact that each system's total mass can be found from their K and P.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier proportional reasoning. Let me re-examine.

I think the correct approach is that the total mass is proportional to ( (K1 + K2) * P )^(1/3).

So,

M1 ∝ (15 * 2 )^(1/3 ) = (30 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 3.072.

M2 ∝ (25 * 1 )^(1/3 ) = (25 )^(1/3 ) ≈ 2.924.

So M1 is about 3.072 / 2.924 ≈1.05 times M2.

So system_1 is about 5% more massive than system_2.

But none of the options are close to 1.05. The closest option is C)1.2.

Hmm, but earlier when I used the mass function approach, I arrived at M1 being about 0.75 times M2. But which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the total mass. Let me try to derive it correctly.

The formula I should use is:

The more precise formula for the total mass of a binary system is:

M = ( ( (K1 + K2) )^3 * P ) / (2 π G ) )^(1/3)

Because:

- K1 and K2 are the velocity amplitudes (km/s)
- P is the orbital period (in seconds)
- G is the gravitational constant (m^3 kg^-1 s^-2)
- M is in kilograms.

But wait, units are a bit of a problem here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is dimensionally correct as is.

So, for each system, M_total = [ (K1 + K2 )^3 * P ]^(1/3) / ( (2 π G )^(1/3) )

But since 2 π G is a constant, when taking the ratio of the two systems' masses, it would cancel out.

So,

M1 / M2 = [ ( (K1_1 + K2_1 )^3 * P_1 ) / ( (K1_2 + K2_2 )^3 * P_2 ) ) ]^{1/3 }

So,

M1/M2 = [ ( (15)^3 * 2 ) / ( (25)^3 * 1 ) ) ]^{1/3 }

Compute numerator: 15^3=3375, 3375 *2=6750.

Denominator: 25^3=15625, 15625 *1=15625.

So,

M1/M2 = (6750 / 15625 )^{1/3 }

Which is (0.432 )^{1/3 }.

As before, approximately 0.755.

So M1 is about 0.755 times M2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of approximately 0.755.

So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is about 0.755, which is approximately 0.76, so the closest option is D) ~0.7.

Wait, but the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if M1 is 0.755 M2, then system_1 is 0.755 times as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.755, meaning system_2 is more massive by a factor of about 1.325.

But the question is phrased as "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So if system_1 is less massive, the factor is less than 1. So the correct answer would be approximately 0.75, which is option D.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the velocities, I might have mixed up which system is more massive. Let me think again.

Wait, system_1's total mass is about 0.755 times that of system_2. So system_1 is about 0.755 as massive as system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of about 0.755. So system_2 is about 1.325 times more massive than system_1.

But the question is asking "by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?" So the factor is 0.755, meaning system_1 is 0.755 times as massive as system_2. So the factor is 0.755, which is approximately 0.76, so the answer would be D) ~0.7.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.7.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because earlier when I considered the mass ratios, I thought system_1's total mass was higher. But perhaps I made a mistake in that approach because I didn't account for the period correctly.

So, to sum up, the correct calculation seems to lead to system_1 being about 0.755 times as massive as system_2, so the factor is approximately 0.76, which aligns with option D) ~0.7.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data:

1. **Key Observations**:
   - System_1 has velocity amplitudes \( K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s} \), with an orbital period \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \).
   - System_2 has velocity amplitudes \( K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s} \), with an orbital period \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \).

2. **Total Mass Proportionality**:
   The total mass of a binary system is proportional to:
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} \propto \left( (K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P \right)^{1/3}
   \]
   where \( K_1 + K_2 \) is the sum of the velocity amplitudes, and \( P \) is the orbital period.

3. **System_1**:
   - \( K_1 + K_2 = 10 + 5 = 15 \, \text{km/s} \),
   - \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \),
   - \( M_{\text{total,1}} \propto \left( 15^3 \cdot 2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 3375 \cdot 2 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 6750 \right)^{1/3} \).

4. **System_2**:
   - \( K_1 + K_2 = 15 + 10 = 25 \, \text{km/s} \),
   - \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \),
   - \( M_{\text{total,2}} \propto \left( 25^3 \cdot 1 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 15625 \cdot 1 \right)^{1/3} = \left( 15625 \right)^{1/3} \).

5. **Mass Ratio**:
   The ratio of the total masses is:
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \left( \frac{6750}{15625} \right)^{1/3}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{6750}{15625} = 0.432
   \]
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = (0.432)^{1/3} \approx 0.755
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   System_1 is approximately 0.755 times as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.7**.
