Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question says we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, and it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So the overall molecule is benzene with two substituents, and the total number of carbons is 8. Hmm, that means each substituent must contribute a certain number of carbons.

So benzene has 6 carbons, so the substituents add up to 2 more carbons. Wait, wait, but 6 (benzene) plus substituents should equal 8. So substituents contribute 2 carbons. Wait, but di-substituted can be in different positions. But wait, let's think about the substituents. Oh, wait, each substituent could be a group that's more than one carbon. Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here because depending on what the substituents are, their total carbons could add up differently.

Wait, wait, the molecule has 8 carbons in total, but the ring is 6, so substituents account for 2 carbons. So each substituent must be a methyl group? Because each substituent is one carbon, but two substituents would add up to two carbons. But that's not the only possibility. Alternatively, maybe one substituent
