Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to give amines, but wait, no, maybe that's not right. Oh wait, another reaction—maybe it's about the hydrolysis of an acid chloride or an ester? Or perhaps it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, wait, I think HI with red phosphorus is used for the hydrolysis of alkyl halides, but that might be part of something else. Alternatively, maybe it's about the conversion of a nitrile to an amine. Let me think—another possibility is the reduction of a nitrile to an amine when treated with H2O and HgSO4, but that's more of a hydrolysis reaction. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out what the initial compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data. Let's look at the IR first. The IR shows a strong peak around 3400-2500 cm⁻¹. That region usually corresponds to O-H or N-H stretches. But in this case, looking at the options, some of them have carboxylic acids, which have O-H stretches. The peak around 1720 cm⁻¹ is indicative of a carb
