Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I'm supposed to find the partition function Z. 

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-β E), right? So I need to figure out all possible configurations of the three spins and calculate the energy for each, then sum up exp(-β E) for each state.

But wait, there are three spins, each with two possible states. So total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I can list them all.

Let me think of each state as a triplet (S1, S2, S3). Each can be +1 or -1.

So all possible states are:

1. (+1, +1, +1)
2. (+1, +1, -1)
3. (+1, -1, +1)
4. (+1, -1, -1)
5. (-1, +1, +1)
6. (-1, +1, -1)
7. (-1, -1, +1)
8. (-1, -1, -1)

For each of these, I need to compute E. Then, calculate exp(-β E) for each, and sum them all.

But wait, maybe I can find a smarter way instead of computing each term. Let's see. Alternatively, maybe I can group the states by their energies.
