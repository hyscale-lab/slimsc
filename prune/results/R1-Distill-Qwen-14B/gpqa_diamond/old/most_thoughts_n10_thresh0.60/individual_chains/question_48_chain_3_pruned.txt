Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me go through each reaction carefully.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. So cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? It's a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The first reaction is treating it with bromine to form product 1. Hmm, what does bromine do to ketones? Oh wait, I remember that ketones can undergo a variety of reactions. Bromine might add to the carbonyl group. Wait, but ketones typically don't react with bromine in the same way alkenes do. Oh wait, maybe it's a different kind of addition. Or perhaps it's a bromination elsewhere.

Wait, another thought. Cyclohexanone has an alpha position. The alpha carbons are the ones adjacent to the carbonyl. Maybe the bromine is adding to the alpha position through some kind of enolate formation. Oh wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. If it's treated with bromine in some conditions, perhaps it's undergoing a halogenation via the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction? No, wait, that's for carboxylic acids. Maybe it's bromine adding to the carbonyl, but that's more like a bromohydrin formation, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, another possibility. When ketones are treated with bromine in the presence of a base, perhaps it's a conjugate
