Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A for a moving point charge. I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields, which are described by these potentials.

The setup is that the charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t), and we're observing at point r. The vector d is from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. So, d = r - s(tr), I think. Oh wait, but actually, the problem says d is from the field-generating point to r. So d would be r minus the position of the charge at time tr. Right.

At the generating instant tr, the charge's velocity is v. And since t > tr, the observation time is after the field was generated. So the fields are retarded, meaning we have to consider the position and velocity at an earlier time.

Wait, I'm trying to recall the expressions for the potentials. The scalar potential V is usually due to the charge, and the vector potential A is due to the current, which is the charge moving. For a point charge, the scalar potential is similar to the static case but with a correction because of the motion. 

The standard scalar potential from a moving charge is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r' - (v t_r)/c²)], but I'm not sure about the exact form. Wait, another
