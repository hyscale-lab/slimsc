Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about particle annihilation. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my relativistic mechanics, but I'll do my best.

The problem states: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The antiproton is moving slowly, and m_A c² is 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A.

Hmm, wait, the antiproton is moving slowly? Oh wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." Oh, maybe that's a typo or perhaps it's saying the initial particles are at low energy. Hmm, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, the process is proton and antiproton annihilating into two A+ and two A- particles. So, I think this is a conservation problem. Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, I should consider conservation of energy and momentum.

But wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. That suggests that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps it's non-relativistic, but the resulting particles might be moving at relativistic speeds. I'm not too sure.

Wait, the problem gives m_A c² as 300 MeV. That's the rest mass energy of particle A. The proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², right? Because protons are heavier than electrons but lighter than, say, a neutron. So m_p c²
