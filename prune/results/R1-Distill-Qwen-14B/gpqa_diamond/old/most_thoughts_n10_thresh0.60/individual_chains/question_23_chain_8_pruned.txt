Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question involves a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, after some time, TLC shows two new spots. I need to choose which products are possible from the options given.

Alright, let me start by visualizing the structure of the reactant. The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. The benzene ring has an ether group attached. The substituent on the oxygen is a butenyl group. Let's break that down. The butenyl is 4 carbons long. The double bond is at position 3, so the structure is CH₂=CH(CH₂)CH(CH2CH3) something? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Let me draw it correctly.

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So, the butenyl chain has four carbons. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, if numbered from the oxygen. Wait, wait, numbering from the oxygen. So the oxygen is attached to the first carbon. Then the structure is: O-CH₂-C(CH3)2-CH₂-CH₂? No, because the double bond is in position 3. Oh wait, but but-3-enyl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that's only possible if it's but-1-ene. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the chain is four carbons, with the oxygen attached to carbon 1. Then the structure is: O-CH₂-C(CH3)2-CH₂-CH2? No, wait. Let me think again. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So butenyl group with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but for butenyl groups, that's actually but-1-enyl? Or wait, but for butenyl substituents, the position is numbered from the end attached to the ring.

Wait, but but-3-enyl would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but that would require a longer chain. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the numbering. Let me get this right. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So, the substituent is attached to the oxygen at carbon 1. The chain is four carbons in total. So positions 1,2,3,4. The double bond is between 3 and 4. So the structure is CH₂-CH₂-C(CH3)2-CH2? No, wait.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH₂-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, I'm getting confused. Let me think of but-3-en-1-yl. The substituent is -O-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH2? No, wait, but that's butyl. But with a double bond at position 3. So the substituent is O-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH2, but with a double bond between positions 3 and 4. Wait, that would be O-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH2 can't have a double bond at 3 since it's the end. Maybe I got the numbering wrong.

Wait, perhaps but-3-en-1-yl is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-O- something? No, wait. Let me try to write the structure correctly. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the main chain is four carbons. The substituent has a double bond starting at position 3. So position 1 is attached to the
