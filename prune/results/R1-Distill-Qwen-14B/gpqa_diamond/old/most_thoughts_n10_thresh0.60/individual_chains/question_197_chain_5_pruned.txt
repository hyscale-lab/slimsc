Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the problem is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I need to find the final product from the options given. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra.

First, I should analyze the IR data. Let me list out the IR peaks: 3400â€“2500 cm-1, 1720 cm-1, 1610 cm-1, 1450 cm-1. So looking at each peak, the 3400-2500 region usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The broadness might suggest an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak, which is a good indicator of a carbonyl group. That would point to a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. 

But wait, aldehydes typically have a peak around 2800 (stretching for the aldehyde C-H) which isn't mentioned here. Esters have a carbonyl around 1740-1700. Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700 and a broad O-H around 2500-3000. The 3400-2500 is a broad region, so maybe that's an O-H stretch. So if there are both a carbonyl and O-H, that suggests a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe an ester with an O-H group elsewhere, but that's less common. Wait, but the presence of a broad O-H could also indicate an alcohol nearby. Hmm.

Wait, but let's check the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows peaks at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. Because aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid's -OH proton, but that's usually broader and appears around 10-12 ppm. Wait, the integration is 1H for both the 10.5 and the others. So if the 1
