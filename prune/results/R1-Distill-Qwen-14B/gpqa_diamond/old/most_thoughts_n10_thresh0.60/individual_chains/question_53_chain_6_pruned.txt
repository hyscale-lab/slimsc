Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step.

The question says that I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The FTIR shows ester groups, so that tells me there's an ester functional group present. Ester groups have carbonyl (C=O) and an ester oxygen, I think. So in the IR, the strong absorption around 1700-1750 cm^-1 probably indicates the ester carbonyl.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It has six signals. Breaking it down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in different positions. Di-substituted benzene rings can have either ortho, meta, or para substitution. The number of aromatic signals can help determine that. For example, if it's para substituted, the two aromatic Hs would each have equivalent environments, so maybe just two signals. Wait, no. Wait, if it's para, the two substituents are opposite each other. So each H on the ring would be in a symmetrical environment. So the aromatic protons would split into two sets: maybe two doublets, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, di-substituted could be two substituents adjacent (ortho) or para. For para, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons. So two signals for aromatic-H. That matches what the NMR shows.

2. Two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically adjacent to a double bond. So maybe there's an ester group attached to the aromatic ring, which might have a vinyl group. Wait, an ester is usually something like R-O-CO-O-R. No, wait, that's not right. Ester is R-O-CO-R. So maybe the structure has a substituent that's an ester, perhaps a vinyl ester. Or maybe it's part of a substituent like an allyl group.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl H signals. Let me think about the possible structures. If there's a vinyl group attached to the ester, like perhaps a substituent such as O-CO-O-R, but that's an ester. Or maybe it's a group like R-O-C
