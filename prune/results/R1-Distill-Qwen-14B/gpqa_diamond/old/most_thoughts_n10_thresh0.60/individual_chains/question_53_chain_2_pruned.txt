Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the structure of this di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. The question gives me some spectroscopic data, and I have to choose the correct chemical formula from the options provided. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. So, I'm thinking it's something like two substituents attached to a benzene ring. The FTIR shows absorption peaks for an ester group. Esters have a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ester linkage, typically O-C-O. So that's a key functional group here.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: there are six signals in total. Let's parse them. Two aromatic H signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substitution pattern might affect the number of unique aromatic protons. For example, in para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other, leading to two sets of aromatic Hs (each pair equivalent). But wait, if substitution is ortho or meta, the number of signals can change. Hmm, but the question says two signals for aromatic Hs. So maybe the substituents are in positions that result in two distinct sets of aromatic protons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene with two identical substituents, the ring would have symmetry leading to two equivalent Hs on one side and two on the other, giving two signals. But wait, di-substituted could also mean two different substituents. Oh, but the question says it's a di-substituted, but doesn't specify whether the substituents are the same or different. Hmm. So maybe the substituents are in positions that give two distinct aromatic H signals. Alternatively, maybe each substituent is causing a different environment for the Hs.

Then, two signals for vinyl-H. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically those attached to a double bond, like in an alkene or possibly in an aromatic ring if it's part of a substituent. Wait, in a benzene ring, the protons are aromatic, not vinyl. So the vinyl protons are probably part of a substituent group attached to the benzene.

Wait, the substituent could be an ester group, perhaps. Since the IR shows an ester, maybe the
