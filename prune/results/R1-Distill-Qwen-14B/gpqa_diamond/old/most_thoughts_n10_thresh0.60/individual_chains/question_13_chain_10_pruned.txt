Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully and understanding each reaction step.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It has a structure with a cyclohexene ring and a methyl group attached. The (R) configuration means it's the enantiomer where the hydroxyl group (in its oxidation form) would be on a specific side, but wait, limonene is actually an alkene, so the configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond, I think. Or wait, no, maybe it's the configuration around the chiral center. Hmm, limonene is a bicyclic structure with a chiral center. Let me think: (R)-limonene has the structure where the substituents are arranged in a specific way. I might need to draw this out.

So, the first step is that limonene is treated with Pd/C under hydrogen. That sounds like a hydrogenation reaction. Pd/C is a catalyst for hydrogenation, typically reducing double bonds. So limonene, which has a double bond in its structure, would undergo hydrogenation. The question says that after one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated. So hydrogenation of limonene would add hydrogen across the double bond, converting it into a single bond. Since limonene is a bicyclic monoterpene with a double bond, hydrogenation would produce a cyclohexane ring with substituents.

Wait, the structure of limonene: it's a bicyclic compound, I'm pretty sure it’s a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. Oh wait, no. Wait, limonene is actually a cyclohexene derivative. Let me correct. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic structure. Specifically, it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So the structure has two rings: a cyclohexane ring fused to a smaller ring, making a bicyclic structure with a double bond. So when hydrogenated, the double bond would become a single bond, giving bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So product 1 would be this hydrogenated compound.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, limonene is a monocyclic compound. Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclic structure. So, it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. So when we hydrogenate it, we add H2 across the double bond, converting it into a single bond. So the product would have a single bond where the double bond was. So product 1 would be (R)-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, but wait, I think that's just the hydrogenated limonene.

But I'm a bit confused because the configuration of the hydrogenation—since the starting material is chiral, the product would retain some configuration. Wait, limonene is a chiral molecule, so product 1 would be a hydrogenated version with a certain stereochemistry.

Then, product 1 is treated with 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA), which is a peracid. mCPBA is commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. But wait, product 1 is the hydrogenated limonene, so it doesn't have a double bond anymore. Oh wait, wait a second—maybe I made a mistake. Because limonene has a double bond, when hydrogenated, it becomes a single bond. So product 1 is limonane, which is a bicyclic alkane without any double bonds. So treating that with mCPBA wouldn't do anything because there's no double bond left to epoxidize. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I get the structure of limonene wrong?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with another compound. Maybe limonene is a cyclic monoterpene with a single double bond. Let me think again. Limonene is an alkene, right. So, (R)-
