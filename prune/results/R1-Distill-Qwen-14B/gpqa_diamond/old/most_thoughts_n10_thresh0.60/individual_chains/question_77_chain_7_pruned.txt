Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement and some other reactions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step.

First, the question has two parts: reaction A and reaction B. I need to determine the major products for each and then match them with the options provided.

Let's start with reaction A. The reactant is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation. In some cases, it can induce conjugate additions or form enolates. But the molecule is an ether, so maybe it's forming an enolate?

Wait, the structure of the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Let me draw that out. So, benzene ring attached to a methylene group (CH2), which is connected to an oxygen. The oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me write the structure:

Ph-CH2-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, the 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group is CH2-C(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but with substituents. Wait, wait: 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl is (CH2)2C=CH2 with a methyl on the third carbon. Let me think: but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-. But wait, the position is 2, so it's CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond between C2 and C3. Wait, but the numbering might be different.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-, right? Because but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, wait, but-2-ene is CH2CH2CHCH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would
