Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question gives me a density matrix rho, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that the density matrix is a way to represent the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, in this case, both terms are projectors onto the basis states, so maybe it's a mixed state of the basis vectors.

I think the density matrix for a pure state would be a projector, like |psi><psi| for some state psi. But here, rho is a combination of two projectors, each with a coefficient of 1/2. So this must be a mixed state with equal probabilities for |0> and |1>. So the system is in a completely mixed state when measured in the computational basis.

Now, the question is about its geometrical position in the qubits space. I'm not entirely sure what that refers to, but I recall something about the Bloch sphere. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation for qubit states. But wait, the Bloch sphere is usually for pure states. How does that work for mixed states?

Oh, I remember that any density matrix can be represented as a point in the Bloch sphere, but the representation includes a vector from the origin to a point inside the sphere. For a pure state, the vector would be on the surface (with length 1), but for a mixed state, it's inside (with length less than 1).

The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written as:

rho = (I + r·σ)/2

Where I is the identity matrix, r is a vector of components (x, y, z), and σ represents the Pauli matrices.

So, given that rho is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2, let me write that out in matrix form. The |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So rho is (I)/2, because 1/2 times I is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]].

Wait, so rho is (I)/2. Now, if I compare it to the general form:

rho = (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2.

But in our case, rho is I/2, so that implies that the (r·σ) term must be zero. Because the equation becomes I/2 = I/2 + (r·σ)/2, meaning (r·σ)/2 must be zero. Therefore, r·σ = 0, so r is the zero vector.

Wait, but in the general case, the vector r would define the point on the Bloch sphere. If r is zero, then the point is at the origin. So in the Bloch sphere representation, this state is at the center.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0
