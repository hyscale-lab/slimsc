Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. Hmm, let's see. I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? The closer a star is, the larger its parallax. Oh wait, no, wait. Parallax is actually inversely proportional to distance. So a bigger parallax means the star is closer, because parallax angle decreases as distance increases.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So their density is uniform in space, I guess. But how does that translate into the number per unit parallax range?

I think I should start by recalling the formula for parallax. Parallax (plx) is equal to 1 over distance (d) in parsecs. So plx = 1/d. That makes sense because if d is small (close), plx is large.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. Let's denote the number density as n stars per cubic parsec. Since the distribution is uniform, n is constant.

The number of stars in a certain range of plx would depend on the volume of space at that parallax. Because plx is 1/d, d is 1/plx. So, the distance d is inversely proportional to plx.

To find the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx, I need to find the corresponding distance range. Let's see. If plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, if plx changes by dplx, the distance changes by dd.

Wait, let me compute the volume in terms of plx. The volume at a certain distance is a spherical shell, I think. The volume of a shell between d and d+dd is 4π d² dd. But wait, since d is 1/plx, let's express this in terms of plx.

So, d = 1/plx. Then, dd would be the change in d with respect to plx. Let's compute that. dd = (d plx)/ (d plx²) )? Wait, maybe I should express dd in terms of dplx.

Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. Taking derivative, dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. So, dd = - dplx / plx². But since d is increasing when plx decreases, the negative just indicates direction, but when considering the magnitude, it's positive
