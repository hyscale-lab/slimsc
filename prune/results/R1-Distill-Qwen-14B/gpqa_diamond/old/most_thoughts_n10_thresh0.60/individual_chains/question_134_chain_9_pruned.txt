Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Wait, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is the heat released when an acid and a base react to form water. Usually, the standard value is around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases. But here, the substances are not just HCl and NaOH or something similar. Let's see what they are.

Looking at the reactants: HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is sulfuric acid, which is also a strong acid but since it's diprotic, I need to account for both H+ ions. And Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. 

Wait, let's write the reaction. When HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2 are mixed, they'll probably react to form water and some salt.

But wait, HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So the reaction is between these acids and the base. But how?

Wait, but wait, when you mix an acid and base, they neutralize each other. So in this case, the total H+ from the acids will react
