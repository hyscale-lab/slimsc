Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about particles being collided in a detector. The detector is spherical with a radius of 30 meters. The particles produced are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities. Their Lorentz factor is around 20 on average. Right now, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So I need to find the Lorentz factor gamma such that two-thirds of the particles make it to the detector's walls, instead of one third.

I remember that the Lorentz factor gamma is related to time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Since these particles are moving at a high speed, their lifetime as measured in the lab frame (the detector's frame) would be gamma times their proper lifetime. Because they decay, the time it takes for them to reach the detector's walls depends on their speed—faster particles live longer, so they can travel further before decaying.

So the distance a particle travels before decaying is velocity multiplied by the mean lifetime. But because of relativity, the mean lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime (tau_0). So the distance (d) would be v * gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but the velocity v is related to gamma as well. Oh right, because gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So for ultra-relativistic particles, v is approximately equal to the speed of light c. So I can probably approximate v as c. That might simplify things.

But wait, let me think. The problem states that the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, so v ≈ c. So I can use v = c for simplicity.

So the distance each particle travels before decaying is d = gamma * c * tau_0.

But wait, the particles are produced at the center of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. So the maximum distance a particle can travel to reach the inner walls is 30 meters. If a particle doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters, it will reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays somewhere inside.

The fraction of particles that reach the walls depends on the
