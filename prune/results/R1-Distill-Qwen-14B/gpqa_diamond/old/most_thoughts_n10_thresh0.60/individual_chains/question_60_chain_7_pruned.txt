Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, a civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud is sending a spacecraft at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and I need to figure out how old they'll be when they reach Earth from their own perspective. The options are about whether they die before getting there or how many years pass for them.

Wait, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. There's the time experienced in the spaceship (proper time) and the time observed from Earth (coordinate time). So the astronaut's own clock is the proper time.

But wait, the question is asking for the time from the astronaut's point of view. So I need to consider the proper time experienced by the astronaut during the trip.

First, I should figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh, right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance D is approximately 163,000 light-years.

The spacecraft is moving at v = 0.99999987c. So very close to the speed of light. The time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is the proper time, which is calculated using the Lorentz transformation.

The formula for proper time is tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t is the time measured in the Earth's frame. Alternatively, since the astronaut is moving relative to Earth, time for them will be less.

Wait, another approach: the time experienced by the astronaut is the distance they travel divided by their speed, adjusted by the Lorentz factor. Oh wait, no, that's not exactly right. The time experienced (tau) is the Earth time multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma inverse? Or is it the other way around.

Wait, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So gamma is very large when v is close to c. But for the astronaut, their own time is shorter.

Wait, let's think again. The time from Earth's perspective is D/(v) = (163,000 light-years) / (0.99999987c). Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, so (163,000 / 0.
