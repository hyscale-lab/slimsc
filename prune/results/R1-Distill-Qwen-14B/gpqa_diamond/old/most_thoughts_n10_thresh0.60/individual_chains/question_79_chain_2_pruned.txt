Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the starting compound X is based on the NMR data of the product. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that compound X, which has the formula C11H12O, was reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to identify X from the options provided.

First, I should recall what reaction conditions usually do. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation, which forms epoxides from epoxide precursors like alkenes. But wait, another possibility is that it's used in other types of epoxide formations, but I think Sharpless is about asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols. Hmm.

Wait, no, actually, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is more commonly known as the catalyst for the Prilezhaev epoxidation. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think the question is about epoxidation, so the product is an epoxide.

So, if X is reacting to form an epoxide, X must have a double bond because epoxidation adds an oxygen across a double bond. So X is likely an alkene.

Looking at the options:

A) 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Wait, that's an oxirane (epoxide) already, right? So if X is an epoxide, why would the reaction form another epoxide? That doesn't make sense. So maybe X is something else.

Wait, the product is the epoxide, so X would be the alkene that is converted into the epoxide upon reaction. Because the product has the NMR data, which includes an epoxide signal. Wait, but looking at the 13C NMR data, there's a peak at 197.7 ppm, which is high. Wait, but in epoxides, the carbons are typically around 40-60 ppm, perhaps. Wait, maybe that's not an epoxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a carbonyl
