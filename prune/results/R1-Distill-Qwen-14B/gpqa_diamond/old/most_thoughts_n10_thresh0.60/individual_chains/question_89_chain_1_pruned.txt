Okay, I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says.

So, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. It's heated with excess KOH at 240°C, forming a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given for product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Next, ozone is bubbled through a solution of product 2 at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR spectrum.

First, I need to figure out what each step does. Let's break it down step by step.

Starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Heating with KOH—probably an elimination reaction, since KOH is a strong base. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,3-dibromo) react with strong bases, they undergo dehydrohalogenation, forming an alkene. Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so the molecule is quite rigid. So heating with KOH would likely form an adamantene structure.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. The molecule is similar to cyclohexane but in a diamondoid framework. The two bromines are on adjacent carbons. So, upon elimination, it would lose two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. But wait, no, elimination for a dihalide would only form one double bond. Wait, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. For 1,3-dibromocyclohexane, for example, elimination with KOH would form cyclohexene. But in adamantane's case, the structure is different. So when KOH is added, the 1,3-dibromoadamantane would lose two HBr molecules, leading to the formation of an alkene.

But wait, if there are two bromines on adjacent carbons, maybe elimination forms a double bond between those two carbons. So product 1
