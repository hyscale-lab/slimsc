Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

First, what's optical isomerism? I remember it's when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, leading to them being chiral. Chiral molecules have a center of chirality, like a carbon atom attached to four different groups. Or maybe they have some sort of stereogenic element like a double bond with substituents on each side that create E/Z isomerism.

The question gives four compounds, and I need to determine which ones exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, so this is a biphenyl structure. Biphenyls can have cis and trans arrangements. Wait, but here it's 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Wait, the biphenyl is connected at positions 1 and 1', meaning the rings are connected directly. So the substituents at 2 and 6 could be in positions that allow for cis or trans configurations. But does that lead to optical isomerism?

Wait, biphenyls can have different conformations, but unless the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it might be chiral. If the substituents are at positions that make the structure non-symmetric, then it could have optical isomers. So in this case, each ring has two substituents: a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Are these in positions that would create a chiral center? Or perhaps the molecule as a whole is chiral.

Alternatively, maybe the biphenyl system has axial chirality. Axial chirality is when the molecule has a helical structure, like in allenes or biphenyls. For biphenyls, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral. So for 6,6' and 2,2' positions, maybe they're arranged in a way that causes the molecule to be asymmetric. If so, then it would have optical isomers.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.
