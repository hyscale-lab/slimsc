Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

So, the setup is that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. It undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. They ask about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, and the difference between the correct relativistic value and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay. So the initial nucleus is at rest, so the total initial momentum is zero. After fission, the two fragments must move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission should be zero as well.

Let me jot down what I know:

- Initial mass: M
- Initial rest mass energy: 300 GeV = 300e9 eV. But perhaps I don't need to use the energy directly; maybe mass is more useful here.

After fission:
- Two fragments, say masses m1 and m2.
- m1 = 2 * m2. So m1 is the more massive one.
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 M.

So substituting m1 = 2 m2 into the sum:

2 m2 + m2 = 3 m2 = 0.99 M â†’ m2 = (0.99/3) M = 0.33 M
So m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M

Wait, wait. Let me check the math: 0.33 + 0.66 is 0.99, yes, that's correct.

So masses are m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Now, since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero. So the momenta of the two fragments must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the velocities as v1 and v2. Wait, but since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, maybe I should use relativistic momentum, which is gamma * m * v. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to
