Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to understand what's being asked.

So, the scenario is about a star similar to the Sun. It has a radius equal to the Sun's, and one hemisphere is covered with dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. When the star rotates, these spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations that look like those caused by an exoplanet.

The question is asking: If the star wasn't covered by spots, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the light curve?

Hmm. So, the star's brightness variations due to the spots must be compared to those caused by an exoplanet passing in front of the star (transit method). The amplitude of the dip in brightness would be the same in both cases.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait a second. The star's brightness is varying because of the spots. When the spots rotate into view, the total brightness of the star as seen from Earth changes. Since the spots are cooler, when they are facing us, the star appears dimmer. So, the amplitude of the brightness variation is tied to the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

I remember that the change in brightness (delta L) when a planet transits a star is given by the formula: delta L ≈ (R_planet / R_star)^2. Because the planet blocks that part of the star's light, causing a dip proportional to the area ratio.

But in this problem, the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, not a planet. So I need to model the brightness change caused by the spots and set it equal to the planet's effect.

Let me think about how the spots affect the brightness. The star emits light based on its temperature and surface area. But when spots are present, the total luminosity changes. The filling factor (f) is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. But wait, in this case, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere, so the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (Surface area of hemisphere).

Wait, is the star's surface area being considered as a sphere or a disk? Hmm. The star is a sphere, but when we observe it, we see a disk. So when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view, and the other is not. So, the observable area when the spots are visible is half the star's surface.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20% for the hemisphere. So the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area. So the total spotted area is 0.2 * (π R^2), since the surface area of a hemisphere is 2π R^2? Wait, no. The surface area of a sphere is 4π R². A hemisphere is 2π R². So the area of one hemisphere is 2π R². So
