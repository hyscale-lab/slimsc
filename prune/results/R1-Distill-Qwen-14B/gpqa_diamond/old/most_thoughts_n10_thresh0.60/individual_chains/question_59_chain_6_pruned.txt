Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing several different acids and bases. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says we have three solutions mixed together: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I need to find the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So maybe I should calculate the moles of each acid and base and see which one is in excess.

Let me break it down step by step.

For each solution:

1. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. So I'll calculate its moles. The formula is Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

2. HCl is a strong acid. Its moles would be 0.2 M × 0.4 L = 0.08 moles of HCl.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. The formula for moles is 0.3 M × 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. But wait, Ba(OH)2 produces two OH- ions per formula unit, right? Because it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH-.

So the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 would be 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

But wait, HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely, providing H+ ions. CH3COOH is weak, so it doesn't dissociate completely, but for the neutralization, maybe I can treat it as providing H+ in the same way as a strong acid, but perhaps I should consider the neutralization first.

Wait, no. Maybe I should first compute the total H+ and OH- from all sources and see if there's an excess of H+ or OH-.

So, H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is strong, so each mole gives one H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so
