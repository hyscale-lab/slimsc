Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about comparing the effect of a star with spots to the effect of an exoplanet on the star's brightness variations. The situation is that a star has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, so R_star = R_sun. The spots have a filling factor of 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are cooler by 1000 K, so their temperature is 5000 K. 

When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing brightness variations. The problem states that this could mimic the presence of an exoplanet. Now, the question is, what radius of a hypothetical exoplanet would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star?

So, the task is to find R_planet / R_star such that the planet's transit causes a brightness dip of the same amplitude as the star's variability due to the spots.

First, I need to figure out the amplitude caused by the spots. Then, calculate the amplitude caused by a planet transit and set them equal to find R_planet.

Let me think about how the brightness (or flux) from the star is affected by the spots. The star's total flux without any spots is what we'd have if it were unspotted. When spots are present, some parts are cooler, so the total flux from the star decreases when those spots are facing us.

The flux from a star is proportional to its surface area and the fourth power of its temperature. So, the total flux from the star when spots are present is the unspotted flux minus the flux from the spotted regions.

Wait, but the star's equator is rotating, so the spots come into and out of view. But since the problem mentions the photometric time-series observations show periodic variations due to rotation, I think we're considering the maximum dip in brightness when the spot is fully visible.

Hmm. So, the maximum dip would be when the entire spotted area is visible. But wait, the spots are on one hemisphere. So, when the star rotates such that the hemisphere is fully visible, the spots cover a certain area. But perhaps the problem is considering the maximum possible variation, which would be when the spots are entirely visible. Alternatively, perhaps it's considering the average effect. Wait, the question says "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve"â€”so the amplitude is the change in brightness from the maximum to minimum.

Wait no, the amplitude of the signal is how much the brightness changes as a fraction of the total brightness.

So, let's compute the fractional change in brightness when the spots are transiting. Wait, no, wait, in the case of spots, the brightness changes as the spotted area comes into view. So the dip in flux is when the spots are facing us. Because the spots are cooler, they emit less flux than the surrounding areas. So when a spot is facing us, the total flux from the star decreases
