Okay, so I'm trying to solve this optics problem, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. A monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're looking at the far field intensity pattern. The question is asking about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. They also mention that we can use the small angle approximation tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, okay. So I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it creates a diffraction pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at angles where the path difference is an odd multiple of half-wavelengths. But wait, this isn't a single slit; it's a polygonal aperture with N sides. But when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle. Oh wait, wait! Because an N-sided polygon with infinitely many sides would approximate a circle. But wait, the apothem is given as 'a'. The apothem of a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, the apothem would be the radius. So the radius of the circular aperture is 'a'.

Wait, no. Wait, the apothem is the distance from the center to the middle of a side, which for a regular polygon is also the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular N-gon, the apothem is a
