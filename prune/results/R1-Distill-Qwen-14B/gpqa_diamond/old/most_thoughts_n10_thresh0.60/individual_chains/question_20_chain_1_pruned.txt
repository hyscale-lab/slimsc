Okay, so I've got this question about the impulse approximation in nuclear physics. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that the impulse approximation assumes nucleons behave like free particles. It asks which of the four assumptions imply this. The options are combinations of the four statements 1 to 4.

I remember that the impulse approximation is used in many-body calculations, especially in things like electron scattering off nuclei. The idea is that each nucleon interacts with the external force (like an electromagnetic force) as if it's free, ignoring the rest of the nucleus for the most part. So the other nucleons are treated as a sort of background that doesn't complicate the interaction much.

Looking at the four assumptions:

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. Oh wait, that makes sense. If the current only interacts with each nucleon separately, then each acts independently, like free particles. Because in reality, they are bound, but if the interaction is only with individual ones, maybe the others' effects are negligible.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Transparent here probably means that the interaction doesn't see the other nucleons. So the nucleus behaves as if it's mostly empty except for the one nucleon being hit. That would mean the other nucleons don't contribute to the interaction, so the selected one can be treated as free. So this assumption supports the idea of treating each nucleon as free.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, quarks being non-relativistic... Hmm. Non-relativistic quarks would mean they're moving at speeds much less than light. I'm not sure how that ties into the impulse approximation. But if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it simplifies the treatment of the nucleon as a composite particle. Wait, but the impulse approximation is more about the interaction with the nucleon as a whole, not the internal structure. So maybe this assumption is about treating the nucleon as a point particle without considering internal dynamics. Because if the quarks are non-relativistic, their motion is perhaps more classical, making it easier to treat the nucleon as a single entity. So that assumption might be part of the approximation because it allows treating the nucleon without considering things like high-speed interactions or quantum effects within it.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the
