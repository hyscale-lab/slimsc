Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question gives me phase shifts for different l values, right? The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts, so I guess I only consider these five. The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are given in fm, which is femtometers, I think.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity. So, f(θ, ω) = f_real + i f_imaginary. The imaginary part is especially important in things like resonance phenomena, but I'm not sure how that ties in here.

The question is specifically about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, wait, when θ is zero, that's along the direction of the incident beam. So, I need to compute the imaginary part of f at θ=0.

I think the formula for the scattering amplitude involves a sum over all the angular momentum states. The general formula for f is something like:

f(θ, ω) = (1/k) * sum_{l=0}^{∞} (2l + 1) [ e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ) ] [ (u_l + i v_l) ]

Wait, no, I think more accurately, for each partial wave, the amplitude has terms involving the phase shifts. Oh right, the partial wave expansion. 

The scattering amplitude f can be written as a sum over l of terms involving the spherical Bessel functions and phase shifts. But for this problem, maybe I can use a simpler expression, especially considering the direction along the beam (θ=0).

Wait, at θ=0, the expression for the imaginary part of f might simplify. Let me think. The general expression for the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ, ω) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ (sin δ_l) (e^{iδ_l}) ] ( (e^{i l θ} - e^{-i l θ}) ) / (2i k) )

Wait, that might not be exactly right. Alternatively
