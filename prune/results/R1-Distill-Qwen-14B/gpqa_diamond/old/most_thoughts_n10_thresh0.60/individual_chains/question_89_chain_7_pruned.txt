Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane has a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The molecule has two bromine atoms at the 1 and 3 positions.

Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. KOH is a strong base, so I'm thinking this is an elimination reaction. When vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dihalides) react with base, they usually form alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. But wait, our compound is 1,3-dibromo, not 1,2. Hmm, so can KOH still cause elimination here?

Wait, maybe it's a double elimination. Because if the two bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure, then the base could abstract a β-hydrogen from each, leading to a double elimination. So each Br would leave, and each β-H would be removed, forming a double bond. So the product would be an alkene. But wait, if it's 1,3-dibromo, perhaps the two Brs are on carbons that are two apart, so the elimination would form a bridge or a double bond. Wait, the structure of adamantane is such that each carbon is bonded to three others, so 1,3-dibromoadamant
