Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

So, there are two stars: Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength. They also measured their radial velocities: Star_1 is at 0 km/s and Star_2 at 700 km/s. The question is about the luminosity factor of Star_1 compared to Star_2, assuming they radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. I remember that the luminosity of a star is related to its radius and temperature. The formula I think is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since we're assuming black bodies, this equation should apply.

So, the problem says both stars have the same peak wavelength. Wait, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law, right? Which is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Wait, because if λ_max is same, then T would be same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but Star_1 has a larger radius than Star_2. So since L is proportional to R² T⁴, if T is the same, L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴) = (1.5²) * (1)^4 = 2.25. So the luminosity ratio would be 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, wait. The velocities are given. How does that play into it? Oh, velocity... Oh, wait, maybe we're supposed to use the Doppler effect to find the actual temperatures.

Wait, the radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. So if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted; moving away, it's redshifted. So the observed wavelength would shift. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths they observed are the same. So perhaps their rest wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, they
