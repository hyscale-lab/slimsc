Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let's see. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer.

Wait, the setup is a bit tricky. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is propagating in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving forward, and the light is going in that same direction but through the moving glass.

I remember that when dealing with light and moving media, it's all about how the medium's motion affects the speed of light as observed from the lab frame. Oh right, the speed of light in a medium is generally v = c/n, where n is the refractive index. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium, right? So if the medium itself is moving, we need to consider how that affects the observed speed.

In special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. Oh wait, but this is about a material medium, not a vacuum. So how does that work? I think the speed of light in the medium depends on the medium's velocity relative to the observer.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the frame of reference. Let's think about the glass as the rest frame first. In the glass's frame, light is moving at c/n. But the glass itself is moving at velocity v relative to the lab. So I need to transform the velocity of
