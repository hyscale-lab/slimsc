Alright, so I've got this question about planets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this. I remember that when a planet transits in front of its star from our point of view, we can detect it because it blocks some of the star's light. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet compared to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says both planets have the same mass, which is interesting. But their orbital periods are different. Planet_1 has a shorter period—three times shorter than Planet_2. So if Planet_2's period is P, Planet_1's is P/3. Also, their orbits are circular, so that simplifies things a bit because eccentricity doesn't come into play here.

The host stars are a bit tricky. Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, that's interesting. If a more massive star has the same radius, it's probably less dense or maybe in a different evolutionary stage. But I'm not sure how that affects transit probability.

I think the transit probability depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet's orbit. The formula I remember is something like (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (something about the orbital distance). Wait, no. Let me think again. The probability is the ratio of the area of the planet's disk to the area of the star's disk, but that's when the orbital plane is edge-on. But actually, the probability isn't just that; it's also dependent on the orientation. Oh right, the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it transits is approximately (R_s / a), where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit and R_s is the star's radius. Or maybe it's (2R_s)/a multiplied by something else. Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, transit probability can be approximated as (R_p + R_s) / (a) * something. No, wait, I think the geometric probability is (R_s + R_p) / a. But wait, because R_p is much smaller than R_s, it's approximately (R_s / a) multiplied by 2? Or is it just (R_s / a)? No, no—wait, the probability that the planet's orbit is oriented such that it transits is (2 R_s) / (a) because the planet's orbital plane can be at any angle, and the effective area where it can transit is a circle with diameter 2R_s, so the probability is (2 R_s) / (a) times the solid angle factor, but I think that's already accounted for. Or maybe the formula is (R_p / R_s) squared multiplied by (something else). Hmm, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, the transit probability, P, is given by:

P = (R_p / R_s)^2 * (1 / (1 - e^2))^(3/2)

But wait, since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term is 1. So it's just (R_p/R_s)^2 multiplied by the geometric probability factor. 

But wait, no, I think the actual probability isn't just that. The geometric probability that the planet's orbit is aligned so that it transits is (R_s + R_p) / a. Since R_p
