Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, let's see what I remember. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab frame.

Wait, I remember that when a medium is moving through a vacuum, the speed of light in that medium doesn't just add the velocities. Because in a vacuum, the speed of light is always c, right? But here the medium is glass, which has an index of refraction n. So the speed of light in the glass when it's stationary would be c/n. But the glass is moving, so how does that affect it?

I think I should consider the frame transformations here. Like, maybe using special relativity principles. Because when objects move at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just add the velocities in a classical way. But wait, in this case, the velocity v is given, but I don't know if it's a significant fraction of c. The problem says c=1, but doesn't specify v. Hmm.

Wait, no, the question is about the speed of light in the glass from the lab's perspective. So first, the glass is moving, and we have to find the speed of light in it relative to the lab.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. But how does that transform when the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light.

Wait, no. Because the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So perhaps I need to consider the relative motion. Let me think about the frames.

The lab is the stationary frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So from the lab's frame, the glass is moving, and in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n.

But in the lab frame, what's the speed of the light? Hmm, I think this is a problem of velocity addition in special relativity. Because the speed doesn't just add linearly when velocities are significant compared to c.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify that v is a significant fraction of c. Oh, but since the options don't involve any terms that would suggest a relativistic addition (like gamma factors), maybe the problem is intended to be solved using a non-relativistic approach. Or perhaps there's a different consideration.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium moving at velocity v. So, in the medium's rest frame, light speed is c/n. But when the medium is moving, what is the observed speed in the lab frame?

Wait, I've heard that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's motion. Or is that only when the medium is moving through the lab frame. Hmm.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is determined by the medium's properties and is independent of the medium's motion. Or is that only in a vacuum? No, because in a medium, light
