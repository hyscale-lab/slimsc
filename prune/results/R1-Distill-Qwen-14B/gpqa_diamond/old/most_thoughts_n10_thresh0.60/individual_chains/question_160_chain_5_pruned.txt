Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light diffraction through an aperture. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. The problem says the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. I need to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Oh, right, the angles are small, so I can use tan theta ≈ theta.

Wait, so if N is very large, the polygon becomes almost like a circle, right? Because as the number of sides increases, a regular polygon approaches a circle. So maybe this problem is similar to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture, but let me think.

In the far field, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk. The first minima occur at an angle given by something like sin(theta) ≈ 1.22 λ / (π a), but wait, I might be mixing up some factors. Or was it that the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 λ / (a), because the formula for the first dark ring is a sinθ = λ, but in the case of a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order. But wait, no, for a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = m λ, where m is 1, 2, 3, etc. So the first minimum is at theta ≈ λ/(a), but wait, for a single slit, the first minimum is when m=1, so a sinθ = λ. So sinθ = λ/a. But for small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/a. Wait, but the options here have a 1.22 factor, like option C is 1.22 λ/a. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the single-slit and the circular aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (π a) or something else? Or perhaps I should think about the general approach.

The problem says it's a polygon, but N is going to infinity. So the shape becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be that of a circular aperture. So the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at an angle given by a specific formula.

Wait
