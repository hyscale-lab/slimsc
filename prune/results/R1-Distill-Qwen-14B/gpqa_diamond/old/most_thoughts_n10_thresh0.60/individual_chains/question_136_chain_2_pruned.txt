Okay, so I'm trying to solve this vector calculus problem. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. Let me break it down.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Wait, radial direction only, right. So in spherical coordinates, the field only has a radial component, and it's f(r) = 1/r². So the vector field is F = (1/r²) er, where er is the radial unit vector.

The question is asking for the integral of the divergence of F over a volume, which is a sphere of radius R. So the integral is ∫ (div F) dV over the volume V of the sphere.

I remember from Maxwell's equations that the divergence of a radial vector field F(r) = f(r) er is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f(r)) ). Let me confirm that. Yeah, in spherical coordinates, the divergence for a purely radial field is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F_r), because there's no angular dependence.

So here, F_r is 1/r². Let's compute that.

Div F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute the inside first: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Oh wait, that would make div F zero everywhere except at r=0, right?

Wait, but wait a second. Because for r not equal to zero, yes, that's correct. But at r=0, the field might be singular. But the integral is over a volume that includes r=0, perhaps. Because the sphere's radius is R, so if R is any positive number, the sphere includes the origin.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But wait, when I integrate zero over the volume, the integral should be zero. But wait, I'm probably missing something, because sometimes when you have a delta function or a point charge, the integral isn't zero.

Wait, no, the divergence here is zero except at r=0, but for the point at r=0, the divergence isn't defined in the same way. Wait, perhaps I should think of this as a distribution or a delta function. Oh wait, maybe I should compute it using the divergence theorem instead, since the integral is over a volume with a boundary.

Wait, the
