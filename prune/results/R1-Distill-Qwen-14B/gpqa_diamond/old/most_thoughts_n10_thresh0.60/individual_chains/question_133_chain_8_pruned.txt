Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says we have a solution with 200.00 cm³ (which I know is 0.2 liters) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molar masses are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C, and we're asked about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, wait. Orthophosphate is H3PO4, right? Or wait—no, orthophosphate is HPO4^2-, or maybe PO4^3-? Actually, I think the different forms are H3PO4 (triprotic), H2PO4^- (dihydrogen phosphate), HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate), and PO4^3- (orthophosphate). But I might have to double-check that.

So the problem gives the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. These are the dissociation constants for each step.

The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 is potassium dihydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate decahydrate (or something similar). When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-? Or is it HPO4^2- that's the orthophosphate? Hmm, I might be confused here. Let me clarify: in the context of these phosphate species, HPO4^2- is called hydrogen phosphate, and PO4^3- is called orthophosphate. But wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, I've heard that HPO4^2- is considered the orthophosphate form, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to PO4^3- as orthophosphate, but given that, perhaps the solution will involve considering the buffer system between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the problem asks for orthophosphate ions, which I think are PO4^3-. So how does that come into play here?

Wait, another angle: perhaps in solution, PO4^3- is formed from the further deprotonation of HPO4^2- using OH- or something. But in this solution, we have both KH2PO4
