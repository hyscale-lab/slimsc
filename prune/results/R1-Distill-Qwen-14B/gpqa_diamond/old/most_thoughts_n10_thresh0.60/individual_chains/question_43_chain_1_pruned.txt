Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming question about a benzene ring with a bunch of substituents. Hmm, let me try to visualize the structure. The molecule has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group, all meta to each other. Wait, that means each of these groups is separated by two carbons, right? So, if one is in position 1, the others are in 4 and 7, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring so positions wrap around.

Wait, maybe I should assign positions. Let me think: Let's assume the carboxylic acid is the main functional group, so it gets the lowest possible number. But wait, benzoic acid has the carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene, so in IUPAC naming, the carboxylic acid is considered the principal functional group, so the numbering starts such that the COOH group is in position 1.

So the main chain is the benzene ring with COOH as position 1. Now, the substituents attached to the ring include carbaldehyde (formyl group), cyano, hydroxyl, dimethylamino, and methoxy. The question says all three (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, cyano) are meta. So if COOH is position 1, then aldehyde is position 4, and cyano is position 7â€”but wait, benzene is six-membered, so position 7 is actually position 1 again. Hmm, maybe I got the starting point wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the three groups are each meta to each other, meaning each pair is three positions apart.

Wait, wait, the question says: a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. Oh, so each is meta to the others. So for example, if COOH is position 1, then aldehyde is position 4, and cyano is position 6? No, wait, because in a ring of 6, position 1, 4, and 6 are not all meta. Let me think again.

Wait, meta means three carbons apart. So in a benzene ring, each is three positions away. So for any substituent, the meta positions are two positions away, because in a six-membered ring, they're opposite each other? Wait no, that's
