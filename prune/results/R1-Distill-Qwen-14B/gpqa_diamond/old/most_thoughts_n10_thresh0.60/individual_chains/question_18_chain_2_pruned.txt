Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, I remember that when they talk about [X/Y] notation, it's the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So like, [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y)_sun. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, it's log(X/Y) minus log(X/Y)_sun, so [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - (log X/Y)_sun.

The question gives me data for two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me jot down the given values:

For Star_1:
- Mass is 1.5 solar masses.
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex.

For Star_2:
- Mass is 1.2 solar masses.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex.

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.
- 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12 = -5 → nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sense of the Sun's composition. The notation is 12 + log10(nX/nH) equals a value. So for Fe, it's 7.5, so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly, Mg is 7, so 7-12 = -5, so nMg/nH = 10^-5.

But what do I need to find? The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, [nSi_1 / nSi_2].

Hmm. How do I relate this to the given [X/Fe], [X/H], etc.?

Let me think about each star's composition.

Starting with Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means log(Si/Fe)_1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun =0.3. So, log(Si/Fe)_1 = 0.3 + log(Si/Fe)_sun.

But I don't know what the Sun's [Si/Fe] is. Oh wait, but I can compute it because I have the Sun's Fe and Mg relative to H. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the abundance ratios in terms of [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], and find the silicon abundance.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0. So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log(Fe/H)_1 - log(Fe/H)_sun =0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun. So the iron abundance relative to hydrogen in Star_1 is the same as the Sun.

But wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) divided by (Fe/H)_sun. So if [Fe/H] is 0, (Fe/H)_star = (Fe/H)_sun. So Star_1 has solar Fe abundance relative to H.

Given that, and knowing the Sun's [Fe/H] is 0 (as [Fe/H]_
