Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it again carefully.

The question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light, wavelength λ, is falling vertically on this aperture. It creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field, and we're asked to find the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Also, small angles are considered so that tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, the options given are A to D, and they're all expressions in terms of λ/a. I remember that in optics, when dealing with apertures and diffraction, the Fraunhofer diffraction is involved, especially for the far field. For a circular aperture, the minima occur at angles where sinθ = mλ/D, where m is an integer, D is the diameter. The first minima are at m=1, so sinθ = λ/(2D), but wait, that's for a single slit. Wait, no, wait, no, no, wait: no, wait, for a single slit, the minima are at mλ = a sinθ, where a is the slit width. So the first minima are at sinθ = λ/(a). But wait, that's for a single slit. But here, the aperture is a polygon.

Wait, but the problem says N is infinitely large. Oh, right! So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. Because a polygon with a huge number of sides approximates a circle. So the situation is that of a circular aperture when N is very large.

Wait, but wait a second. The polygon is N-sided, and all apothems are a. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the apothem 'a' relates to the radius (which would be the distance from center to a vertex) as a = R cos(π/N), approximately, for large N. But as N becomes very large, π/N approaches zero, so cos(π/N) approaches 1, so a ≈ R. So the apothem becomes almost equal to the radius. So for a huge N, the polygon's apothem a is equal to the radius R of the circle. Therefore, the diameter is 2a.

Wait, but wait, the far field diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is the Airy disk. The first minima occur at an angle where sinθ = 1.220 * λ/(π a), wait no, let me think. The formula is actually sinθ = 1.22 λ/(D), where D is the diameter of the aperture.

Wait, correct formula: For a circular aperture, the minima in the diffraction pattern occur at θ where sinθ = (m λ)/(π a), with m = 1, 2, 3,... for the first, second, etc., minima. Wait, no, wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Let me recall: The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at θ where the argument of the Bessel function derivative is equal to its first zero. The formula is usually given as sinθ = 1.22 λ/D, where D is the diameter.

Ah, right, yes. So for the first minimum, m
