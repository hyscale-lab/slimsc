Okay, so I need to tackle this physics problem about oscillating charge distributions and the radiation they produce. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when charges oscillate, they can emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated in the radiation zone as a function of wavelength and angle.

The setup is an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, it's symmetric around the z-axis. The problem says it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis.

They're asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and the possible form of f as a function of λ.

I think the first part relates to the radiation pattern. For a dipole radiator, which I think this is similar to, the radiation pattern in the far zone (which is the radiation zone here) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated per unit solid angle, I believe, depends on the cosine squared of the angle θ. So, the radiation pattern is maximum along the axis (θ=0) and falls off as θ increases.

Wait, the formula for the power per unit solid angle (like the radiation intensity) for an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin²θ) or (cos²θ)? Let me think. No, I think for a dipole, the radiation is maximum along the axis. So the pattern is maximum at θ=0, and decreases as θ approaches 90 degrees. So the function f(θ) must be proportional to cos²θ. Because when you're on the dipole axis (θ=0), cosθ is 1, so maximum. At θ=90, it's zero. Yes, that makes sense.

Wait wait, wait. No, the radiation pattern for a dipole is actually proportional to (sin²θ), isn't it? Because the electric field in dipole radiation falls off as 1/(r sinθ), or something like that. Or perhaps the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. No, wait, no. Let me think again.

The formula I remember is that the intensity (power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is proportional to ( (d^2 φ/dz^2 )^2 ) but in the far field, which would relate to the angle. Alternatively, the radiation pattern in terms of angle is given by the formula I(r, θ) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Because for a dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole axis. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, dipole radiation is strongest along the axis.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the dipole radiation. The far field radiation for a dipole has its maximum intensity in the plane perpendicular to the dipole, right? So if the dipole is along the z-axis, the maximum radiation is in the xy-plane, which is θ=90 degrees. No, wait, that's for the electric field direction. But the intensity is another matter. Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the radiated power per unit solid angle.

The formula for the intensity (power per unit area per unit solid angle)
