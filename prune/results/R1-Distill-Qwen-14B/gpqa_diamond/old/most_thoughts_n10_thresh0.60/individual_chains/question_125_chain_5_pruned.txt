Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it.

The problem is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential. So the force here obeys Hooke's law, which makes sense since F = -kr, and k would be m ω² in this case.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different energy and a number.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. Each state is described by the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz in each direction, but since it's isotropic, the energy depends on the sum of these quantum numbers.

Wait, no, wait—Wait, in three dimensions, for the isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the correct formula is E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding them all gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. So the total quantum number n is the sum n_x + n_y + n_z. So n can be 0, 1, 2, etc.

Wait, but the states are degenerate. For each n, the number of states depends on how many ways you can have n_x + n_y + n_z = n, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. So for each energy level, the degeneracy is the number of possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) triplets that sum to n.

Wait, but the problem is about the third excited state. Hmm. Wait, wait. Ground state is the lowest energy. Let me think about the order.

The ground state (n=0) would have E = (
