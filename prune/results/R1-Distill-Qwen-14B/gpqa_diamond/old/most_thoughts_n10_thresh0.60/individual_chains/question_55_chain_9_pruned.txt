Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which compound it is. Let's see what the question says. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

The NMR data is: 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 ppm (3H, s), and 1.6 ppm (3H, d).

Hmm, okay. I remember that NMR can tell us a lot about the structure, especially the splitting patterns and the integration. Let me start breaking this down.

First, the 2.1 ppm triplet as a singlet with 3H. Singlet means no neighboring protons, so maybe this is an acetyl group (like OAc), where the methyl is attached to an oxygen. So that's probably the acetate part of the molecule. So the structure is probably something like R-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait, acetate is CH3COO- as the group. So in an acetate ester, it would be R-O-CO-OCH3? Or wait, no, the structure is usually R-O-CO-R', like methyl acetate is CH3COOCH3. So in this case, the R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

So the 2.1 ppm singlet is likely the methyl group attached to the carbonyl, right? So that's the acetate part.

Next, looking at the 1.6 ppm (3H, d). A doublet with 3H. So a methyl group attached to something that has one neighboring proton. Wait, but wait, a doublet here. So maybe it's a CH2CH3 group where the CH2 is adjacent to something else. Or perhaps a CH(CH2CH3) group, but not sure yet.

Wait, but the splitting is a doublet. So the 1.6 ppm is a methyl (d), so it's adjacent to a CH group. Because in a doublet, each proton is split into two by a neighboring group with one proton. So the structure could be, for example, CH2CH(CH3) or similar.

Wait, but in the question, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let me think about the structures.

Propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Or maybe CH2CH2O..., no, wait, propenyl is CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as an allyl group, but wait, the actual structure might vary.

Wait, perhaps I should draw possible structures for each option.

Let's consider the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: Structure would be CH2CH2CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, butenyl is four carbons. Wait, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O... or CH2CH=CHCH2-O... Wait
