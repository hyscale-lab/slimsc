Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the starting materials A and B that, when treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water, produce two different diketones.

Hmm, I remember that hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite are typically involved in diazotization reactions, especially with aromatic amines. But wait, in this case, the products are diketones, which are carbonyl compounds. So maybe the starting materials aren't aromatic but are something else that can form ketones upon reaction.

Oh wait, I think I've heard about the Stephen reduction or maybe the Rosenmund reduction, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, maybe this is a hydrolysis reaction. Diazonium salts can undergo various reactions, like hydrolysis to form carbonyl groups. Oh right! Diazonium salts can be hydrolyzed to produce ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure of the starting amine.

So if the starting material is a primary amine, the diazonium salt upon hydrolysis would give an aldehyde. But if it's a secondary amine, the hydrolysis would give a ketone. Wait, but the products here are diketones, meaning they have two ketone groups. So the starting materials must have two amine groups each, perhaps, but that doesn't seem right because amines typically have one or two reactive positions for diazotization.

Wait, no, maybe each starting material has two positions where the amine groups
