Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem has two reactions, and I need to figure out the major products A and B. Then, I have to choose the correct option from A to D. The options give possible products for both A and B. Let's break it down.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. But wait, when H+ is present, maybe it's a workup step after some kind of deprotonation?

So, the starting compound is a spiro alcohol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the alcohol's -OH bearing carbon. The structure is 1-vinyl, so there's a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) attached. The spiro system is [3.5], meaning one ring has three carbons and the other has five, but wait, wait, wait. Spiro notation is spiro[a.b], where a and b are the number of carbons in each ring. So spiro[3.5]non... Hmm, non is nine carbons. Let me think: the main chain would be non, but with a spiro system, it's a bit more complex. But maybe the key is that it's a bicyclic structure with an alcohol and a double bond.

Reaction conditions are THF, KH, H+. So, I think this is a Cope elimination or some kind of elimination reaction. Wait, but Cope elimination is for 1,5-dienes, and maybe under strong base conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination.

Wait, the starting material has a hydroxyl group. So, when treated with a strong base like KH, which is a strong base (it's a hydride source?), perhaps it deprotonates the alcohol to form an alkoxide. Then, maybe it eliminates something?

Alternatively, I've heard of the Birch reduction, but that's with metals like Na or K in ammonia, but not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition or some kind of elimination to form a ketone or something.

Wait, another thought: The compound is a spiro alcohol with a vinyl group. When treated with a strong base like KH, perhaps it undergoes an elimination to form a ring, or maybe a ring expansion. Or maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that usually involves vicinal diols, which this isn't.

Alternatively, since the solvent is THF and using a strong base, perhaps it's a conjugate addition of a hydride. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, another approach: The product options for A are either (E)-bicyclo[5.3.1]undec-1(11)-en-4-one or decahydro-7H-benzo[7]annulen-7-one. So these are both bicyclic ketones. So perhaps the reaction is an elimination to form a ketone.

So maybe the starting alcohol, after deprotonation, undergoes some kind of ring
