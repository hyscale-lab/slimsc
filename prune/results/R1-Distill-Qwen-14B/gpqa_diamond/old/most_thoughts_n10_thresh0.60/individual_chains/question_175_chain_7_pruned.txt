Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The setup is that the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta, measured along the z-axis.

The question is asking two things: first, what fraction of the maximum power A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and second, what's a possible form of the function f in terms of lambda.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence.

Wait, I remember that for dipole radiation, the power radiated depends on the angle. The basic formula I think is something like P = (something) * (sin(theta))^2, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, for an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is a sine squared function. So the intensity or power per unit solid angle is proportional to sin^2(theta). Does that mean the maximum is at theta=90 degrees, since sin(90)=1?

Right, so the maximum power is when sin(theta) is maximum, which is at 90 degrees. So the maximum value of the function f would be when theta is 90, which is 1 in the sin(theta) squared term.

Wait, but the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A. So if the function f is proportional to sin^2(theta
