Okay, so I've got this physics problem about oscillating charge distributions and the radiation they produce. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says the charge distribution is spheroidal, meaning it's sort of oval-shaped, and the symmetry axis is along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find what fraction of A is radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and also figure out the form of f, like its dependence on λ.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since this is spheroidal and symmetric along the z-axis, I think the radiation pattern might be similar to that of a dipole antenna, but maybe a bit different.

In dipole radiation, the power radiated per unit solid angle has a specific dependence on the angle θ. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator (θ = 90 degrees) and falls off as cos^4θ towards the poles (θ=0 and 180). Wait, no, actually, the intensity for a dipole varies as sin^2θ. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh right, the radiation pattern for a dipole is such that the intensity is proportional to (sinθ)^2. So it's maximum at θ=90 degrees, and zero at θ=0 and 180.

Wait, but in this case, the distribution is spheroidal. Maybe it's a quadrupole or something else, but I think the maximum would be at a different angle. Or perhaps it's a dipole-like radiation but with a different angular dependence. Alternatively, perhaps it's a more symmetric radiation pattern.

Wait, but the question states that f is a function of λ and θ. We need to know what f looks like. The options give possible forms, like lambda^-4, etc. So I need to figure out the scaling with λ and the dependence on θ.

Wait, I remember that the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is given by the Larmor formula. The power radiated is proportional to (q^2 a^2)/c^3,
