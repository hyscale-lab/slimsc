Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about the Michael addition, right? I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking the beta-carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. So the general idea is that the enolate ion acts as a nucleophile and attacks another alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which then forms a new carbon-carbon bond.

The problem lists three different reactions, and for each, I need to determine the major products. Then, I have to match these products with the provided options which list possibilities for A, B, and C.

Let's break down each reaction one by one.

**First Reaction (A): dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate + NaOEt, EtOH**

Hmm, dimethyl malonate is a good dienophile, but wait, no, wait. Actually, in the context of the Michael addition, the enolate will be the nucleophile. So which compound is the nucleophile here?

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good electron-deficient species because of the two ester groups, which are electron-withdrawing. But wait, no, when you deprotonate it, it forms a strong nucleophile.

Wait, NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) is a strong base. In the presence of EtOH, which is a protic solvent, but the base would deprotonate the alpha position of the carbonyl. So dimethyl malonate has two alpha positions (the CH2 groups next to the carbonyls). So when the base is added, it deprotonates to form an enolate.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate will attack the beta position of the other compound, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Let me sketch this out. The structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me, but wait, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is actually the acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-O-Me, but with a substituent. Wait, no. Wait, the formula is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate.

Ah, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3.

Wait, but wait, the correct structure: The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So for methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the structure is CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-O-Me. So the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl is between the CH2 and the carbonyl.

So the enolate from dimethyl malonate (which is CH2(COOEt
