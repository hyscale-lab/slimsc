Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I think the exact method might not be too relevant here—it's more about the given ratios and figuring out the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1.

So the data given is:
- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, T1/T2 = 1.4.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, T2/T3 = 2.3.
- The mass ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.15, so M1/M2 = 1.15.
- The mass ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 1.35, so M2/M3 = 1.35.
- The albedo for all is 0.3, same as Earth.

And the question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1's. So, find Period3 / Period1 = ?

Hmm. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula is something like T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4), where a is albedo, L is star's luminosity, d is distance, and σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

Wait, but since all three planets are orbiting the same star, L and σ are the same for all. Albedos are equal, so (1 - a) is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature ratio depends only on the square of the distance. Because T is proportional to ( L (1-a) )^(1/4) / (d²)^(1/4) ), which simplifies to (1/d)^(1/2), so T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d). 

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ) ]^(1/4). So, if the star's luminosity L is same, and albedo a is same, then T is proportional to [1/(d²)]^(1/4) = d^(-1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). Therefore, the ratio of temperatures can help us find the ratio of distances.

So, from the given ratios, let's find the distance ratios.

First, T1/T2 = 1.4. Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(d), then T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So 1.4 = sqrt(d2/d1). Squaring both sides, (1.4)^2 = d2/d1 → 1.96 = d2/d1. So d2 = 1.96 * d1.

Wait, no, wait. If T1 is hotter than T2, that would mean that Planet1 is closer to the star. Because T is higher when d is smaller. So if T1 is 1.4 times T2, then d2 is bigger than d1. Because T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So d2/d1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 * d1.

Similarly, T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2 is hotter than T3, meaning d3 is larger than d2. So T2/T3 = 2.3. So d3/d2 = (T2/T3)^2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29. So d3 = 5.29 * d2.

So now, let's find d3 in terms of d1. Since d2 is 1.96 d1, then d3 = 5.29 * 1.96 d1. Let me compute that. 5.29 * 1.96. Hmm, 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, and 0.29 * 1.96 is about 0.5684. So total is approximately 10.3684. So d3 ≈ 10.368 * d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.368 times that of Planet1.

Now, the next part is about the orbital period. I think we need to apply Kepler's third law here. Kepler's law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star), given that the mass of the star is much larger than the planet. But wait, the problem gives us masses of the planets. Oh, wait, no, Kepler's law in the context of planets orbiting a star would involve the star's mass. But in the problem, the planet masses are given, but the star's mass is the same for all. So perhaps the planet masses don't directly affect the period unless we're considering mutual gravitational interactions, which I think is beyond the scope here.

Wait, no, Kepler's third law in the context where the star's mass is much larger than the planet's:

The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, where M is
