Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR questions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with acetic acid. Let me try to follow each step to figure out what the final product looks like. Once I have the structure, I can analyze its NMR spectrum.

Step 1: Acetic acid is treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that acetic anhydride is often used as a acetylation agent. Bromine with pyridine... Oh wait, that sounds like the formation of an acyl bromide. So acetic acid reacting with acetic anhydride and Br2 probably forms acetyl bromide. Or wait, maybe it's more like a substitution. Oh, right! Acetic acid can be converted into acetyl bromide via acid-catalyzed substitution. So product 1 is probably CH3COBr.

Step 2: Product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid. That setup sounds like an acid-catalyzed nucleophilic substitution. Acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) reacting with ethanol would substitute the bromide with an ethoxide group. So the product would be ethyl acetate. Wait, but wait: CH3COBr + ethanol → CH3COOEt (ethyl acetate) plus HBr. So product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Step 3: Product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide. Sodium cyanide is a good nucleophile. Ethyl acetate has an ester group, which can undergo nucleophilic acyl substitution. The cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon. So the reaction would form a cyanide substitution. So the ester (OEt) is replaced by OCN? Or wait, no. Wait, in an ester, the structure is R-O-CO-O-R'. When you substitute, the leaving group is OR', so the cyanide would attack, leading to a substitution of the ester group. So ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) reacting with NaCN would form CH3COCN (maybe acetonitrile? No, wait. Wait, the general reaction is RCOOR' + CN- → RCO-CN (acylonitrile) plus R'OH. So product 3 would be propanenitrile? Wait, no. Let me think. The structure
