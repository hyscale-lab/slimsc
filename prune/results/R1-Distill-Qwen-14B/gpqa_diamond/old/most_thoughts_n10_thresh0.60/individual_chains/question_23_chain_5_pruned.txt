Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about a reaction between a specific compound and hydrogen bromide (HBr). The compound is ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene. Hmm, let me visualize that structure.

Wait, the structure is an aryl ether, right? The benzene ring has an ether group (O-) attached to it. The other part of the ether is a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. So that substituent on the benzene is O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me get the structure right.

But-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Or wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond at 3? Wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl must be the substituent where the chain is four carbons long, starting from the point of attachment. So the substituent is (CH2)CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Wait, but that can't be right because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that's impossible because that would make it buta-1,3-diene or something else. Wait no, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3? Because the substituent is in position 1.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. The substituent is but-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's impossible because but only has four carbons. Oh wait, maybe I miscounted.

Wait, let's number the substituent chain. The substituent is attached
