Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR spectrum. The options are four different propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

The given NMR data are:
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Let me start by recalling what each of these signals typically represents. 

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is probably an acetyl group (OAc), since the singlet suggests no neighboring protons. Acetates usually have that around 2 ppm.

The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) probably comes from a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. Because in alkenes, the adjacent (vinylic) protons show up around 4-5 ppm, but wait, this is 1.6. Hmm, but wait, wait. Maybe it's a geminal group, like a methyl attached to a carbon adjacent to a double bond. Oh, I think in allylic positions, like in propenyl groups, the CH2 or CH3 next to the double bond can appear around 1.5-2.5 ppm. Wait, but here it's 1.6, which is a bit lower. Maybe it's a CH3 attached to a CH2 which is next to a double bond. Like in propenyl acetate.

Then, the 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (dq) suggests a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. That might be a vinyl proton adjacent to another group. The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz indicates a trans coupling, maybe between two protons on adjacent carbons. A coupling constant of 16 Hz is quite large, so that's probably a trans double bond because cis would have a smaller J. Wait, no, wait: actually, for double bonds, trans coupling (like in trans alkenes) would have a larger J value. Or wait, no, in vicinal coupling (protons on adjacent carbons), trans is higher. So J=16 Hz is likely for a trans coupling, like in a trans double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. Let's consider the options:

The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, and cis or trans.

First, the acetate group is OAc, which has the 2.1 singlet. So each compound is an ester, R-OAc.

So the structure is R-OAc, where R is either propenyl or butenyl, and the double bond is either cis or trans.

So, let me consider the possible structures.

For propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Or wait, wait, no: wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- (allyl group). So the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me correct that.

Wait, acetate is OAc, so the ester would be R-OAc, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group. So if R is propenyl, it would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's not possible because the ester is formed from the alcohol. So perhaps R is an allyl group, like CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Alternatively, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's longer.

Wait, but maybe I should focus on the NMR signals.

The 7.0 ppm doublet (d, J=16 Hz) suggests two protons that are adjacent and trans to each other. So perhaps a structure where two protons are on adjacent carbons and are trans, like in a trans double bond.

Wait, but in allyl groups, you have a CH2 group attached to the double bond. Let me draw this.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the protons on the double bond are on carbons 1 and 2. So the protons on CH2= would be on C1 and C2. The CH2-OAc is on C3.

In that case, the NMR would show signals for the protons on C1 and C2.

Wait, but the NMR has two signals in the aromatic region (around 7 ppm) and another in 5.5. Wait, no, 5.5 is not aromatic, it's vinyl. Let me think again.

Wait, the NMR has a 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, d, J=16). That's probably a proton that's coupled to another proton with a large J. Let me think: in a trans double bond, the two protons are on opposite sides, so they would couple with each other, leading to a doublet.

Wait, but wait, in a trans double bond, each of the two protons would be adjacent to each other and would split each other into a doublet. So in the NMR, each of those protons would be a doublet. So if there are two protons, each would have a doublet, perhaps, but that would lead to a multiplet. Hmm, but here it's a single doublet with 1H.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the structure. Suppose the molecule is an allyl acetate, like CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then the structure would have the double bond between C1 and C2, and the CH2-OAc on C3.

In that case, the protons on C1 and C2 would be on the double bond. Each would be a CH2 group? No, wait: CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, C3 is CH2-OAc.

Wait no, in propenyl, it's CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the protons on CH2= are the C1 and C2 carbons. So the protons on C1 are two equivalent CH2 protons? No, wait, no. Let me correct that: CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me draw it properly.

The structure of propenyl acetate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH2CH2CH2...? No, wait, wait. Acetate is OAc-, which is O-CO-O-. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Wait, acetate is the ester derived from acetic acid, so the structure is R-O-COCH3.

Wait, more accurately, the ester group is O-CO-O-R', where R' is the alkyl group. Wait, no, wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkyl group attached to the oxygen, and R' is the acyl group. So for propenyl acetate, R would be the propenyl group, and R' is acetyl.

So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Wait, but I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me think in terms of the structure.

The ester group is O-CO-O. So the structure is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkyl/alkenyl group from the alcohol, and R' is the acyl group from the acid. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is (propenyl group)-O-CO-CH3.

So the propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-.

So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3.

Now, the NMR signals:

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) is a downfield shift, which suggests aromatic or vinylic protons. But wait, in this case, the vinylic protons are on the CH2 and CH groups.

Wait, the double bond is between C1 and C2: CH2-CH2-CH2-O... No, wait, no. The structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 as CH2-CH2-.

Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3.

The protons on C1 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond. Wait, but CH2=CH- would have two protons on C1 and one on C2. Wait, no, no: wait, CH2=CH-CH2-O... So C1 has two protons (they're on the same carbon, so they are equivalent), C2 has one proton, and C3 (CH2-O) has two protons.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the NMR signals.

In the given NMR data, there are two signals in the 5-7 ppm region. One is at 7.0 (1H, d, J=16), and another at 5.5 (1H, dq). 

Wait, in propenyl acetate, the protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be vinylic. The C1 would have two equivalent protons, so that might show up as a triplet or something, but wait, because each is adjacent to the C2 proton.

Wait, but in the case of a trans double bond, the coupling would be trans, leading to a larger J.

Wait, but looking at the signals: the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a coupling between two protons with a large J, possibly trans on a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, that might be a proton that's coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, a CH group that's next to a CH2 and another group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is butenyl acetate. Let me consider that.

Butenyl has four carbons, so butenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-CH3. Wait, but that's more carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but let's think about the possible structures of the options.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, for each option, the R group is either propenyl or butenyl, and the double bond is cis or trans.

Let me compare the NMR for each possibility.

First, for propenyl acetate, whether cis or trans.

Propenyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 are two Hs, and on C2 is one H.

So the C1 protons are on the same carbon, so they are equivalent. The proton on C2 is adjacent to C1 and C3.

So, for the NMR:

The C2 proton (on the double bond) would be split by the two C1 Hs. Since there are two Hs on C1, each adjacent to the C2 H, the C2 H would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2). But wait, wait, the coupling between C1 and C2 would be through the double bond, so it's a trans coupling, and J would be about 15-16 Hz.

So, the C2 H would be a triplet, but in the NMR, there's a 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). Hmm, but wait, in this structure, the C2 H would be next to the C3 CH2-O group. So perhaps the C2 H is coupled to two sets of protons: the two Hs on C1 (J=16 Hz) and the two Hs on C3 (J smaller, maybe around 6 Hz for CH2-O).

So that would cause the C2 H to be a doublet of triplets or a doublet of quartets. Alternatively, perhaps a doublet of quadruplets if there are two coupling constants.

Wait, but in the NMR, there's a 5.5 ppm (1H, dq). So that might fit the C2 H in propenyl acetate.

The C1 Hs would be split by the C2 H, which is one H. So each C1 H would be a doublet (n=1, so two peaks), but since they are equivalent, the two Hs would combine into a quartet? Wait, no, wait. If the two C1 Hs are equivalent, and each is coupled to the C2 H (1H), then each would be a doublet. But since they are two equivalent Hs, the splitting would be as if each is coupled to one H, so each would have two peaks, and together they would integrate as 2H. But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a 1H doublet, so that might not fit.

Wait, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong. Let me re-examine.

In propenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), the C1 has two Hs, C2 has one H, and C3 has two Hs.

The C2 H is coupled to the two C1 Hs (which are equivalent) and the two C3 Hs (which are also equivalent). So the coupling would cause it to split into multiple peaks.

Wait, the J between C2 and C1 is about 16 Hz (trans), and the J between C2 and C3 would be smaller, perhaps around 6 Hz, because they are adjacent via a single bond.

So the C2 H would be a doublet of doublets (each split into two), but depending on the integration, maybe a triplet or more.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a 1H doublet. That suggests a proton that is only coupled to one other proton. So perhaps the C2 H in the trans-propenyl acetate would be coupled to a single proton elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl but butenyl.

Let me think about butenyl acetate. Let's say it's trans-butenyl acetate, which would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, butenyl would have four carbons. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that doesn't sound right. Wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's butenyl, but the position of the double bond matters.

Wait, but for butenyl, the double bond can be between C1-C2 or C2-C3. For trans-butenyl, the double bond is between C2 and C3, perhaps.

Wait, but let me get back to the NMR.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a proton coupled to another with a large J. So maybe that's a trans coupling across a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets. So that's a proton that's coupled to two different sets of Hs, maybe from adjacent carbons.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is likely a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to a double bond. So perhaps a CH2-CH3 group adjacent to a double bond. So in the structure, maybe it's a CH2-CH2-CH2-O... but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc, but that's more about the butenyl part.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the splitting patterns.

In the 7.0 ppm, a doublet (1H, d, J=16). So it's a single proton coupled to one other proton. Hmm.

If the structure has a double bond, and one of the vinylic protons is only coupled to another single proton, that might fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's ethyl acetate, which is not an option here.

Wait, let me think of each option's structure.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond in the cis configuration.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. The C2 H would be coupled to the C1 Hs and perhaps the C3 Hs.

Wait, but in the cis case, the coupling between C1 and C2 would still be about 16 Hz, but that's a trans coupling because the protons are on opposite sides.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify: the J value for cis and trans in double bonds.

Actually, in a double bond, the coupling (J) between the two vinylic protons is trans, meaning that the protons are on opposite sides of the double bond. So whether the double bond is cis or trans refers to the substituents around the double bond, not the protons' configuration.

Wait, no, wait: the configuration (cis or trans) refers to the groups attached to each carbon of the double bond. So in the case of propenyl, if it's cis, the two substituents (like the CH2CH2OAc) would be on the same side as the other substituents.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Let me try to think about each option's expected NMR.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on the double bond being trans. So the CH2-OAc group is on one side, and maybe another substituent (like H) on the other side.

Wait, but in this case, the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. The CH2=CH group.

So the C1 protons would be two Hs, and the C2 would have one H. The C2 H would be coupled to the two C1 Hs (each equivalent), leading to a triplet.

But in the given NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq), which suggests the proton is coupled to two different sets of Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, another approach: the 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz) must be a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton, which is trans. So if the structure has a double bond where one of the protons is split into a doublet by another proton, perhaps a geminal coupling? No, geminal coupling is usually small or not observed because the protons are on the same carbon.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm proton is a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton across the double bond. So each of them would be a doublet, but since they are equivalent, perhaps they merge into a singlet. But in this case, it's a doublet, which suggests only one coupling.

Hmm, maybe there's another scenario where a vinylic proton is coupled to a single proton elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that a vinylic proton is next to a CH2 group, and the CH2 group's Hs are split into a triplet or more.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is butenyl acetate, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, making the vinylic Hs on C2 and C3.

Wait, let me consider option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with the double bond in the trans configuration. Wait, but that's not precise.

Wait, butenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's if the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Alternatively, if the double bond is between C2 and C3, the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but that's different. Let me think about the NMR signals.

In that case, the vinylic Hs would be on C2 and C3.

Wait, for trans-butenyl acetate (CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans), the structure would have the double bond between C2 and C3, with the substituents on opposite sides.

So the Hs on C2 and C3 would each couple with each other. Each would have a J around 16 Hz.

But then, each of those Hs would couple to their adjacent Hs, perhaps leading to more complex splitting.

Wait, but the given NMR shows a 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, d), which suggests a single coupling. So perhaps one of the vinylic Hs is only coupled to one other H.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that one of the vinylic Hs is not adjacent to any others beyond what's causing the doublet.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) is a single H coupled to one other H with J=16. That suggests that this H is on a double bond, coupled to another H on an adjacent C in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm (dq) suggests a H coupled to two different sets of Hs. Perhaps this is a CH group that's next to a CH2 and another group.

The 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2 that's adjacent to a double bond. So like CH2CH2CH3, where the CH2 is next to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. No, that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the integration.

The NMR shows:

7.0 (1H), 5.5 (1H), 2.1 (3H), 1.6 (3H).

So the molecule has a total of 8 Hs: 1+1+3+3=8. So the molecular formula must have 8 Hs. Let's see:

Acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no: acetate is O-CO-OCH3 would be methyl acetate. Wait, wait, no: the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is the alkoxy group, and R' is the acyl.

So, for propenyl acetate, R is propenyl (3 carbons, 5 Hs?), wait no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- which has 5 Hs: two on C1, one on C2, two on C3.

Wait, but in the NMR, the integrals are 1H, 1H, 3H, 3H. So total 8 Hs. So the molecule must have 8 Hs.

So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-R'

R' is the acetyl group (CH3).

R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me calculate the Hs for each option.

Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-.

That would have 2 (C1) + 1 (C2) + 2 (C3) = 5 Hs.

Acetate: CH3 (3 Hs).

Total Hs: 5 +3 =8, which matches.

Butenyl group: let's see. For butenyl, four carbons.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, then the butenyl group has:

C1: CH2 (2 Hs)

C2: CH (1 H)

C3: CH2 (2 Hs)

C4: CH2-OAc (2 Hs)

Wait, that's 2+1+2+2=7 Hs in the butenyl group. Plus the 3 from acetate, total 10 Hs. But the NMR only has 8, so butenyl might not fit.

Wait, perhaps the butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, which would have 2+1+2+2 =7 Hs, plus 3 from acetate: 10. Doesn't match. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the structure is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the butenyl group is CH2=CHCH2CH3-OAc, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me count again.

Wait, the propenyl group (CH2=CHCH2-) has 5 Hs. Acetate has 3, so total 8 Hs. That fits the NMR data.

But butenyl would have more Hs. So perhaps the correct structure is propenyl-based, either cis or trans.

So, back to propenyl acetate.

So in propenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2-OAc), the C1 has two Hs, C2 has one H, and C3 has two Hs.

The C2 H is adjacent to the C1 Hs and the C3 Hs.

So the C2 H would be coupled to two sets: the C1 Hs (J=16 Hz) and the C3 Hs (J= something else, maybe around 6 Hz).

So the C2 H would have two couplings, resulting in a doublet of doublets or a triplet.

In the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets, which might be the C2 H coupled to two distinct sets of Hs.

The C1 Hs are each coupled to the C2 H (J=16 Hz), so each would be a doublet. But since the two C1 Hs are equivalent, their signal would be a quartet? No, wait, no. When two equivalent protons are coupled to another, they would each split into a doublet, but since they are equivalent, the overall splitting for the two would be a doublet. Wait, no: when two equivalent Hs are coupled to one H, each would split into a doublet, but since they're equivalent, the overall integration would be a doublet for 2H. Alternatively, perhaps they merge into a triplet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the C1 Hs would be a quartet. Because each C1 H is coupled to the single C2 H, and since there are two C1 Hs, each C1 H would see one coupling (n=1), so each would be a doublet. But since they are equivalent, the two Hs together would give a doublet for 2H.

Wait, but the given NMR has a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which is a single H. So that doesn't fit. So perhaps the C1 Hs are not the 7.0 ppm signal.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

In the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the C2 H is the only one that's part of the double bond. The C1 Hs are on the same C, so they are equivalent and would show up as a quartet if coupled to the C2 H. But wait, the C2 H is a single proton, so the C1 Hs would split into a doublet, but since there are two equivalent Hs, the signal would appear as a quartet, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, when two equivalent Hs are coupled to a single H (n=1), each H would split into two peaks, but since they are in a pair, the overall splitting for both would be a doublet for 2H. So the C1 Hs would be a doublet integrating to 2H, but in the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is 1H, which doesn't fit. So maybe this isn't propenyl acetate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Let's think about if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are arranged differently.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's ethyl acetate and doesn't fit the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond in the butenyl chain.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that butenyl has more Hs than accounted for in the NMR. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm (1H, d) is the C2 H in a butenyl structure where the double bond is between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-CH2-OAc.

In that case, the C2 and C3 would be the vinylic carbons.

The C2 H would be coupled to C1 (CH2), C3 (CH), and perhaps others.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

Each has either propenyl or butenyl group with cis or trans double bond.

Let me consider the NMR for each.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

Wait, but in that structure, the vinylic Hs are on C1 and C2.

The C2 H would be coupled to the C1 Hs (2H, so n=2, leading to a triplet) and the C3 Hs (2H, n=2, leading to a triplet as well). So the C2 H would be a triplet of triplets, or a quintet, but in the NMR, it's a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the C2 H is only coupled to the C1 Hs, which would make it a triplet, but the given NMR shows a doublet of quadruplets.

Wait, maybe I should think about the coupling in the trans case.

In the trans double bond, the C1 and C2 Hs are on opposite sides. So the C2 H would be coupled to the two C1 Hs (J=16 Hz, trans), and perhaps the C3 Hs (J around 6 Hz, cis).

So the C2 H would have two couplings: J1=16 with C1 Hs (two of them) and J2=6 with C3 Hs (two of them). So it would be a doublet of doublets, or perhaps a triplet if J1 and J2 are similar, but with J1=16 and J2=6, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, the NMR shows a doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm. A doublet of quadruplets suggests coupling to two different sets of Hs, each with two Hs. So perhaps the C2 H is coupled to two Hs from C1 (J=16 Hz) and two Hs from C3 (J=6 Hz). So the splitting would be (n1=2, n2=2), leading to a doublet of quartets. But the integration is 1H, so that fits.

Then, the C1 Hs would be coupled to the C2 H (n=1, J=16 Hz), so their signal would be a doublet. But the C1 Hs are two Hs, so their integral would be 2H. But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is 1H, which doesn't fit. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C3 H. Wait, but the C3 Hs are adjacent to the OAc group. They would be deshielded, but not as much as vinylic Hs. So their chemical shift would be around 4 ppm or so, not 7.0.

Wait, 7.0 ppm is more typical of aromatic protons, but in this case, it's an alkenyl proton.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about another possibility.

If the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have a double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans.

In this structure, the vinylic Hs are on C2 and C3. Each would be coupled to each other (J=16 Hz) and also coupled to their adjacent Hs.

The C2 H would be coupled to:

- C1 Hs (two Hs, J around 6-7 Hz)

- C3 Hs (one H, J=16 Hz)

- C4 Hs (two Hs, J around 6-7 Hz)

Wait, but that would make the C2 H a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3 H is the one showing up at 7.0 ppm as a doublet.

Wait, but in this structure, there are two vinylic Hs (C2 and C3), each coupled to each other. So each would be a doublet.

But the NMR shows a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which could be one of them. The other vinylic H would be at another shift, perhaps.

The other signal at 5.5 (1H, dq) would be another proton, perhaps a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, another approach: let's count the number of signals.

The NMR has four signals: one at 7.0, one at 5.5, one at 2.1, and one at 1.6.

That suggests that the molecule has four unique proton environments.

If the structure is propenyl acetate, how many signals would we expect?

CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

C1: CH2 (two Hs, equivalent)

C2: CH (one H)

C3: CH2 (two Hs, adjacent to OAc)

So, for C1, the two Hs would be equivalent, so one signal.

C2: one H, another signal.

C3: two Hs, another signal.

OAc: three Hs, another signal.

That's four signals, which matches the NMR data. So that fits.

So the four signals are:

C3 CH2-OAc: 1.6 ppm (d, 3H)

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would be a CH3 group. But in propenyl, the end is CH2-OAc, which has two Hs. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is 3H, so a CH3 group. So perhaps the structure has a CH3 attached to a CH2, which is attached to a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl.

Wait, but earlier I thought butenyl would have more Hs, but let me check again.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

C1: CH2 (2 Hs)

C2: CH (1 H)

C3: CH2 (2 Hs)

C4: CH2-OAc (2 Hs)

So, the Hs:

C1: 2 Hs, possibly as a doublet due to coupling with C2 H.

C2: 1 H, coupled to C1 and C3 Hs.

C3: 2 Hs, coupled to C2 and C4 Hs.

C4: 2 Hs, coupled to C3 Hs.

OAc: 3 Hs.

So the NMR would have:

C1: 2H, possibly a doublet.

C2: 1H, perhaps a doublet of triplets.

C3: 2H, perhaps a triplet.

C4: 2H, perhaps a triplet.

OAc: 3H, singlet.

That's five signals, but the given NMR has four. So butenyl might not fit.

Wait, but perhaps the C3 and C4 Hs are equivalent, leading to a single signal. Alternatively, maybe some of the signals overlap.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. But that would have more Hs.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Let me return to the original NMR data.

The key points are:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16): this is a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton trans to it.

- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq): perhaps a proton adjacent to a double bond, coupled to two sets of Hs.

- 1.6 ppm (3H, d): a CH3 group attached to a CH2 which is adjacent to a double bond.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)OAc? No, that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another approach: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is adjacent to a double bond. So maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but then the 1.6 ppm would be from the terminal CH2 group, which would appear around 1-2 ppm as a triplet or something else.

Wait, but the 1.6 is a doublet, which suggests coupling to one H. So a CH3 group attached to a CH2 which is next to a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the CH2CH3 is at the end. No, that wouldn't give a CH3 group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. But that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the options and their possible NMR signals.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, cis.

In this case, the C2 H is coupled to the two C1 Hs (J=16 Hz) and the two C3 Hs (J=6 Hz).

So the C2 H would be a doublet of doublets, perhaps appearing as a quartet if the Js are similar, but with J=16 and J=6, it would be a doublet of quartets.

Wait, the 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) could be this C2 H.

The C1 Hs would be coupled to the C2 H (J=16), so each would be a doublet. But since they're two equivalent Hs, their signal would be a doublet (2H) at around 5.5 or lower.

But the NMR has a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which doesn't match that.

Hmm.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans.

Here, the C2 H is coupled to C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6).

So the C2 H would have two couplings, leading to a doublet of quartets, which matches the 5.5 ppm (dq).

The C1 Hs would be coupled to C2 H (J=16), so their signal would be a doublet (2H) integrating to 2H. But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is 1H, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the 7.0 ppm is the C3 H, but that's unlikely because the C3 Hs are adjacent to the OAc and would appear downfield but not as much as 7.0.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about the coupling for the C1 Hs.

If the C1 Hs are coupled to the C2 H (J=16), each would be a doublet. But since they are two Hs, the signal would be a doublet integrating to 2H. But in the given NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a 1H doublet. So that doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is not propenyl, but butenyl.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, that's butenyl with double bond between C1 and C2.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, trans.

In this case, the vinylic Hs are on C2 and C3.

The C2 H would be coupled to C1 (two Hs, J=6) and C3 (one H, J=16). So the C2 H would be a triplet of triplets, perhaps appearing as a quartet.

The C3 H would be coupled to C2 (J=16) and C4 (two Hs, J=6), so it would also be a triplet of triplets.

The C4 Hs would be a triplet due to coupling with C3 H.

But this would produce more signals than the given NMR, which has four.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is the methyl group (CH3) attached to the CH2 next to the double bond.

So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

In cis-propenyl acetate, the C2 H would be coupled to C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6). So the C2 H would be a doublet of quartets, matching the 5.5 ppm (dq).

The C1 Hs would be coupled to C2 H (J=16), giving a doublet for 2H.

The C3 Hs would be coupled to C2 H (J=6), giving a triplet for 2H.

And the OAc would be 3H, singlet.

But the given NMR has a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is from the C3 Hs, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the possible answer based on the data.

The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic Hs. So the molecule must have a trans double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) is a proton that's coupled to two different sets of Hs, perhaps from adjacent carbons.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2 which is next to a double bond.

Putting it all together, the structure likely has a trans double bond, a CH3 group attached to a CH2 next to the double bond, and the vinylic Hs showing the 7.0 and 5.5 ppm signals.

The only option with a trans double bond is option B (Trans-propenyl acetate) and option D (Trans-butenyl acetate).

Wait, but earlier I thought that butenyl would have more Hs than accounted for in the NMR. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Wait, the J=16 Hz is for trans coupling, so the correct option would have a trans double bond. So that would be option B or D.

But since the options for propenyl are B and C, and for butenyl are A and D.

In the given NMR, the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2 next to a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the options don't include that, so perhaps I should reevaluate.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH2 which is next to a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl. Then, the CH2CH2-OAc would have the CH2 next to the double bond.

But earlier I thought butenyl would have more Hs, but perhaps I made a mistake in the count.

Wait, let me recount for butenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc):

C1: CH2 (2 Hs)

C2: CH (1 H)

C3: CH2 (2 Hs)

C4: CH2-OAc (2 Hs)

OAc: 3 Hs.

Total Hs: 2+1+2+2+3 =10. But the NMR shows 8 Hs. So that's a problem.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with a methyl group attached elsewhere. But that's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

In that case, the C2 H would be coupled to C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6), leading to a doublet of quartets (5.5 ppm). The C1 Hs would be a doublet at around 5 ppm, but the NMR shows 7.0 ppm as a doublet.

Wait, this isn't fitting.

Another angle: the OAc group is at 2.1 ppm (s), which is correct.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH2 next to a double bond. So the structure might have a CH2-CH2-CH3 group where the CH2 is next to the double bond.

So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

In that case, the C2 H is coupled to C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6), leading to a dq at 5.5 ppm. The C1 Hs would be a doublet around 5 ppm, but the NMR shows 7.0 ppm as a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the coupling.

In the case of a trans double bond, the two vinylic Hs are on opposite sides, so they would be coupled with a large J. So the 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) would be one of the vinylic Hs, and the other would be another H, perhaps in the same or different environment.

But in propenyl acetate, there are only two vinylic Hs: the two on C1 (which are equivalent) and one on C2. So perhaps the 7.0 ppm is not a vinylic H, but something else.

Wait, perhaps the structure is not propenyl but butenyl, with the double bond in a position that allows a CH3 group to be attached.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH2 which is adjacent to a double bond. So the structure could be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl. But earlier, I thought butenyl has more Hs than the NMR indicates.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the count.

In CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc:

C1: CH2 (2 Hs)

C2: CH (1 H)

C3: CH2 (2 Hs)

C4: CH2-OAc (2 Hs)

OAc: 3 Hs.

Total Hs: 2+1+2+2+3=10. But the NMR has only 8 Hs, so this can't be right.

So perhaps the structure isn't butenyl. So back to propenyl.

In propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The C2 H would be coupled to the C1 Hs and C3 Hs.

The C1 Hs are two Hs, and the C3 Hs are two Hs. So the C2 H would be a doublet of quartets.

The C1 Hs would be a doublet (coupled to C2 H), and the C3 Hs would be a triplet (coupled to C2 H and perhaps others).

But the NMR has a 7.0 ppm (1H, d) which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Another possibility: the 7.0 ppm is not a vinylic H but an aromatic H, but the question states it's an organic compound, and the options don't include aromatic groups.

Wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is a vinylic H in a butenyl structure where the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents are arranged so that one H is isolated.

But I'm not making progress here. Let me try to think of the correct answer based on the NMR data.

The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) suggests a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton trans, so the double bond is trans.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) suggests a CH3 attached to a CH2 adjacent to a double bond.

The 5.5 ppm (1H, dq) suggests a proton coupled to two different sets.

Putting this together, the structure likely has a trans double bond, a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2, which is next to the double bond.

Which option fits this?

Looking at the options:

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans.

In this case, the C2 H is the vinylic H, coupled to C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6). The C2 H would be a doublet of quartets (5.5 ppm).

The C1 Hs would be a doublet (coupled to C2 H), but the NMR has a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is not part of the propenyl group, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming the structure. Let me think of another approach.

The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group attached to a CH2, which is next to a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl and would have more Hs.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)OAc, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

In this case, the C2 H would be coupled to C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6), leading to a doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm.

The C1 Hs would be a doublet (coupled to C2 H), but the NMR shows a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which doesn't fit.

I think I'm going in circles here. Based on the J=16 Hz, which indicates a trans coupling, the correct structure must have a trans double bond. Among the options, that's options B and D.

But butenyl would have more Hs, which doesn't fit the NMR. So perhaps the correct option is B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but earlier I thought that in propenyl, the Hs wouldn't fit, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is the C2 H in the trans-propenyl structure. Wait, but the C2 H would be coupled to the C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6), leading to a doublet of quartets at 5.5, which matches the 5.5 ppm signal.

The C1 Hs would then be a doublet at around 5.0 ppm, but the NMR shows 7.0 ppm as a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the shifts. Maybe the C2 H is at 7.0 ppm and the C1 Hs are at 5.5. But that doesn't make sense because C2 is more deshielded and would be downfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the C1 Hs are at 7.0 ppm as a doublet, and the C2 H is at 5.5 as a dq.

But in that case, the C1 Hs would be coupled to the C2 H, giving a doublet for 2H. But the NMR shows 7.0 ppm as 1H, which doesn't fit.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think about what each option's NMR would look like.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, cis.

The C2 H is coupled to C1 Hs (J=16) and C3 Hs (J=6).

So the C2 H would be a doublet of quartets at around 5.5 ppm.

The C1 Hs would be a doublet (J=16) at around 5.0 ppm.

The C3 Hs would be a triplet (J=6) at around 4.5 ppm.

The OAc would be at 2.1 ppm.

But the NMR has a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which doesn't fit.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Same as above, but the J for C2 and C1 is 16 Hz.

So the C2 H would be a doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm.

C1 Hs: doublet at 5.0 ppm.

No 7.0 ppm signal, which doesn't match.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc with the double bond elsewhere. But I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. The 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16) suggests a trans coupling, so the correct structure has a trans double bond. Among the options, that leaves B and D. But butenyl would have more Hs, so perhaps the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Wait, no, because the J=16 suggests trans.

Wait, I'm really confused now. Based on the J value, the correct answer must have a trans double bond, so options B or D.

But considering the NMR data and the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another approach: the 7.0 ppm is a vinylic H, coupled to another vinylic H with J=16 Hz. So the two vinylic Hs are trans to each other, which would be the case in a trans double bond.

So the structure must have a trans double bond, making options B and D possible.

But butenyl would have more Hs. So perhaps the correct answer is option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

In that case, the C2 H would be a doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm, and the C1 Hs would be a doublet at around 5.0 ppm. But the NMR shows a 7.0 ppm (1H, d), which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the coupling. Maybe the C2 H is coupled to the C1 Hs and the OAc group's Hs. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is from a different part of the molecule, but all the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates.

In the end, I'm going to go with option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. But I'm not fully confident.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are four different propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. The NMR data provided are:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **2.1 ppm (3H, s):** This is a singlet, characteristic of the acetyl group (-COCH3) in an acetate ester.  
2. **1.6 ppm (3H, d):** This is a doublet, likely corresponding to a methyl group (CH3) attached to a CH2 group adjacent to a double bond.  
3. **5.5 ppm (1H, dq):** This is a doublet of quadruplets, suggesting a proton coupled to two different sets of protons, likely a vinylic proton adjacent to a double bond.  
4. **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz):** This is a doublet with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), indicative of a trans coupling between two vinylic protons on a double bond.

### Structural Considerations:
- The compound is an ester, with the general formula **R-O-CO-CH3**, where R is either a propenyl or butenyl group.  
- The **J = 16 Hz** in the 7.0 ppm signal confirms a **trans double bond**, as trans couplings typically exhibit larger J values compared to cis couplings.  
- The **1.6 ppm (3H, d)** suggests a CH3 group attached to a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.  
- The **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)** corresponds to a vinylic proton coupled to two distinct sets of protons, likely the CH2 group and another vinylic proton.

### Evaluation of Options:
1. **Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate**  
   - A cis double bond would result in smaller coupling constants (J < 16 Hz), inconsistent with the 7.0 ppm signal.  
   - This option is eliminated.

2. **Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate**  
   - The structure is **CH2=CHCH2-OAc** with a trans double bond.  
   - The C2 vinylic proton would be coupled to the two C1 protons (J = 16 Hz) and the two C3 protons (J ≈ 6 Hz), resulting in a doublet of quartets at ~5.5 ppm.  
   - The C1 protons would appear as a doublet (~5.0 ppm), but the NMR data show a single proton at 7.0 ppm, which does not match.  
   - This option is unlikely.

3. **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate**  
   - The structure is **CH2=CHCH2-OAc** with a cis double bond.  
   - The coupling constants would still result in similar splitting patterns as in the trans case, with the C2 proton appearing as a doublet of quartets at ~5.5 ppm.  
   - The C1 protons would still appear as a doublet (~5.0 ppm), which again does not match the 7.0 ppm signal.  
   - This option is also unlikely.

4. **Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate**  
   - The structure is **CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc** with a trans double bond.  
   - This structure would have more hydrogens (10 Hs) than the NMR data indicate (8 Hs), making it inconsistent with the given data.  
   - This option is eliminated.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data suggest a compound with a trans double bond, a CH3 group adjacent to a CH2 group, and a vinylic proton coupled to two distinct sets of protons. However, none of the options perfectly match the data. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate** is the most plausible choice, despite some inconsistencies in the splitting patterns.

ANSWER: C
