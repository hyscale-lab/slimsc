Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem says: We dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate the resulting solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25 °C. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The Ka of acetic acid is 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, okay. So, first, I think I need to figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid. Then, when we titrate it with NaOH, I have to find the pH at 25% of the way to the equivalence point and at the point where all the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Let me break this down step by step.

First, the initial dilution. We have 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. 

So the initial concentration after dilution can be found using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = (1) /40 *0.05? Wait, let me compute that correctly.

0.05 M *20 cm³ = 1 mmol (since 1 M = 1 mmol/cm³). Then, 1 mmol in 40 cm³ gives 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, 1 mmol in 40 cm³ is 0.025 M? Because 1/40 is 0.025. Yes, that's right. So the concentration after dilution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but wait. Wait, 20 cm³ of 0.05 M is 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol. Because M is moles
