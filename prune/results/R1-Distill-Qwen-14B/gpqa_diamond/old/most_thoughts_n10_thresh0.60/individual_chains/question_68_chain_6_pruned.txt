Okay, so I have this physics problem about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the setup: There's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma multiplied by Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s moment.

Wait, I remember that the magnetic moment mu interacts with the magnetic field, right? So the energy levels depend on the magnetic field direction. When the field is along Z, the particle's spin aligns with it. But when the field changes direction, the system's state might change, leading to oscillations.

So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's magnetic moment is aligned with B, so the energy is E = -mu·B. Since mu is gamma Sz, and Sz is the spin in the z-direction. For a spin-1/2 particle, Sz can be ± ħ/2. But when the field is along Z, the system is in an eigenstate of Sz.

Then, the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, if the magnetic field is off, what happens? The Hamiltonian in the absence of a magnetic field is zero, right? So the system's state doesn't change. But then another magnetic field is turned on along +Y. So now the Hamiltonian isn't zero anymore.

Wait, no. Wait, the particle's moment is mu = gamma S. So the Hamiltonian when a magnetic field is applied is H = -mu·B. So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B (S·Y), where Y is the unit vector in y-direction.

Hmm, but wait, spin operators: S·Y would involve the Sx and Sy components. Let me think about the spin matrices. The spin operator S for a spin-1/2 particle is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, Sx is (ħ/2) sigma_x, Sy is (ħ/2) sigma_y, Sz is (ħ/2) sigma_z.

So the Hamiltonian H is proportional to S·B. When B is along Y, H = -gamma B (S·Y) = -gamma B ( (ħ/2)(sigma_x * 0 + sigma_y *1 + sigma_z *0) )? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the dot product S·Y would have components of Sx and Sy because Y is in the y-direction. Wait, no, Y is a unit vector pointing along y, so the dot product is Sy * (unit vector in y) times B, but I think I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the direction of B is Y. So the magnetic field vector is B in the Y direction, so the vector is (0, B, 0). So the magnetic dipole moment is mu = gamma S, so the interaction energy is H = -mu · B = -gamma (Sx * 0 + Sy * B + Sz * 0) ) = -gamma B Sy.

Wait, more accurately, the interaction energy is H = - mu · B. Since mu is a
