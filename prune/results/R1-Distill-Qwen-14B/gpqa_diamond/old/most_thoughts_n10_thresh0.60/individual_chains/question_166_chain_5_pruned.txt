Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model's extension and specifically about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂ through radiative corrections. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully.

First, let me try to understand the given Lagrangian. The Lagrangian includes terms like i\bar{N}_R γ^μ ∂μ N_R, which looks like a kinetic term for a right-handed neutrino. Then there's (1/2)(∂μ φ)^2, which is the kinetic term for the scalar φ. The term |D^μ S|² suggests that S is a scalar doublet with some gauge covariant derivative, so it's probably involved in electroweak symmetry breaking. 

The term (-y_i / 2) φ \bar{N}_{iR}^c N_{iR}^c seems like a Yukawa coupling where the singlet φ is coupling to the right-handed neutrinos. Wait, the right-handed neutrinos are in the conjugate representation? Or maybe it's just a notation thing. Also, the term -g_{iα} \bar{N}_{iR} L_α S would mean that the N's are interacting with the leptons L and the scalar S. And then there's a potential V(φ, S, H), which probably includes the terms for spontaneous symmetry breaking.

The fields given are singlet fermions N_iR with quantum numbers (1,1,0), which makes sense since they're right-handed neutrinos. The scalar S is a doublet (1,2,1), so it's an SU(2) doublet, and φ is a singlet scalar (1,1,0). 

The vacuum expectation value (VEV) is given as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², where ⟨φ⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, I'm a bit confused. The field φ is getting a VEV, but the h is another field? Or maybe h is a component of S or another scalar. Oh wait, S is a doublet, so maybe h is the Higgs field. Wait, in the Standard Model, the Higgs is a doublet. But here S is another doublet. Or perhaps φ is a singlet that gets a VEV along with the Higgs field. Hmm, perhaps the potential V(φ, S, H) includes the Higgs field H. Not entirely sure, but let's proceed.

The question is about finding the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H₂. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise when a symmetry is broken, but the Goldstone is eaten by a gauge boson, making it a massive vector boson. Alternatively, in models where the symmetry breaking is more complex, some Goldstone modes might remain massless unless there's explicit symmetry breaking.

Wait, but the Higgs mechanism typically gives masses to the W and Z bosons. If there's an extra scalar sector, maybe there's
