Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. The question is about determining which partial wave is not permitted based on Pauli statistics and conservation laws.

First, let me understand the given information. The system is in a 1S0 state, which I know is a notation for the total spin (S), orbital angular momentum (L), and total angular momentum (J). The term 1S0 suggests that the spin multiplicity is 1 (so S=0, since 2S+1=1), L is S which is orbital angular momentum state, and J equals 0. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the term is written as (2S+1)L^J. So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0 (since S is the spectroscopic notation, like S=0 is S state, which is L=0), and J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The system emits a particle X which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. The problem says that Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about this. Wait, T is the isospin of the NN system, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum, but I'm not entirely sure how this equation applies. I think it's a way to relate the quantum numbers under Pauli's exclusion principle. So, T, S, L must satisfy T = S + L +1 mod 2.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So T=0. So using the equation T = S + L +1 mod 2, substituting T=0, we get 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L +1 must be even, which implies S + L is 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

Now, the problem gives options where each option is a transition from the initial 1S0 state to a different state (like 7D1, 3S1, etc.) plus a particle X. The options are labeled A to D, each with a different final state and X emitted.

We need to find which partial wave (the L of X) is not allowed. So for each option, I need to check whether the transition is allowed based on angular momentum conservation and parity conservation.

Let me break down each part. For each option:

1. Determine the initial and final angular momenta.
2. Determine whether the orbital angular momentum (L) of the emitted particle X is such that the transition is allowed.
3. Check parity conservation.

Wait, but the initial state is 1S0: so J_initial is 0. The final NN state has some J_final, and the emitted particle X has its own angular momentum l. The total angular momentum must be conserved, so the initial J_initial (0) must equal the vector sum of the final J_final and the angular momentum of X. But since J_initial is zero, the final J_final and X's angular momentum must sum to
