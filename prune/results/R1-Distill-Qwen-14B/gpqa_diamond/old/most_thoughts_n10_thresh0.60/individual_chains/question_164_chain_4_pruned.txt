Okay, I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, let's see what's given. So there are two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. Wait, the periods are the time between two primary eclipses. So I guess that's the orbital period of the binary system. 

Then, the spectroscopic observations give radial velocity (RV) amplitudes. For system_1, the stars have amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. And for system_2, it's 15 and 10 km/s. The question is about how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. I remember that the mass of a binary system is the sum of the masses of the two stars.

Wait, but how do the radial velocities relate to the masses? Oh right, in binary systems, the stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so a smaller velocity amplitude. Because the less massive star has to move more to keep the system balanced. So the mass ratio (q) is the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. And the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to their masses. So if star A has mass M and velocity v, and star B has mass m and velocity v', then M/m = v'/v.

Right, so the sum of the velocities (v1 + v2) would be related to some other factors. But when calculating the mass function, I think that's where the velocities come into play with the orbital period and the masses.

Wait, the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is given by:

f(M) = (v^3 * P) / (2Ï€ G)

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I think the formula uses the sum of the velocities squared? Or maybe each velocity separately. Let me think again.

Each star's velocity amplitude is related to the mass of the other star. So, for system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So the mass ratio q = m1 / M1 = v2 / v1. Wait, wait. Let me clarify: M is the mass of the primary (the more massive star), m the secondary. Then M/m = v_secondary / v_primary. Because the more massive star moves slower.

So in system_
