Alright, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Okay, so the question is about finding the expectation value of a given operator. Hmm, okay, let's start by understanding what's given.

The particle is a spin-half, so I know it has spin states like up and down. The state is a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. Right, so σz has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for up and down respectively.

The operator we're supposed to find the expectation value of is 10σz +5σx. Oh wait, so it's a combination of the z and x components of the Pauli matrices.

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is given by ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator and |ψ⟩ is the state vector. So I need to compute this expectation for each part of the operator.

Let me break it down. The operator is 10σz +5σx. I can split the expectation into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

So I'll calculate each expectation separately and then combine them.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, that should simplify things. The expectation value of σz for a state can be found by taking the coefficients squared and multiplying by their respective eigenvalues.

In the given state, the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). Let's compute that.

(0.5)^2 is 0.25. (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3)/4 = 0.75. So 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Next, ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is the Pauli x matrix. I think σx has eigenstates that are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but wait, in this case, the state isn't necessarily an eigenstate of σx. So I'll have to compute it directly.

The Pauli x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|. To compute ⟨σx⟩ for the given state, let me write it out.

The state |ψ⟩ is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the bra vector is ⟨ψ| = 0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|.

So, ⟨ψ|σx |ψ⟩ is:

[0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓|] σx [0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ ]

I know that σx acting on |↑⟩ gives |↓⟩, and σx acting on |↓⟩ gives |↑⟩.

So let me expand this:

= 0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩
+ (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.

Wait, but σx|↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ is ⟨↑|↓⟩ which is zero.

Similarly, σx|↓⟩ is |↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩ is ⟨↓|↑⟩, which is zero.

So the terms where the same basis states are involved (like ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ and ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩) are zero.

So we're left with the cross terms:

0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) * ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 * ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩.

Wait, but σx is Hermitian, so ⟨a|σx|b⟩ is the complex conjugate of ⟨b|σx|a⟩. Since our coefficients are real, this should make the terms real.

⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ is ⟨↑|↓⟩ multiplied by the matrix element. Let me think. The matrix element of σx is
