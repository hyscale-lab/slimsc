Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about relativistic collisions and photon emission. But let's take it step by step. 

The problem says that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions.

Hmm. So first, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they convert their mass into energy, usually emitting photons. Since they're moving towards each other, their momenta might affect the direction of the photons.

Wait, but in this case, both photons have the same energy. So they must have symmetric properties relative to some axis. But the positron and electron have different Lorentz factors, so their energies and momenta might not be the same. 

Wait, Lorentz factor gamma is given for each. For an electron, gamma is 4, and for a positron, it's 2. Wait, but positrons have the same mass as electrons, right? So the positron here has a lower gamma, so maybe lower energy? 

Wait, the mass of the electron (and positron) is the same, so the total energy would be gamma * m c².
