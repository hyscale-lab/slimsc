Okay, so I've got this question about detecting exoplanets using the transit method. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but different orbital periods. Planet_1 has a shorter period, three times shorter than Planet_2. So Planet_1 orbits closer to its star. Also, both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies the calculations.

The host stars: Planet_1's star is twice as massive as Planet_2's. But both stars have the same radius. Wait, why would that be? If the host stars have the same radius despite different masses, maybe Planet_2's host is a subgiant or something, but I don't think that affects the transit probability directly.

Transit probability — I think the formula for the probability is (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by something else, or maybe it's related to the orbital inclination. Wait, the transit probability (P) is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (2R_s)) / (a * (1 - e²)^0.5), but since e is zero here, it's just (R_p/R_s)^2 * (1/(2a) )^{-1}? Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, I think the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the ratio of the star's radius to the orbital distance. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. The probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by the impact parameter term, which depends on the alignment. Oh, but the maximum probability occurs when the orbital plane is edge-on, which is when the planet transits. But the probability is the chance that the orbital inclination is such that the planet transits.

Alternatively, the probability is given by (R_p + R_s) / a, where a is the semi-major axis, but no, wait. Wait, the probability is the ratio of the size of the star's disk (as seen from Earth) to the planet's orbital distance. Wait, no, perhaps the probability P is (R_s / a) * ( (R_p) /
