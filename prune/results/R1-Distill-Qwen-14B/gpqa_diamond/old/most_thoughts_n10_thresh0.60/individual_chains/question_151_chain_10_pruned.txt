Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, but I'm a bit new to this. Let me read the question again carefully.

The system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's a 3x1 vector. The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. The matrix P has three rows. The first row is (0, 1/√2, 0), the second row is (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), and the third row is (0, 1/√2, 0). 

The question is about finding the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. So I'm thinking, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable represented by an operator, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that operator. The probabilities are calculated from the eigenvectors corresponding to those eigenvalues.

Wait, but what's the process here? I remember that the observable's eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes. So I need to find the eigenvalues of matrix P, right? Because the measurement outcome 0 must be one of P's eigenvalues.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if P is a projection matrix or something else. Wait, looking at P, let me write it down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Hmm, each element is 0 except where specified. Let me think about the structure. The diagonal elements of P are all zero. The off-diagonal elements in first row are (0, 1/√2, 0); same for the third row. The second row has (1/√2, 0, 1/√2). Maybe P is a symmetric matrix, which is good because Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, and symmetric matrices (real) are a subset of that.

Wait, but P might not be Hermitian. Because the elements are real and symmetric, so yes, it's symmetric. So that's good because observables are Hermitian, so P is Hermitian.

So the next step is to find the eigenvalues of P. Let me think about how to find the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

Matrix P - λ I would be:

[
-λ, 1/√2, 0,
1/√2, -λ, 1/√2,
0, 1/√2, -λ
]

Calculating the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. Hmm, the determinant equation is a bit tedious, but maybe I can find a pattern or symmetry. Alternatively, perhaps P has some symmetry that can help me find the eigenvalues without too much calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can notice that P is a circulant matrix or something similar. Wait, no, because the elements don't follow the circulant pattern. Let's think about the structure.

Looking at the matrix, it's symmetric and seems to have a particular pattern. Each row has non-zero elements only in certain positions. Let me think about the eigenvectors. Maybe there's a vector that's equally distributed, like (1,1,1), or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix can be broken down. Let me consider the sum of all the rows. The first row sums to 1/√2, the second to (1/√2 + 1/√2) = 2/√2, and the third to 1/√2. Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Wait, maybe the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. Because the matrix P seems to have a structure where perhaps the sum of each row is 1 or something. Wait, no, but maybe the matrix has eigenvalues that are 0, 1, and -1. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps the trace of the matrix is the sum of the eigenvalues. The trace of P is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.

Let me think about possible eigenvalues. Suppose λ is 1: then P -
