Okay, so I have this problem about the hydrogen atom transitions, and I need to figure it out. Let me think... The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different transition paths and probabilities.

Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels, and these transitions are governed by selection rules. Right, the dipole transition selection rules. For the principal quantum number n, the change Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but for dipole transitions, the typical allowed transitions are Δn = ±1, but sometimes higher changes are possible, though less probable. Wait, no, wait, I think I got that mixed up. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, in dipole transitions, the selection rule for n is that Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but the other quantum numbers have stricter rules.

Wait, no, wait a second. The selection rules for dipole transitions are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, Δn = any integer, but the more the change in n, the lower the probability. So, for example, from n=3, l=0, m=0, possible transitions would have l' = 1, because l can change by ±1. So the first transition would go from l=0 to l=1. And the next transition would have to go from l=1 to l=0 or 2? Wait, but in this case, the final state is l=0. So the initial state is |3,0,0>, and it's decaying to |1,0,0>, which is l=0. So the first transition must go from l=0 to l=1, because that's the only allowed change (since from 0, you can only go to 1, since you can't have negative l). So the first step is to go from l=0 to l=1.

Now, the possible n values for the intermediate state. Since the initial state is n=3, the first transition could go to n=2 or n=4, but n=4 is higher, and the energy of the final state is lower (n=1), so probably going down. So the first transition would be from n=3 to n=2, because that's the next lower level. So the intermediate state is |2,1,m>, with m being -1, 0, +1.

Wait, but the decay is via two dipole transitions. So from 3,0,0 to something, then to 1,0,0. So first transition: 3,0,0 → 2,1,m. Then, from 2,1,m → 1,0,0.

Wait, but for the second transition: the initial state is 2,1,m and final is 1,0,0. So, what are the selection rules for each step.

First step: l goes from 0 to 1. So that's allowed. n goes from 3 to 2, which is allowed (Δn = -1). m goes from
