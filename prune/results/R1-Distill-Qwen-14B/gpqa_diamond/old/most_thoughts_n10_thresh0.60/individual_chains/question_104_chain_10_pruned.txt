Okay, so I have this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. I'm a bit rusty on my astrophysics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass, both similar to the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. They detected the planets using the RV method.

The RV method detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The shift here is given in milliangstroms. So for planet #1, the shift is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7.

The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Hmm. I remember that the RV method's signal depends on the mass of the planet and its orbital period. Wait, but more specifically, the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital distance. Or maybe it's the orbital period?

I think the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) ) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (P * (1 - e²)^(3/2) ) ) )

But wait, since the planets are Neptune-like and the stars are Sun-like, M_planet << M_star. So M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, which is solar mass. So we can approximate that term as M_star.

But e is zero because the orbits are circular, so we can ignore that.

So K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_s^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) )

Wait, wait, let me get the formula right. I think the formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (sin i) / ( (P * (1 - e²) )^(1/2) )

But since M_p << M_s, (M_s + M_p) ≈ M_s, and sin i is roughly 1, assuming i is 90 degrees (edge-on). Also, e=0, so the denominator becomes P^(1/2).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about it again. Another approach: the RV method measures the star's velocity, which is related to the planet's orbital period and the mass. But I'm trying to recall the exact relationship.

Alternatively, the formula for the semi-amplitude K is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_s) ) )^(1/3) ] * (2π / P )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i )

Wait, maybe I should look up the correct formula. Alternatively, since I can't do that right now, I'll try to derive it.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_s + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P )^(1/3)
