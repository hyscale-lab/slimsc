Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cosmology, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The question is about a quasar observed in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. There's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Hmm, I remember something about the Lyman-alpha forest and the Lyman-alpha emission line. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is emitted when an electron drops from the second energy level to the first in hydrogen, right? And that emission is at about 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet range. But in the observed spectrum, the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared. Oh wait, that's way longer than the rest wavelength. So that must mean there's a redshift involved.

Wait, how does redshift work? The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the rest wavelength λ_rest by 1 + z = λ_obs / λ_rest. So here, λ_rest for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. Observed at 790 nm. Let me calculate the redshift z.

z = (λ_obs / λ_rest) - 1 = (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me compute that. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately 6.5. So 6.5 minus 1 is z=5.5. So the quasar is at a redshift of about 5.5.

Wait, but why is the flux dropping below 790 nm? Oh, because at shorter wavelengths than the peak, the flux decreases. I think that's because of the Lyman limit or something. The Lyman limit is at about 91 nm, and any photons from the quasar that have wavelengths shorter than that are absorbed by the intergalactic medium, like the IGM. So if the quasar's rest frame has emission lines at wavelengths below the Lyman limit, they would be absorbed. So in our observed frame, the Lyman-alpha line is at 790 nm, which is the peak. So for higher energy photons (shorter wavelengths in the quasar's frame) would be absorbed, leading to a drop in flux below that peak. That makes sense.

So the quasar's rest frame Lyman-alpha is at 121.6 nm, observed at 790 nm. So z is about 5.5.

Now the question is about the comoving distance of this quasar. The options are around 6-9 Gpc. So I need to compute the comoving distance for a redshift of z=5.5 under the Lambda-CDM model with the given parameters.

The parameters given are: H0 =70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy density Omega_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Omega_k=0).

The comoving distance is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda). Wait, actually, E(z) is sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda + Omega_k*(1+z)^2). But since Omega_k is zero here (because the universe is flat), E(z)=sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z)^3 + Omega_lambda).

So, the comoving distance D_c is (c/H0) multiplied by the integral from 0 to z of dz' / E(z').

Wait, but calculating this integral exactly requires numerical methods because it's not an analytically solvable integral except in specific cases. So for a given z, like 5.5, what is D_c?

I think I remember that for high redshifts, when matter dominates (z much larger than the dark energy effect), the comoving distance scales approximately with (1+z)^{1/2} or something like that. Wait, for matter-dominated universe (Omega_m=1), the comoving distance is proportional to (1+z)^{1/2} times the age of the universe. But in our case, dark energy is significant, so the expansion isn't purely matter dominated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate. But maybe I should recall the formula or look for a standard value.

Wait, I think that for a flat universe with Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_lambda=0.7, the comoving distance at a redshift z can be found using some standard look-up tables or approximate formula.

Alternatively, I can think about the age of the universe at z=5.5 and then use the relation for comoving distance in a matter-dominated universe, but with dark energy complicating things.

Wait, another approach: the comoving distance can be calculated using the integral:

D_c = (c / H0) * ∫(from 0 to z) [1 / sqrt(Omega_m*(1+z')^3 + Omega_lambda)] dz'

So, for z=5.5, let me try to estimate this integral.

But without computation, it's a bit tough, but perhaps I can use an approximate formula or remember some standard values.

Wait, I think the approximate comoving distance for high redshifts (z >> 1) in a flat universe dominated by dark energy (like ours) can be found using certain approximations.

Wait, I might remember that at z=1, the comoving distance is about 2 billion light-years (but wait, in Gpc units, 1 Gpc is about 3.26 billion light-years), so D_c for z=1 is about 1.6 Gpc? Wait, no, wait, I might be getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator or a standard table. But since I can't do that right now, I'll have to think about how to approach this.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that
