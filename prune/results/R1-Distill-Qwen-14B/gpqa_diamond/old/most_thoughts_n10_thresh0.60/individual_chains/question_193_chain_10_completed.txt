Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me see if I can work through it step by step.

The question says that the number of stars in a specific region varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller. The formula I think is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), but wait, I should check that. Oh yeah, plx (in arcseconds) is 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So distance r is roughly 1/plx. 

The problem is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So I think I need to find the relationship between the number of stars and r. 

The number of stars (N) varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/r, substituting that in gives N proportional to 1/( (1/r) )^5. Let me calculate that. 

So plx is 1/r, so plx^5 is (1/r)^5 = 1/r^5. Therefore, 1/plx^5 is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. 

Wait, but wait a second. Because parallax decreases as distance increases, but how does the number of stars depend on it? If the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r, then replacing plx would give N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of the distance. 

But wait, the question is about how the number changes with distance per unit range. Oh, right, it's the rate of change. So I think, the number of stars per unit distance (like per parsec or something). So perhaps we need to find dN/dr.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. N is proportional to 1/plx^5, and plx is 1/r. So N = k * (r^5), where k is some constant. So as r increases, N increases as r^5. But wait, the question is about the change per unit distance. So if N is proportional to r^5, then the rate of change of N with respect to r, dN/dr, would be proportional to r^4? Because the derivative of r^5 is 5r^4. But the options don't have 5r^4; they have options like r^3, etc. Hmm, but maybe the question is just about the dependence, not the exact power, so perhaps the answer is r^5.

Wait, wait, perhaps the question is asking not about the derivative but about the change in number as you move a unit distance. Oh, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: How does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)? So per unit r. So I think they're referring to the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, but the initial statement says the number varies as 1/plx^5, which would be the total number in the region. So maybe the question is about the number density, the number per unit volume. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a certain volume. Let me think in terms of volume. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr^3. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, but the parallax is related to distance. So when you look at a region, the number of stars you see depends on how many are within a certain distance range. So if N ∝ 1/plx^5, and plx = 1/r, then N ∝ r^5. So the number of stars increases rapidly with distance. But wait, that doesn't make sense because stars are not distributed in such a way that their number increases with r^5. Oh wait, but this is a specific scenario given in the question, so we just follow the math.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr. The number of stars in that shell would be the total number up to distance r+dr minus the number up to r. So if N ∝ r^5, then the number of stars in the shell would be dN = 5 r^4 dr. So the number per unit distance (dr) is proportional to r^4. But looking at the options, option C is r^4, option B is r^5. Hmm.

Wait, but the initial setup says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So if you have a certain region, maybe it's the number of stars within a certain distance. So for a given region, as r increases, the number of stars increases as r^5. But the question is, how does the number change with distance (per unit range). So perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance, which would be dN/dr, which is 5 r^4. So the number of stars increases by r^4 per unit distance. So the correct option would be C) ~ r^4.

Wait, but let me check again. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k (1/plx)^5 = k (r)^5. So N is proportional to r^5. So the number of stars increases with the fifth power of r. But that's the total number within distance r. So the number per unit distance would be the derivative, which is 5 r^4. So the number of stars per unit distance (i.e., the density) would be proportional to r^4. So the answer should be C, r^4.

Wait, but wait another thought. If N is the number of stars in the region, perhaps the region is a volume, like a sphere. So when you look at stars, the number you can see up to a certain distance depends on the volume. But in this case, the problem says it's varying as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number of stars in a certain direction is being considered, not a volume. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the surface density or something else. But given the math, I think the correct approach is to substitute plx=1/r into the equation and find the dependence on r. So N ∝ r^5, and the change in N with r is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C) ~ r^4.


The question states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( r \)), we have \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{r} \). Substituting this into the equation, we find:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{r}\right)^5} = r^5
\]

This shows that the total number of stars (\( N \)) increases with distance (\( r \)) as \( r^5 \). However, the question specifically asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), which corresponds to the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Differentiating \( N \propto r^5 \), we get:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto 5r^4
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( r^4 \). Among the given options, the closest match is \( r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.

Answer: C
