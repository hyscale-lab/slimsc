Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator, and I need to find its eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. I remember that σ is the Pauli vector, which consists of the Pauli spin matrices. Each component of σ is σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Oh, right, and n is a unit vector, so it's pointing in some direction. ε is an energy constant.

Wait, eigenvalues of H. So I'm thinking, since H is a 2x2 matrix (because it's the sum of Pauli matrices multiplied by components), it should have two eigenvalues. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1, right? But here it's the dot product with n, which complicates things a bit.

Let me think about the structure of H. The operator σ · n is the same as n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1.

Now, each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a linear combination like this, what's the overall effect? Oh, I think the eigenvalues of σ · n would just be ±1 multiplied by the magnitude of the vector in the direction of n. But wait, the magnitude here is 1 because n is a unit vector. So the eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1.

So then the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by those. So H has eigenvalues ±ε. Wait, because H = ε (σ · n), so if the eigenvalues of (σ · n) are ±1, then H's eigenvalues are ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε and -ε. That seems to fit. But wait, let me make sure. Another way to think about it: the trace of H. The trace of σ · n would be the sum of its eigenvalues. But each σ_i has trace zero because Tr(σ_x) = 0, same for σ_y and σ_z. So Tr(σ · n)=0.

Wait, that's correct. So the sum of eigenvalues for σ · n is zero, which means the eigenvalues are +1 and
