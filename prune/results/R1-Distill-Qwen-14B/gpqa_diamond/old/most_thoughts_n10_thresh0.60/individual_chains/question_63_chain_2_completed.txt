Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is asking about the momentum of a photon that needs to be absorbed for the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. The molecule is in its fundamental state initially. So, I need to figure out what the initial and final states are, and then find the energy difference which the photon must provide.

Wait, the model is the non-rigid rotor model, but the problem mentions both rotation and vibration. Oh right, the quantum rotation-vibration model considers both rotational and vibrational energy states. So the molecule's energy is a combination of these two.

The fundamental state is the state with the lowest energy. In the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are given by something like E = E_vib + E_rot. The fundamental state is when both vibrational and rotational are in their lowest states. So the vibrational quantum number v is 0, and the rotational quantum number J is also 0? Or maybe J=0,1? Hmm, I remember that for rigid rotors, the rotational energy levels are quantized as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, but the problem says it's a non-rigid rotor model, but I'm not sure if that affects the initial state here. Maybe I should focus on the energy transitions.

The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So what's the next state with the lowest possible energy? That would be the next higher energy state, which could be either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But I'm not sure which is lower in energy.

Wait, vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. The rotational levels are E_rot = B J (J+1). So the first excited state could be either n=1 (vibrational) or J=1 (rotational). Which one has lower energy?

The vibrational energy for n=1 is (3/2) h w. The rotational energy for J=1 is B * 1 * 2 = 2B. So which is lower between 3/2 h w and 2B?

Wait, I need to compute B. The rotational constant B is given by h/(8 π² μ R²), where μ is the reduced mass of the molecule, and R is the bond length.

So let's compute μ first. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) amu. 20*2 is 40, divided by 22 is about 1.818 amu. But I should keep it exact for calculation purposes. Let me write μ = (40)/(22) amu = (20/11) ≈ 1.818 amu. Wait, but I need to convert this into kilograms because momentum is in SI units.

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me compute that. 20/11 is about 1.818, so 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.018e-27 kg.

Wait, 20/11 is exactly 1.8181818... so let me compute 20/11 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

20 * 1.6605e-27 = 33.21e-27.

Divide by 11: 33.21e-27 /11 = approximately 3.019e-27 kg.

So μ is about 3.019e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R=2e-10 m.

Now, compute B. B = h / (8 π² μ R²). Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J*s.

Let me compute the denominator first: 8 π² μ R².

Compute R squared: (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Multiply by μ: 3.019e-27 kg *4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg m².

Now multiply by 8 π²: 8*(pi)^2 is approximately 8*(9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So 78.9568 * 1.2076e-46 ≈ 95.35e-46.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 8 * pi² is approximately 78.9568.

So 78.9568 * 1.2076e-46 = let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2076.

Let's see: 78 * 1.2 is about 93.6, but more accurately:

1.2076 * 78.9568 ≈ let me compute 1.2076 *78 = 94.1088, 1.2076 *0.9568 ≈ approx 1.2076 *0.95=1.147, so total around 94.1088 +1.147=95.2558e-46.

So denominator is approximately 95.2558e-46 ≈ 9.52558e-45.

Then B = h / denominator → 6.626e-34 / 9.52558e-45 ≈ (6.626 /9.52558) * 1e11.

6.626 /9.52558 ≈ approximately 0.695.

So B ≈ 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 Hz? Wait, no. Wait, because the units for B are cm^-1 or wavenumbers, but I'm computing in SI units, so B is in s^-1.

Wait, let's think about the units. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), and B has units of energy per angular momentum? Or wait, no. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, the rotational constant B is in cm^-1 because it's defined as hcB = energy in terms of wavenumbers. Alternatively, when using B in the expression E_rot = B J (J+1), the B is in units of energy per unit angular momentum or something else? Maybe I got confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write B in terms of angular frequency. Because I recall that for a rigid rotor, B = ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, perhaps B is related to the rotational frequency.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of angular frequency ω for rotation. The rotational angular frequency is related to the moment of inertia I by ω² = k / I, but perhaps that's not the right path.

Wait, maybe I should instead compute B in terms of angular frequency, but I'm a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy levels in terms of their vibration and rotation.

Wait, the initial state is the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest possible energy could be either v=1 (with J=0) or J=1 (with v=0). Which of these has a lower energy?

We need to calculate both possible transitions and see which is lower.

First, compute the energy difference for v=0 to v=1.

E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So for n=0, E0 = (1/2) h w. For n=1, E1 = (3/2) h w. So the energy difference ΔE_vib = E1 - E0 = h w.

Now, the energy difference for a rotational transition. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). For J=0, E=0. For J=1, E=2B. So ΔE_rot = 2B.

So the two possible transitions are either absorbing a photon with energy h w (vibrational transition) or one with energy 2B (rotational transition). We need to find which of these is smaller because the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the transition with smaller ΔE is the one we should choose.

So compute h w and 2B to see which is smaller.

We already have w (given as 4e14 rad/s). So h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

Now compute 2B. Earlier, I found B ≈ 6.95e10 (but I'm not sure about the units there). Wait, that can't be right because 6.95e10 is a frequency in Hz. Wait, let's recalculate B properly.

Wait, the formula for B is B = h/(8 π² μ R²). Let me compute that again.

B = h / (8 π² μ R² )

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

μ = 3.019e-27 kg

R = 2e-10 m

So R² = (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

Denominator: 8 * pi^2 * mu * R² = 8 * (9.8696) * (3.019e-27 kg) * (4e-20 m²).

Let me compute each part step by step.

8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

Multiply by mu: 78.9568 * 3.019e-27 kg = let me compute 78.9568 *3.019e-27.

78.9568 *3 = 236.87, 78.9568 *0.019 = approximately 1.500e-27. So total is approximately 236.87e-27 + 1.500e-27 = 238.37e-27 = 2.3837e-25.

Wait, wait, no. Let me compute it more accurately.

78.9568 *3.019e-27 = (78.9568 *3.019) * 1e-27.

78.9568 *3 = 236.8704

78.9568 *0.019 ≈ 1.5001792

So total is 236.8704 + 1.5001792 ≈ 238.3705792e-27 kg·m²/s² ? No, wait, units are kg·m².

Wait, no, because the denominator is in kg·m². Let's focus on the numbers.

So 78.9568 *3.019e-27 = approximately 238.3706e-27. Then multiply by R² (4e-20 m²):

238.3706e-27 *4e-20 = (238.3706 *4) *e-47.

238.3706 *4 ≈ 953.4824.

So denominator is approximately 953.4824e-47 ≈ 9.5348e-45.

So B = h / denominator = 6.626e-34 / 9.5348e-45 = (6.626 /9.5348) * 1e11.

6.626 /9.5348 ≈ approximately 0.695.

So B ≈ 0.695e11 = 6.95e10 s^-1. Because B is in 1/s, as it's an angular frequency.

So 2B = 1.39e11 s^-1.

Now the energy for rotational transition is 2B in terms of frequency, but wait, energy is E = h * frequency. So for rotational transition, the photon's frequency would be ν = 2B.

Wait, no, because E_rot = B J (J+1) is actually in terms of energy. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me clarify. For a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_rot = ħ² (J (J+1)) / (2I), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, sometimes B is defined as ħ²/(2I), so E_rot = B J (J+1). But in that case, B would have units of energy per J (J+1), which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of ω, the rotational angular frequency.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The angular frequency of rotation is ω_rot = sqrt(k/(I)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are E_rot = (ħ ω_rot) (J (J+1)) / (2) ? Or maybe E_rot = J (J+1) ħ ω_rot.

Hmm, perhaps I should just compute the energy difference for each possible transition.

So for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1: The energy change is E_rot = B * [1*(1+1) - 0*(0+1)] = B *2. So the photon's energy needed is 2B.

But then, what is B? Let's compute B again.

Wait, B in terms of energy per J(J+1) is:

But I think I made a mistake earlier because B is often defined as ω_0 / (2π), where ω_0 is the rotational angular frequency. So B = ω_0 / (2π) → ω_0 = 2 π B.

So the rotational energy levels are E_rot = ħ ω_0 (J (J+1)) / (2), right? Or perhaps E_rot = ħ^2 J (J+1) / (2I), which is another expression. Wait, perhaps that's the correct expression.

Let me compute E_rot for J=1 and J=0 and then find the difference.

E_rot = (ħ^2 J (J+1)) / (2 I).

I is the moment of inertia, I = μ R². So,

E_rot (J=1) = (ħ² * 2) / (2 I) = (ħ²) / (I).

E_rot (J=0) = 0.

So the energy difference for rotational transition is (ħ²)/(I).

Similarly, the vibrational energy difference is h w.

So which is smaller between (ħ²)/(I) and h w?

Compute both:

First, compute ħ: h-bar is h/(2π) = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

I = μ R² = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2076e-46).

Compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 → approximately 1.112 *1e-68.

So numerator is 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.2076e-46:

1.112e-68 /1.2076e-46 ≈ (1.112/1.2076) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.9207 * 1e-22 ≈ 9.207e-23 J.

Now, compare with h w.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So 9.2e-23 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

Therefore, the molecule will first undergo a rotational transition to J=1 before any vibrational transition. Hence, the photon must have energy equal to the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait. The question says, when the molecule is in its fundamental state, what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the next lowest energy state, which is the rotational state, because that transition requires less energy.

So the energy of the photon is E_photon = (ħ²)/(I) ≈9.2e-23 J.

But the question is about momentum, not energy. So we need to find the momentum p of the photon. The energy of a photon is E = p c, where c is the speed of light (~3e8 m/s). So p = E / c.

So p_photon = (9.207e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that again.

Wait, 9.207e-23 J / 3e8 m/s = 3.069e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's 3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Looking at the options, none of them are this small. The options are on the order of 1e-28 to 1e-27. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the rotational energy difference is E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I) for J=1, so E_rot = (ħ² * 2) / (2 I) = (ħ²) / I.

Wait, correct. So E_rot = (ħ^2) / I.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in calculations. Let me recompute ħ^2 / I.

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ^2 = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

I = 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.019e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² / I = 1.112e-68 / 1.2076e-46 = approximately 9.207e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Now, p_photon = E_photon / (c) = 9.2e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger. So I'm definitely missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in which transition is allowed. Because in the rotational-vibration model, the molecule can undergo either a rotational or vibrational transition, but perhaps the selection rules apply. Oh wait, but the question says it's the next state with the lowest possible energy, so which is the lower energy transition.

Wait, but perhaps the initial state is not just v=0 and J=0. Wait, no, the fundamental state is the lowest, which is v=0 and J=0. So the next state is either v=1 (J=0) or J=1 (v=0). We found that the rotational transition requires less energy, so that would be the next state.

But why the momentum I calculated is so small compared to the options. Let me check what the options are.

Options are:

A) 1.9e-28 N·s

B) 2.3e-27 N·s

C) 1.1e-27 N·s

D) 1.4e-28 N·s

Wait, N·s is kg·m/s, same as momentum. So my calculation is 3e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3e-31 N·s. But the options are all about 1e-27, which is 1e4 times larger.

So I must have made a mistake in calculating either the energy or the momentum.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the rotational energy. Let me check again.

The energy for rotational transition: From J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is E = B * (2 - 0) = 2B.

But B is defined as B = h/(8 π² μ R²).

Wait, no, B is h bar (ħ) / (2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Let me re-express E_rot.

Wait, E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2 I). So for J=1, E_rot = (ħ² * 2)/(2I) = ħ²/I.

So E_rot is ħ²/I.

Wait, but in terms of frequency, the energy E = h ν, so ν = E / h.

So ν_rot = (ħ²/I) / h = ( (h/(2π))^2 / I ) / h = h^2/(4 π² I h) ) = h/(4 π² I).

So ν_rot = h/(4 π² I) = 1/(4 π² μ R²) * h/(h?) Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, let me compute ν_rot = E_rot / h = (ħ²/I) / h = ( (h/(2 π))^2 )/(I h) ) = h^2/(4 π² I h) ) = h/(4 π² I).

So ν_rot = h/(4 π² I).

I is μ R², so ν_rot = h/(4 π² μ R²).

But wait, B was earlier calculated as h/(8 π² μ R²) = (h/(4 π² μ R²)) ) / 2.

So B = ν_rot / 2. Or ν_rot = 2 B.

So the energy for the rotational transition is E_rot = h ν_rot = 2 h B.

Wait, earlier I thought E_rot = 2 B, but that was wrong because B is in angular frequency units, so E_rot = B * 2 * h bar?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused again. Let me go back.

Wait, E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1)) / (2I) = (J (J+1) ħ² )/(2 I).

For J=1: E_rot = (2 * ħ² )/(2 I) = ħ² / I.

So E_rot = ħ² / I.

Now, E_photon = ħ² / I.

Wait, but this is the same as before, resulting in E_photon ≈9.2e-23 J. Which gives p_photon = 3e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are much bigger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ħ² / I.

Wait, let me recompute ħ squared.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ squared is (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ (1.0545718)^2 * (1e-34)^2 = 1.112 * 1e-68 J²·s².

I is 3.019e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

So (2e-10 m)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.019e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So ħ² / I = (1.112e-68) / (1.2076e-46) ≈ (1.112 / 1.2076) * 1e-22.

1.112 /1.2076 ≈ 0.9207.

So ħ² / I ≈ 0.9207e-22 J ≈ 9.207e-23 J. Correct.

So E_photon =9.207e-23 J.

p_photon = E / (c) = 9.207e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.069e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, maybe the next state includes both a vibrational and rotational transition. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. So that's either a rotational or vibrational transition, whichever requires less energy.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing that both transitions happen? No, the problem states 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy', implying the minimal ΔE.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the next state in the energy order, which could be a combination of J and v. But I thought the rotational transition comes before vibrational because it's lower energy.

Wait, but my calculation for the rotational transition's energy is 9.2e-23 J, and vibrational is 2.65e-19 J. So 9e-23 is much smaller, so the rotational transition requires much less energy. Therefore, the photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3e-31 kg·m/s. But the options don't have that.

So I must have made an error in the approach. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't allowed to make a pure rotational transition in this model because the question says it's a rotation-vibration model, which is a non-rigid rotor. So perhaps the transitions are considered in terms of the total energy levels, which include both rotation and vibration.

Wait, but the question says to find the photon that switches the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So perhaps the next state is the first excited state, which could be either vibrational (n=1) or rotational (J=1). But if the vibrational energy is higher, then the rotational transition is lower, so the photon's energy is lower.

But why the calculation's result doesn't match any options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, maybe I should compute B in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1) and then compute the vibrational or rotational frequency.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider the rotational transition as the next state, but I think that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I calculated the energy for the transition from J=0 to J=1, but in reality, maybe the selection rule for rotational transitions is ΔJ= ±2, so J=0 can go to J=2. Oh wait, that's for rigid rotors in electric dipole transitions. But perhaps for a non-rigid rotor, the selection rules are different. Or maybe the question is in the context of overtones or something else.

Wait, but the question states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the selection rules are different. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the next state is the first vibrational state, not rotational.

But earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition requires much less energy. So why the discrepancy with the options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing B.

Wait, B is h/(8 pi² μ R²). Let me recompute B.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

μ = 3.019e-27 kg.

R=2e-10 m.

So R²=4e-20 m².

Denominator:8 pi² μ R² = 8 * (pi^2) * 3.019e-27 *4e-20.

Compute 8 * pi^2 ≈8 *9.8696≈78.9568.

Compute 3.019e-27 *4e-20 =1.2076e-46.

Multiply by 78.9568: 78.9568 * 1.2076e-46≈95.34e-46.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.534e-45 → 6.626e-34 / 9.534e-45 ≈ (6.626/9.534) *1e11 ≈0.695e11=6.95e10 s^-1.

So B is about 6.95e10 s^-1.

So the rotational energy difference is 2B =1.39e11 s^-1.

But wait, when we compute the energy, it's E=h ν. So E_rot = h * 2B = 6.626e-34 * 1.39e11 ≈ 9.20e-23 J. Which matches our earlier result.

So the momentum p = E/c =9.20e-23 / 3e8 ≈3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But the options are way larger. So I must have made some mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the energy difference but the photon's momentum. Let's think differently. Maybe the energy is given by (n + 1/2) h w for vibration. So the difference is h w.

Then p would be h w / c.

Let me compute that.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28, option A is 1.9e-28.

Hmm, 8.83e-28 is close to 1e-28. So perhaps the correct answer is option A or D.

But why would the rotational transition not be considered? Because perhaps the model assumes that the rotational transitions are not allowed, or perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the state of lowest energy. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But the energy levels: vibrational transitions have larger energy gaps than rotational ones.

Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the rotational transition (J=0 → J=1) requires less energy than the vibrational (v=0 → v=1). So the photon should have energy of 9.2e-23 J, which gives a momentum of 3e-31 kg·m/s, which isn't any of the options.

But the options are all about 1e-27 or 1e-28. Which suggests that the correct approach is to compute the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps I confused the definitions of B and the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the energy levels for rotation are given as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1. So B in wavenumbers. Then, the energy difference would be 2B in cm^-1, and the photon's frequency is ν= c * B *2.

No, because B is in cm^-1, so ν would be c * B *2.

Wait, but I think I'm getting into a muddle. Let me try this approach.

Compute B in cm^-1.

The rotational constant B (in wavenumbers) is given by B = h/(8 π² c μ R²).

Wait, because when B is in wavenumbers (cm^-1), the formula includes c.

Wait, let me think. The rotational energy is E_rot = h c B J (J+1), where B is in cm^-1.

So B (cm^-1) = h/(8 pi^2 c I ), where I is moment of inertia.

So compute B:

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

c=3e8 m/s.

I=μ R²=3.019e-27 kg *4e-20 m²=1.2076e-46 kg·m².

So B (cm^-1) = h/(8 pi^2 c I).

Plugging in the numbers:

h/(8 pi^2 c I ) = (6.626e-34) / (8 *9.8696 *3e8 *1.2076e-46 )

Compute denominator:

8 *9.8696 ≈78.9568.

78.9568 *3e8 = 2.3687e10.

2.3687e10 *1.2076e-46 = 2.3687e10 *1.2076e-46 =2.86e-36.

So B = 6.626e-34 / 2.86e-36 ≈ approximately 2315 cm^-1.

So B ≈2315 cm^-1.

Then, the rotational energy for J=1 is E_rot = h c B *2 (since J=1, J+1=2, so 2B).

So E_rot = h c (2B) = 6.626e-34 *3e8 * 2*2315.

Compute 2 *2315 =4630.

So (6.626e-34)*(3e8)=1.9878e-25.

Multiply by 4630: 1.9878e-25 *4630 =9.20e-22 J.

So same as before, E_rot is 9.2e-22 J? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

Multiply by 4630 cm (since 4630 cm = 46.3 m). Wait, no, because B is in cm^-1, so when you multiply by cm, it becomes dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me compute E_rot correctly.

E_rot = h c B * (J (J+1)).

So for J=1, E_rot = h c B * 2.

So with B=2315 cm^-1, 2B=4630 cm^-1.

So E_rot = h c *4630 cm^-1.

But wait, h c is 12400 eV·Å, but perhaps I should compute in J.

h c = 6.626e-34 J·s *3e8 m/s =1.9878e-25 J·m.

But 4630 cm^-1 is 4630 /100 m^-1 =46.3 m^-1.

So E_rot =1.9878e-25 J·m *46.3 m^-1 = 1.9878e-25 *46.3 → approximately 9.20e-24 J.

Wait, that's 9.20e-24 J, which is even smaller than before. So p_photon = E/c →9.2e-24 /3e8 =3.07e-32 kg·m/s. Even smaller than before.

But again, the options are way larger.

Wait, perhaps the question is not considering the rotational transition. Maybe in the rotation-vibration model, the fundamental state is the first state beyond the ground state, which might include both vibrational and rotational.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible answers again.

The given options are 1e-27 to 1e-28. The calculation for the vibrational transition gives p ≈8.8e-28 Ns. Which is close to option D (1.4e-28) or option A (1.9e-28).

But why? Oh, perhaps the question is considering the rotational transition but with a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy as the difference between the next vibrational state and the ground state, not considering rotation.

Wait, what's the energy difference for the vibrational transition? E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg·m/s → 8.8e-28 Ns.

Which is close to option A (1.9e-28) or option D (1.4e-28). But it's approximately 8.8e-28, which is not exactly any of the options. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the fundamental vibrational state but the next state which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the first state beyond the ground state, which is the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0).

But earlier calculation shows that the rotational energy is much less. So perhaps the question expects us to consider the vibrational transition, for which p is around 8.8e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option B is 2.3e-27, option C is 1.1e-27, option D is 1.4e-28.

8.8e-28 is close to option A (1.9e-28) but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy. Let me double-check.

w is given as 4e14 rad/s.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8347e-28 N·s.

Rounded, that's approximately 8.8e-28. But none of the options match this exactly. The closest option is D) 1.4e-28, which is about a sixth of this value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the units.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the photon's energy to be the vibrational energy, but using the wavenumber w in cm^-1. Let me check.

Wait, the given w is 4e14 rad/s. To convert angular frequency to wavenumbers (cm^-1), we can use w = c * (wavenumber), because wavenumber ν̃ (cm^-1) = w/(c).

So ν̃ = w/(c) = 4e14 rad/s /3e10 cm/s = (4e14)/(3e10) cm^-1 ≈ 1.333e4 cm^-1.

So, the vibrational energy per photon is h c ν̃ = h c (w/(c)) ) = h w. So same as before, 2.65e-19 J.

So the p_photon would be 8.8e-28 Ns.

Hmm. So why isn't this matching any options? Did I make a mistake in reading the question?

Wait, the question states that the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which is the non-rigid rotor model. Perhaps in this model, the energy levels are treated differently. Maybe the ground state is a combination of v=0 and J=0, and the next state is v=1, J=0.

But then, the energy difference is h w. So p_photon is 8.8e-28 Ns. But again, no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the vibrational part but the rotational part. So perhaps the question is looking for the rotational transition. So with E_rot =2B.

But earlier, the rotational energy (2B) is 9.2e-23 J, which gives p_photon =3e-31 Ns. But no option matches.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the photon's momentum using the rotational energy level transition in a different way.

Another approach: The energy difference for rotation is 2B. So the photon's frequency is ν=2B. But B is in s^-1, so ν=2*6.95e10=1.39e11 s^-1.

So the photon's energy is E= h ν =6.626e-34 *1.39e11 ≈9.2e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s. Again, way smaller than options.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to use the vibrational transition. But why isn't the photon's momentum matching any of the options?

Alternative idea: Perhaps the mass given is in amu, but I forgot to convert it to kg. Let me recheck.

Masses:

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.019e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Bond length R=2 angstroms=2e-10 m.

Yes.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

The options are:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum as the rotational transition, but using a different approach.

Wait, the rotational transition requires the photon to have energy E= h ν_rot. Alternatively, perhaps we should calculate the rotational energy in terms of the bond length and moment of inertia.

Another approach: Using the formula for rotational energy E_rot = (1/2) I ω².

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would help.

Alternatively, perhaps the model expects us to compute the energy using the vibrational transition only, which would give p=8.8e-28 Ns. But this isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question was about the rotational transition, but I was supposed to compute the angular momentum change and not the photon's momentum.

Wait, no, the question is about the photon's momentum.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor somewhere. Let me see.

Wait, when dealing with rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ=±2. So the transition is from J=0 to J=2. Which would change the energy by E= B [2*(2+1) - 0 ]= 6B.

So the energy would be 6B, which is much higher.

But then, E =6B =6 *6.95e10 =4.17e11 s^-1.

Then, E_photon = h *4.17e11 =6.626e-34 *4.17e11≈2.76e-22 J.

p_photon =2.76e-22 /3e8=9.2e-31 kg·m/s. Still way too small.

Hmm. I'm not sure where I'm going wrong. Let's try another approach.

Maybe the problem is just about the vibrational transition, and the options have a typo. Let me compute the momentum again.

E_photon = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14=2.65e-19 J.

p_photon= E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8=8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is approximately 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is A) 1.9e-28 and D)1.4e-28. But 8.8e-28 is about 6 times larger than option A. Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the value.

h =6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 s^-1.

E = h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg·m/s.

Yes, that's correct. Approximately 8.8e-28. So none of the options match exactly. But perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the next state in the energy order, which might include both a vibrational and a rotational change. But I'm not sure.

Alternative idea: Perhaps the problem is considering the rotational energy and the vibrational energy together, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the photon's energy is the sum of the vibrational and rotational energy differences, but that would be much higher.

Wait, but the problem states 'the next state with the lowest possible energy', which is the state with the smallest possible energy increase. So it's either the rotational or vibrational transition, whichever is lower.

But in all my calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. So why is the calculated momentum not matching any option?

I'm stuck. Perhaps the intended approach is to compute the vibrational transition, leading to option A or D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of mu. Let me recheck the reduced mass.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.019e-27 kg. Correct.

So I think I've double-checked all the steps and can't find a mistake. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A (1.9e-28), which is about 1/5th of the calculated value. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should go with the vibrational transition, which gives 8.8e-28, and the closest option is A (1.9e-28), but that's not very close.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E_photon. Let me compute h w again.

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

w=4e14 s^-1.

E_photon =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p_photon=2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 kg·m/s.

Hmm. So that's 8.8e-28, but the options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options, option B is 2.3e-27, which is 230 times larger. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the photon's momentum is computed using the wavelength instead of energy. No, p= E/c is correct.

Another possibility: Maybe the problem is considering the photon's energy as the sum of both rotational and vibrational energies. But that would be even larger.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express the momentum in terms of the angular frequency, but I don't think that's relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in units when calculating the rotational energy. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the rotational energy in a different way. For example, using the formula E_rot = (J (J+1)) * h c B, where B is in cm^-1.

But earlier, I found B=2315 cm^-1.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 * B * hc.

E_rot = 2 *2315 cm^-1 * h c.

h c =12400 eV·Å.

But 2315 cm^-1 = 2315 *1e-2 m^-1 =2.315e-2 m^-1.

h c =6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E_rot =2 *2315 cm^-1 * h c.

Wait, 2315 cm^-1 =23.15 m^-1.

So E_rot=2 *23.15 m^-1 *1.9878e-25 J·m =2 *23.15 *1.9878e-25 =9.2e-24 J.

p_photon =9.2e-24 /3e8 =3.07e-32 kg·m/s. Still not matching options.

So I'm really stuck. But given the options, the closest to my vibrational transition calculation is 8.8e-28, but none of the options are close. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the rotational energy using a different formula, perhaps in terms of the bond strength or something else.

Wait, another approach: The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ² J (J+1) )/(2 I). So for J=1, E_rot = (ħ² *2)/(2 I) = ħ² / I.

So E_rot = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (3.019e-27 * (2e-10)^2).

Wait, I is μ R²: 3.019e-27 * (2e-10)^2 =1.2076e-46.

So E_rot = (1.112e-68) / (1.2076e-46) =9.207e-23 J.

p_photon=9.207e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Hmm. Still doesn't match options.

I think I've tried everything I can think of. Given the time I've spent and the options, I think the intended answer is option A) 1.9e-28 Ns, based on the vibrational transition, even though my calculation doesn't match exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the vibrational energy.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Let me think about the units again. Momentum is kg·m/s. But when you calculate p=E/c, that's correct. So I think my calculations are correct. But perhaps the problem expects the answer to be expressed using the rotational energy but with a different approach, perhaps using the formula p = ħ * something.

Wait, another idea: The photon's momentum can also be expressed as p = ħ k, where k is the wavevector. And k = 2 pi / lambda.

But E = h f = hc / lambda → lambda = hc / E.

So k = 2 pi / (hc/E) )= 2 pi E/(hc).

p = ħ k = ħ * 2 pi E/(hc) )= (2 pi ħ E)/(h c).

Wait, simplifying:

(2 pi E ħ) / (h c) )= (2 pi E (h/(2 pi)) )/(h c) )= (E h )/(h c ) )= E/(c).

Which brings us back to p=E/c. So no help here.

I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the calculations.

The correct calculation for the vibrational transition gives p_photon ≈8.8e-28 Ns, but none of the options match. However, option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly 1/5th of that. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the rotational transition, but that gives a value much smaller than the options.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy was computed incorrectly in the previous steps. Let me recompute the rotational energy using B= h/(8 pi² mu R²).

B=6.626e-34 / (8 pi² * 3.019e-27 * (2e-10)^2 )

Compute denominator:8 pi² * mu R² =8 *9.8696 *3.019e-27 *4e-20.

Which is 78.9568 *3.019e-27 *4e-20.

78.9568 *3.019e-27 =78.9568 *3.019 = approx 238.37e-27.

Multiply by4e-20: 238.37e-27 *4e-20 =953.48e-47.

So B=6.626e-34 /9.5348e-45 = 6.626e-34 /9.5348e-45 = (6.626 /9.5348) * 1e11 → approx 0.695e11=6.95e10 s^-1.

So E_rot=2B=1.39e11 s^-1.

E_photon=h*1.39e11=6.626e-34 *1.39e11=9.2e-23 J.

p_photon=9.2e-23 /3e8=3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

No match.

Given all this, I think the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration (non-rigid rotor) model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state, and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis considers both rotational and vibrational transitions, as well as the energy differences between these states.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Fundamental State and Next State**:  
   The fundamental state corresponds to the lowest energy configuration, which is **v = 0 (vibrational ground state)** and **J = 0 (rotational ground state)**. The next state with the lowest energy could either be a vibrational transition (v = 1, J = 0) or a rotational transition (v = 0, J = 1). The energy difference for these transitions determines which transition occurs first.

2. **Vibrational Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{vib}} = \left(n + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega
   \]  
   For the transition from \(v = 0\) to \(v = 1\), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega
   \]  
   Substituting \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) and \(\omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s}\):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \(p = \frac{E}{c}\), where \(c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}\):  
   \[
   p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}
   \]

3. **Rotational Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1)
   \]  
   where \(B = \frac{h}{8 \pi^2 \mu R^2}\) is the rotational constant. The reduced mass \(\mu\) and bond length \(R\) are calculated as:  
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} = 1.818 \, \text{amu} = 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
   \]  
   \[
   R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}
   \]  
   Substituting into \(B\):  
   \[
   B = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \pi^2 \times 3.019 \times 10^{-27} \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2} \approx 6.95 \times 10^{10} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   \]  
   For the transition from \(J = 0\) to \(J = 1\), the energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 6.95 \times 10^{10} = 1.39 \times 10^{11} \, \text{s}^{-1}
   \]  
   Converting to energy:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = h \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 1.39 \times 10^{11} = 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The momentum of the photon is:  
   \[
   p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}
   \]

4. **Comparison of Transitions**:  
   The vibrational transition requires significantly more energy (\(2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)) than the rotational transition (\(9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy corresponds to the **rotational transition**.

5. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:  
   The momentum of the photon for the rotational transition is \(p_{\text{rot}} = 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}\). However, this value is much smaller than any of the provided options. The closest match to the vibrational transition (\(p_{\text{vib}} = 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\)) is **option A (\(1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}\))**, though it is not exact.

### Conclusion:
Given the discrepancy between the calculated values and the provided options, and assuming the problem intends for the vibrational transition to be considered, the closest answer is:

**Answer: A**
