Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, perpendicular to the aperture. In the far field, this creates intensity maxima and minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and we can assume small angles, so tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, I remember from my optics classes that when a light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed is called a diffraction pattern. For a single slit, the minima occur at angles given by a*sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer, and a is the slit width. The first minima would be at m=1, so θ would be roughly λ/(a). But wait, in that case, the angular distance between the first two minima would be (λ/(a))*(1-2) ? No, wait, no, the first minima is at m=1 and the second at m=2, so the difference is λ/(a). But wait, wait, the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is very large, so N approaches infinity.

Wait, but when N is very large, the polygon becomes circular, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So maybe the problem is similar to a circular aperture's diffraction pattern. Oh wait, but the options don't include that. Wait, the single slit is more like a rectangular aperture, but a circle is different. Wait, the single slit's minima are at a sinθ = mλ, but for a circular aperture, the minima are given by a sinθ = (m + 0.5)λ, or is it a different formula?

Wait, no, wait, for a circular aperture, the diffraction minima occur at certain conditions. Let me think. The intensity in Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture has a pattern with rings, and the minima occur at certain angles. The first minimum is at a sinθ ≈ 1.22 λ, right? So the angular position is θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(a). So the first minimum is at that angle. But the problem is asking for the angular distance between the
