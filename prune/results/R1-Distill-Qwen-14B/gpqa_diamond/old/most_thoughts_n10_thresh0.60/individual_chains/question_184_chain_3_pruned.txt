Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions from the given options. 

First, let me visualize the structure. The benzene ring has three substituents: a tert-butyl group, an ethoxy group, and a nitro group. The substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering can be a bit tricky. Let's imagine the positions. Position 1 is where the ethoxy group is. Then, position 2 has the tert-butyl, and position 3 has the nitro group. So the substituents are all adjacent, but in a meta arrangement? Or maybe ortho and para? Hmm, maybe I should draw the structure.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so position 1 is one carbon, position 2 is adjacent, and position 3 is the next. So substituents 1,2,3 would form a sort of adjacent trio. So, ethoxy (OEt) at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. Correct.

Now, the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene. I need to introduce the three substituents in the correct order, considering the directing effects of each group. Because each substitution reaction is influenced by the existing substituents, the order of introducing the groups matters a lot.

Let's recall the directing effects. Benzene is an activating group, but once we add substituents, each will direct incoming groups to certain positions. So, substituents can be meta directors or para/ortho directors.

Nitro groups are meta directors. They are strong deactivating, so they deactivate the ring. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is an activating, since it's an alkyl group; it's an ortho/para director as well.

Wait, but the substituents can influence each other. So when adding substituents, the order will determine where each new group attaches.

The target molecule has
