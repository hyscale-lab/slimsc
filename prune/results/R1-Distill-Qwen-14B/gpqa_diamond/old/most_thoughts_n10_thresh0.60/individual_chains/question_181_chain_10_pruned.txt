Okay, so I need to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped in the Sun's core about 8 and a half minutes ago. Wait, 8.5 minutes is the approximate time it takes for light to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So if the pp-III reactions stopped, the change would be felt here on Earth only after that delay. But the neutrinos move at nearly the speed of light, so any neutrinos produced before the stoppage would have already been emitted, and any after would not be. But the question is about the current flux, which is the rate of neutrinos arriving now.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of fluxes in two specific energy bands. So I need to figure out how pp-III affects the production of neutrinos in these bands.

The pp-III processâ€”I remember that it's one of the proton-proton chains in the Sun. The main pp-I chain is the dominant one, producing a lot of neutrinos. The pp-II and pp-III are side branches, I think. Oh right, the pp-III branch involves reactions that produce higher-energy neutrinos.

In the pp-III process, the main neutrinos are the electron neutrinos from the decay of boron-8. The pp-III process produces a specific range of neutrino energies. Let me get the energy of those neutrinos. I think boron-8 decays into helium-4 and a positron and emits a neutrino. The neutrino energy in the pp-III branch is around 15-20 MeV or so. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Let me think again. Oh wait, the main neutrinos from the Sun are the ones from the dominant pp-I process, which produce lower-energy neutrinos, around 0.5 MeV. The pp-II and pp-III branches contribute to higher-energy neutrinos.

Wait, the question is about neutrinos in the 700-800 keV and 800-900 keV bands. Those are 0.7-0.8 MeV and 0.8-0.9 MeV. That's in the same range as the main pp-I neutrinos. So if the pp-III
