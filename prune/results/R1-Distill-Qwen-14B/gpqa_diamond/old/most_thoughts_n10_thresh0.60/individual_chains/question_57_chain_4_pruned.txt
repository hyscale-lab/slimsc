Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

The problem gives me phase shifts for an experiment. The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. They tell me to ignore the rest of the phase shifts. I need to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The options are A, B, C, D with different values in fm.

Wait, I remember that scattering amplitude has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is related to the cross-section, right? The formula for the differential cross-section in elastic scattering is given by something like |f|^2, where f is the scattering amplitude. But wait, I think the imaginary part of f is connected to the scattering probability.

Oh wait, I think the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is something like Im(f) = (k/(2m)) * sum of the phase shifts. Or maybe it's (1/(2ik)) times something? No, wait, maybe I should recall the relation between the scattering amplitude and the phase shifts.

So, for a given partial wave expansion, the scattering amplitude can be written as a sum over all the angular momentum states. Each term involves the spherical harmonics and the phase shifts. The general form is f(θ, φ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδl} sinδl [Pl(cosθ) + ...], but since we're looking along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees. Oh wait, in the lab frame, the incident beam is along the z-axis, so the scattering angle θ=0 would be the same as the incident direction.

Wait, no, the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Hmm. Maybe I should think about the relation for the total cross-section or the differential cross-section at θ=0.

Wait, the differential cross-section is given by dσ/dΩ = |f|^2. But the imaginary part of f contributes to this. Alternatively, I think there's a formula that relates the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude to the phase shifts. Let me think.

Oh, right! I remember that the imaginary part of f, Im(f), for each partial wave is ( (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l
