Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what the question is about. Hmm, it's about stars with spots and how they might mimic an exoplanet's signal in photometric observations. Interesting.

Alright, let's parse the question. So, we have a star similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so they're at 5000K. When the star rotates, these spots come into view and then go away, causing brightness variations that could look like an exoplanet transiting the star. The question is, what would be the radius of a planet that would produce the same brightness change as these spots?

Wait, but the question says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)." Oh, so normally, without spots, the planet's transit would cause a dip in brightness. But in this case, the spots are causing a brightness variation, and they want to find an exoplanet's radius that would cause the same dip as the spots do.

Hmm, I think I need to compute the fractional change in brightness (delta F) caused by the spots and set that equal to the change caused by a planet transit, then solve for the planet's radius relative to the star.

Wait, but how do spots affect the brightness? Spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the total light from the star decreases. So the flux from the star changes as the spots come into the line of sight. On the other hand, a planet blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip.

So in both cases, the dip in brightness would be proportional to the area blocked. But wait, for the planet, it's a simple area ratio. For the spots, since they are cooler, the flux change isn't just the area times the original flux. Instead, the star's total flux is the sum of the parts not covered by spots and the spots themselves. So when spots rotate into view, the total flux decreases because the spots emit less.

Wait, let me think. The total flux without spots: F_total = sigma * Teff^4 * (4 pi Rstar^2), but
