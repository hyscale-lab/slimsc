Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about particle collisions and photons. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, and the positron from the right. Both have different Lorentz factors. The electron has a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron has 2. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum must be conserved. Since both particles are moving along the same line before the collision, the photons must be emitted in such a way that their momenta balance out in all directions.

Wait, but considering the system's total momentum before and after the collision. Before collision, the electron and positron have their own momenta. After, the photons' momenta should add up to the same total.

Wait, so let's think about the initial momentum. The electron has a Lorentz factor gamma_e = 4, and the positron gamma_p = 2. But wait, since the positron is a antimatter particle, its momentum is in the opposite direction. Let me clarify: the electron is moving to the right (from left), so its velocity is positive. The positron is moving to the left (from right),
