Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again.

The question says: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there, excluding ethene? The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means the redistribution of alkene bonds. Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, usually used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. So in this case, the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene.

Wait, the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw that. Pent-1-ene means a five-carbon chain with a double bond starting at carbon 1. So the structure would be CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH₂CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3. So, the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH₂CH3? Hmm, let me count: Carbon 1 is the first, so double bond is between C1 and C2. Then C3 is CH(CH3), then C4 is CH2, and C5 is CH3. So the structure is CH₂=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? Wait, that's six carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, pent-1-ene is five carbons. So the structure is CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Pentene has five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH₂=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, wait, no. Let me count:

1   2   3   4   5
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's five carbons? No, that's six. Wait, no. Wait, pentane is five carbons. So pent-1-ene is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂CH3. So 3
