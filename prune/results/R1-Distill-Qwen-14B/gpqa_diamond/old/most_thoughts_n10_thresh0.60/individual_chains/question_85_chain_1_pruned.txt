Okay, I'm trying to solve this science question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let's see, I need to figure out the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2. Hmm.

First, I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula I recall is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), but I might be mixing up some terms here. Oh wait, the equilibrium temperature formula is T_p = T_s * ( R_s / (2a) )^(1/2) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 ), where A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out when taking the ratio. So I don't have to worry about A for this calculation.

Wait, but the question gives me information about the RV method and the shifts in the forbidden line [OI]. Oh right, the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift due to the star's movement caused by the planet's gravity. The shift tells us about the mass of the planet and the size of the orbit.

Wait, but in this question, both planets are detected via transit and RV methods. The transit method gives us the radius of the planet and the size of the orbit (period), while the RV method gives the mass. But the question is about equilibrium temperature, which depends on the distance a from the star.

So I need to find the distance of each planet from the star. Because equilibrium temperature depends inversely on the square root of the distance. Right, because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance, so the temperature goes with the inverse square root.

So the key is to find the ratio of a1 to a2, because T_p1/T_p2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Wait, no. Wait, equilibrium temperature T_p is proportional to (L/(sigma))^(1/4) * (R_star/(2a))^(1/2) ). So L is the star's luminosity, which is given by L = 4πR_star² σ Teff⁴. So combining, T_p =
