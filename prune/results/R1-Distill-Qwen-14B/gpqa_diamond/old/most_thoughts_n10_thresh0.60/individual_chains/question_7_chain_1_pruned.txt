Okay, I need to figure out this physics problem. Hmm, the question is about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with CMB photons producing electron-positron pairs. Oh right, this is about photon-photon collisions limiting the lifetime of gamma-rays in the universe.

So the process is gamma-gamma -> e+ e-. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. I think I remember that for such processes, the cross-section (which tells us the probability of the interaction) depends on the energies of the photons involved.

Wait, the cross-section for two photons to produce an electron-positron pair is significant when the center-of-mass energy is at least twice the electron mass, right? Because each electron has a rest mass of about 0.511 MeV, so two would be around 1.022 MeV. So, the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) needs to be at least 1.022 MeV for the process to happen.

But wait, the problem is about high-energy gamma-ray photons. So one photon is the gamma-ray (high energy) and the other is a CMB photon, which is much lower energy.

Let me think about the photon energies. The CMB photon has an average energy of 1e-3 eV. The gamma-ray photon has energy E_gamma. When these two collide, the center-of-mass energy squared (s) is given by s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2. Since photons are massless, their momentum is E/(c). But since for a photon, E = pc, so p = E/(c). So for photons moving in opposite directions, their momenta would subtract. Wait, but in the center-of-mass frame, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the condition for the pair production.

I remember that for two photons colliding, the condition for pair production is that the product of their energies in the center-of-mass frame is sufficient. Or maybe it's the sum of energies. Wait, I think the threshold condition is that the total energy in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2*mc^2, where m is the electron mass.

So, the total energy in the center-of-mass frame should be sqrt(s) >= 2*mc^2. So, sqrt(s)
