Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2 each.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, angular momentum operators like these are involved. Wait, muons are leptons, and their spin is 1/2, so the spin operator components would be similar to the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

The operator here is probably the spin operator, so the eigenvector corresponds to a spin-up state along a particular direction. But wait, the direction is arbitrary but in the x-z plane. Oh, right, that means the direction can be represented with an angle θ from the z-axis, but the direction vector lies in x-z, so the y-component is zero. So the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ) or something like that.

Wait, but the problem is in two dimensions, since it's spin-1/2. Oh, right, the Hilbert space is two-dimensional. So the operator P is a vector operator, which can be expressed as P = n · σ (ħ/2), where σ is the Pauli vector. So, for a direction n in the x-z plane, n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since we're in two dimensions, maybe we can parametrize it differently.

Wait, but the operator along an arbitrary direction n in x-z plane. So I think the operator P can be written as a combination of P_x and P_z. Because the direction is in x-z, the y-component is zero, so P would be P = P_x x̂ + P_z ẑ. But wait, the operator given is for a specific direction, so I should probably write the operator along that direction.

Wait no, the operator is given as components P_x, P_y, P_z. But the question is about the eigenvector of the operator along direction n. So the operator in that direction is P_n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z
