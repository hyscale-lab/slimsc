Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me start by recalling what I know about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

So, cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. The basic idea is that the particles move in a circular path, and each time they complete a half-circle, they get a kick from the electric field. But wait, synchrocyclotrons are a bit different because they have both electric and magnetic fields, and the frequency of the electric field is adjusted as the particles accelerate. That's because the speed of the particles increases, so the frequency needs to change to keep the electric field in sync with the particles' motion.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Hmm, wait, two accelerations? Or maybe it's being accelerated multiple times—like in a certain number of revolutions? I'm not exactly sure, but I'll think as I go.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. So the question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron.

I remember that in cyclotrons, the time period for the electric field to complete a cycle is linked to the particle's motion. But since this is a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν(α) isn't constant because the particles are gaining energy and their speed is increasing. So the frequency must be adjusted to match the changing speed.

Wait, the key here might be the concept of the synchrotron frequency. The cyclotron frequency is the frequency at which the particles orbit in the magnetic field. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the electric field is set to match the cyclotron frequency. So each time the proton goes around once, it gets a push from the electric field.

But how does that relate to the number of revolutions needed to reach a certain kinetic energy? I think I need to relate the kinetic energy to the energy gained per revolution.

Wait, each time the proton goes through a half-cycle of the electric field, it gains kinetic energy. Or is it a full cycle? Let me think. The electric field alternates, so for each revolution, the particle experiences a change in voltage once per half-cycle. Or perhaps each full cycle corresponds to a certain number of energy gains.

Alternatively, maybe each time the particle completes a full orbit, it gains a certain amount of energy. But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to structure my thoughts.

First, I know that in a synchrocyclotron, the accelerating voltage is applied in such a way that the particles keep being accelerated every time they complete a certain part of their orbit. The voltage is adjusted so that the phase of the electric field matches the phase of the particle's motion.

The kinetic energy is given as 950 MeV. Since the proton starts with negligible kinetic energy, the total energy gain is approximately 950 MeV.

Wait, but a proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV
