Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy when the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. Hmm, nucleus X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. Let me think about what that implies.

Wait, Li is lithium. The standard lithium isotope is Li-7, which has 3 neutrons and 4 protons. Oh wait, no, wait. Li has atomic number 3. So Li-7 would have 3 protons and 4 neutrons, but wait wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says X is Li with 3 neutrons. Oh, wait, that might actually be Li-6 because Li has 3 protons normally. So, Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number is 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion, right?

So the first thing I need to do is find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. Because when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy calculations involve the rest mass energy and the kinetic energy. Oh wait, but wait, the total energy of a relativistic particle is given by gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, right? Gamma is the Lorentz factor.

But wait, the problem is about the energy of the collider, which I think refers to the total energy per nucleus. So each nucleus is accelerated to a speed of 0.96c, and we need to find the total energy, which includes the rest mass energy and the kinetic
