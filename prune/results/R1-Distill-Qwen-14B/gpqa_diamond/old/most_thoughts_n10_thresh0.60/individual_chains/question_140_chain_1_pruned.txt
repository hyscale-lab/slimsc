Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. A precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is near 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. We need to find the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the reaction: X reacts violently with Y to produce gas W, precipitate G. Heating G gives B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Wait, 277 K is about 4°C, which is close to the melting point of water (273 K or 0°C), but maybe it's another compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is a substance like ice, but that's a stretch.

Wait, but B's melting point is 277 K. Let's think: what substances have a melting point around there? Water is 273, so maybe another compound. Maybe something like B is NH3 (ammonia) which melts at about 196 K, no. Or maybe it's a different substance. Maybe B is a different compound.

Wait, another approach: what is the gas W where the number of neutrons equals protons in its molecule? So, for W, each molecule has neutrons equal to protons. Let's think about possible gases like that.

Hydrogen has H2. Each H has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So for H2, each molecule has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal. So that's out.

Maybe CO2? No, wait, the molecule is CO2. Each molecule would have (C:6 protons, 6 neutrons if carbon-12, but wait, the question says the molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons.

Wait, the molecule's total protons and total neutrons are the same. So for example, if the molecule has a total of, say,
