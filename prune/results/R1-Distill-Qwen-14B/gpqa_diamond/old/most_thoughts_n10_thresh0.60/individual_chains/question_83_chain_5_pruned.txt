Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me see. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when you titrate them, they react to form acetate ions and water.

The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it by adding 20.00 cm³ of water. Wait, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. I should calculate the new concentration after dilution. Oh right, dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. So initial concentration M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. After adding 20 cm³, V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20) /40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, the titration is done with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at equivalence point. So I need to find both pH values.

Wait, what's the equivalence point? It's when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Let me calculate the moles first. Moles of acetic acid initially: M = 0.025 M, V = 40 cm³ = 0.04 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. Since each mole of acetic acid reacts with one mole of NaOH, moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But the question is about 25% titration. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³ of NaOH used. So at this point, only 25% of the acetic acid has reacted.

Wait, let's think about each part: 25% titration and equivalence.

Starting with the 25% point. So 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 moles. Since the initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, the reaction is: HA + OH- → A- + H2O. So moles of HA reacted: 0.00025, so remaining HA is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of A- produced: 0.00025.

The total volume at this point is initial solution (40 cm³) plus 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, so 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

The pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]). The pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) ≈ 4.73? Let me calculate: 1.85e-5, so log(1.85)=0.267, so pKa is about 4.73. So substituting the values: pH = 4.73 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.333. Log(0.333) is about -0.477. So pH ≈ 4.73 - 0.477 ≈ 4.253.

Wait, but wait, did I get the ratio right? 0.00025 / 0.00075 is 1/3. So [A-]/[HA] is 1/3. So log
