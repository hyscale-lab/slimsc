Okay, so I've got this question about a quasar's observations and figuring out its comoving distance from Earth. Hmm, let me try to think this through.

The question says that observations of a quasar in the near-infrared and optical spectrum show a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes have specific characteristics. Oh wait, maybe this peak is related to the Lyman-alpha emission line? Because the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, but when quasars are at high redshifts, that line would be redshifted into the optical or infrared.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line for hydrogen is at about 121.6 nm (1216 Angstroms). If the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that would mean the quasar is at a significant redshift. Let me calculate the redshift factor, z. So z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength. So 790 / 121.6 is approximately... let's see. 121.6 * 6 is about 729.6, which is less than 790. 729.6 is 6x, so 790 is about 6.5x. So z ≈ 6.5 (because 121.6 *6 =729.6, 729.6 + (790-729.6)=60.4 → 60.4/121.6 ≈ 0.5. So z ~ 6.5).

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it accurately. 790 / 121.6 = let's compute that. 790 divided by 121.6. Let's see: 121.6 *6 = 729.6. 790 -729.6 =60.4. So 60.4 /121.6 is 0.497 approx. So z=6.497, about 6.5.

If the quasar's Lyman-alpha line is redshifted to 790 nm, then its redshift z is about 6.5. So now, I need to find the comoving distance to the quasar at redshift z=6.5, given a flat Lambda-CDM universe with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Ωm=0.3, dark energy ΩΛ=0.7.

The comoving distance (DC) is given by the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ωm*(1+z)^3 + ΩΛ). Because the universe is flat, Ωm + ΩΛ ≈ 1, which it is here (0.3 +0.7=1).

So, E(z) = sqrt( (0.3)(1+z)^3 + 0.7 )

Wait, but the integral isn't straightforward. For a given z, I can use an approximation or look up values or use a formula. Alternatively, I remember that for high
