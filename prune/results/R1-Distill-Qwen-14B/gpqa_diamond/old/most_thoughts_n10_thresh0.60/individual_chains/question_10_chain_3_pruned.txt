Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think about what I know regarding planets and density.

First, the question gives four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. The options are labeled A to D, I need to pick which letter corresponds to the correct answer.

Density is mass divided by volume, right? So for each planet, I should calculate its density or compare them based on their mass and size. Wait, but some of them don't give both mass and radius, so maybe I can compare based on mass and radius properties.

Let's look at each option:

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. That's straightforward, same as Earth. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that from school.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but that's already given. So its density is the same as Earth. But wait, is that possible? Because if the mass is 2x but the density is same, then the volume would be (2 Earth masses)/(same density) = 2 Earth volumes. So the radius would be larger. Because volume scales with radius cubed. So a planet with twice Earth's mass and same density would have a radius larger than Earth. But the question is about their densities; here, it's same as Earth. So option b's density is 5.5, same as a.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Wait, composition affects density. If it's same composition, then density should be same as Earth, right? Because composition determines how much mass is packed into the volume. But wait, wait. No, because if the planet is same composition, but more massive, maybe its radius increases. So the density would be similar. Wait, but if you have more mass but same density, the volume increases, so the radius increases. Because density (rho) = mass/volume. So if mass increases but rho is same, volume increases, so radius increases. So in that case, the density would be same as Earth. Hmm, but that's what option c says: same composition, so same density. So its density is 5.5 as well. So same as a and b.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Wait, same composition, so same density as
