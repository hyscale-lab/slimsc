Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

The question gives me phase shifts for different values, specifically δ0 to δ4. The phase shifts are 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13°. Oh wait, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ4. So I guess I'm only considering these five.

The task is to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh right, I remember that the scattering amplitude in quantum mechanics is a complex quantity. The imaginary part is related to the cross-sections or something like that.

Wait, the formula for the scattering amplitude... I think the general expression is something like f(θ) = (1/k) [sum over l ( (2l+1) (e^{iδl} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ) ) ] where δl are the phase shifts and P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But since the question is asking about the direction along the incident beam, I think that's when θ=0°. Because the incident beam direction is when the scattering angle is zero, right?

Wait, when θ=0, the direction is along the beam, so the cosine of θ is 1. So cosθ = 1. Now, the Legendre polynomials P_l(1) are known. I remember that P_l(1) is 1 for any l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for all l, since P_l(1) is the value at the pole, which is 1.

So, the formula for f(0) becomes f(0) = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) (e^{iδl} -1) * 1.

Wait, but wait, the question is about the imaginary part of f(0). So I need to compute Im[f(0)].

Let me write that down: Im[f(0)] = (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) Im[e^{iδl} -1}.

But wait, e^{iδ} -1 can be written as e^{iδ} - e^{i0} = e^{i(δ)} - 1. Alternatively, using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{iδ} -1 = cosδ + i sinδ -1 = (cosδ -1) + i sinδ. Therefore, the imaginary part of (e^{iδ} -1) is sinδ.

So Im[e^{iδl} -1] = sin(δl). So substituting back into the expression for Im[f(0)], it becomes (1/k) sum_{l} (2l+1) sin(δl).

Wait, but what is k? Because the scattering amplitude is often expressed in terms of k, the wave number. But I'm given some energy. The electrons are 50 MeV. Oh, right, the electrons are non-relativistic? Or relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is a lot for electrons. Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is much larger.
