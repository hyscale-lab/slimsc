Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, the setup is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The question is about photometric observationsâ€”the brightness changes as the star rotates, which can look similar to an exoplanet transit. They want to know what exoplanet radius would produce the same brightness variation as this spotted star.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The depth of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The bigger the planet compared to the star, the deeper the dip.

In this case, the star isn't completely uniform because of the spots. The dark spots are cooler, so when they rotate into view, the observed brightness changes. But how do they affect the light curve?

Wait, the problem says that the brightness variations are due to the spots. So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the star's brightness is lower because the spots are cooler and emit less light. But since the spots are on only one hemisphere, as the star rotates, the amount of spotted area visible changes, leading to periodic brightness variations.

But the question is about comparing this to a planet transit. So, the idea is that the observed brightness change from the spots should be the same as if a planet were blocking part of the star.

So, I need to calculate the fractional change in brightness (the signal) caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same fractional change.

The key formula for the transit depth is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar is the star's radius.

But wait, the spots are causing a change. How does the spot coverage affect the brightness?

The filling factor is 20%, so 0.2 of the hemisphere is covered by spots. But wait, since only one hemisphere is spotted, does that mean that the total spotted area is 20% of the hemisphere's area?

Wait, the star emits light from its surface. The effective temperature is Teff =
