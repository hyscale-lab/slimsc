Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about an acid-catalyzed reaction between 3-methylpyrrolidine and compound A to form 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what compound A is and what catalyst is used.

First, I'll try to visualize the starting material and the product. The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine, which is a pyrrolidine ring with a methyl group on the third carbon. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring, so the structure has four CH2 groups and one NH. Wait, no, actually, pyrrolidine is a saturated five-membered ring with four carbons and one nitrogen. So 3-methylpyrrolidine would have a methyl substituent on the third carbon, but wait, pyrrolidine has five atoms, so numbering starts at the nitrogen. So 1 is the nitrogen, then two, three, four, five. So 3-methylpyrrolidine has the methyl on the third carbon.

The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. Hmm, let's parse that name. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl. So cyclohexylidene is the cyclohexane ring with a double bond to a methyl group. Wait, cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene group attached via a double bond. So maybe it's a cyclohexene ring attached to a methyl group which is connected to the pyrrolidine.

Wait, structure time. The product has a substituent at position 1 of the pyrrolidine. Position 1 is the nitrogen. So the substituent is a cyclohexylidenemethyl group. So that's a group that's (cyclohexylidene)-CH2- attached to the nitrogen. Let me draw that mentally. The pyrrolidine ring has the substituent at the nitrogen: CH2 connected to the ring, and that CH2 is connected to a cyclohexylidene group. So the cyclohexylidene is a cyclohexene ring, meaning a six-membered ring with a double bond, perhaps between carbons 1 and 2. So the substituent is a methyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring, but wait, no, the cyclohexylidene is a substituent on the methyl. So the structure is: pyrrolidine's nitrogen is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a cyclohexene ring via a double bond. So the substituent is CH2-Cyclohexene.

Wait, maybe it's like this: the substituent is a cyclohexene ring connected via a methylene group (CH2) to the nitrogen. So the nitrogen has a CH2 group which is connected to a cyclohexene ring. So the structure of the product is a pyrrolidine ring with a substituent at position 1 (the nitrogen) that is a CH2 connected to a cyclohexene group. And the pyrrolidine also has a methyl group at position 3.

So the reaction is between 3-methylpy
