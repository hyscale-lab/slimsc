Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2.

So, the given data is: Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times that of Star_2. Also, the mass is 1.5 times larger. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature, not mass. Oh, right, because mass affects other things like gravity and maybe the star's stage in its lifecycle, but for luminosity, the key factors are radius and temperature.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation, which is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law states that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. So, λ_max * T = constant. Since the λ_max is the same for both stars, that means their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T must be the same. Because the constant is the same for both.

Wait, but wait. I remember that the peak observed wavelength for a star's emission is related to its temperature. So, if both have the same λ_max, then T1 = T2. So, both stars have the same temperature. That makes sense.

Then, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s, and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Radial velocity would affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right, if a star is moving towards us, the light is blueshifted, and if moving away, it's redshifted. But in this problem, since the radial velocities are given, and the observed wavelengths (peak) are same, maybe the Doppler shift isn't affecting the calculation of temperature? Or perhaps the problem is telling us that after accounting for Doppler shift, the peak wavelengths are same. Wait, maybe the problem statement is a bit ambiguous here.

Wait, the question says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest and found they are the same. So the observed wavelengths (λ_observed) are the same. But the actual emitted wavelengths (λ_emitted) would depend on the star's temperature. So, if star 2 is moving at 700 km/s, perhaps that affects the observed λ_max. But the problem says that the observed wavelengths are the same, so maybe we have to correct for the Doppler effect when considering their actual temperatures?

Wait, maybe not. Because the problem says that the stars' peak wavelengths as observed are the same. So perhaps their emitted wavelengths are different, but due to Doppler shift, the observed ones are same.

Wait, that could complicate things. Let me think. So, the emitted peak wavelength is λ_emit = constant / T. But due to Doppler shift, the observed wavelength is λ_obs = λ_emit * sqrt( (1 + v_r) / (1 - v_r) ) ) or something like that. Or maybe it's a simple linear approximation if velocities are small compared to light speed. Hmm. Wait, 700 km/s is a significant fraction of the speed of light
