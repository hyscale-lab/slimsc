Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, starting from benzene. I need to figure out which sequence of reactions among the options A to D will give this compound in high yield.

First, let me visualize the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one), and the phenyl ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 is bromo, and position 5 is nitro. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring, right? So, the substituents would be in the meta positions relative to each other. Let me think: the phenyl group attached to the ketone is at the 1 position of the benzene ring. So, the substituents are at 3 and 5 positions relative to that point.

Wait, actually, when the ketone is on the benzene ring, the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, the benzene ring has a ketone group (as a substituent) at position 1, a bromine at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. So, the ring has three substituents: COCH3 (from ethan-1-one), Br, and NO2. Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-, but when attached to the benzene, it's a ketone substituent, so it's a C=O with a methyl group attached, making it a ketone attached to the benzene. So, the substituent on the benzene is -COCH3, right?

Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? Wait, no, wait. No. Ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-R, but in this case, since it's 1-(phenyl)ethan-1-one, the structure is (Ph)-C(=O)-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but when it's 1-(substituted)ethan
