Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think it through. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H, which is given as ε times the dot product of the vector σ and n. Oh right, σ is the Pauli matrices, and n is a unit vector. 

Wait, the Pauli matrices... Each component σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are 2x2 matrices, right? So the dot product would be like σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. And since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

So H is ε multiplied by that sum. So H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Since σ·n is a 2x2 matrix, H is also a 2x2 matrix. 

I remember that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1 times some factor. But when you combine them with coefficients, like a linear combination, the eigenvalues of that combination might not be straightforward. Wait, but in this case, H is a scaled version of that combination.

Wait, let me think about the general case. For a spin-½ particle, the Hamiltonian can be expressed in terms of σ·n. The eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1 because each Pauli matrix squares to identity, and the sum here is like a vector in spin space. Because n is a unit vector, the term σ·n is a matrix with eigenvalues ±1. 

So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by those, so ±ε? Because H is ε times σ·n, and if σ·n has eigenvalues ±1, then H's eigenvalues are ±ε.

Let me make sure. The eigenvalues of a matrix A multiplied by a scalar c are c times the eigenvalues of A. So if A has eigenvalues λ, then cA has eigenvalues cλ.

So σ·n has eigenvalues ±1. So H = ε (σ·n) would have eigenvalues ε*(1) and ε*(-1), which are ε and -ε. 

Looking at the options, option B says +ε and -ε. So that's probably the right answer. 

Wait, what about other options? Option C has ε multiplied by hbar/2. Oh, but in the given problem, the Hamiltonian is just ε σ·n. Are there any factors of hbar involved? Well, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, but the Hamiltonian has dimensions of energy. So ε must have energy dimensions. But in the standard spin Hamiltonian, for example, the Zeeman term is something like -μ·B, where μ has factors of e and ħ. Hmm. But in our case, H is given as ε σ·n. So maybe ε already includes any necessary constants, like the magnetic moment or something. 

In the problem, the question is about the eigenvalues. So regardless of the constants, as long as H is ε times a matrix with eigenvalues ±1, so the eigenvalues are ±ε. So the answer is B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is an energy constant, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices: 

\[
\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z,
\]

where \(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1\). Each Pauli matrix (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\), and the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are also \(\pm 1\) because \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. 

The Hamiltonian \(H\) is \(\varepsilon\) times \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), so the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Since the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are:

\[
\pm \varepsilon.
\]

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\), not dimensionless.
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as shown above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because there is no factor of \(\hbar/2\) in the given Hamiltonian.
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
