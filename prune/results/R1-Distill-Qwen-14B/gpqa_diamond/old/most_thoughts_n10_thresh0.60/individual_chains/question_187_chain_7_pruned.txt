Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with an 8m VLT telescope. Hmm, I need to figure out how many of the listed stars meet the required signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. 

First, I should understand what ESPRESSO is capable of. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used for studying exoplanets and stellar dynamics. It's mounted on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics, so maybe I should recall some key points about its performance.

Wait, I think ESPRESSO has different modes, but for this question, I probably need to focus on its sensitivity, especially in terms of how bright a star needs to be to achieve a certain S/N. The S/N ratio depends on factors like the star's brightness (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, and the instrument's efficiency. 

The question gives me six options, a) to f), each describing a star with different properties. I need to evaluate each to see if they can be detected by ESPRESSO with the given parameters.

Let me list the stars:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, Absolute V mag 15, distance 10 pc
d) Same RA, DEC, abs mag 15, distance 200 pc
e) Same, distance 5 pc
f) Same, 50 pc

I think I'll calculate the apparent magnitude (m) for each star, as the brightness (and thus S/N) depends on that. The formula to convert absolute magnitude (M) to apparent magnitude (m) is: 

m = M + 5 + 5 log₁₀(d/10)

where d is the distance in parsecs.

So for each star, I can compute m, then determine if the S/N is sufficient.

But wait, do I have the necessary information about ESPRESSO's sensitivity? I think I need to know the typical S/N ESPRESSO can achieve per pixel for a given star's magnitude. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the concept that brighter stars (lower magnitudes) will be more easily detected because they have higher S/N.
