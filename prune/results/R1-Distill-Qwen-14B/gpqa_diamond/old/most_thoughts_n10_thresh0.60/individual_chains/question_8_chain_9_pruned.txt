Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about white lupine and resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease. So they did an experiment with knock-out mutants for three genes: G1, G2, G3. They also made double mutants, like g1g2, etc. The question is about the interaction between these genes and their function in disease resistance.

The results they got are about the resistance levels of each mutant compared to the wild-type. The wild-type is at 100% resistance. The mutants have varying percentages: g1 is 75%, g2 is 0%, g3 is 50%, g1g3 is 10%, g2g3 is 0%, and g1g2 is 0%. 

So, I need to figure out what these results mean about the gene interactions. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a different conclusion about which gene is a transcription factor, whether there's pleiotropy, or gene redundancy, and epistasis relationships.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on the presence of one or more 'modifier genes'. So gene A is epistatic to gene B if the phenotype of gene B is visible only when gene A is present. 

Also, if a gene's mutation leads to a more severe phenotype than the sum of its individual effects, it might be showing epistatic interactions. For example, if a double mutant is worse than either single mutant, that might indicate epistasis.

Looking at the data:

- g1 is 75%: so it's less resistant than wild-type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance, meaning G1 is probably involved in resistance.
- g2 is 0%: no resistance. So G2 is critical; without it, plants can't resist the disease at all.
- g3 is 50%: lower resistance, but not as bad as g2.
- The double mutants: 
   - g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
   - g1g3: 10% (worse than either single)
   - g2g3: 0% (same as g2)

Hmm. So looking at the double mutants, when G2 is knocked out (g2), any double mutant (g1g2, g2g3) has 0% resistance. So G2 is essential because without it, resistance is lost completely. That suggests that G2 is upstream, perhaps a transcription factor that activates other genes. Because if G2 isn't working, maybe none of the downstream genes can be expressed properly.

Wait, but G2's single mutant is 0% — that's as bad as the wild type? No, wait, the wild type is 100%, so g2 is 0% resistance, which is the worst. So without G2, the plant can't resist the disease at all.

Looking at the double mutants: when you have g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. So maybe G1 is downstream of G2. Because if G2 is not working, knocking out G1 doesn't make it any worse. So the effect of G1 is only seen when G2 is functional.

Wait, no. If G2 is a transcription factor upstream of G1, then without G2 (g2), G1 can't be activated. So knocking out G1 when G2 is already knocked out wouldn't change anything. That fits with g1g2 being 0% — same as g2. So G1 is only effective when G2 is present. Therefore, G2 is epistatic to G1 because the phenotype of G1 depends on G2.

Similarly, looking at g3: 50% resistance. So knocking out G3 alone reduces resistance but not completely. Now, the double mutant g2g3 is 0%, same as g2. So even if G3 is knocked out, but G2 is also out, the resistance is 0%. So perhaps G3 is downstream of G2 as well. Because without G2, G3 can't do anything. So G2 is epistatic over G3.

Wait, but what about the double mutant g1g3? That's 10%, which is worse than either single. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is lower than either single. Hmm. So G1 and G3 might be in parallel pathways, perhaps. But wait, without G2, both are non-functional. 

Wait, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3. Let me think about that. So in a wild-type, G2 makes G1 and G3 proteins. If G2 is knocked out (g2), neither G1 nor G3 is produced, so the plant can't resist the disease. 

If G1 is knocked out (g1), then G2 can still make G3. So the resistance would depend on G3. G1's single mutant is 75% — maybe G3 contributes to the remaining 25% resistance. Because with G1 out, but G3 present (since G2 is functional), resistance is 75% (so G3 might be responsible for 25% of the resistance, and G1 for 75%? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe G2 activates G3, and G1 is in a different pathway.)

Wait, maybe G2 activates G1, which in turn activates G3. Or perhaps G2 activates G1 and G3 separately. Let me think. 

But the data says that
