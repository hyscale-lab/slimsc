Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Alright, the question is about an alien astronaut traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at a speed of 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the journey would take from their perspective. The options suggest either they die before reaching, or one of the longer time frames.

Hmm, wait. So the key here is that it's from the astronaut's point of view. That means I need to consider time dilation effects from special relativity. Because when someone is moving at speeds close to the speed of light, their own experienced time (proper time) is less than the time measured in the stationary frame.

But wait, how do I calculate this? I remember the time dilation formula: the proper time (tau) is equal to the coordinate time (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 - v²/c²). Or wait, is it the other way around? Let me think. The formula is tau = t * sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). So tau is the time experienced by the astronaut, and t is the time measured in Earth's frame.

Wait, no, wait. No, actually, from Earth's perspective, the spacecraft is moving at high speed, so the time experienced on Earth would be much longer. But the astronaut's own clock would run slower. Wait, no—that's not right. Wait, from the astronaut's frame, Earth is moving towards them at 0.99999987c. So the distance they need to cover is contracted. Therefore, the time experienced by the astronaut would be less.

Wait, maybe I should think about the distance first. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a dwarf galaxy, I think. Its distance from Earth is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years. So let's take an average, say about 163,000 light-years. Wait, wait, no—I think the average is about 160,000 light-years, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to not get bogged down by the exact distance but use the given speed
