Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of expectation values and spin operators. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. So σz is the Pauli z-matrix, right? Which has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ respectively.

The question asks for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation values. I think the expectation value of an operator is the average value you'd measure if you measured that observable many times on the same state. So for any operator O, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩.

So I need to compute ⟨10σz + 5σx⟩. But wait, expectation values are linear, right? So that should be 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That makes it easier because I can compute each part separately.

Let me write down the state ψ first. ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are orthonormal, this state is properly normalized because (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So that's good, no need to worry about normalization constants.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Since σz |↑⟩ = +1 |↑⟩ and σz |↓⟩ = -1 |↓⟩. The expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The probability of |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and the eigenvalue is +1. So that part contributes 0.25 * 1 = 0.25.

The probability of |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2 = (3/4) = 0.75. The eigenvalue here is -1. So this contributes 0.75 * (-1) = -0.75.

Adding them together: 0.25 + (-0.75) = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now, moving on to ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli x-matrix. Its eigenstates are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but rather some superpositions. So I can't directly compute it using the same method as with σz. I think I need to calculate the expectation value using the state's components.

The Pauli x operator is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when applied to |↑⟩, which is [1; 0], it becomes [0;1], which is |↓⟩. Similarly, σx |↓⟩ is |↑⟩.

Wait, but for expectation
