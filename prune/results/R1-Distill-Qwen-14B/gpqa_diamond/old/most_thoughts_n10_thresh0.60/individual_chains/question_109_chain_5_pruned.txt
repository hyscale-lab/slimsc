Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a bound system of two nucleons. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that two nucleons (NN) are in a 1S0 state and emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to determine which partial wave is not permitted, considering conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the given condition. So, the equation T = S + L + 1 mod 2. Oh, I think T is the isospin, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So for the final state, T is 0.

Let me think about what the initial state is. The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 would mean 2(0)+1 = 1, so S=0, L=0 (since S is the spin, which is 0 here). And J is 0 as well. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0. And the isospin T for the initial state? Well, it's a singlet state, so T=0 because nucleons in an S-state (like 1S0) are in a singlet isospin state. But wait, is that always the case? I think for NN systems, the ground state is a singlet in isospin, so T=0 initially.

Wait, no, wait. The question says that the system emits a particle X, so the initial state is NN in 1S0, and the final state is NN plus X. Oh, but the question is about the final NN state's T, which is given as 0. So the initial NN T and the final NN T are both 0?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase: The system was initially in a state where NN is 1S0. Then, it emits a particle X. So the final state is NN plus X. But the question is about the NN state after emission. So
