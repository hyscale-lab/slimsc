Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with its symmetry along the z-axis. Because it oscillates, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. The problem is about the radiated power in the radiation zone, particularly the fraction of the maximum power radiated at a specific angle θ, which is 30 degrees here.

The question gives four options, each providing a fraction and a possible form of the function f, which represents the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of λ and θ. The goal is to find the correct fraction and the form of f.

Hmm, I remember that when a charge distribution oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the source. Since the charge is spheroidal and symmetric along the z-axis, I think the radiation pattern should have some symmetry as well. Maybe it's similar to an electric dipole's radiation?

Wait, right. For a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator, perpendicular to the axis, and minimum along the axis. So, the power radiated at a particular angle θ from the z-axis would be maximum when θ is 90 degrees, and zero at θ=0 and θ=180, but that's for a pure dipole. But this is an oscillating charge distribution, which might be like a higher mult pole?

Alternatively, maybe it's a dipole. So, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern is given by the cosine squared law. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to cos^2θ, I believe. Wait, or is it sin^2θ? Wait no, for the dipole, the radiation intensity is proportional to sin^2θ, but wait, no. Let me think again.

The radiation intensity for an electric dipole is given by the formula: I think the power per unit solid angle (the intensity) is proportional to (sinθ)^2. Or wait, no. Wait, the dipole's radiation pattern peaks at 90 degrees, so when θ is 90, sinθ is 1. So, yes, I think the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum intensity is at θ=90 degrees. At θ=0, it's zero.

So in this problem, the maximum power is A. So when θ is 90 degrees, the power would be at its maximum, which is A. But wait, the question says the maximum power is A. So, when θ=0, the power is zero, and at θ=90, it's maximum. So the fraction of A at θ=30 degrees would be the ratio of the power at that angle to the maximum power.

But wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle as a function of λ and θ. So, the function f would probably include terms depending on λ and θ. Also, the problem states that the maximum power is A, so the function f must have a maximum value of A.

Wait, no. The question says, the maximum power, which is A, so the function f would have a maximum at some θ, which is the point
