Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

First, the question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. Let's see what each part tells me.

Compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. A triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm integrating for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting can tell us about neighboring protons. A triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons, and a quartet would come from coupling with three protons. Also, the chemical shifts can indicate what kind of groups we're dealing with. 

Low ppm values like 0.9 and 1.3 are typical for methyl or ethyl groups. So for the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H), that's likely two methyl groups (each with 3H) that are next to something else. The quartet at 1.3 (4H) is probably an ethyl group because each CH2 has 2H, so two of them would make 4H. Wait, but wait, the quartet is for 4H. So maybe it's a CH2CH2 group, but how does that fit?

Wait, maybe it's an ethyl group. If the triplet is from two methyl groups adjacent to a CH2, which is adjacent to another CH2. Let me think: in a structure like (CH3)2CHCH2CH2...? Or perhaps it's a diethyl group in some configuration.

Wait, another possibility: the 4H quartet is from a CH2CH2 group. So, a methylene next to another methylene. So perhaps a structure like CH2CH2 where the middle is connected to something else. But for NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring H's. The quartet at 1.3 ppm (4H) would mean each of those H's is next to a CH2 with 2H. Wait, no, quartet comes from being split by a triplet, so maybe each H is next to a group with 3H. Oh wait, no, wait: the number of peaks in the splitting is determined by the number of neighboring H's plus one. So a quartet means each H is adjacent to a group with 3 H's
