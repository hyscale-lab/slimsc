Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and mean free paths. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to work through it.

So the scenario is about Mike designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a vacuum pump to get an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr, which I think is really low. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because they can interfere with the electron beam, right?

He measures the mean free path of the gas molecules as λ1. Mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. I remember the formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2)*π*d²*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. So the mean free path depends on temperature, pressure, and the size of the molecules.

But then when he turns on the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The question is why. The temperature is the same, so T hasn't changed. So the only variables might be pressure or the presence of the electron beam affecting the gas.

Wait, but the pressure in the chamber is supposed to be ultra-high vacuum. Some gas particles are present, but the pressure is still very low. When he starts the electron beam, does that affect the pressure somehow?

Oh, wait! The electron beam has a lot of energy because the accelerating voltage is 1000 kV. The electrons are moving really fast. I remember that when charged particles like electrons move through a gas, they can cause gas ionization. The electrons collide with gas molecules and knock off electrons, creating ions.

So if the gas particles are ionized, they become charged. Charged particles interact more strongly with the electron beam, but also, in a vacuum, ions may behave differently. I think that when gas molecules are ionized, the mean free path changes because the effective diameter of the particles might change, or maybe the way they scatter electrons changes.

Wait, mean free path is determined by the number of collisions a molecule has. If the gas is neutral, collisions are due to neutral-neutral interactions. But if they're ionized, perhaps the ions have different cross-sections for scattering electrons.

But another angle: the electron beam itself might create more ionization, which could increase the effective pressure because the ions are created and contribute to the gas density. Or maybe the ions are accelerated by the electric fields in the electron beam, causing them to move more, perhaps leading to more collisions. Alternatively, maybe the electron beam doesn't directly change the pressure but causes the gas ions to have different behaviors.

Wait, another thought: when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are more likely to be ionized. Ionized particles (ions) have a different mean free path than neutral molecules. Because ions have a charge, they might collide more frequently with each other or with the walls of the chamber, depending on the setup.

Oh, but wait, the pressure is already super low, so the number density is really low. The mean free path λ1 is based on the assumption that the gas is neutral. When the beam is on, more ionization happens, which could lead to more frequent collisions because ions might interact differently. But wait, if the ions are produced, does that increase the number of particles, thus reducing the mean free path? Because an increase in the number of particles (n) would decrease λ, since λ is inversely proportional to n.

Wait, the number density n is P/(k*T). If the pressure P is the same, n is the same. But if ionization increases, the number of charged particles increases. Does that affect the mean free path? Because ionized particles might have a different collision cross-section.

Wait, but in the original calculation, λ1 was determined based on the pressure, temperature, and the size of the neutral gas molecules. When ionization occurs, the effective diameter for collisions (d) for charged species might be larger because the ions have a larger effective size due to their charge. Alternatively, charged particles might interact via Coulomb forces, which are longer-range, so the collision cross-section could increase.

So if d increases, then the mean free path λ would decrease because λ is proportional to 1/(d²). So if d becomes larger (because the gas is ionized and the effective diameter is bigger), λ would be smaller than before.

But wait, is the ionization affecting the pressure? Because when the electron beam is on, more ionization occurs. Ions could be accelerated towards the walls, possibly leading to gas being pumped out more, but in an ultra-high vacuum system, the pumps are already working, but maybe not immediately. Alternatively, the presence of ions might change the pressure because ions can move more freely, but in a vacuum, perhaps the pressure doesn't change much because it's already so low.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam causes the gas to have a higher effective pressure because the ions are moving faster or something. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't change the pressure but affects the mean free path by causing more frequent collisions.

Wait, Mike's observation is that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path is now λ2, which is different from λ1. The question is, is λ2 larger or smaller than λ1?

From earlier reasoning, if ionization increases, the effective collision cross-section (d) increases, which would make λ smaller. So λ2 would be less than λ1, meaning λ2 < λ1.

So the answer should be option C: λ2 < λ1.

Another angle: the mean free path is determined by the scattering of the electron beam by the gas molecules. When the beam is on, the electrons are interacting with the gas, possibly causing more scattering, which might imply more collisions. But wait, the mean free path is about how far a gas molecule travels before colliding. So if the gas molecules are causing more scattering, that could imply that the electrons are colliding more often, but how does that affect the gas molecules' mean free path?

Wait, perhaps the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves is being measured. If the gas molecules are ionized, the way they move might change. For example, ions could have different velocities or be more likely to stick to surfaces or other ions. But in a vacuum, maybe they just move more freely, but with charged interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam causes the gas to heat up, but the question says the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

So, going back, mean free path formula: λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d²*P). If pressure P is the same, and T is same, but d increases because the gas is ionized, then λ would decrease. So λ2 is less than λ1, so option C.


The scenario involves a high-resolution transmission electron microscope operating in an ultra-high vacuum (< 10^-9 Torr). Mike measures the mean free path of gas molecules in the sample compartment as λ1 under vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The question asks whether λ2 is greater than, equal to, or less than λ1.

The mean free path (λ) is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 P}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(P\) is the pressure. Since the temperature remains constant, any change in λ depends on changes in \(d\) or \(P\).

When the electron beam is turned on, ionization of gas molecules occurs due to the high-energy electrons. Ionized particles (ions) have different properties compared to neutral molecules. Specifically, the effective collision cross-section (\(d\)) increases because ions interact via Coulomb forces, which are longer-range and result in larger effective diameters. Additionally, the mean free path depends inversely on the square of the effective diameter (\(d^2\)), so an increase in \(d\) leads to a decrease in λ.

Thus, λ2, the mean free path under the influence of the electron beam, is smaller than λ1, the mean free path in the neutral gas state. This conclusion aligns with the reasoning that ionization increases the effective collision cross-section, reducing the mean free path.
