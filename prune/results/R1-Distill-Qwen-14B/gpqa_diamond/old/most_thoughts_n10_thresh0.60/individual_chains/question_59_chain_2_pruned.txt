Okay, I need to find the pH of this solution. Hmm, the solution is made by mixing three different solutions: CH3COOH, HCl, and Ba(OH)2. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should probably figure out the moles of each acid and base first.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each component. 

First, CH3COOH. It's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 M × 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but since it's the only acid in the list (wait, no, HCl is also an acid). Oh right, so I have two acids and a base.

Next, HCl. It's 400 mL of 0.2 M. So 0.2 × 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl-.

Then, Ba(OH)2. It's 300 mL of 0.3 M. Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- here are 0.3 × 0.3 × 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 0.3 L (300 mL). Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 × 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-. Yeah, that's right.

Now I need to see if the acids and bases neutralize each other. Let's combine the acids first. CH3COOH and HCl are both acids, so their H+ ions will add up.

CH3COOH gives 0.05 moles of H+ (since it's a weak acid, but in the initial neutralization, it can donate H+). Wait, but wait, no. For neutralization, when mixing acids and bases, the H+ from all acids react with OH- from all bases. So I should sum all H+ from acids and all OH- from bases, then see which is in excess.

Wait, but H+ comes from both CH3COOH and HCl. So total H+ = H+ from CH3COOH + H+ from HCl.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in a solution, it doesn't fully dissociate. However, when considering neutralization reactions, the H+ from CH3COOH may react with OH- from the base. But I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should treat the H+ from CH3COOH as available
