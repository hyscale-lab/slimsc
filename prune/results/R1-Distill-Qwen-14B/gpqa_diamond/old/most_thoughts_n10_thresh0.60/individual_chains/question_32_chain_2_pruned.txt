Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of a nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is defined as Lithium (Li) with 3 neutrons. The options are given in GeV, and I need to choose the correct one. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to figure out the mass of the nucleus X. Since it's Lithium with 3 neutrons, that means it's a specific isotope. Lithium usually has 3 protons, right? So, if it's Li with 3 neutrons, then the atomic number is 3 (protons) and the mass number is 3 + 3 = 6. So, it's Li-6.

Wait, let me confirm that. Lithium typically has 3 protons. So Li-6 would have 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass number A is 6. Got it.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. But wait, how do I calculate that? I think I can approximate the mass using the sum of protons and neutrons. Each proton has a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c², and neutrons are about the same, around 939 MeV/c². But sometimes, it's easier to use the average, like 938.5 MeV each.

So, the mass of Li-6 would be the sum of the masses of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Let me compute that. 3 * 938 + 3 * 939. Wait, wait, but that might not be precise because in reality, nuclei have binding energy, so the actual mass is a bit less than the sum of individual nucleon masses. But for heavy ions in collider experiments, the mass is often approximated as the sum of the constituent nucleons' masses. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, I don't have exact values memorized, but maybe I can approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 is about 6.016 amu. Oh wait, yes, because each amu is approximately 93
