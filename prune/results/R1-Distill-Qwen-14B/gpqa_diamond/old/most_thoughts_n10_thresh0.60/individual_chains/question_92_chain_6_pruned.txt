Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation of this organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. Maybe it's a diene or something with conjugated double bonds?

Wait, the question gives me some bond energies and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon. Oh right, enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I need to break down the compound into its constituent atoms and use bond energies to calculate the total.

The formula for the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf°) using bond energies is: 

ΔHf° = Σ (Bond energies of reactants) - Σ (Bond energies of products)

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated by considering the bonds broken in the reactants (elements) and the bonds formed in the product (the compound). Or maybe I should think in terms of the energy required to break all bonds in the elements and the energy released when forming bonds in the compound.

Wait, more accurately, the enthalpy of formation can be found using the formula:

ΔHf° = [Σ (Bond energies of all bonds broken in elements)] - [Σ (Bond energies of all bonds formed in the compound)]

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. To
