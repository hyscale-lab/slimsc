Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about a solution that's a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds. Both have the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then, there are three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Let me break this down. First, the molecular formula is C10H14. For aromatic compounds, the degree of unsaturation can help. Each benzene ring gives 4 degrees (since benzene is C6H6, which is 3 double bonds equivalent plus a ring). So for benzene, 4 degrees. The rest would be from substituents. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation:

The formula is C10H14. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) can be calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, X=0, N=0. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2=4. So DoU is 4. Well, benzene already gives 4, so each compound must be a mono-substituted benzene with a substituent that is a single substituent because that's the only way to have one ring and the substituent. Wait, but wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6, so substituents contribute C4H8.

Wait, 10-6=4 carbons in substituents, 14-6=8 hydrogens. So substituents are C4H8. Let's think about possible substituents. A C4H8 group could be two ethyl groups (each ethyl is C2H5), so maybe diethyl? Or maybe a single substituent like an isopropyl or something else, but wait diethyl would be (C2H5)2, which is C4H10, but our substituent has C4H8, which is two less hydrogens. Hmm, so maybe it's a single substituent that's -OCH2CH2CH2CH3? No, that's more complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent that is a ring with some branching? Wait, perhaps the substituent is a single group attached to the benzene, and that group is something like -CH2CH2CH2CH3? But that's a straight chain, but that would be C4H9, which wouldn't fit. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C10H14 is similar to a substituted benzene with two substituents each being ethyl groups. Because for diethylbenzene, when two ethyl groups are attached, the formula would be C6H5(C2H5)2 â†’ C6 + 2*(C2) = C10. Hydrogens: benzene has 5 H (if each ethyl is para?), but wait, actually, diethylbenzene would have C6H5-C2H5 groups. Let me calculate the H.

Wait, benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group is -C2H5, which has 5 H each. So two ethyl groups would contribute 10 H, but wait, the benzene would have 4 H left. So 4 +10 =14 H. So molecular formula would be C6 + 2*2 = C10, and H would be 14. Oh, wait wait: each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So, each ethyl contributes 2+3=5 H. So two ethyls contribute 10 H. Benzene has 6 H. So 6+10=16 H, but the formula is C10H14. So that's 2 H less. Hmm, perhaps I'm not considering the substitution correctly.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a single group with C4H8. Let me think. For example, a substituent could be a (CH2)2CH2 group? No, that's more carbons. Alternatively, maybe a substituent like -CH2CH2CH2CH3, but that would be a pentyl group, which is C5. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ring with branching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the substituent is a methyl group and another substituent. No, because the molecular formula is C10H14, which is C6H5 with four more carbons. So perhaps the substituent is a group that's C4H8, which
