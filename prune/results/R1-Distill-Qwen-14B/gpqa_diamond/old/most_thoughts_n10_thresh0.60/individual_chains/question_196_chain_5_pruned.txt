Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of the mass in a 1D relativistic harmonic oscillator. The oscillator has mass m and maximum amplitude A. Oh wait, and it obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct formula for v_max.

Wait, so I remember that in the classical case, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency. But since this is relativistic, I can't just use the classical formula. I need to consider relativistic effects, which probably means using the relativistic expressions for energy and momentum.

In the relativistic scenario, the total energy of the oscillator would be the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, no, in the case of a harmonic oscillator, the energy is quantized, but since this is an oscillator, perhaps it's a classical problem, so energy is continuous.

Wait, the maximum speed would occur when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv², right? Because at high speeds, we have to use the relativistic kinetic energy formula.

So the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kA². Because at maximum displacement A, all the energy is potential. Then, when it's at the equilibrium position,
