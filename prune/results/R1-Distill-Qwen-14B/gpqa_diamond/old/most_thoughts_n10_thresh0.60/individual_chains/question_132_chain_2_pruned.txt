Okay, so I've got this NMR question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that we have a solution with a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different pairs of tetramethylbenzenes and one with diethyl.

Hmm, so let me break it down. The aromatic region is showing two singlets. Wait, aromatic protons usually show up between 6.5-8.5 ppm, depending on substitution. But why two singlets? Each singlet must come from equivalent protons in a symmetrical structure.

Since the mixture is 1:1, the integration ratio of 1:1 for the two singlets suggests that each compound contributes equally. But wait, each compound's own aromatic protons would give a certain pattern. Because each is present in a 1:1 ratio, the NMR would show each's signals, but perhaps overlapping if they're the same.

Wait, but the total integration for the aromatic region is two signals, each singlet, 1:1. So each compound has a single set of aromatic protons, each giving a singlet. So each of the two compounds in the mixture
