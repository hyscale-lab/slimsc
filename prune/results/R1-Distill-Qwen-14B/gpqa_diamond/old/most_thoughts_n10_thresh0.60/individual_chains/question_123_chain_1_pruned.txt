Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. 

The question says that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, but both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, so we can use special relativity principles here because they're both inertial frames.

Wait, but the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, so we're dealing with time dilation and length contraction maybe?

Wait, let's clarify. The ejecta is moving relative to the galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the galaxy in the galaxy's frame, right? Because in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at that speed, and vice versa.

Wait no, actually, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center (since from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at that speed). So the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. That's a pretty high speed, so relativistic effects are significant.

The question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the galaxy's frame when 5
