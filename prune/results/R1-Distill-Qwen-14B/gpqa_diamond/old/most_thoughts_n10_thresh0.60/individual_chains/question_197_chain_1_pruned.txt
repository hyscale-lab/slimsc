Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used for something like the hydrolysis of an ester, but wait, no, wait. Oh yeah, when you have an ester reacting with HI and red phosphorus, that's a specific reaction. Red phosphorus is used to prevent the formation of side products, like when breaking esters. So, maybe it's an acid-catalyzed hydrolysis? Or wait, is it a cleavage reaction?

Wait, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the cleavage of the C-O bond in esters. Oh right! The reaction is called the hydrolysis of esters using HI and red phosphorus. So, the ester group breaks down. But wait, wait, no, that's not right. Oh right, the reaction of esters with HI in the presence of red phosphorus actually cleaves the ester into an acid and an alcohol. So, for example, an ester RCOOR' would react to form RCOOH and R'OH. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, so maybe I should think more about that.

But first, I need to figure out what compound X is. The question gives IR and NMR data. Let me look at the IR data first.

IR data:
- 3400â€“2500 cm-1: That's a broad region, probably O-H stretching. The broadness suggests it's an alcohol or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have a very broad O-H around 2500-3300. But wait, another possibility is that the compound has an alcohol group. But wait, the other IR peaks are at 1720, 1610, and 1450 cm-1.

The 1720 cm-1 peak suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an ester. Esters have strong absorption around 1720-1740. So maybe X is an ester? Because 1720 is right in the ester region. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions are in
