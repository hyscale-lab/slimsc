Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator given a particular state. 

Hmm, let me see. The problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z.

Wait, right, the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared, then take the square root of their difference.

But wait, the state given is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly say anything about ⟨P_z⟩, I have to compute it from the state.

First, let me write down the state vector. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I should make sure it's normalized. Let me check the sum of squares: (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 + 1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So it's normalized, good.

Now, the P_z operator's matrix is given as:
P_z = [ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, 0 ],
         [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Let me compute that. The state is a column vector, so ψ = [a, b, c] where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

So P_z acting on ψ is:

First component: ħ * a = ħ (-1/2)
Second component: 0
Third component: -ħ * c = (-ħ)(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z |ψ⟩ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ is the dot product of ψ† and P_z |ψ⟩.

So, that's a*( -ħ/2 ) + b*0 + c*( ħ/2 )

Substituting a, b, c:

(-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2 )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4
Second term: 0
Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = - ħ/4

Adding them together: ħ/4 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩? Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just each diagonal element squared. So the matrix P_z² will have entries (ħ)^2, 0, (-ħ)^2 → ħ², 0, ħ².

So P_z² |ψ⟩ is [ (ħ²) * a, 0, (ħ²) * c ]^T.

So, again, compute ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩:

a² * ħ² + c² * ħ²

Because the middle term is zero.

So, a² = (1/4), c² = (1/4). So:

(1/4) ħ² + (1/4) ħ² = (2/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is (1/2) ħ².

Now, the uncertainty ΔP_z is sqrt( ⟨P_z²⟩ - (⟨P_z⟩ )² ). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is zero, it's just sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes when you have operators, you might need to consider more, but in this case, since the state is a vector in the given basis, and P_z is diagonal in this basis, the calculations are straightforward.

So the uncertainty is ħ / sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ of the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

The given state is $|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1/2 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/2 \end{bmatrix}$, which is normalized since the sum of the squares of its components is 1. The matrix for $P_z$ is:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value $\langle P_z \rangle$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle.
\]

Applying $P_z$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\hbar/2 \\ 0 \\ \hbar/2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Taking the dot product with $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = (-1/2)(-\hbar/2) + (1/\sqrt{2})(0) + (-1/2)(\hbar/2).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The matrix for $P_z^2$ is:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Applying $P_z^2$ to $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 (-1/2) \\ 0 \\ \hbar^2 (-1/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Taking the dot product with $|\psi\rangle$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = (-1/2)^2 \hbar^2 + (1/\sqrt{2})^2 (0) + (-1/2)^2 \hbar^2.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Since $\langle P_z \rangle = 0$, we have:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Thus, the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ is $\hbar / \sqrt{2}$.

Answer: B
