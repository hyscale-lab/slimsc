Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about determining which system is more massive and by what factor. So, the systems are system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipsing periods, but with different durations. System_1 has a period of 2 years, and system_2 has 1 year. Wait, wait, no, the periods are the time between two primary eclipses. Oh, right, so the orbital period is the same as the eclipse period because eclipses happen when the stars pass in front of each other, so their orbital period is the same as the eclipse period.

So, system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year. That's an important point.

Then there are radial velocity (RV) observations. For system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. RV amplitudes are the maximum velocities each star has towards or away from us. So, the more massive star would have a smaller RV amplitude, because the more massive object has a smaller orbit. Wait, because in a binary system, the two stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so a smaller velocity change, lower RV amplitude. The less massive star moves more, higher RV amplitude.

So, in system_1, star A has 10 km/s, star B 5. So star A's velocity is higher, meaning it's the less massive one. So the more massive star in system_1 is the one with 5 km/s. Wait, no, wait. Because the more massive star has a smaller orbit. So, the star with the smaller velocity is the more massive one. So, in system_1, the 5 km/s star is more massive, and the 10 km/s is less. Similarly, in system_2, the 10 km/s star is more massive than the 15 km/s one.

Wait, but wait, the mass ratio is inversely related to the velocity ratio. Because in a binary system, the two stars orbit the center of mass. So, m1 * a1 = m2 * a2, where a is the orbital radius. The velocities are proportional to a
