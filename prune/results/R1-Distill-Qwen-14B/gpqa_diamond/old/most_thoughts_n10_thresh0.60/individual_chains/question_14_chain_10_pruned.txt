Okay, so I've got this question about ChIP-seq experiments and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see, the question is about why some peaks disappear when using a different fixation method.

So, the setup is that they did a ChIP-seq on PFA-fixed B cells with an antibody against IKAROS, a transcription factor. After processing, they saw certain peaks, but when they switched to PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. The question is where these peaks are most likely located.

Hmm. I remember that in ChIP-seq experiments, the way the cells are fixed can affect the results. So, what's the difference between PFA and PFA+DSG? PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a crosslinker. It's commonly used to fix proteins to DNA, making sure that proteins are attached to the DNA they're bound to at the time of fixation. But sometimes, especially for proteins that are not tightly bound, crosslinking isn't enough, and DSG (which is a stronger crosslinker, I think) might be used to better capture those interactions.

Wait, no. Wait, DSG is a reducing agent, right? Or maybe it's another crosslinker. Or maybe it's used in combination with PFA. Oh wait, I think DSG stands for dimethyl sulfoxide and glutathione. Wait, no, that's not it. DSG is a crosslinker, but I'm confusing it with something else. Let me think. Oh wait, DSG is 1,4-dithioerythritol? Or maybe it's another name for something else. Alternatively, DSG is a type of crosslinker that's more efficient at crosslinking proteins that are farther apart, perhaps. Or maybe it's used for more efficient crosslinking in certain conditions.

Wait, another approach: PFA is a common fixative for ChIP experiments. However, sometimes they use a two-step process. Like, fix with PFA, then treat with DSG and then with sodium borohydride. I think this process is called 'fixation with PFA followed by DSG and NaB treatment', which is meant to improve crosslinking efficiency, especially for proteins that are not tightly bound or in more difficult-to-fix cells.

Wait, but why would the peaks disappear when using this method? So initially, with just PFA, certain peaks were detected, but with PFA+DSG
