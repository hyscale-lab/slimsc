Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me read the question again.

The question lists four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain characteristics. The options provided are A to D, each corresponding to one of these a-d choices.

Wait, the options are labeled A, B, C, D, and the choices are a, b, c, d. So each option (A-D) is an answer choice pointing to a, b, c, or d.

The question asks which exoplanet has the highest density. Let's think about what determines a planet's density. Density is mass divided by volume, right? So higher mass and smaller volume would lead to higher density.

Looking at each option:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. Well, Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that. So a planet with the same mass and radius as Earth would have the same density.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, no, the density is given as 5.5, which is same as Earth. But its mass is double. Hmm, but density is given, so perhaps I should just take that at face value. So this planet's density is 5.5, same as Earth.

Wait, but wait: if a planet has a higher mass but same composition, wouldn't its radius also be larger, which would affect density? Oh, no, because in this option, the density is given. So
