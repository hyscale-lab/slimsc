Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. Hmm, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce gamma-ray photons. But wait, the problem says two photons, so I guess they must emit them in opposite directions or something. But wait, the question is about the angle between them.

Let me think. So, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. When they collide, they annihilate into two photons, and both photons have the same energy. One photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. We need to find the angle between them.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, right? So gamma for electron is 4, and gamma for positron is 2.

First, I should find the momenta of each particle before collision. Because in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum should be zero. So after annihilation, the photons' momenta should add up to zero, considering their directions and energies.

Wait, but since both photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same because for photons, energy equals |p|c. So each photon has the same magnitude of momentum.

Let me think about the initial momenta. The electron is moving to the right (from left), positron moving to the left (from right). So their momenta are in opposite directions
