Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The starting material is (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. It's a bicyclic structure, I think it's a fused cyclohexene. Wait, limonene is actually a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific structure. Let me visualize it. Oh right, it's a bicyclo structure, maybe something like bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene or similar. Wait, no, wait. Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, but more accurately, it's a monocyclic. Wait, no, wait. No, limonene is a bicyclic compound. Wait, no, I'm confusing it with something else. Wait, no, limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclo structure, maybe a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene derivative. Hmm, I should look that up in my notes, but since I can't, I'll proceed carefully.

Limonene is (R)-(+)-Limonene, which is a chiral molecule. It has a specific structure, which I think has a cyclohexene ring with some substituents. Wait, no, limonene is a bicyclo structure. Let me think. The structure of limonene is bicyclo[2.2.1
