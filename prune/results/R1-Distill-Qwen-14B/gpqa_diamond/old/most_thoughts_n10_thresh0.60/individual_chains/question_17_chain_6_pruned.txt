Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm. I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, right? So the problem says we have a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the K for the complex is 5x10^10. Oh wait, K is the formation constant, I think.

Wait, formation constant, Kf, is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something like that. The K would be [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So that's the concentration of the complex. So the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Since the reaction is 1:1, I think the stoichiometry is 1 Ca²+ and 1 EDTA^4- per complex.

So, when the complex dissociates, it should release Ca²+ and EDTA^4- in equal amounts. But wait, the K is really large (5e10), meaning that the complex is very stable, so it doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ would be very low.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So I need to find [Ca²+].

So, let me write the expression. The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But in this case, the complex is 0.02 M, and assuming that the EDTA and Ca²+ come from the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, perhaps I should let s be the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- that comes from the dissociation. So, the complex is 0.02 M, but when it dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So, the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[CaEDTA^2-] = 0.02 - s ≈ 0.02 (since s is small because K is large, so s is negligible compared to 0.02). So [
