Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement. It typically involves 1,5-dienes rearranging into another 1,5-diene. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics, so I need to think this through.

The compound given is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Let me try to draw its structure. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane has two rings: a five-membered and a six-membered? Wait, no, that numbering is a bit confusing. The bicyclo notation is bicyclo[m.n.p], where m ≥ n ≥ p, and the numbers represent the bridge lengths. So [2.2.1] would have bridges of 2, 2, and 1 carbons.

So, the structure is a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. In this case, it's hept-5-ene, so the double bond is at position 5. Also, there's a 2-vinyl group and an azabicyclo, meaning there's a nitrogen in the structure.

The molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) is attached to the 2-position of the bicyclo system. And since it's 2-azabicyclo, the nitrogen is at position 2 as well. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the numbering for bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane would have the bridgehead atoms as 1 and 4, I think. Let me visualize it. The bicyclo has two bridgeheads, 1 and 4. So position 2 is adjacent to 1, and position 5 is across from 1, perhaps.

So the structure is a bicyclic system with a double bond at position 5. The substituents are a vinyl group at position 2 and a nitrogen at position 2. Wait, no, the formula is 2-azabicyclo. Oh, right; the numbering for azabicyclo would have the nitrogen at position 2. So the structure is a bicyclo with a bridge, and at position 2, there's a nitrogen. So the molecule is something like
