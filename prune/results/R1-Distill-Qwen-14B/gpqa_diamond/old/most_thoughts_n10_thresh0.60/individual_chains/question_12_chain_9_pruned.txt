Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion. Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem states that a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles. The options are A, B, C, D with different pairs of energies.

Hmm, I remember that in particle decay problems, conservation of energy and momentum are key. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. So the momenta of the decay products must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to balance each other out.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have very little mass, right? Oh, but in this case, the neutrino is probably treated as massless since its rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles. So, maybe I can model it as the muon having some kinetic energy and the neutrino taking away the rest.

But wait, the problem is about the kinetic energies of both the muon and the neutrino. So, how does that work?

Let me think in terms of energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The muon's energy will be its rest mass energy plus its kinetic energy, and the neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since its rest mass is negligible).

So, energy conservation: E_pion = E_mu + E_nu.

Similarly, momentum conservation: since the pion is at rest, the total momentum after decay must be zero. So the momentum of the muon (p_mu) must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the neutrino's momentum (p_nu). So, p_mu = -p_nu. The magnitudes are equal, so |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Wait, but how do I relate energy and momentum for each particle?

For the muon, which has mass, its total energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu
