Okay, so I have this physics problem about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of high-energy gamma-rays is limited by this process. Hmm, I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB, which is a form of background radiation, and this interaction could influence their lifetimes.

The reaction given is gamma-gamma annihilation producing an electron-positron pair: γγ → e+ e-. So, the gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's a really low energy, which makes sense because CMB photons are very low energy.

I think this has to do with the photon energy and the cross-section for this reaction. The cross-section probably depends on the energy of the gamma-rays. The process is more likely to happen when the gamma-rays are at a certain energy. Maybe there's a threshold where the energy is just enough for the reaction to occur, considering the rest mass of the electron-positron pair.

Wait, the rest mass of an electron is about 0.511 MeV. Since the process produces two electrons (or positrons), the total rest mass energy would be 2 * 0.511 MeV = 1.022 MeV. Oh wait, no, because the reaction is γ + γ → e+ + e-. So each gamma provides energy to create a pair. But wait, considering conservation of energy and momentum, the total energy has to be at least the rest mass of the pair.

Wait, but both photons are massless, so the combined energy should be enough to produce the rest mass. The condition for pair production from two photons is that their combined energy must be at least 2m_e c², which is about 1.022 MeV. But wait, CMB photons are at 1e-3 eV, so the other photon must have enough energy to make the total sum reach 1.022 MeV.

Wait, let me think. The CMB photon has energy E_cmb = 1e-3 eV. Let's denote the high-energy gamma's energy as E_gamma. The condition for pair production (γγ → e+ e-) is that the sum of the energies in the center of mass frame must be at least
