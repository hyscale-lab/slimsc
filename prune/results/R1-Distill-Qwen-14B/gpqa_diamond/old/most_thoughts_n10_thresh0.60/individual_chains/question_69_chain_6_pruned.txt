Okay, so I have this physics problem about particle decay and the resolution needed in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, so first I remember that the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation. The lifetime observed in the lab frame would be longer due to the particle's speed. 

The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. γ is equal to E/(m c²), right? Oh wait, because E is the total energy, which for a relativistic particle is much larger than its rest mass energy. So E ≈ γ m c², so γ = E/(m c²). 

But wait, the units here are given in GeV. So let me get the units right. The mass is 3.41 GeV/c², I think. Because energy and mass are related by E=mc², so mass in GeV/c² when multiplied by c² gives GeV of energy. So the energy E is 27 GeV. So γ would be E/(m c²) = (27 GeV) / (3.41 GeV/c² * c²) ) → the c² cancels out, so 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 * 7 is 23.87, and 3.41 * 7.9 is about 27? Let me compute 3.41 * 7.9: 3.41*7=23.87, 3.41*0.9=3.069, total 26.939. Oh, that's close to 27. So γ is approximately 7.91.

So the observed lifetime τ is γ * τ₀. τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 = approx 6.328e-15 seconds.

Now, the particles move during their lifetime, so the length they travel before decaying is L = v * τ. But wait, I think we can approximate v as the speed of light for high-energy particles. Because particles at such high energies (GeV) are moving very close to c. So v ≈ c = 3e8 m/s.

So L = c * τ = 3e8 m/s * 6.328e-15 s = 3e8 * 6.328e-15 = (3 * 6.328) * 1e-7 = 1
