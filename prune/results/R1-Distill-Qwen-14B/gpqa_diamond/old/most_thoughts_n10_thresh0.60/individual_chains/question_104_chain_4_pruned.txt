Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. Both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. 

The problem gives me the periodic shifts in the spectral lines for each planet. Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 is 7. Wait, but how does that relate to the orbital period? I remember the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. 

I think the RV method formula is something like the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's mass. The formula might be K = (v) = (G * (M_p) / (M_star * sqrt(1 - e²))) )^(1/3) * (1/(2π)) ) * (1/(1 AU)) )^something. Wait, maybe I should recall the correct formula. 

Oh right, the formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / (M_star^(2/3)) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/(1 AU^(1/3))) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) ) * (1/(2π)) )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Alternatively, I think the formula is K = ( (27 * pi * G) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ) ) / (c), where c is the speed of light. Wait, maybe another approach. 

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star in the direction of the observer. K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/( (P)^(1/3) )) ) * (1/(2π c)) ), but I'm probably making this more complicated. Alternatively, another approach is to remember that
