Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, let me read it again. The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly. And the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, each with different velocities.

Wait, protons and antiprotons annihilating? But the products are these A particles. So, I think this is a conservation of energy and momentum problem. Since it's an annihilation process, the initial rest energy plus kinetic energy must equal the final energies.

But the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, so maybe the initial system isn't in the center-of-momentum frame. Hmm, wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is "slowly moving." So maybe it's moving at a low velocity compared to the speed of light, making its kinetic energy much less than its rest energy. Or perhaps the initial kinetic energy is negligible, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in annihilation, the initial particles (proton and antiproton) might not be at rest. So I need to consider their energies and momenta. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can approximate the initial momentum.

Wait, let's think about the system. The initial particles are a proton (p) and an antiproton (p̄). Their rest mass is m_p c² each, but wait, the problem says m_A c² is 300
