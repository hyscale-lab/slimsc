Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles are confined, and their energy levels are quantized. The energy levels depend on their quantum numbers.

The problem says the particles are identical spin-1/2, so I think that means they are electrons or something similar, which are fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can be occupied by only one fermion.

The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), where n is the principal quantum number. Oh wait, the problem defines E as E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. So E_n = n² * E.

Since there are four particles, and they're fermions, their quantum states must be unique. Each state is characterized by the quantum number n and the spin. But since the particles are spin-1/2, each can have two possible spin states: up or down.

Wait, in a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by n and spin. So for each n, we can have two particles with opposite spins. So for each n, maximum two fermions can be placed.

So I need to fill up the lowest energy levels with four particles, considering the spin.

Let me list the energy levels in order:

n=1: E_1 = 1² E = 1E
n=2: E_2 = 4E
n=3: E_3 =9E
n=4: E_4=16E
n=5:25E, etc.

But wait, each n can hold two particles (each with different spin). So let's think about how the four particles will fill these levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energy. So we'll fill up the lowest n's with as many as possible.

n=1 can have two particles (since two spin states). So two particles in n=1, each with spin up and down.

Then, the next state is n=2. It can also hold two particles. So now, with two particles in n=1 and two in n=2, we have filled all four particles.

So for each state, the energies would be:

First, the ground state: all four particles are in the lowest possible states. So two in n=1 (each with different spin) and two in n=2 (each with different spin). So the total energy would be the sum of their individual energies.

Wait, no. Each particle's energy is E_n for their n. So each particle in n=1 contributes E, and each in n=2 contributes 4E. So two particles in n=1: 2 * 1E = 2E. Two in n=2: 2 *4E=8E. So total energy is 2E +8E =10E. But wait, the question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system, not the total energy.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the
