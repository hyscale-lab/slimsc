Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Hmm, let's read through it again. 

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The options given are possible factors by which this ratio changes.

Alright, let's break it down. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass 1.1 solar masses. When there are no spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but wait a second. Dark spots on a star are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So the spots themselves are at a lower temperature. That affects the overall emission of the star, but how does that tie into the effective temperature? Oh, right, the effective temperature is a measure of the total radiation the star emits. So when spots cover part of the surface, the total luminosity decreases, and hence the effective temperature.

But the problem says that when spots are present, the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K. Wait, does that mean that the average temperature of the photosphere is 5500 K? Or does it mean that the effective temperature of the entire star is 5500 K because of the spots?

Hmm, the wording says, "the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases." Oh, maybe the effective temperature is an average over the spotted surface. So the star's overall Teff is lower when spotted.

Now, the main point is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. We're to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So factor = (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots).

In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Since the problem says to consider the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in levels 1 and 2, maybe we're looking at n1/n2.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio
