Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, and they're moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, so I'll have to calculate both the relative velocity and the total energy and match it to the options.

First, relative velocity in special relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right, there's a formula for adding velocities relativistically. The formula is v_rel = (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²). Since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds divided by the factor that accounts for relativity.

Wait, let me make sure. So v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So plugging into the formula: (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let's compute that.

The numerator is 0.1c. The denominator: 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) is 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 = (1/7)c ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have v_rel as 0.14c. So the relative speed narrows it down to C or D.

Next, the total energy. Wait, each astronaut has relativistic energy. The total energy should be the sum of their individual energies.

The energy for each is gamma * m * c². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

For the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):
Gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3 m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 3 * 1.1547 is approximately 3.4641. So E1 is 2.5, E2 is 3.4641. Adding together: 2.5 + 3.4641 = 5.9641 m c². So E ≈5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and D says E=5 mc². So the correct energy is 5.96, which matches option C. So the total energy is 5.96 mc², and the relative speed is 0.14c. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Gamma1: 0.6c. 0.6 squared is 0.36. 1-0.36 is 0.64. Square root is 0.8. So 1/0.8 is 1.25. Correct. So 2m * 1.25 c² is 2.5. Correct.

Gamma2: 0.5c. 0.5 squared is 0.25. 1-0.25 is 0.75. Square root is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660. So 1/0.8660 is approximately 1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 c² is indeed 3.4641, which adds to 2.5 to make 5.9641. So that's about 5.96 mc².

So the answer should be C, which is v_rel=0.14c and E=5.96 mc².


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed and total energy of the system using relativistic principles.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Step 2: Total Energy
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = \frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 \approx 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \(v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c\).
- The total energy is \(E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96m c^2\).

These values match **Option C**: \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\), \(E = 5.96m c^2\).
