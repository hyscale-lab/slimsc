Okay, I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let me read it again carefully.

So, we've got two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both show eclipses, and their periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are the time between consecutive primary eclipses. 

Then, the radial velocity (RV) observations show sinusoidal variations. For system_1, the amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, they're 15 km/s and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. Oh, and the mass of each system is the sum of the two stars' masses.

Hmm. I remember that in binary stars, the radial velocity method is used to detect the stars' orbits. The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) depends on the mass of the companion. Wait, but I need to think about how the masses relate to the observed velocities.

Wait, the radial velocity semi-amplitude is given by the formula:

K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I think the mass function comes into play here. The mass function relates the observed velocities to the masses. The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = (M_2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_1 + M_2)^2 )

But wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think. In a spectroscopic binary, each star's velocity variation is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, so lower velocity. So, the ratio of the velocities is the inverse of the mass ratio.

So, for each system, the two stars' velocities (v1 and v2) are inversely proportional to their masses (m1 and m2). So, v1/v2 = m2/m1.

In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5. So, v1=10, v2=5. So, their ratio is 2:1. So, m2/m1 = 2/1 → m2 is twice m1. So the masses are in a 1:2 ratio. Therefore, the total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1.

Wait, wait, no. Let me correct. If v1 is for star 1, then v1 is larger if star 1 is less massive. Because the less massive star would orbit more quickly. So, the mass ratio (m1/m2) is (v2/v1). So, (m1/m2)=v2/v1.

In system_1: v1=10, v2=5. So m1/m2 = 5/10 = 0.5 → m1 = 0.5 m2. So, m2 is twice m1. So the total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1.

Similarly, for system_2: v1=15, v2=10. So m1/m2 = 10/15 = 2/3 → m1 = (2/3) m2. So m2 = (3/2) m1. The total mass is m1 + m2 = m1 + (3/2 m1) = (5/2 m1).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, maybe I should find the mass ratio for each system and then relate the total masses.

Alternatively, since the mass function involves the sum of the masses and the individual masses, perhaps I need to find the mass function for each and then compare the total masses.

But wait, another approach: in a binary system, the velocity semi-amplitude K is related to the mass. The more massive star has a smaller K because it's moving slower. So, for each system, the ratio of the two K's is the inverse of the mass ratio.

So, for system_1, K1 =10, K2=5. So K1/K2 = 2. So the mass ratio (m2/m1) = K2/K1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So m2 = 0.5 m1 → m1 = 2 m2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, if m1 is more massive, then its velocity K1 would be smaller. So if K1 is 10 and K2 is 5, K1 is larger than K2. So that would mean m2 is more massive than m1.

Wait, no, because the more massive star has a smaller orbit and hence a smaller velocity. Wait, no, that's not correct. The less massive star would have a larger orbit, so higher velocity. Because the center of mass is closer to the more massive star. So, the less massive star (m2) would have a larger orbit, so higher velocity. So, for system_1, K1 is 10, K2 is 5. So m2 is less than m1? Or the other way around.

Wait, let me think. Let me imagine a binary system. The two stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star (m1) would have a smaller orbit, so a smaller velocity. The less massive star (m2) has a larger orbit, so higher velocity. So, K1 is the velocity of m1, K2 velocity of m2.

So, if K1 is larger than K2, that would mean m2 is less massive than m1. Because if K1 is larger, m1's velocity is larger, implying m1 is
