Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's being asked.

The question says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that can't be right because in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to be normalized. Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to normalize it? Or perhaps the given state is already normalized? Let me check.

The vector is (-1, 2, 1). The norm squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )? Or perhaps the given state isn't normalized, but the problem might have it that way. Hmm, but when we compute probabilities, we'll probably need the normalized state. So I should normalize it first.

So the normalized state |Ïˆ> is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1)^T.

Next, there are two observables, P and Q. The operators are given as matrices. I need to find the probabilities of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1, in that order.

Wait, but the problem says measuring Q after P. So first, measure P, then measure Q. But wait, the question is about the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So it's the joint probability of P=0 and Q=-1 occurring in consecutive measurements.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the probability when you first measure P and get 0, and then measure Q and get -1. Hmm.

Wait, but what's the correct procedure? When you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So if P is measured first and gives 0, the state collapses into the eigenspace of P corresponding to 0. Then measuring Q would be done on this new state.

So I think the approach is:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P for eigenvalue 0. The state after measuring P=0 would be a superposition of these eigenvectors.

2. Then, from this new state, compute the probability of measuring Q=-1.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the probability of P=0 and Q=-1 by
