Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then determining the final product. The options are A to D.

First, I'll look at the IR and NMR data provided for Compound X.

Starting with the IR data:
- 3400â€“2500 cm-1: That's a broad peak, probably due to an -OH stretch. But wait, wait. Or is it maybe an NH stretch? Hmm, but the peak is in a region where both could appear. But another thought: maybe it's an O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Wait, but wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong peak. That's a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester or acid. Let me think, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches around 2500-3300, which this first peak covers. So maybe a carboxylic acid? Or perhaps an aldehyde? No, aldehydes have lower carbonyl peaks, around 1700 maybe. Oh, but 1720 could be a ketone or an ester. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, but maybe the -OH is present.

Wait, but let me look at the other IR peaks. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range of aromatic C=C stretching. So there's likely an aromatic ring. So multiple substituents on the benzene ring.

Now the NMR data:
1H NMR: The peaks are at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which is a broad singlet. Aromatic protons are usually around 7 ppm. Wait, but 10.5 is very upfield for an aromatic proton. That's more like an aldehyde proton, but wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm. Alternatively, an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. Or maybe an enol proton? Hmm, but that's less likely. Let me think. If it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be around 10-12 ppm, but sometimes as a broad peak. So maybe a carboxylic acid group is present.
