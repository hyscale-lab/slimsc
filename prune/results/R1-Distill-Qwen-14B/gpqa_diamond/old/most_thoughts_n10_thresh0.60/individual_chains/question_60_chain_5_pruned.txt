Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with relativity stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and they've built a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years, which is way longer than ours. The astronaut is 22 years old, and they want to reach Earth. The question is, how long will the trip take from the astronaut's perspective?

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with such high speeds, we have to consider special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. Because at speeds close to the speed of light, time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is less than the time measured by someone else (coordinate time).

Wait, but wait. So the spacecraft is moving at a high velocity relative to Earth. From the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them at that speed, right? So the distance they need to cover would be contracted. 

Wait, no, no. The distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is a fixed distance in the Earth's frame. But from the astronaut's frame, as they're moving at a high speed, the distance would appear shorter, so the time taken would be less. Alternatively, from Earth's frame, the astronaut's clock is ticking slower. But the question asks from the astronaut's perspective, so we need to calculate their experienced time.

Wait, but first we need the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, the problem doesn't give that. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh wait, maybe it's a standard problem where the distance is implicitly known. Or wait, perhaps I should figure out the distance first. But the problem doesn't specify, so maybe I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the distance between Earth and the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years, if I'm not mistaken. Because the Large Magellanic Cloud is one of the closest galaxies to the Milky Way, about 160,000 light-years away. So maybe the problem assumes that, or perhaps I'm supposed to know that. But the question doesn't give that number, so I must have made a mistake. Hmm. Wait, but the problem statement says the aliens are in the Large Magellanic Cloud and are heading to Earth, so the distance is the same as the distance to the LMC.

But without that, maybe the question expects me to calculate using the speed given, but somehow I need the distance. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is more about the time experienced by the astronaut, so perhaps I don't need the actual distance because it's implied, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps there's another approach. Let me think: the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to the speed of light. So, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) would be the distance divided by speed, but adjusted for time dilation. Or wait, no. Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the moving frame. So in the astronaut's frame,
