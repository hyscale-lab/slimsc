Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this kind of stuff, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question carefully.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B. Their total weight is 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. When heated, they form a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through several tubes in sequence. 

The tubes are filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2 (number 1), then Ca(OH)2 solution (number 2), and then red-hot copper (number 3). The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60 grams, tube 3 gains 0.80 grams, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. Also, after all this, there's 2.24 liters of gas C left at standard temperature and pressure.

The question is asking for the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A)13, B)19, C)17, D)15.

Hmm. Let's break this down. I think I need to figure out what the salts A and B are, or at least what gases are being produced when they're heated. 

First, the process of heating the salts. Since it's done without air, probably it's a decomposition reaction. The decomposition would produce gases, which are then passed through the tubes.

Let me think about each tube:

1. Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong drying agent. So, when gases pass through it, it absorbs water. So if the gas mixture has water vapor, it would be absorbed here. The weight gain of 3.60 g suggests the amount of water absorbed.

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. If a gas is passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2, it might precipitate something. But if the weight doesn't change, perhaps the gas is not reacting here. Wait, maybe the gas is CO2? Because CO2 would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But if the solution's weight didn't change, that would mean no CO2 was present. Or maybe the CO2 was completely absorbed, leaving no excess. Alternatively, perhaps another gas isn't reacting here.

3. Tube 3: Red-hot copper. Gas passing through hot copper might cause a reaction. For example, if there's water vapor, it wouldn't react. But if there's a reducing gas like H2 or CO, they might react with copper. Wait, but if the gas is H2, it would react with hot copper(II) oxide to produce water and copper metal. But in this case, the copper is in the tube—maybe it's copper oxide? Because when it's red-hot, maybe it's CuO. So, when H2 or another reducing gas passes through, it would cause the CuO to be reduced, producing H2O and Cu metal, but wait, that would give off water vapor again. Alternatively, if the gas is CO, it could react with CuO to form CO2
