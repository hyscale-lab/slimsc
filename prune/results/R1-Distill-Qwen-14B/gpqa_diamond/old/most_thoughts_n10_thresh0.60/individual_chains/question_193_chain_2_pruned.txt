Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The specific detail is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, so the equation is N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, so I need to connect parallax and distance to figure out how N depends on distance.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. I think the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. Or was it distance in some other unit? Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is equal to 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So if d increases, plx decreases, which makes sense because stars get dimmer and their parallax becomes harder to measure as they get farther away.

Now, the number of stars N varies with 1/plx^5. Wait, so N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let's substitute plx with d. Since plx = 1/d, then 1/plx = d. So substituting that in, 1/plx^5 is (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, that would mean that as distance increases (d), the number
