Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some solutions are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. The enthalpy change, ΔH, is usually measured in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol), but the options given have kcal and kJ. Oh wait, sometimes these problems use different units, so I need to be careful.

First, I think I should figure out how much acid and base each solution contributes, then determine which is in excess. Because in a neutralization reaction, the limiting reagent determines the extent of the reaction.

Let me break it down. Each of these solutions is an acid or a base. HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base.

Each reaction will produce water. But wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so each mole can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, each mole providing two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^-.

So, let's calculate the moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH- from the base.

Starting with HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole of H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4: 0.3 M, 300 mL. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. But since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now the base: Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M, 200 mL. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but in neutralization, H+ and OH- react in a 1:1 ratio. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reactant here. All 0.2 moles of OH- will react with 0.2 moles of H+.

But wait, that leaves some H+ unreacted. Because we have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-,
