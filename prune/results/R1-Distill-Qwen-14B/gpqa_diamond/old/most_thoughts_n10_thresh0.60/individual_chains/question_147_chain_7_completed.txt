Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. The question is asking about the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c. 

Hmm, let me start by recalling what I know about annihilation and particle physics. Annihilation usually refers to a particle and its antiparticle annihilating each other, converting their mass into energy. But in this case, the products are two particles and two antiparticles of another kind. So each A⁺ and A⁻ must be some new particles.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh wait, wait, the given reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, I think that implies that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy, so maybe we can approximate its velocity as much lower than the speed of light, but I'm not entirely sure how that plays into this.

Wait, but the problem gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. So the mass of particle A is 300 MeV/c². But what about the masses of the proton and antiproton? Because in the annihilation, the initial particles' rest mass energy must be converted into the rest mass plus kinetic energy of the products.

The proton and antiproton each have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c². So the total rest mass energy in the initial state is (938 + 938) MeV = 1876 MeV. But the products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has mass 300 MeV, so total rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So that leaves 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV of energy that can go into kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. Because in particle reactions, the initial kinetic energy also plays a role. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps we can assume that the initial kinetic energy is low, so the majority of the energy comes from the rest mass. Hmm, but wait, the proton is at rest? Or is the proton also moving? The problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton's state isn't specified. Oh, but the problem doesn't mention the proton's velocity, so maybe both are at rest? Or perhaps only the antiproton is moving, and the proton is at rest. Hmm, but it's not clear. 

Alternatively, maybe the system is such that the initial particles are at rest, but that's a big assumption. Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some small velocity. But for the sake of solving the problem, perhaps we can make the approximation that the initial total energy is the sum of the rest masses, and kinetic energy is negligible. Or maybe the kinetic energy is included in some way.

Wait, but I think I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum. Because in any reaction, both energy and momentum must be conserved.

So let's outline the conservation laws here.

Initial state: p + p̄. Let's think about their momenta and energies.

But the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. I might need to model the initial momentum and energy.

Assume that the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton has some small velocity, so its momentum p̄ is much less than its rest mass times c. Since it's moving slowly, v is much smaller than c, so perhaps we can approximate its momentum as (gamma) m_p v ≈ m_p v, since gamma is about 1. So maybe the momentum of the antiproton is small.

Wait, but p + p̄ annihilate. So the initial momentum is the momentum of the antiproton. Because the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton has some momentum, say p_initial.

In the final state, we have four particles: 2 A⁺ and 2 A⁻. Let's assume that particles A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions, but that's just a guess. Or perhaps they're moving in such a way to conserve both energy and momentum.

Wait, but perhaps symmetry comes into play. Since the initial state has a proton (charge +e) and an antiproton (charge -e), but the reaction produces two A⁺ and two A⁻. So maybe the charges are balanced, which makes sense.

But getting back to the problem, perhaps the initial momentum is entirely in the antiproton, since the proton is at rest. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = gamma * m_p * v. But since v is small, gamma is approximately 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p * v.

Now, the final state must have a total momentum equal to p_initial. So the four A particles must have a total momentum of p_initial. But how?

Assuming that the four particles are moving symmetrically, perhaps in pairs. For example, two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ in the opposite, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe all four are moving in the same direction, but that would make their momenta add up.

Wait, perhaps the easiest way is to model this as a symmetric situation, where the final particles are emitted in such a way that their momenta add up to p_initial. For example, two of them moving in one direction and two in another, but perhaps the directions are arranged symmetrically.

Alternatively, perhaps the situation is that the four A particles are moving in pairs in opposite directions, so that the total momentum adds up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but perhaps all four particles are moving in the same direction. That would mean that their combined momenta sum to p_initial. But given that the initial momentum is small (since v is small), perhaps the velocities of the A particles are not extremely high.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe there's another approach. Let's think about energy and momentum in terms of four-momentum. The sum of the four-momenta of the initial particles equals the sum of the four-momenta of the final particles.

But let's define the initial four-momentum. The proton is at rest, so its four-momentum is (E_p, 0), where E_p = m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so its four-momentum is (gamma m_p c², gamma m_p v c). So the total initial four-momentum is (m_p c² + gamma m_p c², gamma m_p v c).

In the final state, each A particle has four-momentum (E_A, p_A c), where E_A = gamma_A m_A c², and p_A is the momentum. Since each A is moving, their gamma factors would vary.

But considering four particles, perhaps each with the same speed and direction, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, maybe they come in pairs moving in opposite directions, but in such a way that the total momentum is conserved.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the center of momentum frame. Wait, no, because the initial frame has the proton at rest and the antiproton moving, so the lab frame is not the center of mass frame. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so we can approximate the initial energy as just the sum of the rest energies, and the initial momentum as the momentum of the moving antiproton.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the energy and momentum separately.

Total initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² (proton rest) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton).

But wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, then gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²), but since v is small, gamma ≈ 1. So E_initial ≈ (m_p + m_p) c² = 2 m_p c² = 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving, then its energy is gamma m_p c². If it's moving slowly, then gamma is just a bit over 1, but perhaps we can take it as approximately 1. Hmm, but then E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

Total initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p v. Since v is small, gamma is about 1, so p_initial ≈ m_p v.

Now, the final energy is the sum of the rest mass energies and the kinetic energies of the A particles. The rest mass energy is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. So the kinetic energy is (1876 - 1200) MeV = 676 MeV.

But wait, that's the total energy available, but the way the energy is distributed between rest mass and kinetic energy for each A depends on their velocities.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the A particles are all moving at the same speed. Let's model that.

So, each A has energy E_A = gamma * m_A c², and momentum p_A = gamma m_A v_A, where v_A is the speed of each A.

But since there are four A particles, let's say two in the same direction and two in the opposite, or perhaps all moving in the same direction.

Wait, but perhaps the four A particles are moving in pairs, such that their momenta add up in a way that the total momentum is the same as the initial p_initial.

Let me try to model this. Suppose that two A⁺ are moving in one direction with velocity v_A, and two A⁻ are moving in the opposite direction with velocity v_A. Then, the total momentum would be (2 * gamma_A m_A v_A) - (2 * gamma_A m_A v_A) ) = 0 if they are moving symmetrically. But that would make the total momentum zero, which contradicts the initial momentum p_initial.

So that can't be the case. Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction, so their total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A. But that would require 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = p_initial ≈ m_p v.

Wait, that seems possible. Let's see.

So, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v. [Equation 1]

Now, for the energy:

The total energy is (4 gamma_A m_A c²) = E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

So, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c². [Equation 2]

We can solve for gamma_A from Equation 2:

gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A) 

Given m_A c² is 300 MeV, m_p c² is 938 MeV.

So gamma_A = (938) / (2 * 300) ) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.5633.

Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)), so:

1.5633 = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²))

Squaring both sides: (1.5633)^2 = 1/(1 - v_A²/c²)

Calculating (1.5633)^2: approximately 2.443.

So 2.443 = 1/(1 - v_A²/c²) → 1 - v_A²/c² = 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095 → v_A²/c² ≈ 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905 → v_A = c * sqrt(0.5905) ≈ c * 0.768.

So v_A is approximately 0.768c. But looking at the options, option A is 0.77c, which is close. But wait, let me check my steps for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, but wait a second: the initial assumption was that all four A particles are moving in the same direction. But that would result in a total momentum of 4 gamma_A m_A v_A. However, the initial momentum is m_p v. If the A particles are moving in the same direction, and the initial momentum is small (since the antiproton is moving slowly), then 4 gamma_A m_A v_A must equal m_p v.

But from Equation 1: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v.

But from Equation 2: 4 gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 → gamma_A m_A c^2 = (m_p c^2)/2 → gamma_A = (m_p c^2)/(2 m_A c^2) ) = m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.5633.

Wait, but substituting gamma_A into Equation 1, let's see:

4 * gamma_A * m_A * v_A = m_p * v.

But from Equation 2, we have gamma_A = (m_p c²)/(2 m_A c²) ) → m_p = (2 m_A gamma_A c^2 )/(c^2) ) → m_p = 2 m_A gamma_A.

Wait, maybe substituting that into Equation 1.

Wait, m_p = 2 m_A gamma_A.

So Equation 1 becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = (2 m_A gamma_A) v.

Divide both sides by m_A gamma_A:

4 v_A = 2 v → v_A = (v)/2.

But from Equation 2, we found gamma_A ≈ 1.5633.

So, gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2)) ≈ 1.5633 → 1 - (v_A^2/c^2) = 1/(gamma_A^2) ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.4095 → v_A^2/c^2 = 0.5905 → v_A ≈ 0.768 c.

But from Equation 1, v_A = v / 2. So v = 2 v_A → v = 2 * 0.768 c → v ≈ 1.536 c.

But wait, that's impossible because you can't have a speed greater than the speed of light. So this leads to a contradiction. Hence, my initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction must be wrong.

So, perhaps the four A particles are moving in opposite directions. Let me think differently. Suppose that two A particles are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, such that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Let me consider that two A⁺ are moving in the direction of the initial momentum, and two A⁻ are moving opposite to it. So the total momentum would be (2 gamma_A m_A v_A) - (2 gamma_A m_A v_A) ) = 0. Which can't be, because the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v.

Hmm, that's not working either. So maybe only two of the A particles are moving in the same direction, and the other two are at rest? No, because if the other two are at rest, their momentum would be zero, and the total momentum would be 2 gamma_A m_A v_A. Which would have to equal p_initial = m_p v.

But then energy-wise, the total energy would be 2 * gamma_A m_A c² + 2 m_A c². Because two A's are moving and two are at rest. So:

2 gamma_A m_A c² + 2 m_A c² = E_initial = 2 m_p c².

But then 2 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² - 2 m_A c^2 → gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² - m_A c².

So gamma_A = (m_p c² - m_A c²)/(m_A c²) ) → (938 - 300) / 300 = 638 / 300 ≈ 2.1267.

So gamma_A ≈ 2.1267.

Then, gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2)) → 2.1267 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) → square both sides: 4.52 = 1/(1 - v_A²/c²) → 1 - v_A²/c² = 1/4.52 ≈ 0.221 → v_A²/c² = 0.779 → v_A ≈ 0.883 c.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.91c, which is close but not exactly matching. Hmm, but perhaps I made an error in the assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the final state, the particles are moving symmetrically such that their momenta add up to the initial momentum. Let me try a different approach.

Let me denote the speed of each A particle as v_A. Since the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v (approximate because v is small), and the final momentum must equal this, let's consider that each A has momentum p_A.

Assume that all four A particles move in the same direction as the initial momentum. Then total final momentum is 4 p_A = p_initial → p_A = p_initial /4.

But from the energy side: each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c². The sum of all four is 4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

So gamma_A = (2 m_p c² )/(4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) = 938/600 ≈ 1.5633.

Which brings us back to the same gamma as before. So v_A ≈ 0.768 c. But earlier, using this in Equation 1, we got a v larger than c, which is impossible, so this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the A particles are moving in such a way that the total momentum is p_initial, but not all of them moving in the same direction. Let me think that two A particles are moving in the direction of p_initial, and the other two in the opposite direction.

So, let's say two A's are moving forward with momentum p, and two A's backward with momentum p. Then the total momentum would be 2p (forward) - 2p (backward) = 0. Which is not equal to p_initial. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe three moving forward and one backward. No, but that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps two move in one direction and two in another, but their momenta add up to p_initial.

Wait, maybe the four A particles are moving in pairs. Let's say two A⁺ are moving in the same direction, and two A⁻ are moving in the opposite direction. But each A⁺ and A⁻ have the same speed, so their momenta would cancel, leading to the same problem as before.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me try to consider the conservation of momentum and energy in another way.

Since the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v (approximate, as v is small), and the initial energy is E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² (since the antiproton's gamma is ~1).

The final state has four particles. Let's denote the speed of each A as v_A, and their momentum as p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Assuming all A's move in the same direction. Then the total momentum is 4 p_A = m_p v → 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v. [Equation 1]

The total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) = 1.5633. [Equation 2]

From Equation 2, gamma_A ≈ 1.5633. So,

gamma_A = 1.5633 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) → sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.64 → 1 - v_A²/c² ≈ 0.4095 → v_A²/c² ≈ 0.5905 → v_A ≈ 0.768 c.

But from Equation 1, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v.

Let me plug in the numbers:

gamma_A = 1.5633, m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p = 938 MeV/c².

So,

4 * 1.5633 * 300 * v_A = 938 * v.

But v_A is 0.768 c, so:

4 * 1.5633 *300 * 0.768 c = 938 v.

Wait, let me compute the left side:

4 * 1.5633 ≈ 6.2532 → 6.2532 *300 = 1875.96 → 1875.96 * 0.768 ≈ 1436.15 → 1436.15 c.

So, 1436.15 c ≈ 938 v → v ≈ (1436.15 c)/938 ≈ 1.531 c.

Which is impossible because v can't exceed c. So this suggests that the initial assumption that all A's are moving in the same direction is wrong.

Hmm, so perhaps the A particles are moving in opposite directions, but not all in the same direction.

Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the four A particles are moving in two pairs: two moving in the direction of the initial momentum and two moving opposite. Let me denote the speed of the two forward A's as v1 and the two backward as v2.

But this complicates things a bit because each pair has a different speed. Alternatively, perhaps all four move in the same direction but with varying speeds, but that's getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the initial assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is the only way, but that leads to v > c, which is impossible. Hence, perhaps the initial assumption that the antiproton's velocity is negligible and thus gamma ≈ 1 is incorrect. Maybe the antiproton is moving with a significant velocity which allows the A particles to have a realistic velocity less than c.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps v is small, making the initial momentum small, but not zero.

Let me try to model this without approximations.

Initial four-momentum:

The proton is at rest, so its four-momentum is (m_p c², 0).

The antiproton is moving with velocity v. Its four-momentum is (gamma m_p c², gamma m_p v c).

So, the total initial four-momentum is:

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

In the final state, the four A particles have four-momentum (gamma_A m_A c², gamma_A m_A v_A c) each.

But since the initial momentum is not zero, the four A's must have a net momentum of p_initial. Assuming they all move in the same direction, their total final momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A c = p_initial.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v. [Equation 1]

The total energy is:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = m_p c² (1 + gamma). [Equation 2]

We have two equations with two variables: gamma and v_A.

But we're supposed to find v_A, the velocity of the A particles.

Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but let's try to express gamma in terms of v from Equation 2.

From Equation 2:

gamma = [4 gamma_A m_A c² ] / [m_p c² (1 + gamma)] - 1.

Wait, no, Equation 2 is:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma) → 4 gamma_A m_A = m_p (1 + gamma).

So,

gamma = (4 gamma_A m_A )/(m_p) ) - 1.

Substituting this into Equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = [ (4 gamma_A m_A )/(m_p) ) - 1 ] * m_p v.

Wait, let me substitute gamma from Equation 2 into Equation 1.

Equation 1:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = (gamma m_p v).

But gamma = [4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ] - 1.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = [ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ] * m_p v.

Simplify the right-hand side:

[ (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ] * m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A - m_p.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p) v.

Hmm, but this still has v in it. But I don't know v yet. Wait, how else can I relate v and v_A?

Alternatively, maybe I can express v in terms of v_A from Equation 1.

From Equation 1:

v = [4 gamma_A m_A v_A ] / [ (4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) ]

Hmm, but I'm not sure how that helps. Let me try to substitute this into the energy equation.

But this seems getting too complicated. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that the proton is at rest is incorrect. Because the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, but doesn't specify the proton's state. Perhaps both are moving, but that complicates the matter further.

Alternatively, perhaps in the center of mass frame, the initial momentum is zero. But that would require that the proton and antiproton are moving toward each other with equal and opposite momenta. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests that it's moving in one direction, and the proton is at rest. So the initial frame is not the center of mass frame.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let me think about the ratio of the rest masses.

The rest mass energy of the proton (and antiproton) is 938 MeV, and each A is 300 MeV. So each A is about a third the mass of a proton.

In the annihilation, 4 particles are produced. So the total rest mass increases from 2*938 MeV to 4*300 MeV = 1200 MeV. But 2*938=1876, which is more than 1200. So the difference 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV is the available kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. In reality, when a particle and antiparticle annihilate, their rest mass is converted into other forms, but in this case, they are producing four particles, so perhaps their rest masses are adding up. But I'm not sure how that directly helps.

Wait, another approach: use the fact that in the center of mass frame, the total initial momentum is zero, so the final momentum must also be zero. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests that the lab frame is not the center of mass frame. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the concept of invariant mass.

The invariant mass squared s is (sum of four-momenta)^2.

In the initial state, the four-momentum is (E_initial, p_initial c), where E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c^2, and p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The invariant mass squared s is [ (E_initial)^2 - (p_initial c)^2 ] c^2.

But in the final state, the invariant mass should be the same.

The final state four-momentum is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles.

But this seems complicated because each A has its own momentum, which depends on direction. So perhaps this approach isn't the easiest.

Wait, maybe I should simplify by assuming that all the kinetic energy goes into the rest mass of the A particles. But that's not correct because the sum of their rest masses is 1200 MeV, which is less than the initial rest mass plus kinetic. Hmm.

Wait, but the initial energy includes the rest mass and the antiproton's kinetic energy. Maybe the A particles' total rest mass plus kinetic energy equals the initial energy.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think of another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be approached using the concept of energy and momentum ratios.

In the initial state, in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, the energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c^2.

The momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

In the final state, the four A particles must have a total energy of E_initial and a total momentum of p_initial.

Assuming all four A's are moving in the same direction.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial → gamma_A = E_initial/(4 m_A c²).

And,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = p_initial → gamma_A v_A = p_initial/(4 m_A).

But p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So,

gamma_A v_A = (gamma m_p v)/(4 m_A).

But gamma_A = E_initial/(4 m_A c²) ) = [m_p c² (1 + gamma) ]/(4 m_A c²) ) = m_p (1 + gamma)/(4 m_A).

So,

gamma_A v_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) / (4 m_A) ] * v.

But v_A is [c^2 v ] / beta_A c, where beta_A is v_A / c.

Hmm, perhaps substituting v_A = beta_A c.

So,

gamma_A beta_A c = [ m_p (1 + gamma) v ]/(4 m_A ).

But gamma_A beta_A = gamma_A (v_A/c) = (v_A / sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) ) → let's write this as (v_A c)/(sqrt(1 - v_A²/c^2)) ) → but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express gamma_A in terms of beta_A.

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A^2).

So,

gamma_A beta_A = beta_A / sqrt(1 - beta_A^2) = (v_A c)/sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) ) = (v_A c) / sqrt( (c² - v_A²)/c² ) ) = (v_A c) * (c) / sqrt(c² - v_A²) ) → (v_A c²) / sqrt(c^2 (1 - v_A²/c²)) ) → v_A c / sqrt(1 - v_A²/c²) ) → which is the same as gamma_A v_A.

Wait, perhaps I should substitute gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2) into the earlier equation.

So,

(1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2)) * beta_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) v ]/(4 m_A c).

But this is getting complicated. Maybe instead, I can relate the two equations:

From gamma_A = (m_p (1 + gamma) )/(4 m_A ), and from the momentum equation,

gamma_A v_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) v ]/(4 m_A ).

Substituting gamma_A from the first equation into the second,

[ m_p (1 + gamma) / (4 m_A ) ] * v_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) v ]/(4 m_A ).

Simplify:

v_A = v.

Hmm, that suggests that v_A = v.

But from the earlier calculation, when I assumed all A's are moving in the same direction, v_A was about 0.768c, which led to v being approximately 1.53c, which is impossible. So perhaps this approach isn't correct, and the initial assumption that all A's are moving in the same direction is wrong.

Given that, I'm stuck and perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the kinetic energy of the initial antiproton is much smaller than its rest mass energy, so p_initial = gamma m_p v ≈ m_p v. But v is small, so gamma is approximately 1. Then,

p_initial ≈ m_p v.

In the final state, the four A's must have a total momentum of approximately m_p v.

Assuming that each A has velocity v_A, and that all are moving in the same direction, then 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v.

But from the energy,

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (m_p + gamma m_p ) c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

So,

gamma_A = (2 m_p c² )/(4 m_A c² ) = m_p/(2 m_A) ≈ 938/(2*300) ≈ 1.5633.

So,

gamma_A ≈ 1.5633 → 1/sqrt(1 - v_A²/c² ) ≈ 1.5633 → sqrt(1 - v_A²/c^2) ≈ 0.64 → 1 - v_A²/c² ≈ 0.409 → v_A²/c² ≈ 0.590 → v_A ≈ 0.768 c.

But using this in the momentum equation: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v → v = (4 gamma_A m_A v_A )/(m_p ).

Substituting numbers:

4 * 1.5633 * 300 MeV/c² * 0.768 c = 938 MeV/c² * v.

Wait, let's compute the left side:

4 * 1.5633 = 6.2532 → *300 → 1875.96 MeV/c² → *0.768 c → 1875.96 * 0.768 ≈ 1436.15 MeV c.

So, 1436.15 MeV c = 938 MeV/c² * v → v = (1436.15 MeV c ) / (938 MeV/c² ) → v = (1436.15 / 938 ) c → ≈ 1.531 c.

Which is impossible. So this can't be correct.

This suggests that the initial assumption that all four A's are moving in the same direction is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps the A's are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel out, but that would require the initial momentum to be zero, which it's not. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the A's are moving in pairs, such that their momenta add up to p_initial. Let me try this:

Assume that two A's move in the same direction as p_initial, and two move in the opposite, but with a different speed. Let me denote their speeds as v1 and v2.

Then, the total momentum would be 2 gamma_1 m_A v1 - 2 gamma_2 m_A v2 = p_initial.

The total energy would be 2 gamma_1 m_A c² + 2 gamma_2 m_A c² = E_initial.

But this adds more variables, which complicates the problem. 

Alternatively, perhaps all four A's are moving in such a way that their velocities are the same, but their momenta add up to p_initial. But I don't see a clear path here.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should think of another approach. Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using non-relativistic mechanics, but that seems unlikely since it's about particle physics.

Wait, but the question gives m_A c² = 300 MeV. So perhaps the A's are much lighter than the proton and antiproton. So when the proton and antiproton annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into the rest mass and kinetic energy of the A's.

But earlier I thought the initial energy is about 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV, and the A's total rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV, leaving 676 MeV for kinetic energy.

If the kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four A's, each has KE of 169 MeV.

But without knowing the distribution of kinetic energy, I'm not sure how to find the velocity.

Wait, but particles' kinetic energy is related to their velocity via KE = (gamma - 1) m c².

So, for each A,

KE = (gamma_A - 1) * 300 MeV = 169 MeV → gamma_A - 1 = 169 / 300 → gamma_A ≈ 1 + 0.563 → 1.563.

Which is the same gamma as before. So, gamma_A ≈ 1.563 → v_A ≈ 0.768 c.

Which is about 0.77c. So option A is 0.77c.

But earlier, that led to an impossible momentum. So perhaps the assumption about distributing the KE equally is incorrect, but if this is the intended approach, the answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the kinetic energy is entirely converted into the rest mass of the A's, but that would require the initial energy to be higher than the rest mass of the A's, but that's not the case. So perhaps the velocity is about 0.77c, but I'm not confident.

But wait, let me compute v_A more precisely.

gamma_A = 1.5633 → let's compute 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) = 1.5633.

beta^2 = 1 - (1/(1.5633)^2 ) → 1.5633^2 ≈ 2.443 → 1/2.443 ≈ 0.4095 → 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905 → beta = sqrt(0.5905) ≈ 0.768.

Yes, so 0.768c, which is approximately option A, 0.77c.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process \( p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^- \) using conservation of energy and momentum. The antiproton is stated to be moving slowly, implying its kinetic energy is much smaller than its rest mass energy. The rest mass energy of the proton (\( m_p c^2 \)) and antiproton is approximately \( 938 \, \text{MeV} \), while the rest mass energy of each \( A \)-particle is \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Step 1: Total Energy and Momentum in the Initial State
The total initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The total initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the slowly moving antiproton:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} \approx m_p v.
\]

### Step 2: Total Energy and Momentum in the Final State
In the final state, the total energy is distributed among the four \( A \)-particles. The rest mass energy of the \( A \)-particles is:
\[
4 m_A c^2 = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The remaining energy is kinetic energy, which is:
\[
E_{\text{kinetic}} = E_{\text{initial}} - 4 m_A c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV} - 1200 \, \text{MeV} = 676 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Assuming the kinetic energy is distributed equally among the four \( A \)-particles, each \( A \)-particle has:
\[
\text{Kinetic energy per } A = \frac{676 \, \text{MeV}}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Step 3: Relating Kinetic Energy to Velocity
The kinetic energy of each \( A \)-particle is related to its velocity by:
\[
\text{Kinetic energy} = (\gamma - 1) m_A c^2,
\]
where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting the kinetic energy:
\[
169 \, \text{MeV} = (\gamma - 1) \times 300 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
Solving for \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma - 1 = \frac{169}{300}, \quad \gamma = 1 + \frac{169}{300} \approx 1.563.
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the Velocity
Using the relation \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):
\[
\gamma^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2}, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}, \quad v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}.
\]
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 1.563 \):
\[
\gamma^2 \approx 2.443, \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 0.4095, \quad v^2/c^2 \approx 1 - 0.4095 = 0.5905.
\]
\[
v \approx c \sqrt{0.5905} \approx 0.768c.
\]

### Step 5: Matching to the Options
The calculated velocity \( v \approx 0.768c \) is closest to option \( 0.77c \).
