Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a reaction between ((2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene and hydrogen bromide. Hmm, let me parse that structure first.

The compound is benzene with an oxy group attached. The oxy is connected to a 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl group. Let me draw this out. So the butenyl chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, wait. The numbering is from the end closest to the benzene. So it's 1-yl, meaning the substituent is on carbon 1. So the structure is benzene-O-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but but-3-en-1-yl means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but that can't be because but has four carbons. Wait, wait, but-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? That's not possible because but has four carbons, so the positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between 3 and 4, but that's the end. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 3 and 4? No, wait, that would be but-1-ene. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is OCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, that can't be right because but is only four carbons. Oh wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between 2 and 3. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think: but-3-en-1-yl is the group where the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4. But wait, but has four carbons, so the positions are 1,2,3,4. The double bond starts at carbon 3
