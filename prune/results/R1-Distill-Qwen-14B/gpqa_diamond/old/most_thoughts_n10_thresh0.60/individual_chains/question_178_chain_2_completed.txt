Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question gives the Lagrangian as L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that the gamma matrices, γ, have specific dimensions. Oh right, in 4-dimensional spacetime, each γ matrix is dimensionless, right? Because when you're working in 4D, the field strength tensor F has a certain dimension, and the fermion fields ψ have their own.

Wait, what are the dimensions of each field? Let me recall. In 4D, the fields usually have specific mass dimensions based on their type. For fermions, like the ψ here, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, so the field has to compensate. Let's see: the term ψ̄ iγ^μ ∂_μ ψ would have to be dimensionless (since the Lagrangian is in 4D, dimension 4), so each ψ is 3/2. Because ψ̄ ψ is like (3/2)*2=3. Then the derivative ∂ has dimension 1. So that's 3 + 1 =4 for the kinetic term, which matches.

Now, the field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from the electromagnetic field, right? Or maybe something else, but generally, F is the field tensor, like in electromagnetism. In 4D, the field tensor F has dimension 2. Because Maxwell's Lagrangian is F^2, which has dimension 4. So F is dimension 2.

What about σ_{μν}? It's (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which involves the gamma matrices. Since each γ is dimensionless, the commutator is dimensionless, so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So σ is 0.

So putting it all together: the Lagrangian term is κ times ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's write the dimensions of each part.

ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ ψ is 3. Then, σ is 0, so ψ̄ σ ψ is still 3. F is 2. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 =5. 

The Lagrangian term is κ multiplied by this. The whole term should have dimension 4, because in 4D, the Lagrangian density is dimension 4 (so integrals over 4D spacetime give dimensionless action, as the integral has dimension 4). So, κ times (5) must equal 4. So κ's dimension is 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, so each term inside must have dimension 4. So whatever the other factors contribute, κ must adjust that product to 4.

So κ has mass dimension -1.

Now, about renormalizability. I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension. Wait no, wait. The mass dimension determines whether the interaction is renormalizable. Coupling constants with positive or zero mass dimension are okay, but negative dimensions imply non-renormalizable. Or wait, no, it's the other way around. Let me think.

In general, the required condition for renormalizability is that the coupling constant has a mass dimension ≥ 0. Because if a coupling has negative mass dimension, that implies that the interaction term has higher dimension, making the theory non-renormalizable. Because higher-dimensional operators come with higher inverse energy scales, leading to worse UV behavior.

So here, κ has dimension -1. So that's negative. So the interaction term has dimension [κ][ψ]^2 [F] = 5 (as I calculated earlier), which would require κ to have a dimension of -1.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The term in the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. So each ψ is 3/2, so two ψ's make 3. F is 2. So total without κ is 3 + 2 =5. So 5 must be balanced by κ's dimension to make the term have dimension 4. So κ must be 4 -5 = -1. So [κ]_M = -1.

Since κ has negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable. Because in general, for a term in the Lagrangian to be renormalizable, the coupling's dimension must be >=0. Because each term in the Lagrangian must have the right dimension, and if the coupling has negative dimension, that term is non-renormalizable.

Wait, no... wait, another approach: the superficial degree of divergence can be calculated to determine renormalizability. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (sum of the dimensions of the fields in the term - number of derivatives). Alternatively, perhaps a better way is to consider the Feynman diagrams and whether divergences can be absorbed into a finite number of parameters.

Alternatively, recall that for a term in the Lagrangian, the dimension is [L] = [mass]^4, since in 4D spacetime. Each field in the term contributes their mass dimension. So for the term L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F, the dimension must be 4. So as I found before, [κ] is -1.

So the mass dimension is -1, which is negative. Non-renormalizable theories have coupling constants with negative mass dimensions. Because they can't be absorbed into a finite number of parameters; you need an infinite number of counterterms, which isn't possible. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So looking at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, theory renormalizable. No, because [κ] is negative, theory isn't renormalizable.

Option B: [κ]=1, theory ren. No, since [κ] here is 1 but that's not what we have.

Option C: [κ]=-1, theory not ren. Yes, this matches.

Option D: [κ]=1, theory not ren.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- In 4-dimensional spacetime, the Dirac field $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F]_M = 2$.
- The $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ tensor, being a commutator of dimensionless $\gamma$ matrices, is also dimensionless: $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$
The Lagrangian term $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $[ \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} ]_M = 4$ in 4D spacetime. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes the following dimensions:
- $[\bar{\psi}]_M = [\psi]_M = \frac{3}{2}$ for $\bar{\psi}$ and $\psi$.
- $[\sigma_{\mu\nu}]_M = 0$.
- $[F^{\mu\nu}]_M = 2$.

Thus, the total dimension of $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
[\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}]_M = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 0 + 2 = 5.
\]
To ensure the Lagrangian term has dimension 4, $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa]_M + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Since $[\kappa]_M = -1$, which is negative, the theory is **not renormalizable**. Non-renormalizable theories require an infinite number of counterterms to handle divergences, making them non-predictive at higher energy scales.

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
- **Option A**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as the theory is not renormalizable.
- **Option B**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is not 1.
- **Option C**: $[\kappa]_M = -1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Correct**, as explained above.
- **Option D**: $[\kappa]_M = 1$, theory is not renormalizable. **Incorrect**, as $[\kappa]_M$ is not 1.

### Final Answer:
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
