Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The options given are A, B, C, D, each with different expressions for the eigenvector elements.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvalues correspond to possible measurement outcomes. The operator here is P, which is a vector operator with components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is given as a matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, each P component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], right? Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it can be represented as the dot product of the vector (P_x, P_y, P_z) with the direction vector n. 

The direction n is in the x-z plane, so it has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), perhaps? Because when a direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. Wait, no, wait—if θ is the angle from the z-axis, then n would be (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since it's in the x-z plane, φ is zero or π, so the y-component is zero. So n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or maybe (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Hmm, I think it depends on the convention. But for this problem, perhaps the exact parametrization isn't crucial yet.

The operator P along direction n would be P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. Since n_y is zero, that term drops out. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Since the operator is P·n, and we're looking for its eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, (P·n)|ψ> = (ħ/2)|ψ>.

Each component of P is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write each component:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So P·n is (n_x * P_x) + (n_z * P_z). Plugging in the matrices:

n_x * (ħ/2)*[[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Wait, let's compute it:

The matrix for P·n would be:

(ħ/2) * [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add n_x * P_x (which gives diagonal elements 0 and 0, but off-diagonal n_x* (ħ/2)*1 each) and n_z * P_z which gives diagonal elements n_z*(ħ/2) and -n_z*(ħ/2), and off-diagonal 0.

So combining these, the matrix is:

Row 1: [n_z*(ħ/2), n_x*(ħ/2)]
Row 2: [n_x*(ħ/2), -n_z*(ħ/2)]

Wait, no, no, because P_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], so n_x * P_x is [[0
