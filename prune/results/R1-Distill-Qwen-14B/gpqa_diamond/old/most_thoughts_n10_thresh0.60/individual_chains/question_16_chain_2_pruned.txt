Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in organic compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to work through each compound one by one to figure out which ones are optically active.

Optical activity usually means the compound has chiral centers, right? So I need to find out if each of these compounds has at least one chiral center. But wait, sometimes even with chiral centers, a molecule might not be chiral if there's a plane of symmetry or if it's part of an identical structure elsewhere. Oh, and meso compounds are a thing. Those have multiple chiral centers but are achiral because of a plane of symmetry, making them not optically active.

Alright, let's go through each compound.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   The structure here is a butene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Cl is on C1, and a methyl is on C2. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but in this case, substituents are on C1 and C2. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or is it CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? No, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but wait no, double bond is between C1 and C2. So the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's butane. Oh wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro substitution would be on the first carbon, so Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait but that's butane, not butene. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so the substituents are on the double bond. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and methyl on C2.

So structure
