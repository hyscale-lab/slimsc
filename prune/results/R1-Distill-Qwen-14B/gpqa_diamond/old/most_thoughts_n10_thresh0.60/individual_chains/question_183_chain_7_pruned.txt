Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the index of hydrogen deficiency for the product formed after a certain reaction. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me visualize its structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 has a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 has a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-), right? Also, the ring itself has a double bond at the 3-enecarboxylic acid part. Wait, no, wait. The name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, which means the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, I think. And the carboxylic acid group is at position 1, maybe? Or wait, numbering is going to be important here. Let me recount.

In cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the carboxylic acid is at C1. So positions 2 and 5 are adjacent to that. So the substituents are at C2 (formyl) and C5 (vinyl). So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents: formyl at C2 and vinyl at C5.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction conditions, but wait, no, red phosphorus and HI is typically used for the elimination of halides to form alkenes. Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, when you have a carboxylic acid and you treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it's often a decarboxylation reaction. Wait, that's right! The Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction is for halogenation, but here, I think it's more about decarboxylation. Or wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is a carboxylic acid, so when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's a way to form an alkyl iodide. But wait, I might be mixing reactions.

Wait, I think when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reaction called
