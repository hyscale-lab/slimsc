Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question involves two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine what the chromatograms would show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation typically forms an epoxide by adding an oxygen across the double bond. But wait, what about the stereochemistry here?

Wait, (E)- and (Z)-oct-4-ene. So, each isomer when treated with mCPBA would form an epoxide, right? But wait, mCPBA is an electrophilic oxidizing agent, and the epoxidation would be stereospecific. Oh right, mCPBA adds an oxygen across the double bond, and since the starting alkenes are E and Z, the resulting epoxides would have different configurations.

Wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, actually, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide via an electrocyclic opening. The reaction is stereospecific but leads to the same diastereomer regardless of the starting alkene's configuration. Wait, no, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the mechanism. mCPBA adds across the double bond, creating an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. For trans (E) alkenes, the epoxide would form a trans ring, and for cis (Z), a cis ring. Is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. Let's take the example of cyclohexene. When mCPBA reacts with cyclohexene, it forms an epoxide with a specific stereochemistry. The reaction proceeds through a concerted mechanism, where the peracid attacks the less substituted side of the double bond? Or is it more about the geometry?

Wait, I think the key point is that mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that maintains the stereochemistry. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene
