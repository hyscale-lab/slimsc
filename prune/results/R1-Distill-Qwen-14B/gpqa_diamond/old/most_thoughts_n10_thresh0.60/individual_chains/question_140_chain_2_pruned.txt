Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question describes a reaction involving Substance X and liquid Y. Here's what I gather from the problem:

1. **Substance X**: Incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So maybe it's an element with common isotopes, like chlorine or something else.

2. **Reaction with Liquid Y**: Violently reacts and releases gas W. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Hmm, so the molecule is something where neutrons = protons. Let me think about common gases. Maybe H2O? No, because H2O has 2 H and 1 O. Wait, no, the molecule's protons and neutrons must be equal. Let's think: if each atom in the molecule has equal protons and neutrons, or maybe the molecule as a whole? Wait, the question says the molecule contains the same number of neutrons and protons. So total neutrons in the molecule equals total protons. For example, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 proton and 1 neutron) and one O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). The total protons would be 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons would be 2*(1) + 8 = 10. Oh, that adds up! So W could be H2O.

Wait, but when H2O is a gas, it's steam. But the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a rapid reaction releasing a lot of steam? Or perhaps another molecule. Alternatively, maybe the gas is something else. Let me think of other possibilities.

Wait, another thought: CO2. Let's calculate. CO2 has one C and two O. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (since C-12 is common). Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So total protons: 6 + 2*8 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8 =22. Oh, that also works. So CO2 is another possibility.

Wait, but in the problem, the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. Then, heating G releases B, whose melting point is close to 277 K. 2
