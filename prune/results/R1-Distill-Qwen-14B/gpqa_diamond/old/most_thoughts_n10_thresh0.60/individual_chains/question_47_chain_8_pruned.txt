Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2, and there are four options provided. Let's start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, looking at the IR data: there are medium to strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are usually indicative of N-H stretching in amines or amides. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, like an amide or ester. So, the compound probably has both an amine/amide group and a carbonyl.

Now, the 1H NMR data: let's parse each peak.

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This is likely a CH3 group attached to something that causes splitting into a triplet. Maybe an ethyl group (like CH2CH3), where the CH3 is next to a CH2. So, maybe an ethoxy group?
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet for two protons. This could be an OCH2 group, perhaps part of an ester or ether. Alternatively, an NH2 group, but if it's an amide, it would be more downfield.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet for two protons. A quartet suggests splitting into four, which often comes from neighboring groups with two protons each. So, maybe a CH2 next to another CH2. Like in an ester where the CH2 is next to another CH2 group (like OCH2CH3), but wait, the triplet at 1.2 is a CH3, so perhaps ethyl ester. Wait, but wait: in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (the CH3), and the OCH2 would be around 4.1 or so, but here 4.0 is a singlet for 2H. Hmm, maybe it's part of a different structure.

Looking at the aromatic region:
- 7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
- 8.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H
A pair of doublets, each integrating to 2H, suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like two substituents opposite each other on a benzene ring. So, perhaps a benzamide or an ester attached to a benzene at the para position.

Putting this together, let's consider the possible structures.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. The NMR would have ethoxy as CH2CH3 (triplet around 1.2 and quartet around 4.0 maybe), but the benzamide group has a CONH2. Wait, in IR, there's an amide (since there's N-H), and the carbonyl at 1720. But in the NMR, for 3-ethoxybenzamide, the ethoxy is at meta, so there might be splitting in the aromatic protons. But the aromatic protons in the NMR are a doublet each, which would fit a para-substituted benzene. So maybe that's not correct.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So formamide has a structure where the amide is RCONH2. Wait, no, formamide would be HCONH2. N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be O=CNH-Ph-OEt. Wait, actually, the structure would be O=C(NR2) where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the carbonyl would be at around 1720, which matches. The ethoxy group would be as before. But what about the NMR?

In NMR, the ethoxy would be at 1.2 (t, 3H), and the OCH2 at ~4.0? Also, the aromatic would be para-substituted. So the formamide's NH would have a peak, but it's a broad peak. But in the NMR given, the 4.0 ppm is 2H as a broad singlet. Wait, maybe that's the NH2 group? But formamide is NH, so it's a lone proton. Hmm, but the NMR shows 2H at 4.0 as a broad singlet. Maybe not.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So, structure would be CH2CH2COO-NH-Ph. Wait, no.
