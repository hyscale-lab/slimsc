Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. I remember that buffer solutions resist changes in pH when you add acids or bases, but I'm not super confident about all the details. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says we have a solution of 200.00 cm³ (which is 200 mL) containing 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate with water. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Hmm, wait. Orthophosphate is the conjugate base, right? So phosphate ions in solution, but I think in this case, we might be dealing with a buffer solution because we have a weak acid and its conjugate base. Or maybe it's a buffer of a different kind, considering the components.

I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The Ka values are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. Okay, so the first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^-, and the second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2-, and the third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3-.

The problem is about finding the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution. Wait, but PO4^3- is the third deprotonated form. How much of that is present in the solution?

The solution has KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let's write their formulas. KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So, in solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, but H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-, and HPO4^2- can donate another to become PO4^3-. But in the solution, are these in equilibrium?

So, the solution contains both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, which are conjugate acid-base pairs, so this should form a buffer solution. But wait, I'm supposed to find the concentration of PO4^3-.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think about the dissociation steps. The first H comes off H3PO4 to form H2PO4^-, then the second to form HPO4^2-, third to form PO4^3-.

In the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. But how much of each?

Wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4. So the concentration of H2PO4^- comes from KH2PO4, and HPO4^2- comes from Na2HPO4. So the total phosphate species would be H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

But the question is about the concentration of PO4^3-. That's the fully deprotonated form. So how much PO4^3- is present?

I think I need to consider the dissociation of HPO4^2- to form PO4^3-. The Ka for the third dissociation is 1.8e-12. That's a very small Ka, so the concentration of PO4^3- will be very low compared to HPO4^2-.

So, perhaps I can model this using the Ka3 expression. The reaction is
