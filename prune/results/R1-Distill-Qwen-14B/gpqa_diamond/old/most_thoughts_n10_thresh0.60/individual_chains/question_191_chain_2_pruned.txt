Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (that's CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2C(CH3)=CH2, right? Wait, no. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2CH2? No wait, no. Let me think: propene is CH2=CHCH3. The substituent is prop-1-en-2-yl, which is CH2C(=CH2)CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2â€“? No, wait, the numbering. Prop-1-en-2-yl would have the double bond between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituent is on carbon 2. So, it's CH2CH2 with a substituent? Hmm, maybe it's more accurately (CH2)CH2. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)CH(CH3), but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should draw this out
