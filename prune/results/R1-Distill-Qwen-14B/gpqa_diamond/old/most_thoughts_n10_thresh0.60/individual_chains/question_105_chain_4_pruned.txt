Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about photometric variations caused by a star's rotation and how it's similar to an exoplanet transit. Wait, right, when a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view, causing dips in brightness. Similarly, an exoplanet transiting in front of the star would block some light, creating a dip too. So the question is asking what size exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation as the spotted star.

The star's radius is equal to the Sun's, so Rstar is the same as R_sun. The problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with 20% filling factor. Filling factor means the fraction of the surface covered, right? So 20% of the star's surface is spots.

The effective temperature of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. So the spots are at 5000 K? Wait, the temperature difference is 1000 K, but I'm not sure if it's 5000 K or if it's a relative difference. Oh, wait, the problem says a temperature difference of 1000 K. So spot temperature is 6000 -1000 = 5000 K.

Okay, but how does the brightness variation work? When the star rotates, the spots cover parts of the star that we see. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, when that hemisphere is facing us, more of the cooler (darker) spots are visible, causing a dip in brightness. The variation in brightness depends on the fraction of the star's surface that's covered by spots and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest of the star.

Wait, the problem asks what exoplanet radius would produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So we need to model both scenarios and set their brightness variations equal.

Let me think about the brightness change when a planet transits. The dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is proportional to the square of the planet's radius over the star's radius. So the amplitude ΔF_planet = (Rp / Rstar)^2.

For the star with spots, the variation in brightness would be a bit more complex. The spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible hemisphere, the star appears dimmer. The variation depends on the filling factor (f) and the temperature difference.

The star's luminosity is given by L = 4πR²σTeff^4. When part of the surface is covered by spots, the observed flux changes. The average flux when the spots are visible would be (1 - f)*L / (4πD²) + f*(L_spot) / (4πD²), where L_spot is the luminosity of the spotted area.

Wait, more precisely, the total luminosity when spots are visible would be:

L_total = (1 - f) * L_unspotted + f * L_spotted.

But L_unspotted is the normal part of the star's surface, and L_spotted is the area with lower temperature.

So, the star's overall luminosity when spots are visible is less than when spots are not visible. The question is about the variation in brightness as the star rotates, so when the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the brightness decreases, and when it goes away, it returns to normal.

The change in brightness, ΔF_spot, can be calculated as the difference between the normal flux and the flux when spots are visible.

Wait, but the filling factor is 20%, which is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So f = 0.2.

Let me compute the change in flux. The star's total luminosity without spots is L = 4π R_star² σ Teff^4.

When spots are present, the luminosity is L = (1 - f) * L_unspotted + f * L_spotted.

Unspotted areas have Teff, so their luminosity per unit area is σ Teff^4. Spots have T_spot = Te
