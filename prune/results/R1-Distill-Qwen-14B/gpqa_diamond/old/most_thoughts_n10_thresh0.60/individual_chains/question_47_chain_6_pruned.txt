Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about identifying a compound using spectroscopic data. The compound has the formula C9H11NO2. Hmm, let's see what the data tells me.

First, the IR spectrum. The peaks at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches. Wait, or maybe they are from O-H? No, O-H is usually broader and around 3200-3600. But wait, the question says medium to strong intensity. N-H in amines or amides usually show up around those regions. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl group. That could be an amide, ester, or maybe a ketone. But since the formula has two oxygen atoms and an N, maybe it's an ester or amide.

Looking at the 1H NMR data now. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm, a triplet integrating to 3H. That sounds like a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe as part of an ethyl group. Like an ethoxy group. Because the triplet suggests two neighboring protons, which would be the case if it's CH2CH3. So the 1.20 ppm is probably the CH3 of an ethyl group attached to something else.

Next, 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Broad singlet could mean either some exchange, like an NH group, but the integration is 2H. Wait, if it's NH, that would be a singlet, but 2H makes me think maybe it's two NH protons. But amides have two NH protons, but they're usually broad or absent in DMSO-d6. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group or something else. Wait, but 4.0 ppm is upfield for an OCH2. Or perhaps it's an ethyl group where the CH2 is attached to something else. Wait, maybe it's an NH2 group? But the integration is 2H, so maybe a -NH- group?

Then, 4.5 ppm is a quartet integrating to 2H. Quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. That would fit a CH2 group next to
