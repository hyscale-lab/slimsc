Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which comes from having a chiral center. But wait, there are other possibilities too, like if the molecule has a plane of symmetry or not.

The question lists seven compounds, and I need to figure out how many of them are optically active. Let's go through each one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, this is a di-substituted alkene. The configuration is Z, which means the higher priority groups are on the same side. But wait, what about the structure? The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, the structure might be Cl attached to the first carbon, and a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, but the double bond is between 1 and 2 carbons, so structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but wait. Wait, butene is CH2-CH2 with double bond. Let me think. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-C(=CH2)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to carbon
