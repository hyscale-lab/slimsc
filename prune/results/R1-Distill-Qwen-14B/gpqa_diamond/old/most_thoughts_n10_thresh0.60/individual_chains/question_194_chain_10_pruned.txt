Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spins and partition functions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me see if I can work through it step by step.

The problem says: We have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be +1 or -1. The energy of the system is E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? Because each state contributes a term proportional to exp(-βE), and Z is the sum of all these terms.

So first, I need to figure out all the possible states of the system. Each spin can be +1 or -1, so three spins would have 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than listing all 8 states. Because for each state, S1, S2, S3 can be either +1 or -1. So each state is a combination of these.

But wait, calculating the energy for each state individually might be tedious, but maybe manageable.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Let's call this sum H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Then, the energy E is -J H, so E = -J H. So the exponential term becomes exp(β J H), because when E is negative, the exponent is positive.

Wait, because in the partition function Z, each term is exp(-β E). So substituting E = -J H, it becomes exp(β J H).

So for each state, compute H, then compute exp(β J H), sum all these up.

So first, let's find all possible values of H for the three spins.

Each S is ±1, so each product S_i S_j is also ±1. So each term in H is ±1.

H is the sum of three such terms, so H can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, maybe? Let me think.

Wait, each term is either 1 or -1, since S_i S_j is either 1 (same spin) or -1 (opposite). So adding three of them
