Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Let me visualize its structure. It's a benzene ring with substituents at the 3 and 5 positions. Wait, actually, numbering might be a bit confusing. Oh right, in benzene, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group. So the ketone is at position 1, and then bromo and nitro are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no, 3-bromo and 5-nitroâ€”so if the ketone is at position 1, then bromo would be at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the benzene ring, and the ketone is at position 1.

Wait, wait. Benzen rings are usually numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So for 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. If the ketone is on the same carbon as the phenyl group, making it ethan-1-one, so the structure is (Ph
