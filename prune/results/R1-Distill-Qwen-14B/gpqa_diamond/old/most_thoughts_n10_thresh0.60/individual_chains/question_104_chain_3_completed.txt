Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in wavelength can tell us about the planet's mass and orbit, I think.

The problem says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with Neptune-like mass. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for #2. The question is about the ratio of their orbital periods—specifically, how many times longer is planet #2's period compared to planet #1.

Wait, let's think about the radial velocity method. The Doppler shift (wavelength change) depends on the star's velocity due to the planet. The formula I recall is something like v = (G * M_p * sin i) / (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 / (1-e²)^(1/2)) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is zero, so that term drops out. And since the planet masses are much smaller than the stars, M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, which is the same for both stars (solar mass). So the velocity is proportional to (M_p / M_*)^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3?), wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. 

Wait, let's think of the formula: the semi-amplitude K of the radial velocity is given by K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^2 ) ]^(1/3) * (1/( (1-e²)^(0.5) )) ). But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / (M_*^2) )^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3) ) )... Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait another approach: the Doppler shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. The star's velocity is linked to the planet's orbital period. The formula for the semi-amplitude K is K = ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_*^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ). Again, since M_p is much smaller than M_*, and sin i is 1 (edge-on, which is maximum), this simplifies to K ≈ ( (2π G) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p) / M_*^(2/3) ). 

But since both stars have the same mass (M_* same) and the planets have similar Neptune masses, M_p is the same for both. So the K (velocity semi-amplitude) is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), because K = (something) * (1/P^(1/3)).

Wait, here's another way: the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_*) + M_p )^(2) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / c ), where c is the speed of light. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up with the exact formula. Alternatively, I remember that K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_* ^ (2/3) (1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / P^(1/3) ), but again, M_p is much less than M_*, so this becomes K ≈ constant * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)) * (1 / P^(1/3) ). 

So K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, P^(1/3). So K ∝ 1 / P^(1/3). 

In the problem, planet #1 has a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and #2 is 7. The shifts are proportional to K, right? Because a larger shift would mean a higher velocity. So K1 =5, K2=7. Since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), the ratio K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) * (other factors), but since M_* and M_p are same for both, the other factors are same, so K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

Wait wait, let me clarify. Let me write this properly. Let's denote:

K1 = (some constant) / (P1)^(1/3)
K2 = (same constant) / (P2)^(1/3)

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

But wait, since K1 =5 and K2=7, then K1/K2 = 5/7. So:

(5/7) = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

We need to find P2/P1.

So cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So (125)/(343) = P2/P1

Which is approximately 0.364.

Wait, wait, no, because if K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so P is proportional to 1/(K)^(3). So K1 is 5, K2 is7, which are the semi-amplitudes. So lower K implies longer period. Because K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ (1/K)³.

So for K1 =5, P1 ∝ (1/5)^3 = 1/125.

For K2=7, P2 ∝ 1/343.

So P2/P1 = (1/343)/(1/125) )= 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

Wait, so planet #2's period is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So the period of #2 is shorter than #1. But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So if P2 is 0.364 P1, then it's about 0.36 times as long. So the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364, which is approximately 0.36. So answer is option A.

Wait, but the question says, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter than P1. So it's not longer, but shorter. But the options have 0.36 as option A. So that would be the correct answer.


The radial velocity (RV) method detects exoplanets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the gravitational pull of the orbiting planet. The semi-amplitude of the radial velocity, \( K \), is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), as \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \). This relationship arises because the star's velocity is tied to the planet's orbital motion.

For planet #1 and planet #2, the RV shifts are given as 5 milliangstroms and 7 milliangstroms, respectively. Since \( K \propto 1/P^{1/3} \), the ratio of the periods \( P_2/P_1 \) can be determined from the inverse cube of the ratio of the RV shifts:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1. Since the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, the answer is approximately 0.36.
