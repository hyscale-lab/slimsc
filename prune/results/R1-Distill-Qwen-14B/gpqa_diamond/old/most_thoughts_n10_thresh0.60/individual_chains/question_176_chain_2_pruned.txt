Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So, that's a 3x1 vector, probably a normalized state vector because in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented by normalized vectors. Wait, but let me check if this vector is normalized. To do that, I have to compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values of its components.

So, (-1)^2 is 1, 2^2 is 4, 1^2 is 1. Adding them up gives 1+4+1=6. Oh, so the vector isn't normalized. That's a problem because quantum states must be unit vectors. But wait, maybe the question expects me to normalize it, or perhaps I missed something. Hmm. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the vector is already normalized, but wait, 1 +4+1=6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So I probably need to normalize it by dividing each component by sqrt(6). But wait, the question doesn't mention anything about normalization. Hmm. Well, maybe the problem is set up so that the state is not normalized, but the operators are such that the probabilities still come out right. Or perhaps I'm supposed to proceed without normalizing, but that might complicate things.

Next, the operators P and Q are given. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2),0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

Operator Q's matrix is diagonal: first row (1,0,0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-1). So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So after measuring P and getting a certain value, the state changes. Then measuring Q would be done on this new state
