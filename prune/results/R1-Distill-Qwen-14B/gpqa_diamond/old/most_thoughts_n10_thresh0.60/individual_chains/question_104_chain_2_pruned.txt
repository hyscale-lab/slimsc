Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble. The bigger the wobble, the more massive the planet, or the closer it is, I think.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, so their masses are the same. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. Both planets have circular orbits. 

They detected Planet #1 with a 5 milliangstrom periodic shift, and Planet #2's shift is 7 milliangstrom. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. The options are A to D.

Wait, I need to remember the formula related to the RV method. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by some formula involving the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance. 

I think the formula is K = (v * sin i) = (28.4 m/s) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) * (P yr)^(-1/3) * (1 + M_p/M_star)^(2/3)) ) 

Wait, but maybe that's getting too detailed. Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the inclination angle. But since both planets are detected, their inclinations must be such that sin i is similar—probably close to edge-on, so maybe we can assume sin i is the same for both. 

But wait, the question says both are found to have circular orbits, but I don't think that directly affects the RV method except that eccentricity might influence the shape of the spectral line, but not the period in terms of the calculation for K. 

Wait, another approach. The RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is the maximum velocity of the star's reflex motion. K is related to the mass of the planet and the orbital period. The formula I think is K ∝ (M_p / M_star) * (P/(1 yr)) )^(-1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_star))^(1/3) )

But wait, since the stars have
