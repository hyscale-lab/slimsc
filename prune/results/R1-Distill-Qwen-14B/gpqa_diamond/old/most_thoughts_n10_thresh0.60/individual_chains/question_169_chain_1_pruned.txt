Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So, two nucleons of flavor A decay into two B's and two each of particles E and V. Then, there's a variant where instead of two V particles, it emits one exotic, massless particle M. So the reaction becomes 2A → 2B + 2E + M.

The key point is about the energy spectrum of E particles. In the original decay, the E particles have a continuous spectrum with an endpoint Q. Now, how does this change when instead of two V's, there's one M.

Hmm. So I remember that in decay processes, the energy distribution of emitted particles depends on whether the decay products have mass and whether the decay is a result of conservation laws.

Wait, in the original scenario, E and V are two lighter particles. Since the E's have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that they are beta particles or something similar where the energy can vary. But why is their spectrum continuous?

Oh right, in beta decay, when a neutron turns into a proton, it emits an electron and an antineutrino. The emitted electron has a continuous spectrum because the Q value is shared between the electron and the neutrino. Since neutrinos are hard to detect and are massless (or nearly so), the electron can take a range of energies up to the maximum Q. That's why the spectrum is continuous.

So in the original case, if E and V are like beta particles, then their energies are shared. But what's the case when two V's are emitted? Or, in the variant, just one M.

Wait, the problem says that in the original decay, two E and two V are emitted. So the original decay produces four particles: each A decaying into one B, one E, and one V? Or maybe the two A's decay into two B's and four particles, two E and two V.

But the original setup is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So each A must be decaying into B, E, and V? Or perhaps it's a double decay.

But the key is the emission of E and V. Since the E particles have a continuous spectrum, that suggests that their energies are variable. So maybe the process is similar to beta decay, where energy is divided between particles.

But now, in the variant, instead of two V's, we have one M. And M is massless. So how does the change affect the E particles' spectrum?

In the original decay, if each E can have a range of energies, but now if there's only one M emitted, which is massless, perhaps the energy distribution changes.

Wait, in the original case, the two V's would share some energy, but in the variant, M is massless, so it might carry away some energy.

Wait, let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. In the original decay, the total energy released is Q, perhaps. So the energy is divided among the products.

In the original decay, the two V's and two E's would each carry some energy. Since E and V are lighter, perhaps their energies are determined by the available Q value.

But wait, when the decay emits more particles, does that affect the possible energy spectrum of E? For example, in beta decay, when you have an electron and a neutrino, the electron's energy is continuous because the neutrino takes away some energy. But if you also have another particle, maybe this affects the maximum energy.

Wait, but in the original problem, the E's have a continuous spectrum. So perhaps the V particles are also involved in carrying away energy, allowing E's to have variable energies.

In the variant, instead of two V's, there's one M which is massless. So maybe M takes more energy, or perhaps it changes the way energy is distributed.

Wait, another angle: the number of particles emitted can affect the energy spectrum. For example, in positron emission, when you have only one neutrino, the emitted positron has a continuous spectrum. But if you have two leptons (like in some decay modes), but in those cases, the energy spectrum might be different.

Alternatively, considering that when you have more particles emitted, the maximum possible energy for each individual particle decreases because energy is split among more particles.

Wait, but in the original case, the E's have a continuous spectrum with endpoint Q. So perhaps the maximum energy any E can have is Q. But if in the variant, the decay emits another particle instead, would that change the endpoint?

Wait, perhaps in the original decay, the two V's are also taking some energy. So each E can't have more than (Q - energy used by V's) each. Then in the variant, with one M which is massless, perhaps the energy is divided differently.

Wait, but what if M is massless? Then it's like a photon or a neutrino, which can
