Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all these reactions and calculations. But I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in an acid. Hmm, right. Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, which is a base. When you add a strong acid to it, they should react. The acid is monobasic and strong, so probably like HCl or HNO3. 

The problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 and want to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3... Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1. So Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). Let me compute:

Fe: 55.85
Each OH- is (16 + 1) = 17, so 3*17=51.
Total = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, more accurately, 0.1/106.85 is approximately 0.0009358 mol. Let me note that as approximately 9.358e-4 moles.

Next, the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is a base, and when it reacts with a strong monobasic acid like HCl, it should form Fe^3+ ions and water. The reaction equation would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Because Fe(OH)3 is a strong base? No, actually, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base because it's a hydroxide of a transition metal. But since the acid is strong, the reaction should proceed. But the stoichiometry might be different. Let me think again.

The formula for Fe(OH)3 is Fe(OH)3. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 will react with 3 moles of H+ ions. That's right. Because each OH- in Fe(OH)3 will take an H+ to form water. So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are needed.

So, if I have 0.0009358 moles of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ required would be 3 * 0.0009358 ≈ 0.002807 moles.

The acid solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So, to find the volume needed, I can use the formula:

M = moles / volume (in liters)
=> volume = moles / M

The moles needed are 0.002807, so:

volume = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C says 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Option B is 30.09, which is a bit higher.

Wait, but the initial volume is 100 cm³. Does that affect the calculation? Because the acid volume adds to the total solution volume. Oh wait, but the question says "minimum volume of a
