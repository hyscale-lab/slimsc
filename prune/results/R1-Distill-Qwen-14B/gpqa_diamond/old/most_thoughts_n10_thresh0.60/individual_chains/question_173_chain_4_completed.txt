Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in an electron's energy. Hmm, I remember something about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle from my studies. Let me try to think this through.

The question says that an electron is moving along the x-direction at a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, each giving a different order of magnitude.

Wait, I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

But how does that relate to energy? Oh, because the momentum p is related to kinetic energy. The kinetic energy E is (p²)/(2m), so maybe I can find Δp first and then relate it to ΔE.

So, starting with the uncertainty principle. Let's rearrange the inequality to solve for Δp. Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I can use the equality Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh, nanometers to meters: 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 m.

Calculating Δp: ħ is 1.05e-34 J·s. So Δp = (1.05e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) ) = 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = approximately 5.25e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, let me calculate that again. 2 * 1e-10 is 2e-10, so 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1.05 / 2) * 1e-24. 1.05/2 is about 0.525, so 0.525e-24, which is 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. Yeah, that's right.

Now, to find the uncertainty in energy ΔE. Since the electron's kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be (Δp²)/(2m). Let me write that down: ΔE = (Δp²) / (2m_e), where m_e is the mass of the electron.

What's the mass of an electron? I think it's about 9.11e-31 kg. So plugging in the numbers: ΔE = (5.25e-25)^2 / (2 * 9.11e-31)

Let's compute the numerator first. (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 * 1e-50. 5.25 squared is about 27.56. So 27.56e-50, which is 2.756e-49.

Denominator: 2 * 9.11e-31 = 18.22e-31, which is 1.822e-30.

So ΔE ≈ 2.756e-49 / 1.822e-30. Let's divide the exponents: 1e-49 / 1e-30 = 1e-19. So 2.756 / 1.822 ≈ 1.513. So 1.513e-19 J.

Wait, that's approximately 1.5e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, and option B is ~1e-17. My calculation is about 1.5e-19, which is closest to option C. So the answer should be C.

Hmm, but wait, the problem states that the electron is moving at a speed v=2e8 m/s. Does that affect the calculation? Oh wait, I think the Heisenberg Uncertainty gives the relationship between Δx and Δp, regardless of the actual momentum or speed. Because the uncertainty principle is about the limits of simultaneous measurement, not the actual values.

So I think the speed given is a red herring, or perhaps not needed for this particular calculation. Because the uncertainty in momentum comes only from the uncertainty in position, not the actual speed. So yeah, my initial calculation should be correct.

So the minimum uncertainty in energy is about 1.5e-19 J, which is closest to option C) ~1e-19 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron moving with a speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) and an uncertainty in position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2},
\]

where \( \hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \). Rearranging for \( \Delta p \), we find:

\[
\Delta p \approx \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}.
\]

Given \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), substituting the values gives:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

Next, the uncertainty in energy \( \Delta E \) is related to the uncertainty in momentum \( \Delta p \) through the kinetic energy formula:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{\Delta p^2}{2 m_e},
\]

where \( m_e = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) is the mass of the electron. Substituting \( \Delta p = 5.27 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, compute the numerator:

\[
(5.27 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 27.77 \times 10^{-50} = 2.777 \times 10^{-49}.
\]

Next, compute the denominator:

\[
2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Dividing these gives:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.525 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Thus, the minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is closest to option C (\( \sim 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)).

The speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) is not directly relevant to this calculation, as the uncertainty principle depends only on \( \Delta x \) and \( \Delta p \), not the actual speed.
