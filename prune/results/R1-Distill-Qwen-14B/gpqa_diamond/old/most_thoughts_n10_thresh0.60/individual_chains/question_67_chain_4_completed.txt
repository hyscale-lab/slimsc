Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The setup: There are two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, so we're focusing just on their orbital angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |l₁, l₂, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. 

Wait, okay, angular momentum coupling... I remember that when you have two particles, their individual angular momenta can combine in different ways. So each electron has its own l₁ and l₂, which are both 1 here because they're in p orbitals (p has l=1). Then the total angular momentum quantum numbers are l and m. So l can range from |l₁ - l₂| to l₁ + l₂. In this case, since both are 1, l can be 0,1,2. The given state is l=2, m=-1.

The question is about measuring the orbital angular momentum components L₁z and L₂z for each electron. The measurement is for both L₁z and L₂z, and we want the probability that both are equal to -ħ. So we're looking for the probability that L₁z = -ħ and L₂z = -ħ.

Hmm. I remember that angular momentum states are eigenstates of certain operators. For a coupled state like |l₁, l₂, l, m>, it's an eigenstate of L², L_z (the total), and also each L_zi (individual), but wait, no. Because when you couple angular momenta, the state is a combination of the individual states. So, perhaps the coupled state can be expressed as a linear combination of product states of individual states.

Wait, no, I think that when you have a coupled state |l₁, l₂, l, m>, it's expressed as a combination of |l₁, m₁> ⊗ |l₂, m₂> states, such that m₁ + m₂ = m. Oh, but wait, in this case, the total m is -1. So m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So, the given state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the z-component m is -1. Now, we need to express this state in terms of the product states of individual m₁ and m₂ values. Because when you measure L₁z and L₂z, you'd be projecting into those individual m states.

So, the possible individual m₁ and m₂ values must sum up to -1. Since each electron can have m₁ and m₂ values from -1, 0, +1. Let's list all possible (m₁, m₂) pairs that add up to -1:

- (m₁, m₂) = (-1, 0): -1 + 0 = -1
- (0, -1): 0 + (-1) = -1

Wait, are those the only possibilities? Let's see:

m₁ can be -1, 0, 1; same for m₂. So m₁ + m₂ = -1.

So, possible pairs are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (1, -2) but wait, m₂ can't be -2 because l₂ is 1, so m₂ can only be -1,0,1. So (1, -2) is invalid. So only two possibilities: (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait wait, what about ( -1, 0 ), (0, -1 ), (1, -2 )? But since m₂ can't be -2, because l₂=1, m₂ can't be less than -1. So only two valid pairs. So the product states would be |1, -1> ⊗ |1, 0> and |1,0> ⊗ |1,-1>.

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of these two product states. The coefficients can be determined using the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Oh right, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients tell us how to combine the individual states to get the coupled states.

Wait, from what I remember, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta l1 and l2 to get L and M are such that the state |l1, l2, L, M> is a sum over m1 and m2 where m1 + m2 = M, of the product |m1> |m2> multiplied by the CG coefficient.

So in this case, L=2 and M=-1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of |1, m1> |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

As we found earlier, m1 can be -1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a linear combination of |1,-1>⊗|1,0> and |1,0>⊗|1,-1> with some coefficients.

Let me write that as:

|1,1,2,-1> = a * |1,-1>|1,0> + b * |1,0>|1,-1>

The coefficients a and b can be found from the Clebsch-Gordan table or formula.

I think for L=2 and M=-1, which are the values here, the CG coefficients for two l=1 states are known. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute them.

Wait, the general formula for CG coefficients is a bit involved, but for two p orbitals (l=1), I think the coefficients for adding to L=2 and M=-1 are known.

Wait, from what I remember, the CG coefficients for adding two l=1 (p orbitals) to get L=2 (d orbital) are symmetric in certain cases.

Let me think: For each state, the coefficient is determined by the combination of m1 and m2.

In our case, the two possible (m1, m2) are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So, the coefficients for these two product states in the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> would be given by the CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1.

I think the CG coefficients for L = l1 + l2 when l1 = l2 =1, and L=2.

I recall that for M = m1 + m2.

In this case, M = -1.

So the two possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

The CG coefficients for these would be determined using the formula:

< l1 m1, l2 m2 | L M >.

The formula for CG coefficients is:

< l1 m1 l2 m2 | L M > = (-1)^{L - l1 - l2} * sqrt( (2L +1) ( (l1 + l2 - L)(l1 + l2 + L) ) / ( (2l1 +1)(2l2 +1) ) ) * [ ... some polynomial terms ... ]

Wait, perhaps that's getting a bit too complicated. Maybe I can look up the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible L values are 0, 1, 2.

For L=2, the M values can be -2, -1, 0, +1, +2.

So for M=-1, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of the two product states mentioned earlier.

I think the CG coefficients for L=2, M=-1 are sqrt(2/3) for the (m1, m2) = (-1,0) and sqrt(1/3) for (m1, m2)=(0,-1). Or was it the other way around? Or perhaps I've got them swapped.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the square of the coefficients. Let me think about normalization. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should add up to 1.

Suppose the state is:

|1,1,2,-1> = c1 |1,-1>|1,0> + c2 |1,0>|1,-1>

The coefficients c1 and c2 should satisfy |c1|² + |c2|² = 1.

Wait, but I heard that when you have two p orbitals combining to a d orbital (l=2), the CG coefficients for M=-1 are such that the coefficients for the two terms are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible combinations of m1 and m2 that sum to -1. So for each possible term, the product state is |m1, m2>.

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The coefficients can be found using the CG coefficients.

I think the general formula for CG coefficients when l1 = l2 =1, L=2, M=-1 is:

For each (m1, m2) pair where m1 +m2 = M=-1,

the coefficient is:

sqrt( ( (2 - |m1|)(2 - |m2|) ) / ( (2)(2) ) )

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I should look for a table. Oh wait, I can't look it up right now, but I can try to remember.

Wait, I think that for the addition of two l=1 (p) angular momenta to get L=2, the states are symmetric in certain ways.

For M=2, only one term: m1=1, m2=1.

For M=1, two terms: m1=1, m2=0; m1=0, m2=1.

Wait, but in our case, M=-1. So the two terms are m1=-1, m2=0 and m1=0, m2=-1.

But what's the relative coefficients?

Another approach: think about the state |1,1,2,-1> being a symmetric combination? Or maybe not. Wait, because L=2 is even, perhaps the state has certain symmetry.

Wait, but no, the state with M=-1 is not symmetric under exchange of the two electrons. Because if you swap the two electrons, m1 and m2 swap, which would turn the term (m1=-1, m2=0) into (m1=0, m2=-1). So, if the state is symmetric, their coefficients would be the same. But in our case, perhaps the coefficients are different.

Wait, but electrons are fermions, so their overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. But wait, the question says to ignore spin, so we're only considering the orbital part. So, in the orbital part, if the electrons are in the same state, the orbital wavefunction must be symmetric because the spin part would be antisymmetric. But in this case, the electrons are in the same l=1 orbital, so perhaps the orbital part is symmetric.

Wait, but in our problem, the state given is |1,1,2,-1>, which is a coupled state. So, perhaps the state is symmetric under exchange.

Wait, no. Because when you have two identical particles, their combined state must be antisymmetric. But if we're ignoring spin, then the orbital part must be antisymmetric. Wait, but this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should focus back on the problem.

The key point is, the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> is expressed as a linear combination of product states |m1>⊗|m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

So, the state is a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>.

The coefficients can be found from the CG coefficients. Let me see if I can find them.

I think the CG coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1 are such that the coefficients are given by:

For (m1, m2) = (-1, 0): coefficient is sqrt( ( (2 +1) ) / (2+1 + ... ) ) Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that for two p orbitals combining into l=2:

The state |2, -1> can be written as:

sqrt(2/3) |1, -1> |1, 0> + sqrt(1/3) |1, 0> |1, -1> 

Wait, I think that's correct. Let me verify the normalization. The squares would be (2/3) + (1/3) = 1, so that's correct.

Alternatively, it could be the other way around, but I think the first term has the larger coefficient.

Wait, perhaps I can also think in terms of ladder operators. The state |L, M> can be built from the product states using the ladder operators. 

But perhaps I don't need to get too bogged down in the exact coefficients right now. The main point is, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of |1,-1>|1,0> and |1,0>|1,-1>.

So, when we measure L₁z and L₂z, what outcomes do we get?

Each product state in the expansion corresponds to specific m values for each particle. So, the product state |1,-1> |1,0> corresponds to m1 = -1 and m2 = 0. Similarly, the product state |1,0> |1,-1> corresponds to m1 = 0 and m2 = -1.

The question is asking for the joint probability of getting L₁z = -ħ and L₂z = -ħ. That would require both m1 and m2 to be -1. Because L₁z = ħ m1, and similarly for L₂z. So, if m1=-1 and m2=-1, then both L₁z and L₂z are -ħ.

But wait, looking at the possible product states in the expansion, neither of them have m1=-1 and m2=-1. Because our possible (m1, m2) pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1), which sum to -1. So, in neither of the terms do both m1 and m2 equal -1. 

So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a combination of product states where one electron has m=-1 and the other m=0, or vice versa. There's no term where both have m=-1. 

Therefore, the probability of measuring both L₁z and L₂z to be -ħ is zero, because the state doesn't have any component where m1=-1 and m2=-1.

So, the joint probability is zero. So the correct answer is D) 0.


The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state described by $|l_1, l_2, l, m\rangle = |1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Here, $l_1 = l_2 = 1$ (corresponding to $p$ orbitals), $l = 2$ (total orbital angular momentum), and $m = -1$ (the $z$-component of the total angular momentum). The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$.

To solve this, we express the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ as a linear combination of product states $|m_1\rangle \otimes |m_2\rangle$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the $z$-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. The condition $m_1 + m_2 = m = -1$ restricts the possible $(m_1, m_2)$ pairs to:

1. $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$
2. $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$

Thus, the coupled state can be written as:

\[
|1,1,2,-1\rangle = c_1 |1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,0\rangle + c_2 |1,0\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle
\]

The coefficients $c_1$ and $c_2$ are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for $l_1 = l_2 = 1$ and $L = 2$. These coefficients are known to be:

\[
c_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}, \quad c_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

The state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ is therefore a normalized superposition of the two product states $|1,-1\rangle \otimes |1,0\rangle$ and $|1,0\rangle \otimes |1,-1\rangle$.

When measuring $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$, the possible outcomes correspond to the $m_1$ and $m_2$ values of the product states. For the joint measurement $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$, both electrons must have $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$ does not contain any term where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. The only terms are $(m_1, m_2) = (-1, 0)$ and $(m_1, m_2) = (0, -1)$.

Since there is no component of the state where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, the joint probability of measuring $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$ is zero.
