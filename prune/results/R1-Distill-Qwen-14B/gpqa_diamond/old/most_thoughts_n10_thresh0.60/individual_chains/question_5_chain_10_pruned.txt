Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and eigenvectors represent the states where the operator has a definite value.

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. The question is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along a direction n in the x-z plane. So I think the operator P is a vector operator, and the direction n is arbitrary but in the x-z plane, which means it's in the XZ-plane, so the angle θ would be from the z-axis. Right, because the x-z plane is spanned by the x and z axes. So direction vector n could be (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ), but wait, wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, the direction in x-z plane would have θ measured from the z-axis, and φ would be 0 or π because it's in the x-z plane (i.e., φ is 0 or π, but since the direction is arbitrary, maybe we can just choose φ=0 without loss of generality, but perhaps it's not necessary here). But maybe I don't need to worry about φ because the problem says the direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, but the eigenvector will depend on θ. Hmm.

So the operator P is a vector operator, which can be written as P = P_x x-hat + P_y y-hat + P_z z-hat. But since the direction of interest is along n, which is in the x-z plane, and we're looking for the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for P along n, I think that the operator we're interested in is P_n = n · P, which is n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because P_y's component is zero since n is in the x-z plane. Wait no, actually, in the x-z plane, the direction vector n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, no, wait, no, wait. Wait, if the direction is in the x-z plane, the y-component of n is zero. So n is (nx, 0, nz), but since it's a unit vector, nx^2 + nz^2 =1.

So the operator P in the direction n is P_n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because P is a vector operator, so when you take a component along a direction, you sum P_i multiplied by the direction's i-component.

So the eigenvalue equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Wait, but the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So we're looking for the eigenvector of P_n corresponding to this eigenvalue.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem says to calculate the eigenvector of P along n, which corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the operator is P_n, and the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So first, I'll need to construct the matrix for P_n. Since n is in the x-z plane, n has components (a, 0, b), with a^2 + b^2 =1. So P_n = a P_x + b P_z.

Given the matrices for P_x, P_y, P_z:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So substituting into P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ a * [[0,1],[1,0]] + b * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Adding the matrices:

a*(0,1;1,0) = [[0, a],[a, 0]]
b*(1,0;0,-1) = [[b, 0],[0, -b]]

So adding these gives:

[[b, a],
 [a, -b]]

Multiply by ħ/2, so P_n = (ħ/2) * [[b, a],[a, -b]]

So the matrix is:

[ [ (ħ/2) b, (ħ/2) a ],
  [ (ħ/2) a, -(ħ/2) b ] ]

Wait, no. Let me compute it correctly.

Wait, P_n is a sum of a P_x and b P_z. Each of P_x and P_z is multiplied by (
