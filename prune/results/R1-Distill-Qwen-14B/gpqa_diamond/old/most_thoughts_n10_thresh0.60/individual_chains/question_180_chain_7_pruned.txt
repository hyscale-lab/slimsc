Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. So, I remember that the elementary charge e is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each of these charges is 2 times that, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C.

Now, 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P.

The question is about finding the minimum energy of this system. I think this refers to the electric potential energy. Because in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, considering their mutual interactions.

Wait, so for a system of charges, the potential energy U is given by the formula U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (Σ (q_i q_j)/r_ij), where i < j. But wait, in this case, since all the charges are identical and at the same distance from P, maybe we can compute it more simply.

Wait, the point P is where the 13th charge is located. So the 13th charge is fixed there, and each of the 12 charges is at 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2m from the 13th charge.

But also, the 12 charges are at 2m from P, but how are they arranged relative to each other? Are they all on a sphere of radius 2m around P? So each of the 12 charges is 2m from P, but the distance between any two of the 12 charges would depend on their positions. However, if the problem is considering the minimal energy, perhaps the configuration where each of the 12 charges is as far apart as possible, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering only the potential energies between the 13th charge and each of the 12, and the potential energies between the 12 charges themselves.

Wait, but the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So maybe the distances between the
