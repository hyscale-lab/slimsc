Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the uncertainty in P_z. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me the matrices for the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which makes sense because usually, the eigenbasis of an observable is the basis you'd use for such problems.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh wait, wait. Let me think about normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1. Let's check: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, (-1/2)^2 is another 1/4. Adding them up: 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. Right, so it's normalized. Good.

I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, ΔP_z. I remember that the uncertainty is the square root of the expectation of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation of P_z. So ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z^2⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

But first, I should compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since the state is given in the basis of P_z's eigenvectors, applying P_z to the state should just give its eigenvalue. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't assume that P_z acting on it just gives an eigenvalue; I need to compute the expectation value properly.

So, the state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ; 1/√2 ; -1/2 ]. Let's write this as a column vector. To compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, P_z is a matrix. Let me write out P_z's matrix as given:

P_z = [[ħ, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, -ħ]]

So, when I multiply P_z by |ψ⟩, I get each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So P_z |ψ⟩ would be:

(ħ)(-1/2) = -ħ/2 in the first component,
0 * (1/√2) = 0 in the second,
(-ħ)(-1/2) = ħ/2 in the third.

Wait, but to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate ψ† (P_z ψ). Let me compute P_z ψ first.

P_z ψ = [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the row vector [-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2].

So, ψ† (P_z ψ) is the dot product of ψ† and P_z ψ.

So that's (-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ/2) = ħ/4.
Third term: (-1/2)(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.
The middle term is 0.

Adding them: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Hmm, interesting. So the expectation value of P_z is zero.

Next, I need to find ⟨P_z²⟩. Since P_z is already diagonal in this basis, P_z squared is just the square of the diagonal elements. So P_z² is [[(ħ)^2, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, (ħ)^2]].

So, P_z² |ψ⟩ is [ (ħ^2)(-1/2), 0, (ħ^2)(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait, no. Wait, P_z² is [[ħ², 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, ħ²]]. So when you multiply P_z² by |ψ⟩, you get each component multiplied by the diagonal element squared.

So P_z² ψ is [ (ħ²)(-1/2), 0, (ħ²)(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck: the first component is (ħ²)(-1/2), second component is 0, third component is (ħ²)(-1/2). Yes.

Then, ψ† multiplied by P_z² ψ is:

(-1/2)(-ħ²/2) + (1/√2)(0) + (-1/2)(-ħ²/2).

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.
Third term: (1/2)(ħ²/2) = ħ²/4.

Adding them gives ħ²/4 + ħ²/4 = ħ²/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Wait, wait. Let me do that calculation again. Because P_z² is diagonal, so when I compute ⟨P_z²⟩, it's the sum of each component squared times the corresponding element in P_z squared.

Wait, more accurately, ψ is a vector (a, b, c). Then ⟨P_z²⟩ is a² * (ħ)^2 + b² * 0 + c² * (ħ)^2.

Looking at |ψ⟩:

a = -1/2, so a² = 1/4.

c = -1/2, so c² = 1/4.

b = 1/sqrt(2), b² = 1/2.

So ⟨P_z²⟩ = (1/4)(ħ²) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(ħ²) = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So that's correct. So ⟨P_z²⟩ is ħ²/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Since ⟨P_z⟩ is 0, it's sqrt(ħ²/2) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the state is an eigenstate of P_x, but P_z is another observable. The uncertainty principle says that if a state is an eigenstate of one observable, its uncertainty in the other is non-zero unless the two observables commute.

But in this case, P_x and P_z don't commute, so the uncertainty in P_z should be non-zero, which matches our result.

So the options are:

A) sqrt(2) ħ

B) ħ/sqrt(2)

C) ħ/2

D) ħ

So the value we found is ħ/sqrt(2), which is option B.


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The state of the system is given as the column vector:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The operator $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, with the matrix:

\[
P_z = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z \rangle$, we calculate:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle = \psi^\dagger (P_z \psi).
\]

First, compute $P_z |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -\hbar \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar}{2} \\ 0 \\ \frac{\hbar}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the dot product with $\psi^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{4} + 0 - \frac{\hbar}{4} = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The operator $P_z^2$ is the square of $P_z$:

\[
P_z^2 = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$, we calculate:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle = \psi^\dagger (P_z^2 \psi).
\]

First, compute $P_z^2 |\psi\rangle$:

\[
P_z^2 |\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \hbar^2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & \hbar^2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \\ 0 \\ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Now, take the dot product with $\psi^\dagger = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}$:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)(0) + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2}\right).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{4} + 0 + \frac{\hbar^2}{4} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
Using the formula for uncertainty:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2} - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hbar^2}{2}} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to **Option B**.
