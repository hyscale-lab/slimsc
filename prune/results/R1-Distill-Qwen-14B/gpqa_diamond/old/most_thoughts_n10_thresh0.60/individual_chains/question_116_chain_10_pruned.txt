Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons corresponds to their splitting. So a triplet for 6H suggests that those protons are each split into a triplet. Wait, actually, the triplet is for the integration of 6H, which is the total. So maybe each of those 6H is adjacent to two equivalent protons. Or perhaps it's two sets of 3H each that are split into a triplet. Wait, noâ€”triplet means each proton is next to two others, so perhaps it's a -CH2CH2- group?

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H. Oh, wait, 0.9 ppm is usually a methyl group attached to something, maybe an oxygen or a neighboring group. Like in an ether or something. But wait, 6H suggests two methyl groups, each with 3H. Oh, wait no, 6H would be two groups each of 3H. But methyl groups are usually singlets if they're not split by neighboring protons. Wait, but in this case, it's a triplet. So perhaps each methyl group is next to
