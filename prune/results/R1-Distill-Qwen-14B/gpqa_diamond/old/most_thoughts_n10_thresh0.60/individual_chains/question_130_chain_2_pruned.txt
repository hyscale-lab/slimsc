Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to the subject, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorbing light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is approximately 1216 Angstroms. The task is to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B) 1.2, C) 2.4, D) 1.9.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is a specific emission or absorption line in hydrogen. In this case, it's about absorption because the clouds are absorbing the quasar's light. So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium absorb at the Lyman alpha wavelength.

Wait, the Lyman alpha wavelength is about 1216 Angstroms. But wait, isn't that in the far ultraviolet? Because I remember that the Lyman series is in the UV. So if a cloud is at a certain redshift, the observed wavelength would be longer (redshifted).

But how does this relate to detection with optical telescopes? Oh right, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the wavelength must be shifted into the visible spectrum.

So the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen clouds. The absorption line at 1216 Angstroms (rest frame) would be redshifted to a longer wavelength when observed. If the observed wavelength is in the optical range, which is roughly 400-700 nm (4000 to 7000 Angstroms), then we can set up an equation.

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength) / (rest wavelength) - 1.

So the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength needs to be at least 4000 Angstroms to be in the optical range. Let me plug that in.

z = (4000 / 1216) - 1. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216 is approximately 3.29. So 3.29 minus 1 is 2.29. So the redshift z is about 2.29.

Wait, but the question is asking for the lower limit. So the Lyman alpha absorption line needs to be just entering the optical range. If the observed wavelength is higher than 4000 Angstroms, it's in the optical. So the minimum z would be when the observed wavelength is 4000 Angstroms.

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.29. So the redshift must be at least about 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest higher value is option C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. Wait, 2.29 is between 2.2 and 2.4. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29, so the minimum z is about 2.3.

Wait, but the options are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So 2.4 is the closest higher option. But wait, wait a minute. Another thought: maybe the optical range starts at longer wavelengths than 4000 Angstroms? Let me think. Because 400 nm is violet, 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm. So optical starts around 400 nm (violet) up to about 700 nm (red). So if the observed wavelength is at 4000 Angstroms (400 nm), that's the lower edge of optical. So the redshift z would be (4000/1216) -1 ≈ 2.29.

So the lower limit on the redshift is roughly 2.29. None of the options give exactly that, but the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, 2.29 is close to 2.3, but the options have 2.4 as option C. So if the question is about the lower limit such that the absorption line is in the optical, then the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted into the optical. So the minimum z is when lambda_obs is 4000 Angstroms.

So the calculation gives z≈2.29, so the lower limit is just above 2.29. Since 2.29 is about 2.3, the next available option higher than that is 2.4. So the answer would be C) 2.4?

Wait, another angle: perhaps the Lyman alpha line is observed in
