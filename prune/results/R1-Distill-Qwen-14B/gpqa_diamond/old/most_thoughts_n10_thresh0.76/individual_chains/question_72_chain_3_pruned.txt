Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. But I'll take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions leading to a final product, and I need to determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present on that product. The options are A) 8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Let me try to break down each step.

First, the initial compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I'm a bit fuzzy on the structure of bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene. From what I remember, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure, which is a bridged bicyclic compound. The hepta-2,5-diene part means there are two double bonds at positions 2 and 5. So the structure would have two rings, probably with two double bonds.

Then, this compound is combined with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Wait, so the starting material is a diene with a tert-butoxy group. The other reactant is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Hmm, sodium iodide is typically a source of iodide ions. Oh, wait a second! This looks like a Diels-Alder reaction setup. Because the starting compound has a diene (the bicyclo structure with two double bonds?), and the other compound has two dienophiles (each dibromomethyl group attached to a cyclohexene? Or wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene—so the cyclohexene has double bonds at 1,3 positions, and at 5 and 6 positions there are dibromomethyl groups.

Wait, no. Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene: so positions 5 and 6 are each attached to a CH2Br2 group. So each CH2Br2 is on the cyclohexene at positions 5 and 6. So the structure is a cyclohexene (double bonds at 1,3), and at 5 and 6 positions, there are CH2Br2 groups.

Wait, but when we have two equivalents, that might mean adding two such groups. Wait, but the starting compound is a diene. So perhaps each of the two dienophiles (the dibromomethyl groups) will react in a Diels-Alder reaction with the starting diene. But wait, the starting material is a bicyclo diene, which is conjugated? Or perhaps each diene in the starting material will react with a dienophile.

Wait, the starting material is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene—so two double bonds, maybe at 2 and 5? So, the structure is a norbornene derivative with two double bonds. Hmm, but wait, norbornene is
