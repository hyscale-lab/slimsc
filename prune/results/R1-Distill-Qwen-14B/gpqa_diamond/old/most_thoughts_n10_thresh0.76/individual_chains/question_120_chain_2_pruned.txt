Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. Hmm, parallax is a measure of distance, right? Oh wait, right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So a larger parallax means the star is closer.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed might mean that the number of stars in a given volume is the same everywhere. Wait, but the distribution is in 3D space, so I need to think about how parallax relates to distance and how that affects the number of stars in a certain parallax range.

Parallax, plx, is equal to 1/distance (d) in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. But I'm not sure how that ties into the number of stars per unit plx.

Let me think about the volume. Volume is proportional to the cube of the distance. So if you have a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dr, the volume would be 4πd² dr. But since plx is 1/d, dr = - (1/plx²) d(plx). Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx instead of d.

So if I consider a small change in parallax, d(plx) = delta plx, then the corresponding change in distance is d = 1/plx, so dd = -1/(plx²) d(plx). Wait, maybe I should get the volume in terms of plx.
