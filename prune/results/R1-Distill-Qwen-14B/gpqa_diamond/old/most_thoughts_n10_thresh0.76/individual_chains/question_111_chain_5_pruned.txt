Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the major products formed in two reactions. The question gives me two different reactions, A and B, and I have to pick the correct options from the four provided. Let me take them one at a time.

Starting with Reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so maybe this is an enolate formation reaction. Enolates are involved in alkylation or acylation reactions. 

The starting ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw that structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1, which is adjacent (position 2) to an ethyl group and a methyl group at position 6. Wait, no, maybe I should number the ring correctly. Let's see: position 1 is the ketone, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl (since it's 2-ethyl and 2,6-dimethyl implies two methyl groups? Wait no, 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl would mean that position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl as well. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone at C1, C2 has ethyl and methyl substituents, and C6 has methyl. 

So when t-BuOK is present, it will deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate. The enolate can attack the acrylate. But wait, ethyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. So it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. The reaction here is likely a conjugate addition (Michael addition) or an aldol-like addition. But given that the base is bulky, maybe the enolate forms at the less hindered position.

Wait, the ketone is at position 1. The cyclohexanone has substituents at 2 (ethyl and methyl) and 6 (methyl). So the enolate would form at the alpha position. The alpha carbons are adjacent to the carbonyl, so in this case, positions 2 and maybe another position. Wait, the carbonyl is at C1; the alpha carbons would be C2 and C12 (but cyclohexane is a ring, so perhaps positions 2 and ... wait, in a cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at C1, so the adjacent carbons are C2 and C12 (but since it's a ring, positions 2 and 6? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think: the six-membered ring with ketone at C1. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So the alpha carbons are C2 and C6. 

So the enolate will form at either C2 or C6. But wait, the substituents at C2 are an ethyl and a methyl, and at C6, a methyl. So which position is more acidic? Bulky substituents can sometimes stabilize the enolate better through induction and steric effects. But t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base; it will abstract the less hindered proton, perhaps.

Wait, the substituents at C2 are more bulky. The ethyl and methyl group are at C2. So the H's at C2 (alpha to the carbonyl) are more hindered. So the base might abstract the proton from the less hindered position, which would be C6. Because C6 has only a methyl group, which is less bulky than ethyl and methyl at C2. So the enolate would form more easily at C6.

Wait, but wait. When the base is bulky, it tends to abstract the less hindered proton, leading to the more substituted enolate if possible because it's more stabilized. Alternatively, maybe the enolate forms at the less substituted position because steric hind
