Okay, so I need to calculate the enthalpy of formation for this organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me think about how to approach this.

Wait, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. Oh right, and it's usually calculated using bond energies.

But wait, the question gives me some data: enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, atomization is breaking all bonds in an atom to make it into separate atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy needed to break all the bonds to form C atoms.

The bond energies given are for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. So I need to figure out how many of each bond are present in the compound and then calculate the total bond energy.

Wait, but the compound is a bit complex. Let me draw it out or at least count the bonds. Let's see, the structure is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. So, each CH3 group has three C-H bonds. The central part has a double bond and single bonds.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of each type of bond in the molecule. Let's count each type.

First, the molecule.
