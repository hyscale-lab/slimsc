Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about why a transgenic mouse model isn't expressing the protein as expected. Hmm, let's break this down.

The setup is that someone is trying to create a mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus, which is a common way to track proteins in experimentsâ€”like using antibodies against HA to detect the protein. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, but the overexpression isn't happening. They checked the construct's sequence and found an issue.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, which is the plus (coding) strand. Let's think about the structure of a gene. The coding sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then comes the coding part for the protein. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so it's at the beginning. So the first few codons would be the HA sequence.

Wait, looking at the sequence: The very beginning is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... Wait, ATG is the start. Then TAC is Tyr; but HA is a specific peptide from influenza. Oh, I think the HA sequence is about 10 amino acids, so the first few codons should code for that.

But wait, maybe the problem is in the reading frame or something. Let me think about the sequence. The construct should have the HA tag correctly. If the sequence is messed up, maybe the HA isn't there, causing an issue. But the options mention possible issues.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The HA determinant has a missense mutation. That could cause the HA epitope to be wrong, making antibodies not recognize it. Maybe the person used the right HA sequence or not. But the question says they introduced the HA sequence. So if it's a missense, the HA tag isn't correct, so when they try to purify with HA antibody, it doesn't work. But the problem is that the protein isn't overexpressed, not that it's not being purified. Hmm. Maybe the issue isn't the HA, but the expression.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. That would be a premature stop codon. If there's a stop codon (like TAG, TAA, TGA) somewhere in the sequence before the end, the ribosome would stop early. Let's look for any stop codons in the given sequence. Wait, the sequence is the plus strand, which is the coding (non-template) strand. So the mRNA is complementary to this. So when looking for stop codons in the DNA, which would become the mRNA. Wait, mRNA is made from the template strand, which is the complementary of the plus strand.

Wait, the coding sequence is the plus strand, meaning the mRNA would be the same as the plus strand except T becomes U. So looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA in the plus strand would indicate a stop codon when transcribed.

Looking at the given sequence: Scanning for TAA, TAG, TGA.
