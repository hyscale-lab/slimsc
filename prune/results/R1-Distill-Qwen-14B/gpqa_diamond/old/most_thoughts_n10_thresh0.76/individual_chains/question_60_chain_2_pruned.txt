Okay, so I've got this question about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think about this step by step. I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity, right?

So the question is, an astronaut from an alien civilization is traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast—almost light speed. Their average lifetime is 150 solar years, so from their home perspective, they have about 150 years to live. But the astronaut is 22 years old, so maybe that's not the key point here. Wait, the question is about how long the trip takes from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, no, the astronaut's perspective is the ship's frame of reference. So we have to calculate the time experienced by the astronaut, which would be less than the time measured in Earth's frame because of time dilation.

Wait, no, actually, I might have it backwards. Time dilation affects the time measured by the observer. So from Earth's perspective, the spaceship is moving at a high speed, so time on the ship would appear to slow down. But from the astronaut's perspective, Earth is moving towards them at that high speed. Wait, no, the astronaut is on the ship, so their proper time is what matters.

Wait, maybe I should use the time dilation formula. The formula is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where t' is the proper time (time experienced by
