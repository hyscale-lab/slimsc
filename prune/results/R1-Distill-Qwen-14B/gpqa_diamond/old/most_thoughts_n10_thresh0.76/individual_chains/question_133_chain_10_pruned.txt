Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperature is 25°C. I'm supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-, in this solution. The Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

Hmm, okay. I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The different salts can exist in different forms, depending on the pH. So, I need to figure out how much of each salt contributes to the phosphate ions.

First, I'll calculate the moles of each salt. For KH2PO4, the formula is K(H2PO4), so each mole gives one mole of H2PO4^- ion. Similarly, Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. Its formula is Na2(HPO4·2H2O), but wait, when dissolved, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2- ion. So each mole of Na2HPO4·2H2O gives one mole of HPO4^2-.

Wait, but we're asked about PO4^3- ions. So I need to think about how H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- can convert to PO4^3-.

H3PO4 has three dissociation steps:

1. H3PO4 ⇌ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
2. H2PO4^- ⇌ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
3. HPO4^2- ⇌ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

So, if I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in solution, under certain conditions, they can convert to PO4^3-.

But wait, in this solution, we have both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The PO4^3- concentration will depend on the pH of the solution because the deprotonation depends on the pH.

Wait a second, but wait. How do these two salts interact in solution? They might form a buffer solution. Because KH2PO4 is a weak acid (H2PO4^- can donate a proton), and Na2HPO4 is its conjugate base (HPO4^2- can accept a proton
