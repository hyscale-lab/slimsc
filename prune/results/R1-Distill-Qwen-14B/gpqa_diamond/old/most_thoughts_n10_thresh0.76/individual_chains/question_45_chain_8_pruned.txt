Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that four identical spin-1/2 particles are placed in a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length L. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of E, where E is given as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). The options are A to D, each with different combinations.

Hmm, I remember that in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula for the energy of a single particle is E_n = (n²)E, where E is the base energy unit given here. So each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n.

Wait, but these are identical particles. Oh right, identical particles can be Fermions or Bosons. Since they're spin-1/2, they must be Fermions. Fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, meaning no two particles can occupy the same quantum state. 

So in the case of four Fermions in the well, each must have a unique quantum state. But in a 1D well, each state is defined by the quantum number n and the spin. Wait, but for spin-1/2 particles, each has two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles with opposite spins. 

Wait, no, in a 1D well, the spin doesn't affect the spatial part of the wavefunction, right? So each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So the maximum number of particles that can occupy each energy level is determined by the spin multiplicity. For spin 1/2, each level can have two particles.

Given that, I need to arrange four particles into the lowest possible energy states, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Let me think about the possible arrangements.

The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration possible. Since each energy level (n) can hold two particles (spin up and down), the first few levels would be filled as much as possible.

So, for four particles, let's see:

- The first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles.
- The second
