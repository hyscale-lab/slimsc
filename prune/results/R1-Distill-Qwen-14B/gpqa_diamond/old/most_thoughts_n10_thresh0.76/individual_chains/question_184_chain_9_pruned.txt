Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound, 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene, starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence of reactions leads to the desired product with a high yield.

First, I should probably draw the structure of the target molecule to visualize what's going on. So, benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Let me number the ring: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other where applicable.

Wait, no, actually, the numbering might be such that the substituents are at 1, 2, and 3 in a way that each is adjacent. Let me think: the substituents are ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3. So, the ring has three substituents in adjacent positions. That means the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted arrangement. But wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, making them meta to each other? Hmm, no, I think in a benzene ring, positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent, each next to the other. So, each substituent is next to the other. So, the nitro is at 3, which is next to 2 (tert-butyl) and 4. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the arrangement.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the substituents as being in a para arrangement, but not necessarily. Maybe it's better to think about the reaction sequence needed to get the substituents in the correct positions.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me
