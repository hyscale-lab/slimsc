Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. The initial solution is 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, which is then diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A to D, each with two pH values.

Right, first, I should probably figure out the concentrations after dilution, then determine the equivalence point, and then calculate the pH at 25% of that equivalence point and at the equivalence point itself.

Let's start by finding the diluted concentration of acetic acid. When I mix two volumes, the concentration changes. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and after adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³. So, the concentration after dilution would be (volume1 × concentration1) / total volume.

So, volume1 is 20 cm³, concentration is 0.05 M. So, moles of acetic acid are 20 * 0.05 = 1 mmol. Then, when diluted to 40 cm³, the concentration is 1 mmol / 40 cm³ = 0.025 M. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 1 cm³ is 1 mL, so 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters. Wait, wait, maybe I should compute it in terms of liters and moles.

Wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 L. So initial moles = 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Then, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So the new concentration is 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So yes, 0.025 M acetic acid after dilution.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction is: HC₂H₃O₂ + NaOH → NaC₂H₃O₂ + H₂O. So, each mole of NaOH neutralizes a mole of acetic acid, producing its conjugate base, acetate.

The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of acetic acid initially. So let's calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: 0.001 mol (from earlier). The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume needed at equivalence point is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. Oh wait, wait. Wait, wait a minute. Let me check that again. Because the titration is done with the
