Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. So, the question is about a spin-1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu, which is given by gamma times Sz. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction, and then it's suddenly turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, and both have the same magnitude B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment.

Hmm, right. I remember that when a magnetic field is applied, the spin precesses around it. The magnetic moment, mu, is proportional to the spin operator, S. So mu = γ S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh wait, the problem says mu equals gamma times Sz. So that must mean that the magnetic moment is aligned along the z-direction in the initial state.

Initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. So the spin state must be an eigenstate of Sz. Because when the magnetic field is along a particular axis, the spin will align along that direction, right? So the spin is in either the up or down state along Z.

But then the magnetic field is turned off. Wait, when the field is turned off, the Hamiltonian changes. Because the magnetic field affects the energy levels via the Zeeman term. So initially, the Hamiltonian would have been H_initial = -μ·B, which is -γ S_z B, I think. Oh wait, but wait. The magnetic moment is mu = γ S, so the energy is H = -μ·B. So H_initial = -γ S_z B.

Then the field is turned off, which I think means B becomes zero. So H_initial becomes zero? But then another field is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So now H_final is -gamma S_y B. Wait, but since the field is along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y.

Wait, but wait, the problem says mu is gamma*S_z. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. So when the magnetic field is along Z, the spin is in an eigenstate of S_z. Then, when the field is turned off and another field is applied in Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H = -gamma S_y B. Or wait, perhaps the magnetic field is along Y, so the direction of the magnetic moment's interaction is in Y. So H = -μ·B, which in this case is -gamma S_y B, because mu is now in the Y direction? Wait, no, mu is given as gamma S_z, but that was when the field was along Z. Hmm, maybe I should think differently.

Wait, no, perhaps I got that wrong. Let's clarify. The magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, but the direction of the magnetic moment is the same as the spin direction. So when the magnetic field is along +Z, the magnetic moment is along Z. So the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z, either up or down.

When the magnetic field is suddenly switched off, the Hamiltonian becomes zero. So the state doesn't change instantaneously, right? So the state remains an eigenstate of S_z.
