Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I remember cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use magnetic fields and electric fields to accelerate charged particles. Synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron, right? 

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV. The question is asking how many revolutions the proton makes in the synchrocyclotron.

Wait, what do I know about synchrocyclotrons? Oh right, in a cyclotron, the particles move in a magnetic field and get accelerated by an electric field that's applied across the gaps between the D-shaped electrodes. The frequency of the applied voltage has to match the circular motion frequency of the particles as they spiral out. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field isn't constant—it increases as the particles gain energy. Or wait, maybe that's the difference between cyclotron and synchrocyclotron. Oh, no, wait. In a cyclotron, the magnetic field is constant, but in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted as the particles' velocity changes. Because as the particles gain energy, their speed increases, so the cyclotron frequency changes. So the synchrocyclotron has to vary the frequency of the accelerating voltage to match the changing frequency of the particle's motion.

But wait, in this problem, the proton is accelerated twice—does that mean it goes through two acceleration cycles? Or does it undergo two acceleration steps to reach the desired energy? I'm a bit confused about that part. The problem says it undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the proton is accelerated in two different regions or through two different steps, each time using the same synchrocyclotron setup but with varying parameters. Or perhaps each acceleration refers to each passage through the electric field region, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's about the number of revolutions required to reach that kinetic energy.

Let me think about the physics involved. The kinetic energy of a proton is given by T = (1/2)mv². The voltage applied in the accelerator does work on the proton, so the energy gained is eU, where e is the charge and U is the voltage.

Wait, but the voltage is time-dependent, so perhaps each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated by the voltage. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the voltage has to match the frequency of the particle's motion. So the idea is that each time the particle completes a revolution, it's in phase with the accelerating voltage, so it gets a kick each time, adding to its energy.

But since the magnetic field is changing, the cyclotron frequency ν is changing as the particle's velocity increases. So the synchrocyclotron requires that the frequency of the accelerating voltage is adjusted as the particle's speed changes.

Wait, but in the problem, the applied voltage is given as U(t) =
