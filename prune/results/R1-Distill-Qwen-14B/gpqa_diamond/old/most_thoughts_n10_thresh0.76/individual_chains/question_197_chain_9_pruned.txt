Okay, I'm going to try to figure out this chemistry problem step by step. So, the question is about identifying a compound X that reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and then determining the final product. The options are A to D, each a different organic compound.

First, let's look at the given data: the IR and NMR spectra of compound X. I need to analyze these to determine what X is, and then see what reaction it undergoes.

Starting with the IR data:
The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. But since we're dealing with organic compounds, O-H (like a carboxylic acid or an alcohol) is more likely. Another strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the range for aromatic C=C stretching, so X probably has a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR data:
The 1H NMR shows several peaks. The first one is at 10.5 ppm, which is a broad singlet (bs). That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton (RCHO) because aldehydes typically appear around 9-10 ppm. Wait, but wait—carboxylic acids also have an -OH proton, which is usually broad, but for a carboxylic acid, it would be around 10-12 ppm. Hmm, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 is present. A carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H around 2500-3000 cm-1 as well, which is in the given IR range. So, could X be a benzoic acid derivative?

Wait, but the NMR peak at 10.5 ppm is a singlet, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak, sometimes as a singlet. So that could fit. Alternatively, it's an aldehyde. Let me think. Let's look at the other NMR peaks.

Next, the 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) are typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets suggest that each proton is adjacent to one substituent. So the ring has two substituents in the para positions. One substituent could be an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid group, and another group like a methyl or ethyl.

Looking at the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). These seem to suggest an isobutyl or similar group. Let's break them down.

- 2.9 ppm, multiplet, 1H: Maybe a CH adjacent to two different groups, like a CH between two branching points.
- 1.7 ppm, multiplet, 2H: This could be a CH2 group attached to a branching point.
- 1.4 ppm, d, 3H: A methyl group attached to a CH that's part of a branching structure, like a CH(CH2CH3) group.
- 0.9 ppm, t, 3H: A terminal methyl group, like the end of an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has an isobutyl group attached somewhere. Like, in the case of a para-substituted benzene, one substituent is an aldehyde or carboxylic acid group, and the other is an isobutyl group.

Wait, but wait: If the substituent is an isobutyl group, the NMR signals might look different. Let me think about the structure. Let's say the benzene ring has a substituent like a CH2CH(CH2CH3)2? No, wait, perhaps a branching like -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH3? Hmm, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group would have a CH connected to two CH2 groups or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with an isobutyl group and another substituent. Let me try to sketch a possible structure.

So, let's say the benzene has two substituents in para positions: one is an aldehyde group (CHO), and the other is an isobutyl group. Then, the aldehyde proton would appear as the 10.5 ppm peak, and the isobutyl would have the other peaks.

Wait, but wait. The aldehyde group's proton is usually around 9-10 ppm. The NMR shows 10.5 ppm, which is a bit high, but possible. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around that region. But
