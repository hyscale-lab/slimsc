Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the setup is an electron and a positron moving towards each other along a horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate each other and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are one in the upper-right and the other in the lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the directions of these two photons.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and the conservation laws (like conservation of momentum and energy) must hold. So I'll probably need to consider the momenta of the electron and positron before the collision and then set up equations for the photons after.

Wait, but wait, electrons and positrons have opposite charges, and when they annihilate, they produce gamma rays (photons). Since they're moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions along the horizontal axis. So the total momentum before collision is a vector sum of their individual momenta.

First, I should calculate the relativistic momenta of the electron and positron. The Lorentz factor (γ) is given for each. The Lorentz factor is defined as γ = E/(m c²), but more importantly, the relativistic momentum p is given by p = γ m v. Alternatively, since for high speeds, p can also be expressed as (γ m c²) / c = γ m v. Alternatively, because v = c² (1/γ) for high speeds? Wait, maybe I should just remember the formula for relativistic momentum correctly.

Wait, the formula is p = γ m v, where m is the rest mass. But v is the velocity, which for relativistic speeds can approach c. Alternatively, since γ = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), maybe I can find the velocities in terms of γ, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can use the relation p²c² = (E)² - (m c²)², but perhaps a better approach is to compute the total momentum before collision.

So, each particle has its own momentum. Let's think about the electron and positron.
