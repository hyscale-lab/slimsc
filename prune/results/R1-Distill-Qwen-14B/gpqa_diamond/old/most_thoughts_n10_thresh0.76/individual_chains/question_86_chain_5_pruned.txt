Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. I need to determine which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, first, I remember that when you reduce a ketone or aldehyde, you usually get an alcohol. But wait, the product here is a tetrahydro pyranone. Tetrahydro pyran is a six-membered ring with an oxygen, like a cyclic ether. So, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a gamma-pyrone, which has a ketone group at position 2 and the ring is saturated except for the double bond.

Wait, no, the formula is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So the ring is saturated except for the double bond in position 2. Oh wait, tetrahydro-pyran is fully saturated except for the position where the substitution is. Let me think about the structure. So, it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen. The '2H' indicates that there's one double bond. The '2-one' means the ketone is at position 2. So the structure would be a five-membered ring? No, wait, pyran is six-membered. So the ring has O at position 1, and the ketone (O) at position 2. So the ring has a double bond between C2 and C3 perhaps?

Wait, tetrahydro-pyran-2-one. So the ring is saturated except for a double bond from C2 to C3. So the structure is a ring where positions 2 and 3 are double-bonded, and there's a ketone at position 2. Wait, no, the '2-one' means a ketone at position 2. So, the ring has a double bond between C1 and C2? Or maybe C3 and C4? I might be getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to think about the reduction reaction. The starting material must have been a carbonyl group that, upon reduction, forms a ring. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a cyclic ketone. So when you reduce a cyclic ketone, you get a diol. But wait, the product here isn't a diol; it's a tetrahydropyranone. Hmm, that suggests that the starting material isn't a cyclic ketone but perhaps an aldehyde or a ketone that can form a ring upon reduction.

Wait another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Or maybe it's an acyclic ketone or aldehyde that upon reduction forms a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal.

Wait, wait, another approach. When you reduce a carbonyl group, you add hydrogen, turning it into an alcohol. If the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, like a cyclic ether with a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the starting material
