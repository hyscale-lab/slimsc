Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound X based on its reaction product's NMR spectra. Hmm.

The reaction conditions are with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Wait, I think that's a base, maybe used in some kind of ring-opening or elimination reaction. Oh right, that compound is often used as a base in the Hofmann or Cope elimination reactions. But wait, what kind of reaction is happening here?

Compound X is C11H12O. The formula suggests it's an organic compound, perhaps with a ring or some unsaturated groups. The product's NMR data is given, so maybe the reaction is an elimination leading to an epoxide or something else. Wait, or maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide?

But wait, the product's NMR is provided. Let me look at the 1H NMR data. The signals are:

δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s) → two singlets, each integrating for 3H. Hmm, maybe two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split the signal, like an electronegative atom or a benzene ring.

Then, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So that's four signals in the aromatic region. Let me think about this. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring with some substituents causing deshielding. Alternatively, perhaps it's a coupling pattern from a substituted styrene group.

Wait, the 13C NMR data has 9 signals. Let's see the carbons. 21.3 and 28.4 are both singlets. Those are likely to be methyl groups attached to something. Like, maybe a quaternary carbon or attached to an electronegative atom. Then, the rest are mostly around 125-145, which are typical for carbons in aromatic rings or double bonds.

Wait, the 13C NMR shows 197.7, which is a ketone or maybe an ester. Or wait, no, wait! An epoxide doesn't have a carbonyl. Hmm, 197 is more like a carbonyl, maybe an ester or ketone. Or perhaps an aldehyde? Hmm.

Wait, but the starting material is compound X, which is reacted with a base. Maybe the reaction is an elimination to form a double bond, perhaps forming an epoxide? Or maybe it's a ring-opening of an epoxide.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a retro-Diels-Alder or some kind of elimination. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is a strong, bulky base, often used in elimination reactions. So perhaps compound X is something that can undergo elimination.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl
