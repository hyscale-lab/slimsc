Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that has to do with the star's radiation and how much the planet absorbs. Right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is probably T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ). Oh wait, but wait, both planets have the same albedo, so that part cancels out when taking the ratio. Oh, right, because Planet1 and Planet2 have the same albedo, so the (1 - albedo) factor is the same for both. So I don't need to worry about that part for the ratio.

Wait, but wait, the question gives us data from the transit and radial velocity methods. Oh, but for equilibrium temperature, those methods probably tell us about the mass and radius of the planets, but maybe not directly the distance. Hmm, but I don't have the distances here. So how do I find the distances to calculate the equilibrium temperature?

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. Because the farther a planet is, the less starlight it receives, so lower temperature. So the formula I need is:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * ( (1 - A) )^(1/4 )

But since A is same for both, it'll cancel when taking the ratio.

So I need the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( R_star/(2a1) ) / sqrt( R_star/(2a2) ) )

Oh, wait, sqrt is the same as square root. So that ratio simplifies to sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because:

sqrt( (R/(2a1)) ) / sqrt( (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) * (2a2)/R ) ) = sqrt( a2/(a1) )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But I don't have the distances a1 or a2. How can I find them?

Wait, the problem gives us data from the radial velocity method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum due to the planet's
