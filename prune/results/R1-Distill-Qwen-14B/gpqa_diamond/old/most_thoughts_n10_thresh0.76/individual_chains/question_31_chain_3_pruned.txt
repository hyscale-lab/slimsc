Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question involves a series of reactions starting with toluene, and then determining the molecular symmetry group of the final product. Hmm, let me break it down.

First, the starting material is toluene. I remember that toluene is methylbenzene, a benzene ring with a methyl group attached. The first reaction is treatment with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. Oh wait, that's a nitration reaction. Nitration typically occurs under strong acid conditions, like with H2SO4 as a catalyst. Toluene undergoes nitration in the meta position or para position. Wait, no, when you nitrate toluene, the methyl group is an activating group, so the nitration happens mainly in the meta and para positions relative to the methyl group. But I think the major product is the para isomer because the para position is more stable due to better symmetry, so the nitro group would add para to the methyl. So product 1 should be para-nitrotoluene.

Wait, wait, maybe I should double-check. Nitration of toluene: the methyl group is a strong activating group. The nitration tends to occur in the positions where the group directs. Since methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group, the nitration would primarily occur at the para position, but some can form at ortho as well. However, the para isomer is more stable and will be the major product. So product 1 is 4-nitro toluene,
