Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I need to figure out how much acid and base are present in total and see if they neutralize each other or if there's an excess.

Let me list out the given data:

- Volume and concentration of each solution:
  - CH3COOH: 500 mL of 0.1 M
  - HCl: 400 mL of 0.2 M
  - Ba(OH)2: 300 mL of 0.3 M

Wait, CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when I mix them, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base.

I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base first.

Calculating moles:

Molarity (M) is moles per liter, so moles = M * volume (in liters).

For CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, Volume = 0.5 L (500 mL)
Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

Since CH3COOH is a weak acid, it won't dissociate completely, but maybe I can treat it as just contributing H+ moles for now, but I'll have to see if it's in excess later.

For HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, Volume = 0.4 L (400 mL)
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely, providing 0.08 moles of H+.

For Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, Volume = 0.3 L (300 mL)
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So moles of OH- = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, that's right. So the OH- is 0.18 moles.

Now, I need to figure out if the H+ from the acids and the OH- from the base will neutralize each other. The reaction between H+ and OH- is H+ + OH- → H2O.

Total H+ from acids: CH3COOH and HCl. CH3COOH contributes 0.05 moles H+ (since each CH3COOH gives one H+), and HCl gives 0.08 moles. So total H+ = 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 moles.

Total OH- is 0.18 moles.

So when H+ and OH- react, the H+ is less than OH-, so the OH- will be in excess. The excess OH- will determine the pH.

Let me calculate how much H+ and OH- react. The moles of OH- are 0.18, and H+ is 0.13.

So, H+ will be neutralized by OH-: 0.13 moles of OH- will react with 0.13 moles of H+ (since they're in a 1:1 ratio). That leaves 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles of OH- unreacted.

Wait, but wait. Because Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so all OH- will react with any available H+.

But wait, the acetic acid is a weak acid. Does that change anything? Let me think. When you mix a weak acid and a strong base, the strong base will deprotonate the weak acid. So the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will first neutralize the H+ from the strong acids (like HCl), and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the weak acid (CH3COOH), which can't donate much H+ on its own.

Wait, no. Wait, the OH- will react with any H+ available. So the order of neutralization would be: first, the strong acids (HCl) will donate H+, which will react with OH- from the base.

But wait, actually, the H+ from HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is also fully dissociated. So when you mix them, the OH- will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH, as H+ is H+.

So the order doesn't matter because all H+ ions will react with OH- ions. So the total H+ is 0.13, and OH- is 0.18. So all 0.13 H+ will react, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Wait, no, because Ba(OH)2 gives OH- ions, which will react with H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the total H+ and total OH-.

Total H+ is from HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl: 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH: 0.05 moles H+.

Total H+ = 0.13.

Ba(OH)2 gives 0.18 moles OH-.

So when they react, the OH- will neutralize the H+. So:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Available H+ is 0.13, OH- is 0.18.

So, 0.13 H+ will react with 0.13 OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles OH-.

The total volume of the solution is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So the concentration of excess OH- is 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.041666... M.

Then, pOH = -log (OH- concentration).

pH = 14 - pOH.

Wait, what's the concentration? 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

So pOH = log(0.041666...)

Wait, wait, log(0.041666...) is the same as log(1/24) because 1/24 ≈ 0.041666...

Log(24) is log(2.4*10^1) → log(2.4) is about 0.3802, so log(24) is about 1.3802. So log(1/24) is -1.3802.

But since pOH is -log [OH-], that would be 1.3802.

So pH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62, which matches that.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, the initial assumption is that all the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH are neutralized by the OH- from Ba(OH)2. But CH3COOH is a weak acid; when the OH- is in excess, will the CH3COOH contribute any H+ after the reaction?

Wait, because if there's excess OH-, it will deprotonate the CH3COOH. So, when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it will form CH3COO- and water.

So wait, maybe I should calculate the net reaction correctly.

Let me reapproach: total n H+ = 0.08 (from HCl) + 0.05 (from CH3COOH) = 0.13.

Total n OH- = 0.18.

The OH- will first react with the H+ from the strongest acid (HCl), since it's a strong acid and H+ is available in solution. Wait, but in reality, all H+ and OH- will react regardless of the source.

Alternatively, perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from the strong acids, then any remaining OH- will react with the weak acid.

But since all H+ are available, the OH- will react with all the H+ available.

So in the solution, the OH- is 0.18 moles, and H+ is 0.13 moles. So, the H+ will be neutralized, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the excess OH- is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M. pOH is about 1.38, pH is 12.62, which is option A.

But wait, what about the CH3COOH? Because when you mix a strong base with a weak acid, the base will deprotonate the weak acid. So in this case, if there's excess OH-, it will neutralize all the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH, but since there's more OH-, it will also deprotonate any CH3COOH.

Wait, no, because when OH- is in excess, it will first neutralize all H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and then any remaining OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a neutralization reaction.

Let me think: The OH- will first react with the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH.

So, the OH- will neutralize 0.13 moles of H+ (from HCl and CH3COOH), leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

Then, the remaining OH- will react with the CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so the OH- will consume it by converting it into acetate ions.

So, the reaction would be:

CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO- + H2O.

The OH- available is 0.05 moles. CH3COOH initially is 0.05 moles. So, all the OH- will react with the CH3COOH, turning it into 0.05 moles of acetate ions, and leaving no OH- left.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion. Hmm, so which is right?

Let me think again. The total OH- is 0.18. The total H+ is 0.13.

So, when the 0.13 H+ reacts with OH-, they'll neutralize each other, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

But then, the remaining 0.05 moles of OH- will react with any available acid. The only acid left is CH3COOH, which is 0.05 moles. So OH- and CH3COOH will react in a 1:1 ratio, producing CH3COO^- and water.

So after this reaction, the OH- is all used up (0.05 moles reacting with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH), leaving no excess OH-.

Wait, that complicates things. So, in this scenario, after the initial neutralization, all the remaining OH- will react with CH3COOH, leaving no excess OH-.

So in that case, there is no excess OH-; we have a solution that is neutral, or maybe a slight excess of acetate ions and other ions.

Wait, but that's not possible because the initial OH- was 0.18, H+ 0.13, so after neutralizing H+, 0.05 OH- remains. Then, this 0.05 OH- reacts with the CH3COOH (0.05 moles), converting it all into acetate ions.

So, in the end, the solution would have:

- From Ba(OH)2: Ba^2+ and OH- but the OH- has reacted.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

So, the total moles of Ba^2+ contributed by Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles Ba^2+.

Which stays in solution.

Then, after the reactions:

The H+ from HCl and CH3COOH have been neutralized by OH-, and the remaining OH- has neutralized all the CH3COOH.

So, all the acetic acid is converted into acetate ions.

So, the solution now contains:

- Ba^2+ ions: 0.09 moles.

- Acetate ions (CH3COO^-): 0.05 moles.

- Chloride ions (Cl^-): from HCl, 0.08 moles.

Wait, but when HCl reacts with OH-, it's H+ + OH- → H2O, so the Cl^- remains in solution. So, yes, Cl^- is 0.08 moles.

Wait, but this would imply that the solution is a mixture of Ba^2+, Cl^-, and CH3COO^- ions, with nothing else.

Wait, but in this case, after all reactions, we have an excess of OH-? No, because the remaining OH- has reacted with the CH3COOH.

Wait, let me recount:

Total OH- initially: 0.18 moles.

Total H+ initially: 0.13.

After neutralization: OH- used 0.13 moles, remaining 0.05 moles.

These 0.05 moles of OH- react with 0.05 moles of CH3COOH to form 0.05 moles CH3COO^- and 0.05 moles H2O.

So, the OH- is now all consumed.

Therefore, the solution has:

- Ba^2+: 0.09 moles.

- Cl^-: 0.08 moles.

- CH3COO^-: 0.05 moles.

No excess OH- or H+.

So the solution is... neutral? Or is there any other reaction?

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it's completely dissociated. HCl is a strong acid, so it's fully dissociated. CH3COOH is a weak acid, but in this case, it's all converted into CH3COO^- because it was in excess OH-.

Wait, but no, the CH3COOH is 0.05 moles, and OH- is 0.05 moles. So all CH3COOH is neutralized into acetate.

So the solution has:

Ba^2+ (0.09), Cl^- (0.08), CH3COO^- (0.05), and any spectator ions.

But since Ba(OH)2 and HCl are strong, their ions are fully dissociated.

Wait, but the solution is a mixture of these ions.

But the question is, do these ions affect the pH? Ba^2+ is a spectator ion; Cl^- is a spectator (from HCl), and CH3COO^- (acetate) is the conjugate base of a weak acid.

Wait, since acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, it can hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So, the presence of CH3COO^- could make the solution basic, which would affect the pH.

So, perhaps the initial approach was incorrect, and I need to calculate the pH considering the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

Wait, let me think again.

After all reactions, the solution contains:

Ba^2+ (0.09 mol), Cl^- (0.08 mol), CH3COO^- (0.05 mol), and any other ions.

But Ba^2+ and Cl^- are spectators; they don't affect the pH. The acetate ions, however, can hydrolyze in water.

The acetate ion (CH3COO^-) reacts with water as follows:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

This reaction produces OH- ions, making the solution basic.

So, to find the pH, I need to calculate the concentration of OH- from the acetate ion hydrolysis.

But wait, the concentration of acetate is 0.05 moles in 1.2 L. So initial concentration [CH3COO^-] is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

The Kb for acetate can be found using the Ka of acetic acid. The Ka for CH3COOH is about 1.8 × 10^-5. So, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56 × 10^-10.

Wait, wait, Kb for acetate is Kw / Ka = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 ≈ 5.56e-10.

So, Kb is 5.56e-10.

Now, I can set up the hydrolysis equation:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The initial concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.041667 M.

Change: -x for CH3COO^-, +x for CH3COOH and OH^-.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] ≈ 0.041667 - x ≈ 0.041667 (since Kb is very small, x will be tiny).

So, Kb ≈ (x^2) / 0.041667.

So, x^2 = Kb * 0.041667 ≈ (5.56e-10) * (0.041667) ≈ 2.3167e-11.

x ≈ sqrt(2.3167e-11) ≈ 4.812e-6 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 4.812e-6 M.

pOH = -log(4.812e-6) ≈ 5.317.

Therefore, pH = 14 - 5.317 ≈ 8.683.

Looking at the options, option D is 8.68, which would be the pH.

Wait, but earlier I thought the pH would be 12.62, but now it's 8.68. So which is correct?

Ah, this is getting complicated. So I must have made a mistake in my initial approach. Let me retrace.

The initial approach assumed that all OH- would be consumed by the weak acid, but that's incorrect because the OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18, and the H+ from acids is 0.13. So after neutralizing the H+, 0.05 moles of OH- remain.

But then, the remaining OH- would react with the weak acid (CH3COOH), which is 0.05 moles. So the OH- would fully react with CH3COOH, converting it into acetate. But wait, the H+ from HCl was 0.08, and the CH3COOH's H+ is 0.05, so the total H+ is 0.13. The OH- is 0.18. So OH- neutralizes the 0.13 H+, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

These 0.05 OH- then react with the 0.05 moles of CH3COOH, producing 0.05 moles of acetate.

So, after all that, the solution has:

- 0.09 moles Ba^2+.

- 0.08 moles Cl^-.

- 0.05 moles acetate (CH3COO^-).

No excess H+ or OH-.

But wait, acetate is a weak base, so it will hydrolyze in water, producing OH-.

So the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions. So indeed, the pH is around 8.68.

So the correct answer is D) 8.68.

But wait, why did the initial approach give a different result? Because I didn't account for the hydrolysis of acetate. So after all the neutralization, there's no excess OH- or H+, so the pH is governed by the acetate ions hydrolyzing.

So, the correct pH is approximately 8.68, which is option D.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the reaction between the acids (CH₃COOH and HCl) and the base (Ba(OH)₂). The steps are as follows:

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each substance
- **CH₃COOH**:  
  Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
  CH₃COOH is a weak acid, contributing \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \, \text{H}^+ \).

- **HCl**:  
  Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
  HCl is a strong acid, contributing \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \, \text{H}^+ \).

- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
  Ba(OH)₂ dissociates completely, providing \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \, \text{OH}^- \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction
The total \( \text{H}^+ \) from CH₃COOH and HCl is:  
\[
\text{Total H}^+ = 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 \, \text{moles}.
\]  
The total \( \text{OH}^- \) from Ba(OH)₂ is \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  

The \( \text{OH}^- \) reacts with \( \text{H}^+ \) in a 1:1 ratio:  
\[
\text{OH}^- + \text{H}^+ \to \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
After neutralization, \( 0.13 \, \text{moles} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with \( 0.13 \, \text{moles} \, \text{H}^+ \), leaving:  
\[
\text{Excess OH}^- = 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 3: Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The remaining \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \, \text{OH}^- \) reacts with CH₃COOH:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^- \to \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]  
CH₃COOH is completely neutralized, forming \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \, \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \).

### Step 4: Final solution composition
The final solution contains:  
- \( \text{Ba}^{2+} \): \( 0.09 \, \text{moles} \) (from Ba(OH)₂).  
- \( \text{Cl}^- \): \( 0.08 \, \text{moles} \) (from HCl).  
- \( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \): \( 0.05 \, \text{moles} \) (from CH₃COOH).  

The pH is determined by the hydrolysis of acetate ions (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)), as they are the conjugate base of a weak acid.

### Step 5: Calculate pH
The concentration of acetate ions is:  
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{moles}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]  
The hydrolysis reaction is:  
\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]  
The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is:  
\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10}.
\]  
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{[\text{OH}^-]^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}.
\]  
Substitute \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 0.0417 \, \text{M} \):  
\[
[\text{OH}^-]^2 = \text{K}_b \times [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.56 \times 10^{-10})(0.0417) \approx 2.316 \times 10^{-11}.
\]  
\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{2.316 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 4.81 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]  
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(4.81 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 5.32.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.32 = 8.68.
\]

### Final Answer:
The pH of the solution is **8.68**, corresponding to **Option D**.

ANSWER: D
