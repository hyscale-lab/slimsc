Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes two reactions performed by an organic chemist. Reaction I involves treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II uses pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 and then an acidic workup. After these reactions, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is about how many peaks the chemist will observe in each case.

Hmm, so I need to think about the products of each reaction first. Let's break them down one by one.

Starting with Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one + LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but waitâ€”what's the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one? Hexan-3-one means a six-carbon chain with a ketone on carbon 3. The 5th carbon has a methoxy group. So, the structure would be:

CH3-C(=O)-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me draw it out.

Actually, hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but the 5th carbon is the one with the methoxy. So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Let me number properly. Hexan-3-one is:

Positions 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So, Carbon 3 is the carbonyl. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's:

Wait, maybe I should think about it as CH2CH2-... Wait, perhaps it's:
