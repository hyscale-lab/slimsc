Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Hmm, let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the absorption is at 3000, that might be the O-H from a carboxylic acid, which tends to be broader than, say, an alcohol because of hydrogen bonding. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm^-1, which is a key region for carbonyl groups. A carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around there, so that fits with the O-H peak. So the compound likely has a carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens, meaning there are no double bonds or rings with adjacent hydrogens. So the structure must be saturated, no alkenes or aromatic rings. All the signals are from CH2 or CH groups maybe.

In the NMR, there's a signal that's a doublet of triplets of quartets and another that's a doublet of triplets of triplets. That's a bit complex, so I need to think about what kind of splitting that would cause. Let me recall that splitting in NMR arises from neighboring protons. The more neighbors, the more splitting.

A doublet of triplets of quartets... Hmm, perhaps it's a proton that's next to a CH2 group, which is next to another CH2, and so on. Alternatively, maybe a branching point where each proton has multiple neighbors. For example, in a structure where a CH group is attached to two different CH2 groups, each of which might be connected to other branching points.

Looking at the options, all are carboxylic acids, ending with COOH. Let's look at their structures.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So the structure is something like this: the main chain is CH2COOH, and attached to the central carbon are two ethyl groups (C2H5) and a methyl (CH3). Wait, actually, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the central two carbons each have a methyl and an ethyl group. Wait, no, each of the central carbons (C(H)(C2H5)) is attached to another CH2 group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me parse it again.

Breaking down option A: It's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So the structure is CH3-CR1-CR2-CH2COOH, where R1 and R2 are (C2H5) and another substituent. Wait, perhaps the molecule is more like:

The main chain is CH2COOH, and the central two carbons (the ones adjacent to the CH2) each have substituents. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2COOH is not right. Wait, perhaps it's CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH.

So each of the two central carbons (let's say C2 and C3) have a methyl group (CH3), an ethyl (C2H5), and are connected to each other. So it's more like:

CH3–C(CH2CH3)(H)–C(CH2CH3)(H)–CH2–COOH

Wait, that might not be possible. Alternatively, perhaps it's a geminal substitution. Let me think: Each of the two middle carbons (C2 and C3) have two
