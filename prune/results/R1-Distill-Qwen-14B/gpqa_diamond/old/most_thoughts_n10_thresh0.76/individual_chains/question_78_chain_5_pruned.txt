Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that when charges move, they create both electric and magnetic fields. But wait, the question is about the potentials, not the fields directly. Oh right, potentials are kind of like the sources for the fields through Maxwell's equations.

So the setup is a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at that earlier time is v. And we're supposed to find V and A at time t, where t is after tr, so t > tr.

I think potentials are calculated using retarded times. Oh right, because the electromagnetic effects travel at the speed of light, so the potentials at the current time t depend on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time tr, where tr = t - (|d|)/c. Wait, because d is the displacement from the charge's position at tr to the observation point. So the charge was at r - d at time tr, but wait no, d is from the charge's position to the field point. So maybe the charge was at r - d at time tr? Or is it the other way around? Let me think.

The vector d is from the charge's position (at time tr) to the field point. So if the field point is r, then the charge was at r - d at time tr. But wait, no. Because if the charge was at position s(tr), then the vector from s(tr) to r is d, so d = r - s(tr). So yes, s(tr) = r - d. That makes sense.

Now, the scalar potential V is given by Coulomb's law, but with the retarded time. So for a stationary charge, V would be (q)/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, do we need to adjust the expression? Oh wait, no, the scalar potential for a moving charge is still similar to the static case, but evaluated at the retarded time. Wait, but in the options, the expressions for V and A don't seem to involve the trajectory of the charge beyond the position and velocity at tr. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about
