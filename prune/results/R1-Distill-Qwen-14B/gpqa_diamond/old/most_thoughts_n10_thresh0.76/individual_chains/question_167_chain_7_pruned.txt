Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the state given is |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α>]/N. So this is a superposition of two coherent states with amplitudes α and -α. The normalization constant N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). Oh right, because when you have a superposition like this, the normalization comes from the inner product of the state with itself. So the denominator N ensures that the state is normalized to 1.

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. The measure provided is the relative entropy del_b, which is the difference between the von Neumann entropies (or more accurately, the traces of rho ln rho and tau ln tau). So del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). Here, rho is the density matrix of our state |ψ>, and tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, non-Gaussian states are those that can't be described by Gaussian statistics, like coherent states or squeezed states. Schrödinger cat states are definitely non-Gaussian because they are superpositions of coherent states, which are Gaussian.

But how do I compute the non-Gaussianity here? The relative entropy is a measure of how different rho is from a Gaussian state. The more non-Gaussian, the higher the del_b. Or wait, does it mean that if the state is Gaussian, del_b would be zero? Because if rho is Gaussian, then it's the same as tau, so their entropies would be the same.

So in this problem, when is the state still Gaussian? Because sometimes superpositions can be Gaussian if they have certain properties. Wait, for the state |ψ>, when is it Gaussian?

A coherent state is Gaussian. A superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian unless...? Wait, I think in some cases, like when the phase is zero or pi, the state might reduce to a single coherent state, making it Gaussian. For example, if phi is 0, then it's |ψ> = cos(0)|α> + sin(0)|-α> = |α>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, sin(phi)=1, so it's |ψ> = | -α >, which is also Gaussian. But for other phases, like phi = pi/4, it's a superposition and thus non-Gaussian.

So in this problem, phi is given as -pi/4. Let's see: sin(2phi) would be sin(-pi/2) = -1. Wait, but the normalization N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, but phi is -pi/4, so 2phi is -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2)). Let
