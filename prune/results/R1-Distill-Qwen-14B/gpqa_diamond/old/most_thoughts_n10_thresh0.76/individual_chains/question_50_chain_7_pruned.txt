Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Feynman diagrams and loop calculations in quantum field theory. Hmm, let's see. The question is about figuring out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on the "size estimate" expression provided.

Wait, Feynman diagrams and loop integrals... Right, in quantum field theory, each loop in a Feynman diagram corresponds to an integral that contributes a certain factor to the amplitude of the process. The number of loops is related to the order in perturbation theory—if it's a one-loop diagram, it's usually the first-order approximation beyond the tree level.

But wait, the problem gives an expression for the size estimate: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I remember that Feynman diagrams with loops contribute factors involving the coupling constants and loop integrals, which often involve denominators with powers of π and other constants.

So, how does the number of loops relate to the factors in the amplitude? Let me think. Each loop generally introduces a factor of (4π)^d, where d is the number of dimensions, but wait, the spacetime here is four-dimensional. So each loop would bring in a factor of (4π)^4? Or maybe (4π)^something else.

Wait, no. I remember that loop integrals in four dimensions typically involve a factor of (4π)^2 per loop. Because the integral in four dimensions might have a volume factor like (4π)^2 from integrating over the angles, for example.
