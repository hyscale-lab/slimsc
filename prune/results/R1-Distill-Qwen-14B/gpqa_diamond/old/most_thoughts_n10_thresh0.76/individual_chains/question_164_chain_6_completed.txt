Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? And the question is about figuring out which system is more massive and by what factor. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

So the problem gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. I think the orbital period of the binary system is the same as the eclipse period because the stars have to orbit each other so that their line of sight brings them in front of each other periodically.

Then, there are radial velocity (RV) observations. For system_1, the two stars have RV variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. For system_2, the amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s. I remember that in a binary system, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit, so its velocity will be lower because velocity is inversely proportional to mass (since momentum is conserved). So the mass of each star is inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes.

Wait, right! The ratio of the masses of the two stars is equal to the inverse ratio of their velocity amplitudes. Because M1 * V1 = M2 * V2. So M1/M2 = V2 / V1.

So for system_1, star 1 has V1 =10 km/s and star 2 has V2=5 km/s. So M1/M2 is 5/10 = 0.5. So the mass ratio is 0.5, meaning M1 is half the mass of M2. But wait, the total mass of the system is M1 + M2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So if M1 is the mass of one star and M2 the other, then M1/M2 = V2 / V1. So for system_1, V1=10, V2=5, so M1/M2 = 5/10=0.5 → M1=0.5*M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5*M2 + M2 = 1.5*M2.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because M1 and M2 are the masses of the two stars. So for system_1, M1 = (V2 / V1) * M2. So M1 = (5/10) * M2 = 0.5 M2. So M1 + M2 = (0.5 +1) M2 = 1.5 M2. So the total mass of system_1 is 1.5 times the mass of M2. Wait, but I think I might have this mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the velocities are proportional to the masses in the sense that the more massive star moves slower. So M1 * V1 = M2 * V2. So M1/M2 = V2 / V1. So in system_1, M1 is (5/10) M2. So M1 is half of M2. So the total mass, M_total_1 = M1 + M2 = (0.5 + 1) M2 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, no, that's not correct because M2 is the mass of the other star. Wait, perhaps I should consider the system's total mass as M1 + M2, but in the RV method, the velocities are such that M1 * V1 = M2 * V2. So for system_1, M1 = (V2 / V1) * M2. So M1 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. So M_total_1 = 1.5 M2.

Wait, but M2 is the mass of the other star in system_1. Or wait, perhaps I should think of each system separately. Let me think about each system's total mass.

For system_1:

V1 =10 km/s (star 1), V2=5 km/s (star 2).

M1 * V1 = M2 * V2 → M1/M2 = V2/V1 = 5/10 = 0.5. So M1 = 0.5 * M2. So M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2. So the total mass of system_1 is 1.5 times M2, which is the mass of the other star in system_1.

Wait, no, M2 in this context is the mass of the second star in system_1. So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + (M1 / 0.5) ) → since M1 =0.5 M2 → M2 = 2 M1. So M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1. Alternatively, in terms of M2, it's 1.5 M2.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the mass function for each system.

Wait, but actually, the total mass of the binary system can be determined using the formula involving the orbital period and the velocity amplitudes. The formula I recall is:

M_total = ( (4 π²) / (G) )^(1/3) * (a1 + a2)² / P )^(1/3)

But perhaps that's getting too complicated. Another approach is to consider that Kepler's third law in the form:

P² (M1 + M2) = (4 π²/G) (a1 + a2)^3

But since the stars orbit their common center of mass, a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes of their orbits. Also, a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) ) * a_total, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) ) * a_total, where a_total is the separation between the two stars.

Alternatively, considering that the velocity amplitude K1 is related to the mass ratio. K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 of star 2. Then, K1 = (2 π a1 sin i ) / P, and similarly K2 = (2 π a2 sin i ) / P.

But since a1 = (M2 / (M1 + M2)) a_total, and a2 = (M1 / (M1 + M2)) a_total, the sum a1 + a2 = a_total.

So, K1 = 2 π a1 sin i / P = 2 π (M2/(M1+M2) a_total) ) sin i / P.

Similarly, K2 = 2 π (M1/(M1+M2) a_total) ) sin i / P.

But in a binary system, the ratio K1/K2 is equal to M2/M1.

Because K1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) * (2 π a_total sin i) / P.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the mass function. The mass function is given by f(M) = (K1³ P) / (2 π G) ), which gives a lower limit on the mass of the companion.

But perhaps a better approach is to relate the velocities and the masses.

In a binary system, the masses are inversely proportional to their velocities. So M1/M2 = V2/V1.

So for system_1, V1 =10, V2=5 → M1/M2 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 M2.

So the total mass is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

In system_2, the velocity amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s.

So V1=15, V2=10 → M1/M2 = 10/15 = 2/3 → M1 = (2/3) M2.

So the total mass is M1 + M2 = (2/3) M2 + M2 = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but wait, in system_2, which star has which velocity? The problem says system_2 has RV amplitudes of 15 and 10. So I think the same approach applies: M1/M2 = V2/V1. So M1 = (10/15) M2 = (2/3) M2.

So, system_1's total mass is 1.5 M2, system_2's is (5/3) M2. Wait, but wait, M2 here refers to the mass of the companion in each system. Or perhaps I should think in terms of each system's own masses.

No, perhaps it's better to model each system separately. Let me think about system_1's total mass and system_2's in terms of their own stars.

Let me denote system_1 as having masses M1 and m1, and system_2 as M2 and m2.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. For system_1, the two stars have velocities V1=10 and V2=5.

So M1 * V1 = m1 * V2 → M1/m1 = V2/V1 = 5/10 = 0.5 → M1 = 0.5 m1.

So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + m1 = 0.5 m1 + m1 = 1.5 m1.

Similarly, for system_2, the stars have V1=15 and V2=10 → M2/m2 = V2/V1 = 10/15 = 2/3 → M2 = (2/3) m2.

Total mass of system_2 is M2 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses because the product of mass and velocity is the same for both stars (since they share the same momentum around the center of mass). So M * V = m * v, where M and m are the masses, V and v their velocities.

So for system_1: M1 * 10 = m1 *5 → M1/m1 =5/10=0.5 → M1 = 0.5 m1.

Thus, system_1's total mass is M1 + m1 = 0.5 m1 + m1 = 1.5 m1.

For system_2: M2 *15 = m2 *10 → M2/m2 =10/15= 2/3 → M2= (2/3) m2.

So system_2's total mass is M2 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2 = (5/3) m2.

Now, the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So we need to find (M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = (1.5 m1) / (5/3 m2) ).

But wait, I think I'm mixing up variables. Because in system_1, m1 is the mass of the second star. But in system_2, m2 is the mass of the second star. Are these the same as the masses in their respective systems? Or perhaps I should find a way to express each system's total mass in terms that can be compared.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that each system's mass is the sum of the two stars' masses, and find the ratio of system_1's total mass to system_2's total mass.

Wait, but let's think about each system's total mass in terms of the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the total mass of a binary system from the radial velocities is given by:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2) * P )/(2 π G) )^(1/3) * (1 + q) )^(1/3),

where q is the mass ratio M2/M1, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the relation between the velocities and the masses.

Alternatively, let's use the fact that the total mass is (M1 + M2), and from the velocity amplitudes.

We have M1 * V1 = M2 * V2.

So, M1 = (V2 / V1) * M2.

So, total mass = M1 + M2 = (V2/V1 + 1) * M2.

Wait, but I'm not sure if M2 is the same as in the other system.

Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the mass function, which is given by:

f(M) = ( (V1 * sin i)^3 * P )/(2 π G )

But without knowing the inclination (i), which is the angle between the orbital plane and the line of sight, and since we don't have that, perhaps the question assumes that the inclination is the same for both systems, or that sin i is the same. Because if i is 90 degrees (edge-on), sin i is 1. But if the systems have different inclinations, the actual masses would be different. But since the problem doesn't mention anything about inclination, perhaps we can assume that sin i is the same for both systems, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplified such that the mass can be determined directly from the velocities and the period.

Let me think about the formula for the mass function. The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2942.45 )

where K is the velocity semi-amplitude in km/s, P is the orbital period in years, and f(M) is the mass function in solar masses.

But wait, the mass function gives a lower limit on the mass of the companion, assuming a circular orbit and sin i =1. The formula I have is f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) )/(2942.45 ), where units are solar masses, km/s, and years.

So perhaps I can compute the mass function for each system and then compare.

Wait, but the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So without knowing sin i, it's tricky. But if we assume that both systems have the same inclination, then the ratio may work out.

Alternatively, perhaps each system's total mass can be found using the formula:

M_total = ( (V1 + V2)³ * P ) / (2942.45 ) )^(1/3)

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try this approach.

For system_1:

V1 =10, V2=5 → V_total =15 km/s.

P =2 years.

M_total_1 = ( (15^3 * 2 ) / 2942.45 )^(1/3 )

But wait, I'm not sure if this is the correct formula.

Wait, another approach comes to mind. The more massive star has a smaller velocity. So, the mass of each star is inversely proportional to their velocities.

So, for each system, the masses are M1 = (V2 / V1) * M2.

But for system_1, M1 = 5/10 * M2 = 0.5 M2.

So, the total mass is 1.5 M2.

Similarly, for system_2, M1 = 10/15 * M2 = 2/3 M2.

So, the total mass is M2 + (2/3 M2) = (5/3) M2.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because I'm using M2 for both systems. Let me clarify.

Let me denote:

For system_1:

Masses are M1 and m1.

M1 * V1 = m1 * V2 → M1/m1 = V2/V1 =5/10=0.5 → M1 =0.5 m1.

Total mass system_1: M1 + m1 = 0.5 m1 + m1 =1.5 m1.

For system_2:

Masses are M2 and m2.

M2 * V1 = m2 * V2 → M2/m2 = V2/V1 =10/15=2/3 → M2= (2/3) m2.

Total mass system_2: M2 + m2 = (2/3 m2) + m2= (5/3) m2.

Now, the problem is to find how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. So the ratio is (M_total_1) / (M_total_2) = (1.5 m1) / (5/3 m2) ) = (1.5 * 3)/(5) * (m1/m2) )

Hmm, but this ratio depends on (m1/m2), which I don't know. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Ah, wait. Maybe the periods are the same? No, system_1 has a period of 2 years and system_2 1 year. So their periods are different.

Wait, but in binary systems, the period is related to the masses and separation. Remember Kepler's third law: P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) ) a³, where a is the separation. But perhaps I can relate the masses using the periods and the velocity amplitudes.

Wait, but the problem is that each system has a different period. So how can I compare the masses when the periods are different? I think the key is to find the ratio of the total masses, considering both the period and the velocities.

Wait, another approach: The mass of a binary system can be determined using the formula:

M_total = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

Where a is the separation between the two stars. Or, perhaps, since we can express a in terms of the velocities and the period.

Wait, the velocity of each star is V = 2π a_i sin i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of each star's orbit, and i is the inclination.

But a1 + a2 = a, the total separation.

But since M1 a1 = M2 a2 (from the center of mass condition), we can write a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) a.

So, substituting into V:

V1 = (2π a1 sin i )/ P = (2 π (M2 a) sin i )/( (M1 + M2) P )

Similarly, V2 = (2 π (M1 a) sin i )/( (M1 + M2) P )

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to find a relation between the two velocities.

Since M1 a1 = M2 a2, and a1 + a2 = a, perhaps another way is to write V1/V2 = M2/M1.

Which makes sense because V1 = 2 π a1 sin i / P and V2= 2 π a2 sin i / P.

So V1/V2 = a1/a2 = M2/(M1 + M2) a / (M1/(M1 + M2) a ) ) → a1/a2 = M2/M1 → V1/V2= M2/M1.

Wait, so V1/V2 = M2/(M1). So M1 = M2 * V2 / V1.

Which brings us back to the initial approach. So for each system, the masses can be determined in terms of their velocity amplitudes.

But how does the period come into play here?

Wait, the total mass is related to the period and the velocities via the formula:

M_total = ( (V1 + V2)^3 P ) / (2942.45 ) )^(1/3)

But I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think again. The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) ) / (2942.45 ) )

Where K is the velocity semi-amplitude of the companion, and f(M) is the mass function, which depends on the mass of the companion and the inclination.

But without knowing the inclination, it's hard to get the actual masses. However, since the question is about the ratio of the masses, perhaps the inclination is the same for both systems, or it can be assumed that sin i is the same for both, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the masses can be related through the periods and velocity amplitudes.

Wait, another approach. The mass of a binary system can be determined using the formula:

M_total = ( (V1 + V2)^3 P ) / (2942.45 ) )^(1/3)

Wait, but I need to confirm the correct formula.

Alternatively, the formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (P * K^3 ) )/( 2942.45 )

Which gives f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Assuming that sin i is the same for both systems, but perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the total masses can be found using the ratio of (V1 + V2)³ * P.

Wait, let me think. The mass function f(M) is proportional to (K³ P ) for each system. So for each system, f(M1) = (K1³ P1) / 2942.45, and f(M2) = (K2³ P2) / 2942.45.

But the actual masses would require knowing the companion's mass, which isn't directly given. So perhaps the only way is to compare the mass functions.

But without inclination, I can't find the exact masses, but maybe the question is designed so that the inclination is the same, making the ratio of the mass functions equal to the ratio of the actual masses.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplified, and the masses are directly proportional to (V * P)^(1/ something). Let me think of the mass in terms of Kepler's third law.

The formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (P (K)^3 ) )/( 2942.45 )

But f(M) = (M2³ sin³ i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

If we assume that system_2's companion is more massive, but without knowing the exact mass ratio, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps another angle: the velocities and the period are all that's needed to find the mass ratio.

Wait, the mass of each star is proportional to (V * P) / (2 π G a) ), but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the mass ratio between the two systems using the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Wait, let's think of it this way: the mass of each star is given by M1 = (V2 / V1) * M2, as before.

But the total mass is M1 + M2 = M2 (1 + V2 / V1 ).

So for system_1, M_total_1 = M2 (1 + 5/10 ) = M2 * 1.5.

For system_2, M_total_2 = M2' (1 + 10/15 ) = M2' * (1 + 2/3 ) = M2' * 5/3.

But wait, M2 here refers to the mass of the companion in each system, which is not the same between system_1 and system_2.

So this approach doesn't directly give the ratio between system_1 and system_2's total mass.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the formula that relates the period, velocities, and masses.

The formula I think is:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³ )/(G P² )

And a can be found using the velocities.

Because in a binary system, each star's velocity is V = 2 π a_i / P, where a_i is the semi-major axis of that star's orbit.

And because a1/a2 = M2/M1.

So a1 = (M2/(M1 + M2)) a_total,

a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a_total.

The total separation a_total = a1 + a2 = a.

So, the velocity of each star is:

V1 = 2 π a1 / P = 2 π (M2 a )/( (M1 + M2) P )

Similarly, V2 = 2 π (M1 a )/( (M1 + M2) P )

Dividing the two equations:

V1 / V2 = (M2 )/( M1 )

Which is consistent with earlier findings.

Now, let's square and cube as needed.

But perhaps a better approach is to express a in terms of the velocities.

From V1 = 2 π a1 / P → a1 = (V1 P )/( 2 π )

Similarly, a2 = (V2 P )/( 2 π )

And since a1 + a2 = a → a = (V1 + V2 ) P/(2 π )

Now, substituting into Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² a³ )/( G (M1 + M2) )

So,

M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

Substituting a = (V1 + V2) P/(2 π )

Then,

M1 + M2 = (4 π² ( (V1 + V2) P/(2 π ))^3 ) / ( G P² )

Simplify:

= (4 π² ) * ( (V1 + V2)^3 P^3 )/( (2 π )^3 ) ) / ( G P² )

= (4 π² ) * (V1+V2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3 ) ) / ( G P² )

Simplify numerator:

4 π² * (V1 + V2)^3 P^3 / (8 π^3 ) )

= (4 /8 ) * (V1+V2)^3 P^3 * π² / π^3 )

= (0.5) * (V1+V2)^3 P^3 * (1/ π )

Denominator: G P².

So,

M1 + M2 = [0.5 (V1 + V2)^3 P^3 / π ] / (G P² )

= [ 0.5 (V1 + V2)^3 P ] / ( π G )

So,

M1 + M2 = ( (V1 + V2)^3 P )/( 2 π G )

But let me check the units. V is in km/s, P in years. Let me convert these to SI units.

1 km/s = 1e3 m/s,

1 year ≈ 3.1536e7 seconds.

So, V1 and V2 are in km/s. Let's convert them to m/s for consistency.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula in terms of solar masses, years, and km/s.

Wait, I think there's a convenient version of Kepler's third law when using units of solar masses, years, and AU.

But perhaps I can find a formula that directly relates (V1 + V2) and P to the total mass.

Wait, I think the formula is:

M_total = ( (V1 + V2)^3 P ) / (2942.45 )

Where M_total is in solar masses, V in km/s, P in years.

But I'm not entirely sure about this, but let's proceed.

So, for system_1:

V1 + V2 =10 +5=15 km/s,

P=2 years.

M1_total = (15^3 * 2 ) / 2942.45

= (3375 * 2 ) / 2942.45

= 6750 / 2942.45 ≈ 2.294 solar masses.

For system_2:

V1 + V2=15+10=25 km/s,

P=1 year.

M2_total= (25^3 *1 ) /2942.45

= (15625) / 2942.45 ≈ 5.313 solar masses.

So, M1= ~2.294, M2= ~5.313.

The ratio M1/M2 is 2.294 /5.313 ≈ 0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43, so around 0.4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4.

Wait, but wait, the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if M1 is ~2.294 and M2 is ~5.313, then system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

So the answer would be ~0.4, which is option A.

But wait, let me double-check the formula.

Another approach: the mass function is given by:

f(M) = ( (K^3 P ) )/( 2942.45 )

But the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Assuming that sin i is the same for both systems, then the ratio of the mass functions would be the same as the ratio of (M2^3 )/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But without knowing M2 and the inclination, this might not help.

Wait, but in the formula I used earlier, M_total is ( (V1 + V2)^3 P )/(2942.45 ) )^(1/3) ? Or is it directly (V1+V2)^3 P /2942.45 ?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me look up the correct formula for the mass in binary systems.

After a quick recall, the correct formula for the total mass when you know the radial velocities is:

M1 + M2 = ( (V1 + V2)^3 P )/( 2942.45 )

But I'm not entirely confident about the exact coefficient. Another source I recall says:

M_total = ( (V1 + V2 )^3 * P ) / ( 2942.45 )

So with that in mind, let's proceed.

So for system_1:

V_avg =15 km/s, P=2 years.

M1 = (15^3 * 2 ) / 2942.45 = (3375 * 2 ) / 2942.45 ≈ 6750 / 2942.45 ≈ 2.294 M_sun.

For system_2:

V_avg=25 km/s, P=1 year.

M2= (25^3 *1 ) /2942.45 = 15625 /2942.45 ≈5.313 M_sun.

So the ratio M1/M2 is approximately 2.294 /5.313 ≈ 0.432, which is about 0.4.

So the answer should be option A, ~0.4.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data about the binary star systems. Both systems exhibit eclipses with periods \( P \) of 2 years (system_1) and 1 year (system_2). Additionally, radial velocity (RV) observations provide the velocity amplitudes of the stars in each system: \( 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( 5 \, \text{km/s} \) for system_1, and \( 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( 10 \, \text{km/s} \) for system_2.

### Key Relationships:
1. **Mass Ratio from Velocities**:  
   In a binary system, the masses of the two stars are inversely proportional to their velocity amplitudes. For system_1:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
   \]
   Thus, \( M_1 = 0.5 \, M_2 \), and the total mass of system_1 is:
   \[
   M_{\text{total,1}} = M_1 + M_2 = 0.5 \, M_2 + M_2 = 1.5 \, M_2
   \]

   For system_2:
   \[
   \frac{M_1}{M_2} = \frac{V_2}{V_1} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]
   Thus, \( M_1 = \frac{2}{3} \, M_2 \), and the total mass of system_2 is:
   \[
   M_{\text{total,2}} = M_1 + M_2 = \frac{2}{3} \, M_2 + M_2 = \frac{5}{3} \, M_2
   \]

2. **Mass Ratio Between Systems**:  
   To compare the total masses of the two systems, we compute the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{1.5 \, M_2}{\frac{5}{3} \, M_2} = \frac{1.5}{\frac{5}{3}} = \frac{1.5 \cdot 3}{5} = \frac{4.5}{5} \approx 0.9
   \]

3. **Refining the Calculation**:  
   Using the formula for the total mass of a binary system:
   \[
   M_{\text{total}} = \frac{(V_1 + V_2)^3 \cdot P}{2942.45}
   \]
   For system_1 (\( V_1 + V_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, P = 2 \, \text{years} \)):
   \[
   M_{\text{total,1}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{2942.45} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{2942.45} \approx 2.294 \, M_\odot
   \]

   For system_2 (\( V_1 + V_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}, P = 1 \, \text{year} \)):
   \[
   M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{(25)^3 \cdot 1}{2942.45} = \frac{15625}{2942.45} \approx 5.313 \, M_\odot
   \]

   The ratio of the total masses is:
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{2.294}{5.313} \approx 0.432
   \]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately 0.4 times as massive as system_2. The closest option to this value is **A) ~0.4**.
