Okay, so I've got this science question in front of me. It's about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and an experiment involving transfection and Cre-Lox systems. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to break it down.

The setup is that a new ligand-receptor pair was identified, and they're initially expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand the developmental fate by using a bicistronic vector. So, a bicistronic vector means it has two coding regions, right? So this vector has both the ligand and the receptor genes.

The vector is a lox-Cre construct. I remember that loxP sites are used for recombination with Cre. The vector has the ligand's ORF (open reading frame) at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. So, each gene is tagged with a fluorescent protein. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter used for expression in various tissues. The receptor is after an IRES element, which is used to initiate translation of the second gene in a bicistronic vector. IRES allows internal ribosome entry, so the second gene can be expressed without a traditional promoter in that context.

Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, there's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites, right? Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites. Oh, but lox2272 is a variant; I think it's a mutant that Cre can't recombine. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around? I'm a bit confused. I remember that lox2272 is a lox variant that is not recognized by Cre, so it's used as a stop cassette for the reverse process.

So when Cre is introduced, it will recombine with loxP sites but not with lox2272. So the vector works like this: the ligand is under CBA promoter, then a stop cassette with loxP. The receptor is after IRES, and then a stop cassette with lox2272. So if Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassettes.

Wait, let's think about that. The vector is designed so that in the absence of Cre, the stop cassettes prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins. When Cre is introduced, it will delete the loxP sites, allowing the genes to be expressed.

So the ligand is at the 5' end, followed by loxP-stop, then mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, after IRES, with a stop cassette in between the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the vector structure.

It's a bicistronic vector: the first gene is ligand, then a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP), then the second gene is receptor, with its own features. But wait, the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor is after IRES. So when Cre is present, the loxP sites are cut, removing the stop cassettes, so the genes are expressed.

Wait, but the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so the ligand should be expressed first. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which is part of the same transcript.

Wait, but without Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of the fluorescent tags. When Cre is introduced, the stop cassettes are removed, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed, right? Because the ORFs would be in frame.

So in the
