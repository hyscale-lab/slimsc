Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about electrochemistry. Hmm, I remember that oxygen is involved in redox reactions, and the question is about how it behaves thermodynamically and kinetically in different solutions—basic versus acidic.

The question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a ….. oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts ….. in acidic solutions. The options are about whether it's stronger or weaker, and faster or slower.

Wait, I think I need to recall what affects the strength of an oxidizing agent and the rate of reaction. Oh right, thermodynamics deals with the feasibility (ΔG, cell potential) and kinetics deals with the speed (activation energy, reaction rate).

So for the first part, oxygen as an oxidant: in basic solutions. I remember the standard reduction potentials. In basic conditions, the OER (oxygen evolution reaction) might have a higher potential, making O2 a stronger oxidizing agent. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Let me think. In acidic solutions, the standard O2 reduction is higher. For example, in acidic, O2 + 4H+ + 4e^- → 2H2O with E° around 1.23 V. In basic, the same reaction would be O2 + 2H2O + 4e^- → 4OH^- with E° around 0.401 V. Wait, that's lower. So in acidic, the O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent because the E° is higher. So in basic, the E° is lower, so O2 is a weaker oxidant.

Wait no, wait. The higher the E°, the stronger the oxidizing agent. So in acidic, E° is higher (1.23 V) so O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent. In basic solution (E° of 0.401 V), it's weaker. So thermodynamically, in basic, O2 is a weaker oxidant.

So the first blank should be 'weaker' because in basic, the E° is lower, making it less likely to be a strong oxidant compared to acidic.

Now the second part: kinetically, how does O2 react in acidic versus basic? Kinetics are about reaction rates, which depend on factors like activation energy. I remember that in acidic solutions, the reaction rate for O2 reactions is often faster because of the presence of H+ ions. For example, the reaction might have a lower activation energy in acidic conditions. Or maybe the reaction involves H+ ions, so in acidic solution, the necessary protons are more available, making the reaction proceed faster.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on this. I think that in general, in acidic conditions, reactions can proceed more quickly because H+ can act as a catalyst or participate in the rate-determining step. So O2 reacting in acidic solutions would have a faster reaction rate. So the second blank should be 'faster'.

So putting it together: thermodynamically, oxygen is a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, it reacts faster in acidic solutions. So the blanks are 'weaker' and 'faster'.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options:
A) stronger – faster
B) stronger – slower
C) weaker – faster
D) weaker - slower

So the correct combination is weaker and faster, which is option C.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in basic and acidic solutions thermodynamically and kinetically.

1. **Thermodynamic Behavior**:  
   The standard reduction potential for the oxygen reduction reaction is higher in acidic solutions (E° ≈ 1.23 V) compared to basic solutions (E° ≈ 0.401 V). A higher reduction potential indicates a stronger oxidizing agent. Therefore, oxygen is a stronger oxidant in acidic solutions and a weaker oxidant in basic solutions. This means that thermodynamically, oxygen is a **weaker** oxidant in basic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Behavior**:  
   Reaction rates are influenced by factors such as the availability of ions like H⁺. In acidic solutions, H⁺ ions are present in higher concentrations, which can lower the activation energy and facilitate faster reaction rates. Thus, kinetically, oxygen reacts **faster** in acidic solutions.

Combining these observations, the correct combination is "weaker" and "faster." This corresponds to **Option C**.

Answer: C
