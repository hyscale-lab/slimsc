Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because sigmatropic rearrangements can be a bit tricky. Let's take it step by step. 

The question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out the products A, B, and C. Then, match them with the options given. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

First Reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat → A

Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with a sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples. But wait, this reaction involves an amine and an alcohol, so maybe it's a different kind of rearrangement. Oh, wait—maybe this is a case of the Huisgen cycloaddition? No, that's for azides and alkynes. Alternatively, perhaps it's related to the formation of an oxaziridine or something similar. Alternatively, maybe it's a [3,3] sigmatropic shift.

Wait, but 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is like (CH3O)2CH-NH2. But that's not a typical structure for a Claisen or Cope. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Hofmann rearrangement? No, that's for amides. 

Alternatively, thinking about the components: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine (which is dimethylaminoethane dimethyl ether?), and but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2 where double bond is between carbons 3 and 4? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH(OH)-CH3. Because but-3-en-2-ol has four carbons, double bond between C3 and C4 (but numbering starts from the end), so it's CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3, no, wait, that's but-2-en-2-ol. Wait, perhaps
