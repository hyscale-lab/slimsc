Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants, β, are used to determine the stability of complexes in solution. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

The question states that we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentrations are given as c(Co) = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants for the cobalt complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We're asked to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes among all cobalt species. The options are A to D.

Wait, wait. So, the complexes are Co(SCN)n^2−n, right? And each βn is the stability constant for the formation of the complex with n SCN- ions. The blue dithiocyanato complex must be the one with two SCN- ions, so n=2. Because I remember that the different numbers of SCN- give different colors, like the blue one is probably the tetracoordinated complex, which is the [Co(SCN)4]^2- or maybe [Co(SCN)2]^ something. Wait, no, the dithiocyanato would be two SCN- ions, so the complex is [Co(SCN)2]^2+.

But wait, the stability constants given are β1, β2, β3, β4... So β1 is for the complex [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)2]^0, β3 for [Co(SCN)3]^−, and β4 for [Co(SCN)4]^2−. But wait, I'm not sure about the charges. Let me think: Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN^- is -1. So [Co(SCN)_n]^ (charge) would be 2 - n*(1) = 2 - n. So for n=1: +1, n=2: 0, n=3: -1, n=4: -2.

So the stability constant βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ions. So the formation of [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n} from Co^2+ and n SCN^-.

The problem asks for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is n=2. So [Co(SCN)₂]^0. So we need to find the fraction of Co in this form.

In solution, the cobalt exists in various forms: free Co²+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)₂]^0, [Co(SCN)3]^−, [Co(SCN)4]^2−. So all these species are present, and we need to find the fraction that is [Co(SCN)₂]^0.

The approach is to calculate the fraction of each species using the stability constants. But wait, how do I account for all the possible species and their concentrations?

I think I should model this using the formation constants. The idea is that the distribution of the species depends on the concentrations of the ligand (SCN-) and the stability constants.

The general approach is to use the formation constants to express the concentration of each complex in terms of [Co²+] and [SCN^-], and then find the fraction of each complex.

But wait, how do I handle multiple formation constants? Oh, right, because each complex formation is a stepwise process. So for the nth complex, the formation constant is the product of the stepwise constants up to n. But in this case, the given β values are the overall stability constants for each complex. Wait, no, I think each β represents the overall formation constant for that particular complex, not the stepwise. So βn = [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}}]/([Co²+][SCN^-]^n).

So for each n, the concentration of the complex is [Co(SCN)_n^{2−n}}] = βn [Co²+] [SCN^-
