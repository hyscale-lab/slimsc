Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclooctatetraene. The first step is heating it with maleic anhydride in a 1:1 ratio to form product 1. Then, product 1 is heated with methanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid to form product 2. Finally, product 2 is heated with cyclopentadiene to form the final product 3. They're asking about the structure of the major isomer of product 3, with four options given.

Hmm, let me think about each reaction.

First reaction: cyclooctatetraene with maleic anhydride. I remember that cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated eight-membered ring, sort of like a non-aromatic compound because it's tub-shaped. When it reacts with a dienophile like maleic anhydride, it probably undergoes a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene and a dienophile. Cyclooctatetraene can act as a diene? Or is it the other way around? Oh wait, maleic anhydride is a good dienophile, so maybe cyclooctatetraene acts as the diene here.

Wait, cyclooctatetraene is a conjugated diene in a
