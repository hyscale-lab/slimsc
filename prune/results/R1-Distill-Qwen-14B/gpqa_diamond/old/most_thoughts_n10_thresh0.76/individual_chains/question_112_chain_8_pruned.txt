Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the problem says that we have an electron described by the state |α⟩, which is proportional to (1+i)|up⟩ + (2−i)|down⟩. The |up⟩ and |down⟩ are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. We are to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix representation has elements A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. Also, we need to find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Wait, the operator's matrix elements are A_ij = ħ/2 when i≠j, and 0 otherwise. That sounds familiar. Let me think about what kind of operator that is. Oh, right! The Pauli matrices. Well, the Pauli X matrix, perhaps? Let me recall: the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and its elements are 0 on the diagonal and 1 elsewhere. But in this case, our A_ij has ħ/2 as the off-diagonal elements, and zero on the diagonal. So perhaps A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix?

Wait, let me write out matrix A. The operator A is a 2x2 matrix because we're dealing with spin-1/2 particles (since it's an electron and we're talking about spin up and down). So, the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because for i ≠ j, A_ij is ħ/2, and A_ii is zero. So yes, that's correct. So, A is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli X matrix has 1s off-diagonal and 0s on the diagonal.

Wait, but the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so our A is (ħ/2) * σ_x. So, the eigenstates of A would be the same as those of σ_x, because scaling by a scalar doesn't change the eigenstates, only the eigenvalues.

So, the eigenstates of A are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the spin states in the x-direction. The eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, perhaps. So, the operator A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, right? Because σ_x has eigenvalues 1 and -1, so when multiplied by ħ/2, the eigenvalues become (ħ/2) and -(ħ/2).

But wait, the question says to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of the operator. So, the operator is A, which has eigenstates |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. So, to find the probabilities, we need to expand the state |α⟩ in terms of these eigenstates.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenstates |a⟩ and |b⟩ of A, and express |α⟩ in terms of |
