Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, the question gives me the matrix form of Ay and asks about its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, as well as some statements regarding the properties of these eigenvalues and eigenfunctions.

First, I'll try to understand what's given. The operator Ay is defined as c multiplied by matrix S. The constant c is given as h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So matrix S looks like this:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

So Ay = (h/(4π)) * S.

I remember that the Pauli matrices (like S here, but scaled) are related to spin operators. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, and each has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, S as given here might actually be the Pauli matrix σy multiplied by something. Let me think: the Pauli matrix σy is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ], which matches S exactly. So S is σy. So Ay is (h/(4π)) * σy.

Wait, but wait. The spin operator for a spin-½ particle is usually given as ħ/2 times the Pauli matrices. Because the spin angular momentum is ħ/2 times σ for each component. So maybe S is (2ħ)σy or something? Hmm, maybe I should get into the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So I need to find the eigenvalues a and eigenvectors φ of Ay.

Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0.

Let me compute Ay first. Ay = (h/(4π)) * S. So substituting S, Ay becomes:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

So, the matrix Ay is:

[ [0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

The characteristic equation is determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0.

So:

| (-a)       (-i h)/(4π)      |
| (i h)/(4π)   (-a)        | = 0

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h)/(4π) * (i h)/(4π) ) ] = 0.

Compute each part:

(-a)(-a) = a².

The other term: [(-i h)/(4π)] * [(i h)/(4π)] = [ (-i)(i) ] * (h²)/(16 π²) 

Since i * (-i) is (-i²) = - (-1) = 1. So:

= [1] * (h²)/(16 π²) = h²/(16 π²) 

So the determinant is:

a² - [h²/(16 π²)] = 0

So a² = h²/(16 π²)
Taking square roots:
a = ± h/(4 π)

Wait, that's interesting. So the eigenvalues of Ay are plus and minus h/(4 π). 

So looking at the options, let me see.

Option A says the imaginary part are ±2πh and real parts are ±h/(4π). That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real numbers here. Because the matrix Ay is Hermitian, right? Because it's a spin operator component, which should be Hermitian, so eigenvalues should be real.

Wait a second, let me check if Ay is Hermitian. The matrix Ay has elements:

First row: 0, (-i h)/(4π)
Second row: (i h)/(4π), 0

The conjugate transpose of Ay would have elements:

First column: 0, (i h)/(4π)
Second column: (-i h)/(4π), 0

Wait, the original matrix Ay has first row [0, (-i h)/(4π)], and second row [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ].

The conjugate transpose would have first row [0, (i h)/(4π)], and second row [ (-i h)/(4π), 0 ].

Which is not the same as Ay. Oh wait, am I missing something? Because S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. The conjugate transpose of S is [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is negative of S. Because S^† = -S.

So, since S is anti-Hermitian, S^† = -S. So for Ay = c S, the conjugate transpose is (c S )^† = c^* S^† = c^* (-S) because c is h/(4π), which is real, so c^* = c. So Ay^† = c (-S) = - Ay.

Wait, that implies that Ay is anti-Hermitian. Because (Ay)^† = - Ay. So the eigenvalues are imaginary?

Wait, but earlier calculation shows the eigenvalues are real. Hmm, that's a contradiction. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is Hermitian. Let me compute S^†. S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. The conjugate transpose of S is [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is equal to -S, because S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S^† = -S. So S is anti-Hermitian. So Ay = c S, where c is real. Then Ay^† = c S^† = c (-S) = - Ay. So the matrix Ay is anti-Hermitian. So its eigenvalues would be purely imaginary. Because for an anti-Hermitian operator, the eigenvalues are imaginary. 

But earlier, I found the eigenvalues as real numbers, which is a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute the eigenvalues correctly.

The matrix Ay is:

[ [ 0, (-i h)/(4π) ],
  [ (i h)/(4π), 0 ] ]

So the characteristic equation is:

| Ay - a I | = 0

So the matrix is:

[ -a        (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  -a ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) (i h/(4π)) ]

So calculate each part:

First term: a².

Second term: (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²)/(16 π²) 

(-i)(i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1.

So the second term is (h²)/(16 π²) 

So determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0 → a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ±h/(4 π) 

Wait, that's the same as before. But according to the Hermiticity, since Ay is anti-Hermitian, the eigenvalues should be imaginary. So why am I getting real eigenvalues?

Oh wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the operator definition. Let me re-express the operator correctly.

Wait, the operator Ay is given as c·S, where c = h/(4π), and S is the matrix given. So S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

But in quantum mechanics, the spin operator S is often (1/2) σ, where σ is the Pauli matrix. So perhaps S here is (i σy/2) or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered units correctly.

Wait, maybe I should think of S as (1/2) times the Pauli matrix. Let me check. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each with eigenvalues ±1. The spin operator is (ħ/2) σ. So for example, Sx = (ħ/2) σx.

Wait, considering that, the matrix S given here is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is equal to i σy, since σy is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S = i σy. So S is i times the Pauli matrix σy.

So then, Ay = c * S = (h/(4 π)) * i σy.

Wait, let's compute the eigenvalues of Ay. Since σy has eigenvalues ±1, and Ay is (i h/(4 π)) σy.

So the eigenvalues of σy are 1 and -1, so the eigenvalues of Ay would be (i h
