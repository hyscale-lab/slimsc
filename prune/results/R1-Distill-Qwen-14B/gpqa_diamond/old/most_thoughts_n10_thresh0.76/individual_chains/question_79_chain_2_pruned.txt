Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying Compound X based on the NMR data of the product formed after a reaction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

So, the reaction conditions: Compound X (C11H12O) is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K (which is around 130°C) for a day. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, right? It's often used in the Corey-House reaction or other types of eliminations. Oh wait, but wait, another thought: it's also used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes using peracids, but no, that's more like mCPBA. Oh wait, no, Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction maybe? Or maybe it's involved in some kind of elimination. Alternatively, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclooctane is a base that can induce epoxide ring-opening reactions, especially under certain conditions. Oh wait, but wait, in this case, the product's NMR is given, so maybe the reaction is an epoxidation or something else.

Wait, the product's NMR is provided. The compound after reaction has a certain structure. So we need to figure out what the product is, which will tell us what the starting material was.

Looking at the product's 1H NMR:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) and δ 2.31 (3H, s): two singlets, each integrating to 3H. That suggests two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't have neighboring protons, like attached to an electronegative atom or in a symmetric environment.

Then, for the aromatic region:

δ 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, these are all in the aromatic region. Let me see the splitting patterns.

The 6.75 and 7.68 are doublets, each integrating 1H. The 7.08 and 7.71 are doublets, each integrating 2H. Hmm, so let me try to figure out the coupling here. Maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a styrene group or something with a substituent that affects the ring.

Wait, let's think about the 13C NMR data as well for the aromatic carbons.

The 13C NMR shows:

126.9 (2C, s), 127.1 (1C, s), 129.1 (2C, s), 130.3 (1C, s), 141.5 (1C, s), 144.1 (1C, s), 197.7 (1C, s).

Wait, the 197.7 ppm is a carbonyl carbon, probably a ketone or an ester. Or wait, could it be an epoxide? No, because epoxide carbons are around 55-65 ppm. So 197 is more like a ketone. Or maybe a carbonyl in an ester. Hmm.

So let me think about the structure.

The product has two methyl groups (from the 2.28 and 2.31 singlets), some aromatic carbons, and a carbonyl carbon.

Putting this together, maybe the product is a bicyclic compound or something with a ketone group.

Wait, but the starting material is reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. Oh, perhaps the starting compound was an epoxide, and the reaction is ring-opening.

Wait, the starting material is C11H12O. After reaction with a strong base, perhaps the epoxide ring is opening. But let me think: Diazabicyclooctane is a strong base, so if the starting material was an epoxide, the base might open it. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide was formed.

Wait, the product's formula isn't given, but the starting material is C11H12O. Let me think about the options given.

The options are A to D. Let me look at them.

Option A: 2-(4-methylstyryl)oxirane. Oxirane is an epoxide. Structure would be a three-membered ring with two substituents. Styryl is a vinyl benzene group. The 4-methyl would mean a methyl group on the benzene ring at the para position.

Option B: 2-(1-phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)oxirane. So the oxirane has a substituent that's a propenyl group with a phenyl at position 1 and another substituent (probably the oxygen of the epoxide) at position 2.

Option C: 2-methyl-3-styryloxirane. So the oxirane (epoxide) has a methyl group at position 2 and a styryl group at position 3.

Option D: 2-styrylepoxide. So the epoxide has a styryl group attached to carbon 2.

Wait, but the product is the result of reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclooctane. So perhaps the starting compound X is an epoxide, and the reaction is ring-opening. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, considering that 1,4-diaz
