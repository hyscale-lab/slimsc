Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Sigma here must be the Pauli matrices, right? Because the question mentions that the components are Pauli spin matrices.

Wait, Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each a 2x2 matrix. So the dot product σ · n would be σx nx + σy ny + σz nz, where nx, ny, nz are the components of the unit vector n. Since n is a unit vector, nx² + ny² + nz² = 1.

So H = ε (nx σx + ny σy + nz σz). I need to find the eigenvalues of this H.

I remember that for Pauli matrices, each σi has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you have a linear combination of them, what's the eigenvalue like?

Oh right! The eigenvalues of a spin operator like σ · n are ±1. Because, for any direction n, the spin component can be +1 or -1 when measured along that axis. So the spin operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1.

But wait, the Hamiltonian here is multiplied by ε. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε multiplied by the eigenvalues of σ · n. That would make the eigenvalues plus ε and minus ε.

Looking at the options, option B says +ε, -ε. That seems right.

Wait, but wait another thing. I recall that sometimes in these problems, the Pauli matrices include a factor with ħ. Like, the spin operator is (ħ/2) σ · n. Because the actual spin angular momentum is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices.

Oh, but in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n. So perhaps in this case, the factor of ħ/2 isn't present here. Let me think... The Pauli matrices themselves are just the matrices; their eigenvalues are ±1. But if the operator is (σ · n), the eigenvalues are ±1. If the operator is (something else, like (ħ/2)σ · n), then the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So in our problem, H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalues are ε multiplied by ±1, which gives ±ε.

Wait, but the options include options with ħ. Option C is ± ε ħ/2. So why is that not the case here?

Ah, perhaps I'm forgetting something about the units. Wait, the Pauli matrices have dimension of ħ times something. Let me think about the dimensionality.

The Pauli matrices are dimensionless (they're matrices, and each element is a number without units). But when you have an operator representing a spin component, like S·n, then S is in units of ħ/2. So S·n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. But in our case, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So perhaps ε has to include the factors of ħ to make the dimensions correct.

Wait, wait. Let's think about the dimensions. The Hamiltonian has dimensions of energy. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless, since they're matrices with elements like 1, 0, etc. So if H has dimension energy, then the term ε times (σ · n) must have dimension energy. Since σ · n is dimensionless (each σ is dimensionless), ε must have dimension energy. So in this problem, ε is just an energy scale. So when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Wait, but in the case of the spin Hamiltonian, like the Zeeman term, the energy is often written as -(μ·B), where μ is the magnetic moment. And μ for spin is (gμ_B S), where S is in units of ħ/2. So for example, the energy would be proportional to (something involving ħ). But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, so it's already accounting for any constants. So the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

So the eigenvalues are ε and -ε. Therefore, the correct option is B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose the Hamiltonian was written as H = (ε/ ħ) (σ · n) * ħ. Then the eigenvalues would be ± ε/ ħ * ħ * 1 = ± ε. But no, in this problem, it's just H= ε σ·n, so the eigenvalues are ±ε.

So the options are:

A) ±1 → energy? No, because ε is energy multiplied by a dimensionless term.

Wait, but the problem states that ε has dimension of energy. So the eigenvalues should have the same dimension as H, which is energy.

Option B is ±ε, which are energies, so that makes sense.

Option C is
