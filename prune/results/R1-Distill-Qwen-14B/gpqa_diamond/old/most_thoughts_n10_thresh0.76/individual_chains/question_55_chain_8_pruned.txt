Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis or Trans versions of propenyl or butenyl acetates. 

Alright, first, I need to remember what each of these structures looks like. Let me think: propenyl and butenyl are types of alkenyl groups. Acetate means it's an ester, right? So the structure is probably something like R-O-CO-OCH3, wait no, acetate is R-O-CO-O-R, but the actual structure is the ester of acetic acid. So it's something like where an acetic acid's -OH is replaced by an R-O- group. 

Wait, no, the general formula for an ester is R-O-CO-R'. Acetate would be when R' is from acetic acid, which is CH3COO-. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Acetic acid is CH3COOH. The ester would be where the -OH is replaced by OR. So the acetate ester would be R-O-CO-O-CH3? No, wait, correction: no. The ester is formed from the acid (like CH3COOH) and an alcohol (ROH). The ester would be CH3CO-O-R. So the structure is like R-O-CO-OCH3? No, wait, no. Let me clarify. Oh wait, the ester is R-O-CO-R', where R is from the alcohol and R' is from the acid. Since it's acetate, R' is CH3. So the structure is R-O-CO-CH3. So the acetate ester would be something like CH2CH2CO-O-R, but wait no. The group attached to the oxygen would be the R from the alcohol. So for example, if the alcohol is prop-1-en-2-ol, the ester would be prop-1-en-2-yl acetate, which would be CH2=CH-CH2-O-CO-CH3? No, wait, let me think again. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, no. Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- or CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- but wait, propenyl is a three-carbon chain with a double bond. So propenyl could be either CH2=CHCH2- (propenyl) or CH2CH2CH2? No, no. Wait, the structure of propenyl could be either allyl (CH2=CHCH2-) or another arrangement, but perhaps in the case of the ester, the substituents are arranged around the double bond.

But wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. So propenyl is a three-carbon with a double bond, and butenyl is four carbons. So for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, wait
