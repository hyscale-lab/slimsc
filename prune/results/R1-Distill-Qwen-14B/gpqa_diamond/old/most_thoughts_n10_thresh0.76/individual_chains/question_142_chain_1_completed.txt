Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. So, the question gives me a specific density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are labeled A to D with some r vectors.

Wait, the density matrix given is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me think about what this represents. Oh right, |0><0| is a projector operator that projects onto the state |0>, and similarly for |1>. So when you add them together and multiply by 1/2, it's like taking an equal mixture of the states |0> and |1>. So this is a classical mixture, meaning it's a completely mixed state for a single qubit.

I remember that for a single qubit, the space can be represented in a 2D Bloch sphere. The Bloch vector represents the state, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside. The general form of a density matrix for a single qubit can be written in terms of a Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So ρ can be expressed as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and I is the identity matrix.

Let me write out the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute this. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ = (I)/2.

Wait, so ρ = (1/2) * I. So in terms of the Bloch vector, using the equation ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. If I set them equal, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. So r·σ = 0. Each component of r multiplied by the corresponding Pauli matrix equals zero. The only way this can be true is if each component of r is zero. Because if r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0, and since the Pauli matrices are all non-zero and independent, the coefficients must be zero. So r_x = r_y = r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector is at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), which matches what I just found. So the geometrical position is at the center of the Bloch sphere, which makes sense because the state is completely mixed, so it's the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. The maximally mixed state is the center, and pure states are on the surface.

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), meaning it is a completely mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation of single-qubit states, the position of a state is determined by its Bloch vector \((r_x, r_y, r_z)\). For a single qubit, the density matrix can be expressed as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. Comparing this with the given \(\rho = \frac{1}{2} I\), it is clear that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This implies that all components of \(\mathbf{r}\) must be zero (\(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\)), as the Pauli matrices are independent and non-zero. Therefore, the Bloch vector is at the origin, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

From the options provided, the correct geometrical position is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to a mixed state.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this represents a pure state along the \(z\)-axis.  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as this represents the maximally mixed state at the center of the Bloch sphere.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

The correct answer is **C**, as the density matrix represents a completely mixed state with the Bloch vector at the origin.

Answer: C
