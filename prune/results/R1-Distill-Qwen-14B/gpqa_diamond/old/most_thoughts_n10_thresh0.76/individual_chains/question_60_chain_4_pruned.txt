Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. So there's this alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They've built a super fast spacecraft that can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Their average lifetime is about 150 solar years. The question is about how long it takes for a 22-year-old astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective.

Hmm, right, I remember something about time dilation from my physics class. Time dilation is when time moves slower for an object moving at a high velocity relative to another object. So from Earth's frame of reference, the spacecraft is moving really fast, but from the astronaut's perspective, they're stationary and Earth is moving backwards.

Wait, but the question is asking about the time from the astronaut's point of view. So I think I need to consider the proper time, which is the time experienced by the traveler.

First, I need to know the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, I think the LMC is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance d is approximately 163,000 light-years.

The spacecraft's speed is 0.99999987c. Let me compute the time it takes from Earth's frame. Time is distance divided by speed. So t = d / v.

Plugging in the numbers: t = 163000 ly / 0.99999987c. Wait, since the speed is so close to c, the time would be almost 163,000 years. But that's from Earth's perspective.

But wait, the astronaut's experienced time is different because of time dilation. Oh right! The formula for time dilation is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). 

Wait, actually, no. The proper time is the shortest time, experienced by the traveler. So the time experienced by the astronaut is t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me get the exact formula right.

Gamma factor, γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' = t / γ.

So first, calculate t as seen from Earth: t = 163000 / 0.99999987. Let me compute that. Since 0.99999987 is very close to 1, this will be approximately 163000 * (1 / 0.99999987). Hmm, 1 divided by 0.99999987 is roughly 1.00000013. So t ≈ 163000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163000.21 years. So from Earth's frame, it takes about 163,000 years. But the astronaut's time is less.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old. If the trip takes 163,000 years from Earth's perspective, that would mean the astronaut would age much less due to their own time being shorter.

Wait, but wait, no. Because when moving at such high speeds, the astronaut's time is dilated. So from Earth, the astronaut ages less. But from the astronaut's frame, the distance is shorter. Oh, right! Because in the astronaut's frame, Earth is moving towards them at 0.99999987c, and the distance is contracted.

Wait, could I be mixing up the frames here? Let me get this straight. Time dilation and length contraction are both effects of special relativity. The astronaut is in the spacecraft, so their frame is the one where the distance is contracted. So the proper length (distance between Earth and LMC in Earth's frame) is L = 163,000 ly. The length in the astronaut's frame is L' = L * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So L' = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2).

Wait, but wait, let me compute the gamma factor first. Let me compute v = 0.99999987c. So v is 0.99999987 times the speed of light.

So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let's approximate it. 0.99999987 is extremely close to 1, so (0.99999987)^2 is about 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 =
