Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. The question is about treating racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene with Grubbs catalyst. The options are A to D, with possible answers from 2 to 8 products.

Hmm, I remember that Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Metathesis means breaking and reforming of double bonds, right? Grubbs catalyst is a transition metal carbene catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis.

So the starting material is 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent means five carbons. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-C(CH3)H2? Wait, no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure CH2=CHCH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3, but with a methyl branch at position 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Let me count the carbons.

Wait, pentene is five carbons. So 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the structure: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's six carbons. Oh wait, wait, the formula for pentene is C5H10. So 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, that can't be right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe it's (CH2)2CHCH(CH3), but wait, no. Let me write the structure properly.

Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. So 3-methyl would have a methyl group on the third carbon. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but that's six carbons. No, no, because pent-1-ene is five carbons. So maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH2CH3)-CH3? No,
