Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry question about the color a dye emits and which color it absorbs. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that a textile dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system and emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. We're supposed to find out what color of light it absorbs. The options are red, violet, blue, or yellow.

Hmm, I remember something about electromagnetic radiation and energy levels. Oh right, when a substance absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others. I think this has to do with the complementary color. Like, if a dye emits green light, it must absorb the complement, which is magenta or something. But wait, how does that tie into the energy?

Wait, the energy of the emitted light is given. I recall that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light. So higher energy photons have shorter wavelengths, which correspond to higher frequency and different colors.

The emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I should convert that into wavelength to find out what color it is. Once I know the emitted wavelength, the absorbed wavelength should be in the complementary part of the spectrum, right?

Let me calculate the wavelength. I'll use E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E. But I need to make sure the units are correct. Planck's constant h is 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. E is given in electron volts, so I'll need to convert that to joules.

1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. So 2.3393 eV is 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J. Let me calculate that:

2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ (2.3393 * 1.602) * 1e-19. Let's compute 2.3393 * 1.602. 2 * 1.6 is 3.2, 0.3393 * 1.6 is around 0.543. So total is about 3.743e-19 J.

So E = 3.743e-19 J. Now, plug into λ = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.743e-19 J). Let me calculate numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by denominator 3.743e-19 J: 1.9878e-25 / 3.743e-19 ≈ (1.9878 / 3.743) x 1e-6. 1.9878 /3.743 is about 0.531. So λ ≈ 0.531e-6 meters, which is 531 nm.

Wait, 531 nm is in the green region of the spectrum because green is about 495-570 nm. So if the dye emits green light, but wait, the question says it's the emitted light color.

Wait, no, wait. The question is asking what color is absorbed. Because when something emits light, it's because it absorbed higher energy light and then emits lower energy. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no. The dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. The energy of the emitted light corresponds to the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state.

So the energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is equal to the energy difference between the excited and ground states. That means when the dye absorbs a photon of higher energy than E_emit, it gets excited. So the absorbed photon's energy must be higher than the emitted.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Absorption involves promoting an electron from a lower energy level (ground state) to a higher energy level (excited state). When it returns to the ground state, it emits a photon with energy E = E2 - E1. So the emitted photon's energy is lower than the absorbed photon's energy.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The energy of the absorbed photon must be equal to the energy difference between the excited and ground states. Because when it absorbs, the electron jumps up, and when it emits, it drops back down. So the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorbed) is the same as the energy difference (E_emit) if it's a simple two-level system. Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed. But in reality, the molecule might go into multiple excited states with varying energy differences, but in the case of conjugated systems, maybe it's about the energy gap.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The key here is that the color emitted is the color that the molecule doesn't absorb. Wait, no. Wait, when a molecule absorbs certain wavelengths, it uses that energy to excite electrons. The emitted light is the result of the molecule returning to a lower energy state, but the emitted photon's energy is usually lower than the absorbed. So the emitted color is lower energy than the absorbed.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So that energy corresponds to the emitted photon. So we need to find the absorbed photon's energy. But wait, the energy difference between the excited and ground state would be the same as the emitted photon's energy, right? Because the molecule goes from excited (higher energy) to ground (lower), so the energy difference is E_emit = E_excited - E_ground.

Wait, but absorption and emission are processes that involve the same energy gap. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it's because the photon's energy matches the energy gap between the ground state and an excited state. Then, when it emits, it releases a photon of the same energy (assuming it goes directly back to ground state). So if it emits 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the photon absorbed.

Wait, but that can't be right because then the absorbed and emitted photons would be the same. But wait, maybe the question is about the color of the absorbed light. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, what color is that? Then the absorbed light would be the same as the emitted? No, that can't be because a substance can't absorb and emit the same color. Or can it? No, usually when something is colored, it absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think of it another way. For example, if a substance emits green light, it must have absorbed higher energy (lower wavelength) light, perhaps blue or violet, and then emits green as it relaxes. So the emitted light is lower in energy than the absorbed.

Wait, but in the question, the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed light must be of higher energy than that. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes to a higher energy state and then emits a photon as it relaxes.

So let's compute the wavelength of the emitted light. Earlier, I calculated that 2.3393 eV is about 531 nm, which is green. But wait, green is around 550 nm, so 531 is a bit towards the blue-green. So if the emitted light is green, the absorbed light would be higher energy (shorter wavelength, higher eV), which is blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is asking what color is absorbed. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed would be a higher energy color, like blue or violet. Because the emitted photon's energy is lower than the absorbed.

Wait no, wait I think I have this reversed. If the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy (lower wavelength), say blue light (around 450 nm), which is higher energy than green (531 nm), then the energy difference would be E = hc/λ. Let's compute the energy for blue light.

Blue light is roughly around 450 nm. E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (450e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.5e-7) = approx 4.417e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.417e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.757 eV.

So if the molecule absorbs blue light (2.757 eV), then the emitted light would have energy E_emit = E_absorbed - E_energy_gap? Wait, no. Or is the energy of the emitted photon equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states.

Wait, perhaps in a simple two-level system, the absorbed photon's energy equals the energy gap. So if a molecule is in the ground state, it absorbs a photon of energy E, jumps to the excited state, and then when it relaxes, emits a photon of the same energy E. But in reality, it might emit lower energy photons due to multiple energy levels or other factors. Wait, but the question gives the emitted photon's energy as 2.3393 eV, so perhaps the absorbed photon must have been higher energy than that.

Wait, but if the molecule emits 2.3393 eV, that's the energy of the emitted photon, which would be equal to the energy gap between the excited and ground states. So if the molecule is excited to a higher state by absorbing a photon with energy E_abs = 2.3393 eV, then when it relaxes, it emits the same energy. So the absorbed photon would have energy 2.3393 eV. But that would mean the absorbed and emitted are the same. That can't be right because if you absorb green and emit green, the material would appear green, but the question is about the absorbed color.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is about the complementary color. The color emitted is the color that is transmitted or emitted, and the absorbed color is the one not emitted. But wait, the way colors work is that if a material absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects or transmits others. So if it emits green, it's because it absorbed higher energy (blue/violet) and emits green.

Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed—so the dye absorbs a certain color, which is higher in energy (shorter wavelength) than the emitted.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light. So the emitted light is the color we see. The absorbed light is the color not seen, which is the complementary color.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me recap the main points.

Energy of emitted light: 2.3393 eV. Let's find the wavelength of that emitted light.

E = hc/λ → λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s, E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J ≈ 3.745e-19 J.

λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) ≈ (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) ≈ 5.307e-7 meters → 530.7 nm.

530 nm is in the green region, since green is about 495-570 nm. So the emitted light is green.

But wait, the question is about what color is absorbed. So the dye must absorb the complementary color. The complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not one of the options. The options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question isn't about the complementary color but the absorbed photon's energy.

Wait, according to the theory, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's because the photon's energy matches the energy gap between the ground state and an excited state. This energy gap is the same as the energy of the absorbed photon. When the molecule relaxes back to the ground state, it emits a photon with the same energy. But in practice, sometimes molecules can have multiple excited states, so the emitted photon might have a lower energy than the absorbed one.

Wait, but in the case of conjugated pi systems, the energy gap determines the wavelength absorbed. Extensively conjugated systems have lower energy gaps because the pi orbitals are more delocalized, leading to smaller band gaps. So lower energy (longer wavelength) photons are absorbed.

Wait, but the question says the dye emits light of 2.3393 eV. So the emitted photon's energy is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, so the energy gap must be 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon would also have energy 2.3393 eV, but that can't be because then the same color is absorbed and emitted, which doesn't make sense for color. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, another approach: The energy of the emitted photon is equal to the energy difference between the excited and ground states. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from ground to excited, then emits a photon when it goes back. So the absorbed photon's energy is E = E_excited - E_ground, which is the same as the emitted photon's energy. So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed is the same.

But that can't be, because if you absorb green and emit green, you wouldn't see any color. So maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the emitted light is not the same as the absorbed light. Maybe the energy of the emitted photon is lower than the absorbed.

Wait, but if the molecule goes from the ground state to an excited state (absorbs a photon of energy E), and then transitions to another lower energy state, emitting a photon of lower energy (E_emit < E_absorbed). So the emitted photon's energy is the difference between the two excited states.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the absorbed light, which is the one that the molecule doesn't emit. Wait, but the question is phrased as, the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV, so what color is absorbed?

Wait, another thought: the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed light would be higher than that. Because when the molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, upon relaxation, it emits a photon of lower energy. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted.

So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is about 530 nm (green). The absorbed photon must be of higher energy (shorter wavelength), which would be blue or violet.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. Which one is it?

So let's calculate the wavelength of the absorbed photon. Let's assume the absorbed photon has higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Let's see, for example, if the absorbed photon is violet light, which is around 400 nm.

E = hc/λ → E = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (400e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / 4e-7 = approx 4.9695e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.9695e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

So if the absorbed photon is 3.10 eV, then the emitted would be 3.10 - (energy difference for the transition after absorbing). Wait, but the emitted photon's energy is given as 2.3393 eV. So perhaps the absorbed photon is of higher energy, but I'm not sure exactly by how much.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is about the color absorbed, given that the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. Since emitted is green (530 nm), the absorbed must be the complementary color. Wait, the complementary color of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps the light absorbed is the higher energy (blue or violet) because when a molecule absorbs higher energy light, it emits lower energy.

Wait, but the options don't include magenta. So perhaps the absorbed light is blue or violet. Let's see:

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 530 nm, which is blue or violet.

But what color is absorbed? The dye is absorbing higher energy (shorter wavelength) light and emitting lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

So the color absorbed would be blue or violet. Wait, but which one?

Well, 2.3393 eV is about 530 nm, which is green. The absorbed photon would have higher energy, so let's see for blue (around 450 nm), which is higher energy than green.

Wait, let's compute the energy for blue. 450 nm is blue. E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (450e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.5e-7) ≈ 4.417e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.417e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.757 eV.

So blue light is about 2.757 eV. The emitted is 2.3393 eV, which is lower. So the absorbed photon is blue, higher energy than emitted. So the dye absorbs blue and emits green.

Wait, but the question is asking what color is absorbed. So the answer would be blue, option C.

Wait, but another possibility is violet. Violet is a shorter wavelength than blue, around 400 nm. Let me calculate its energy. 400 nm:

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (400e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (4e-7) = 4.9695e-19 J → 4.9695e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.10 eV.

So if the absorbed photon is violet, its energy is about 3.10 eV, which is higher than the emitted 2.3393 eV.

But how would we know whether the absorbed is blue or violet?

Well, the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy gaps (longer wavelengths absorbed). So the absorption would be at a longer wavelength than a less conjugated system.

But wait, in conjugated systems, the more conjugated the molecule, the lower the energy gap (because the pi orbitals are more delocalized, leading to smaller band gap), so the absorption would shift to longer wavelengths. So, for example, a molecule with more conjugation might absorb in the visible range, perhaps red or orange.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think: for conjugated systems, the more conjugated (longer conjugation), the lower the energy gap between HOMO and LUMO, which corresponds to longer wavelengths (lower energy) being absorbed.

So if a conjugated system is very long, the energy gap is small, so it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light. So in this case, the dye has an extensively conjugated system, so it would absorb lower energy (longer wavelength) light, like red.

Wait, but the emitted light is 2.3393 eV (green). So if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed higher energy (shorter wavelength) light, such as blue or violet.

Wait, but if the molecule is extensively conjugated, it would have a lower energy gap. So the energy difference between the states is smaller, so the absorbed photon is lower energy (longer wavelength). But that would mean the absorbed photon is, say, red or orange. But then the emitted photon would be higher energy? That doesn't make sense because when a molecule absorbs a photon, the energy of the emitted photon is usually lower than the absorbed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The energy of the emitted photon (E_emit) is equal to the energy difference between the initial and final states. So when a molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, it goes from ground state (E1) to excited state (E2), so E_abs = E2 - E1. Then, when it emits a photon, it goes from E2 to E1, emitting E_emit = E2 - E1. So E_abs = E_emit.

But that can't be right because then the absorbed and emitted would be the same, which would mean the molecule doesn't change color. So perhaps in reality, the molecule might have multiple excited states, leading to a lower energy emission.

Ah, right! In conjugated systems, the molecule can have multiple excited states. So when it absorbs a photon of higher energy (E_abs), it might transition to a higher energy state, but then relax to a lower energy excited state, emitting a photon of lower energy (E_emit = E2 - E3, where E3 < E2).

So, the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

So in the question, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The absorbed photon would be higher than that. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, shorter wavelength.

Which color is that? Let's calculate.

If the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed energy would be higher. Let's find the wavelength of the absorbed photon.

But without knowing the exact energy difference between E_abs and E_emit, I can't compute it exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the typical absorption and emission in conjugated systems.

Extensive conjugation usually leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. For example, carotenes have extensive conjugation and absorb in the visible range (red). So, if the dye has extensive conjugation, it would likely absorb in the red region.

Wait, but according to the question, the emitted light is green (530 nm, 2.3393 eV). So if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy (shorter wavelength, higher eV) photon. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is probably blue or violet.

Wait, but the conjugation makes the absorption red, which is lower energy. That would mean the emitted photon should have lower energy than the absorbed. But the question says the emitted is 2.3393 eV (green), which is higher than red (about 1.8-2 eV perhaps). So that doesn't add up.

Wait, maybe the conjugated dye absorbs in the blue or green. Let me think about another approach. Maybe I should find the complementary color.

The emitted color is green, so the absorbed would be magenta, which isn't an option. So the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the energy of the absorbed photon. Since the emitted is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher. So the absorbed color is higher energy (shorter wavelength) than 530 nm.

So, which of the options have higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

Let's compute the energy for each option.

Option A: Red light. Red is around 650 nm.

E = hc/λ → (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (650e-9) = (1.9878e-25) / (6.5e-7) ≈ 3.06e-19 J → 3.06e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 1.91 eV.

So red is about 1.91 eV. That's lower than 2.3393 eV, so red is lower energy than the emitted. But the absorbed should be higher energy than emitted. So red can't be the answer.

Option B: Violet. Let's take 400 nm.

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(400e-9) = 4.9695e-19 J → 3.10 eV. So violet is higher than 2.3393 eV. So violet could be the absorbed.

Option C: Blue, 450 nm.

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(450e-9) ≈ 4.417e-19 J → 2.757 eV. Higher than 2.3393 eV, so blue is also a candidate.

Option D: Yellow, around 570 nm.

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8)/(570e-9) → (1.9878e-25)/(5.7e-7) ≈ 3.487e-19 J → 2.176 eV. So yellow is lower than emitted. So not the answer.

So the options with higher energy than 2.3393 eV are violet (B) and blue (C).

The question is, which one is it?

Another point: the molecule has an extensively conjugated pi system. Extensive conjugation usually causes the energy gap to decrease, leading to longer wavelengths (lower energy) being absorbed. So the absorption would be at a longer wavelength, which would have lower energy than emission.

Wait, but that's conflicting. Because earlier, I thought that the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted. So if the conjugated system is extensive, the energy gap is smaller, leading to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So perhaps the absorbed photon is lower energy (longer wavelength) than the emitted, which would be opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, no. Let me think. The energy gap (E) is the difference between the ground state and the excited state. If E is small (extensive conjugation), then the photon absorbed has lower energy (longer wavelength). So the photon absorbed is lower energy than the emission photon? No, that can't be. Because emission occurs when the molecule relaxes from the excited state to a lower energy state, which is lower than the initial state. So the energy of the emitted photon is E_emit = E2 - E1, where E2 is the excited state and E1 is the ground state.

Wait, no, E1 is the ground state, which is lower than E2. So E_abs = E2 - E1, and when the molecule relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E2 - E1, which is the same as the absorbed. But that would mean the same energy, which doesn't make sense for color. Unless the molecule goes to a lower excited state, emitting a lower energy photon.

Wait, perhaps after absorbing a higher energy photon (E_abs), the molecule is in a higher energy state (E2), then emits a photon of lower energy (E_emit = E2 - E3), where E3 is another state lower than E2 but higher than E1.

So E_abs = E2 - E1, E_emit = E2 - E3.

Thus, E_abs > E_emit.

So if the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So, in the options, B and C are higher than 2.3393 eV.

Now, considering the conjugated system, which would have a lower energy gap (E_abs smaller?), but that's conflicting with the earlier conclusion.

Wait, but when a molecule has a larger conjugated system, the HOMO-LUMO gap decreases, so the energy required to excite the electron decreases. So the absorption occurs at a longer wavelength (lower energy). So the E_abs is lower in such a case.

But in our case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which implies the E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So if the molecule's HOMO-LUMO gap is E_abs = E_emit, then for extensive conjugation, E_abs decreases, so E_emit would decrease as well. But that's not the case here, because the question states that the emitted is 2.3393 eV.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of a simple example. Let's say a molecule has a HOMO-LUMO gap of 3 eV (E_abs=3 eV, wavelength ≈ 413 nm, which is violet). When it absorbs this violet photon, it gets excited. Then, when it relaxes, it might emit a photon of lower energy, say 2.3393 eV (green), because it transitions to a lower energy excited state, not all the way back to the ground state.

In that case, the absorbed photon is violet, and the emitted is green.

So according to this, the absorbed photon is violet (option B), and the emitted is green (2.3393 eV).

But wait, why would extensive conjugation affect this? Because extensive conjugation reduces the HOMO-LUMO gap, leading to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So in that case, the E_abs would be lower. For example, if E_abs was originally 3 eV (violet), with more conjugation, perhaps it shifts to 2.5 eV (blue). But in our case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV.

So if the HOMO-LUMO gap is 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon would be 2.3393 eV, but that's the same as the emitted.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that the emitted photon's energy is the same as the HOMO-LUMO gap. Maybe the emitted photon's energy is a smaller portion of the HOMO-LUMO gap.

Alternatively, perhaps the emitted photon's energy is not the same as the HOMO-LUMO gap. For example, the molecule could have multiple excited states. So it absorbs a higher energy photon, then emits a lower energy photon when it relaxes to a lower excited state.

So E_abs > E_emit.

So in the case of the question, the emitted is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed must be higher.

Now, the options with higher energy than 2.3393 eV are violet (3.10 eV) and blue (2.757 eV).

Now, which one is more likely for a conjugated system?

Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy (longer wavelength) absorption. So the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than a less conjugated system. So if a molecule with less conjugation absorbs at 400 nm (violet, 3.10 eV), then a more conjugated one would absorb at a longer wavelength, say 450 nm (blue, 2.757 eV).

So between the two options, blue is longer wavelength than violet, and thus has lower energy. So if the conjugated system is extensive, the absorption would be at a longer wavelength than a less conjugated system.

So with extensive conjugation, the absorption would be at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than a less conjugated system. But in our case, the emitted is 2.3393 eV (530 nm, green), so the absorbed must be higher energy than that.

But if the molecule's absorption is at blue (450 nm), which is higher energy than green, then that fits. So blue would be the absorbed color.

So the answer would be option C, blue.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the relationship between the energy of the emitted light and the absorbed light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength of approximately **530 nm** (calculated using the equation \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \)). This wavelength falls within the green region of the spectrum.

When a molecule absorbs light, it uses the energy to excite an electron from the ground state to a higher energy state. The energy of the absorbed photon is typically higher than the energy of the emitted photon because the molecule may transition to an intermediate excited state before emitting light. Thus, the absorbed photon must have an energy greater than **2.3393 eV**.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Red (650 nm)**: The energy of red light is approximately **1.91 eV**, which is lower than **2.3393 eV**. Since the absorbed photon must have higher energy than the emitted photon, red cannot be the absorbed color.

2. **Violet (400 nm)**: The energy of violet light is approximately **3.10 eV**, which is higher than **2.3393 eV**. This makes violet a plausible candidate for the absorbed color.

3. **Blue (450 nm)**: The energy of blue light is approximately **2.757 eV**, which is also higher than **2.3393 eV**. Blue is another plausible candidate for the absorbed color.

4. **Yellow (570 nm)**: The energy of yellow light is approximately **2.176 eV**, which is lower than **2.3393 eV**. Therefore, yellow cannot be the absorbed color.

### Final Consideration:
The question specifies that the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation typically reduces the HOMO-LUMO energy gap, shifting the absorption to longer wavelengths (lower energy). However, the emitted photon has an energy of **2.3393 eV** (green light), which implies that the absorbed photon must have higher energy (shorter wavelength). Between violet and blue, blue light (450 nm, **2.757 eV**) is more consistent with the expected absorption for a conjugated system compared to violet light (400 nm, **3.10 eV**), which is typically associated with smaller conjugated systems.

Thus, the absorbed color is **blue**.
