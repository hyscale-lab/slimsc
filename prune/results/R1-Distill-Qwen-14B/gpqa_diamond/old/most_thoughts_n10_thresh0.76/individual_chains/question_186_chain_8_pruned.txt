Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, I remember that the Cope rearrangement is a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, right? It usually involves 1,5-dienes. But wait, the molecule in question is (1S,4R)-2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me try to sketch the structure.

So, a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system. The substituents are at position 2: a vinyl group and an azabicyclo structure. Oh wait, 2-azabicyclo means there's a nitrogen in the bridge, right? So the structure has a bridge with nitrogen. And there's a double bond at position 5-ene.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl, so the vinyl group is attached to the second carbon. Also, it's 2-azabicyclo, so the nitrogen is at position 2 in the bicyclo system. So, the structure is a norbornene derivative with a vinyl substituent.

I think the Cope rearrangement typically applies to 1,5-dienes, which undergo a [3,3] shift. But wait, in this case, the molecule isn't a simple diene. It's a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. How does that fit into the Cope rearrangement?

Alternatively, I might be confusing the Cope with the Claisen rearrangement. No, Claisen is for allyl vinyl ethers. So back to Cope. Maybe the vinyl group is part of the rearrangement.

Let me think: The Cope rearrangement of 1,5-dienes gives another 1,5-diene as a product, but perhaps in a different ring structure. So, the starting molecule here has a bicyclic structure with a double bond, and a vinyl substituent. So perhaps the vinyl group is part of a conjugated diene system that can undergo the rearrangement.

Wait, the molecule is 2-vinyl-2-azabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene. So the bicyclo system has a double bond between carb
