Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, the question is asking about the energy at which the lifetime of a gamma-ray is limited by the process γγ → e+e-. I remember that the CMB has an average photon energy of 10^-3 eV. 

Wait, I think the process involves pair production. So gamma rays interacting with CMB photons can produce electron-positron pairs. I remember something about the threshold energy for this process. The threshold occurs when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to create the rest mass of the electron and positron.

Oh right! The rest mass energy of an electron (and positron) is 2 * m_e * c². The electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so 2 times that is 1.022 MeV. But wait, that's the center-of-mass energy required. So, when the two photons collide, their energies must sum to at least this to produce the pair.

Wait, but each photon has a certain energy. The CMB photons are at a much lower energy, around 1e-3 eV on average. So the gamma-ray photon must have enough energy that when it interacts with a CMB photon, their combined energy meets or exceeds the threshold.

But wait, for the process γγ → e+e-, the threshold condition is that the sum of the energies of the two photons in the center-of-mass frame is at least 2 m_e c². Alternatively,
