Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states with definite values.

Wait, the operator P is in an arbitrary direction, but the components P_x, P_y, P_z are given. Oh right, so the operator P along direction n would be the sum of the components multiplied by the direction cosines. Since n is in the x-z plane, the y-component should be zero. So n is along x and z. Let me think, n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) or wait, no, maybe (sinθ, 0, cosθ) since x-z plane, so polar coordinates might have theta from the z-axis. Or is it the other way? Wait, usually in quantum mechanics, the direction is given by angles θ from the z-axis and φ for the azimuthal angle. Since it's in the x-z plane, φ would be zero because it's along x and z, so φ is zero? Or maybe any phi, but the direction is in the x-z plane, which would have phi either 0 or pi, but perhaps it's arbitrary. Wait, no, the question says an arbitrary direction in x-z plane, so the direction is given by some angle θ from the z-axis and φ=0. So the direction vector n would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), or perhaps (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ)? Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify: in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero. So any direction in the x-z plane can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ), but since we're in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or pi/2? No, wait, phi is the angle around the z-axis. So for the x-z plane, the direction can have any phi, but the y-component is zero. So the direction vector n would have components (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So the operator P along n is given by P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Because the Y-component is zero since the direction is in the x-z plane. That makes sense.

So I need to construct the matrix for P. Let's write down the given matrices.

P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1], [1,0]]. So P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) * [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2)*[[1,0],[0,-1]].

So the operator P along n would be P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z. Let's compute that.

Let me compute each term. Let me call the direction vector's components as (a, 0, b), where a^2 + b^2 =1. So n_x = a, n_z = b.

Then,

P = a (ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + b (ħ/2)[[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let's factor out ħ/2:

P = (ħ/2) [ a * [[0,1],[1,0]] + b * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Multiplying those matrices:

The first matrix has a in each 0,1 and 1,0 element.

The second matrix has b in (1,1) and (2,2) positions.

So adding them:

[ [b, a],
  [a, -b] ]

So the matrix becomes:

P = (ħ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]]

Now, we're looking for eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

An eigenvector |v> satisfies P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So let's set up the equation.

Let |v> be a column vector [v1, v2]^T.

P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

So,

(ħ/2) * [ [b, a], [a, -b] ] * [v1; v2] = (ħ/2) [v1; v2]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2:

[ [b, a], [a, -b] ] [v1; v2] = [v1; v2]

So,

b v1 + a v2 = v1
a v1 - b v2 = v2

Let me write these equations:

Equation 1: (b - 1) v1 + a v2 = 0
Equation 2: a v1 + (-b -1) v2 = 0

So we have a homogeneous system of equations. To have non-trivial solutions, the determinant must be zero.

But perhaps it's easier to express in terms of ratios.

Let me consider equation 1:

(b-1) v1 + a v2 = 0 => (1 - b) v1 = a v2 => v2 = [(1 - b)/a] v1.

Similarly, equation 2:

a v1 + (-b -1) v2 =0.

Substitute v2 from equation 1 into equation 2.

a v1 + (-b -1) [(1 - b)/a] v1 = 0.

Factor v1:

v1 [ a + [ (-b -1)(1 - b) ) / a ] = 0.

Since v1 can't be zero (else v2 would also be zero, which is trivial), the term in brackets must be zero.

So,

a + [ (-b -1)(1 - b) ) / a ] = 0.

Multiply both sides by a:

a² + (-b -1)(1 - b) = 0.

Let me expand (-b-1)(1 - b):

= (-b)(1 - b) -1*(1 - b)
= -b + b² -1 + b
= (-b + b) + b² -1
= 0 + b² -1
= b² -1

So,

a² + (b² -1 ) =0 => a² + b² =1.

Which makes sense because a² + b² =1 (since n is a unit vector in x-z plane).

So the equations are consistent, and the eigenvectors are determined by the ratio v2 = (1 - b)/a * v1.

Let me set v1 =1 for simplicity, then v2 = (1 - b)/a.

But the eigenvector can be scaled by any non-zero scalar, so let's represent it as [1, (1 -b)/a ].

But wait, this is for the eigenvalue +ħ/2. What about the other eigenvalue? Oh, the other eigenvalue would be -ħ/2, and its eigenvector would satisfy a similar equation, but perhaps with a different sign.

Wait, but the problem asks for the eigenvector corresponding to +ħ/2. So proceeding.

So the eigenvector is [v1, v2] = [a, 1 - b], but multiplied by a scalar to make it non-dimensional. Wait, no: from equation 1, v2 = [(1 - b)/a] v1. So if I set v1 = a, then v2 = 1 -b. But that depends on a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of the spherical angles theta and phi.

Wait, since n is in the x-z plane, the direction can be represented with theta as the angle from the z-axis, and phi=0. So n_x = sin(theta), n_z = cos(theta). So a = sin(theta), b = cos(theta).

So substituting, (1 - b)/a = (1 - cos(theta)) / sin(theta).

Hmm, but that's a trigonometric identity. Let me compute it:

(1 - cos(theta)) = 2 sin²(theta/2)
sin(theta) = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

(1 - cos(theta))/sin(theta) = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ) 
= [sin(theta/2)] / [cos(theta/2)]
= tan(theta/2)

So (1 - b)/a = tan(theta/2) = t, say.

So the eig
