Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem is about an isolated system of particles. There are 13 identical particles, each with a charge of 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times that. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh, and the 13th charge is fixed at point P. I'm supposed to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you have charges in a system, the potential energy depends on their configuration. Since the system is isolated, the energy should be the potential energy between all the charges.

Wait, but the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the other 12 are all at 2m from P. So each of these 12 charges is 2 meters away from the 13th charge. But what about the potential energy between the 12 charges themselves? Because they are all 2 meters apart from P, but how far are they from each other?

Oh wait, the problem says the 12 are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. So their positions form a sphere of radius 2 meters. But how are they arranged around that sphere
