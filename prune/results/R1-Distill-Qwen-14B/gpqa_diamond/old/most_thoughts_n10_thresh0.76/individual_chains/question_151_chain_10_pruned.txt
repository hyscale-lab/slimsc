Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, so that's a vector in three-dimensional space. I think in quantum mechanics, these vectors represent the state vector of the system, right? And each component is the amplitude for a particular basis state.

The observable is represented by the matrix operator P. Let me write down what P looks like. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)). Third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So P is a 3x3 matrix.

The question is asking for the probability that measuring the observable P will yield 0 at time t. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes of a measurement of an observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P, and see which one corresponds to 0.

Wait, but maybe I don't need to find all the eigenvalues. Because the probability of measuring a particular eigenvalue is the square of the amplitude of the component of the state vector in the corresponding eigenvector direction. Alternatively, perhaps P is a projection operator, and the eigenvalues are 0 and 1. Because I notice that all the diagonal elements of P are zero except possibly if any, but wait, the diagonal entries are 0, 0, 0? Let me check the matrix again.

Wait, no. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], second [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], third [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So the diagonal elements are all zero. Hmm, that's interesting. So P is a matrix where the diagonal is zero, and the off-diagonals are 1/sqrt(2) in some places.

Wait, maybe P is a Hermitian matrix because it's an observable. Let me check if P is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of P should be equal to P. All the elements are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let me see the transpose of P.

Original P:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Transposing P would swap rows and columns. So the columns become rows.

Transposed P:
Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Which is the same as the original P. So yes, P is Hermitian, which makes sense because observables are represented by Hermitian operators. So the eigenvalues will be real.

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, perhaps I can find its eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me write down the matrix (P - λI), which is:

Row 1: [-λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0]
Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2)]
Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ]

The determinant of this matrix should be zero.

Calculating the determinant:

| -λ       1/√2      0     |
| 1/√2    -λ       1/√2  |
| 0       1/√2    -λ     |

This looks a bit tricky, but maybe I can expand it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by other means, like noting any patterns or symmetries.

Wait, I notice that the matrix P has some symmetry. Let me think: each row has a similar structure. Maybe there are eigenvectors that are symmetric in some way.

For example, perhaps the vector (1,1,1) is an eigenvector. Let me test this.

Let me compute P multiplied by the vector (1,1,1)^T.

P * (1,1,1)^T:

First component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 = 1/sqrt(2)
Second component: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2)
Third component: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0*1 = 1/sqrt(2)

Hmm, so P*(1,1,1) = (1/sqrt(2), sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2))^T. Is this a scalar multiple of (1,1,1)? Let's see.

Let me see if each component is equal to some λ times 1.

First component: 1/sqrt(2) = λ *1 → λ=1/sqrt(2)

Second component: sqrt(2) = λ *1 → λ= sqrt(2)

Third component: 1/sqrt(2) → same as first.

But these are conflicting. So (1,1,1) is not an eigenvector. Hmm.

Maybe another approach. Let's consider the sum of all rows. Each row sums to zero except when the middle element is zero. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the sum of all rows: first row sum is 0 + 1/sqrt(2) + 0 = 1/sqrt(2). Second row sum is 1/sqrt(2) + 0 + 1/sqrt(2) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2). Third row sum is 0 +1/sqrt(2) +0 =1/sqrt(2).

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can look for eigenvectors where all components are the same, but I don't think that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps some symmetries.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the trace of the matrix. The trace of P is the sum of the diagonals, which are all zero. So the trace is zero, which means the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.

Also, the determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. So let's calculate the determinant of P.

Wait, but the determinant of P is the same as the determinant of (P - λI) evaluated at λ=0. So the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the determinant of P. Let me try.

The matrix P is:

0       1/√2      0
1/√2    0       1/√2
0       1/√2     0

So the determinant is:

0*(0*0 - 1/√2 *1/√2) - (1/√2)*(1/√2 *0 -1/√2 *0) + 0*(1/√2 *1/√2 - 0*0)

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me expand along the first row.

The determinant is:

0 * minor_11 - (1/√2) * minor_12 + 0 * minor_13.

Minor_12 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

Which is:
Row 2 and 3, columns 1 and 3.

So elements are 1/√2, 1/√2 in row 2, and 0, 0 in row 3.

Wait, no: when we remove column 2, the remaining columns are 1 and 3.

So row 2 becomes 1/√2 (column 1) and 1/√2 (column 3). Row 3 becomes 0 and
