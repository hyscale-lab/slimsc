Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. So, cyclohexane ring with substituents. The numbering... cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid means the ring has a double bond at position 3 (between carbons 3 and 4) and a carboxylic acid group probably at position 1, since it's the first in the name. Wait, no, the numbering might be different. Let me think. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Oh, wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the formyl group is at 2, and the vinyl group is at 5. Right.

So the structure has a cyclohexene ring (double bond at 3), a formyl group (-CHO) at position 2, a vinyl group (-CH2CH2?) Wait, no. Vinyl is a CH2CH2 group, but attached where? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the substituent at position 5 is CH2-CH2? No, wait, no. Vinyl is -CH2-CH2- with a double bond. Wait, no, wait. Vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So position 5 has a CH2-CH2 group with a double bond? Hmm, maybe I should sketch this mentally.

So the cyclohexane ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. Position 1 is the carboxylic acid (-COOH). Position 2 is a formyl group (-CHO). Position 5 is a vinyl group, which is CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in the substituent. Wait, no. Wait, vinyl is a substituent where a carbon is attached to a CH2-CH2 group, but that's not right. Wait, the vinyl
