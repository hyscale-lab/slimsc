Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the question says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right, so the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation. Oh yeah, time dilation is part of special relativity. The lifetime observed (τ) is longer than the proper lifetime by the gamma factor, which depends on the velocity of the particle.

Gamma (γ) is equal to the total energy divided by the rest mass energy. So, γ = E / m. Here, E is given as 27 GeV, and m is 3.41 GeV. Let me calculate that. 

So, gamma = 27 / 3.41. Let's compute that. 27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. So gamma is about 7.917. 

Now, the observed lifetime τ = γ * τ₀. So τ = 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me calculate that. 

7.917 * 8 is about 63.336, so τ ≈ 63.336e-16 s, which is 6.3336e-15 s.

Wait, but the problem is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. I'm a bit confused here. Oh, right, when you have a certain resolution in the detector, it's the ability to distinguish the decay points. The decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying.

So, the decay length L is the velocity of the particle multiplied by the lifetime, and that's the distance it travels. But wait, in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer, so L = v * τ.

But wait, another approach: The mean
