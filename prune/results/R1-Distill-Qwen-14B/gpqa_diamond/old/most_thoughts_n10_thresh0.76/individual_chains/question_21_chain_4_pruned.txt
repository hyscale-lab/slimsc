Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down. The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers, and then two parts about tautomerism and optical isomerism.

The first part (A) asks which compound doesn't show tautomerism. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Wait, I remember that tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen and the shift of a double bond. So for tautomerism to occur, the compound needs to have adjacent atoms with hydrogen that can move. Like in keto-enol tautomerism, which requires a carbonyl group and an adjacent hydrogen.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups. Quinones are aromatic, so the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other (like in para positions). So, structure-wise, it's O=C6H4=O. But wait, actually, benzoquinone can have two double bonds. Hmm, but does it have any alpha hydrogens? Because without alpha hydrogens, keto-enol tautomerism isn't possible. 

Wait, benzoquinone (para-benzoquinone) has the structure O=C6H4=O. The carbonyl groups are in the 1 and 4 positions of the benzene ring. So each carbonyl group is at the end of a double bond. Do the carbonyls have any adjacent hydrogens? Let me think. Each carbonyl is attached to the benzene ring, which is a conjugated system. The carbonyl carbon (C=O) is attached to two ring carbons. So the alpha carbons (the ones adjacent to carbonyl) are the ring carbons. Do those have hydrogens? In benzene, each carbon has one hydrogen when it's part of the ring, but wait, in quinone, two of the ring positions are carbonyls. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are the ones next to them on the ring. Those are each attached to two other ring carbons and a hydrogen. So, for example, in para-benzoquinone, each carbonyl is at 1 and 4. The carbons at 2 and 3 would each be adjacent to the 1 and 4 carbonyls. Wait, no, actually, in benzene, each carbon is connected to two others. So the carbonyl is at positions 1 and 4. The adjacent carbons are 2 and 6 for 1, and 3 and 5 for 4. So each of these would have a hydrogen attached. 

Wait, so does this mean that the alpha positions (the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl) have hydrogens? Because if they do, then the molecule can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. Let me think. For enol tautomerism, the molecule needs an alpha hydrogen. So benzoquinoneâ€”do the carbonyl carbons have alpha hydrogens?

Wait, no, the carbonyl is part of the ring. So each carbonyl group is O=C-R, where R is a benzene ring. The carbons next to the carbonyl are part of the ring
