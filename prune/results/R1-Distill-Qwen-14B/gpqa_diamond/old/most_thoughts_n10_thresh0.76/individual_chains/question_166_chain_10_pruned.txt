Okay, so I have this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 through radiative corrections. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The Lagrangian is given, and the fields involved include singlet fermions NR, a scalar doublet S, and a singlet scalar φ. The vacuum expectation values (VEVs) are given as ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², so ⟨φ⟩ is x and ⟨S⟩ is v. Wait, no, wait. The user wrote ⟨h⟩ = v. Oh, but in the problem, the fields have different VEVs. Let me parse that again: ⟨φ⟩² = x² + v², so the VEV of φ is x, and the VEV of h is v. Or wait, is h a part of the scalar fields here? Let me see. The Lagrangian includes S, which is a scalar doublet, and φ, a singlet. So in the model, perhaps the Higgs field is a combination of these. Or maybe the Higgs is part of S? Wait, the problem says S is a scalar doublet. In the Standard Model, the Higgs is usually a doublet, so perhaps S is the Higgs field here. But the notation is a bit confusing because the problem mentions H as a pseudo-Goldstone.

Wait, the question is about the mass of H2, which is a pseudo-Goldstone boson. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons come from spontaneous symmetry breaking when a symmetry is broken, but there's a discrete symmetry to prevent the mass from getting a large value. So, if the symmetry is broken, the Goldstone bosons (would be massless) but sometimes one of them can get a mass, like the Higgs in the SM, but others become pseudo-Goldstones.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a doublet with hypercharge Y=1/2. When it gets a VEV, the three Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z bosons, and the remaining is the Higgs boson. But in this model, perhaps the situation is extended. The scalar fields here are S (a doublet) and φ (a singlet). The VEV of φ is x, and S has a VEV v. So maybe the symmetry breaking is a two-step process. Alternatively, perhaps the model has multiple Higgs fields, and the potential V(φ, S, H) leads to symmetry breaking.

The question is about the pseudo-Goldstone boson H2 and its mass via radiative corrections. So I need to think about how radiative corrections affect the mass of such a boson.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs mass receives quantum corrections through loops. The main contributions come from top quarks because of their large mass, and also from W, Z, Higgs itself, etc. The corrections are typically proportional to the
