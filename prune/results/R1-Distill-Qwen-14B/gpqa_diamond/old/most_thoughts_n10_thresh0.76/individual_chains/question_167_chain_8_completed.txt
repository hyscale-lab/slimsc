Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

The state given is |ψ> = [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α> ] / N. Oh right, and N is the normalization constant. The normalization factor N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)). 

The question asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) when φ is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. The relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix and rho is the non-Gaussian state's.

Wait, I remember that Gaussian states are states like coherent states, squeezed states, etc. The Schrödinger cat state, on the other hand, is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. So it's definitely a non-Gaussian state. The non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian the state is.

But how do I compute this? Let's break it down step by step.

First, I think I need to write down the density matrix rho for the given state |ψ>. The state is a superposition, so rho is |ψ><ψ|. Let me compute that.

The state |ψ> is [cos(φ)|α> + sin(φ)|-α> ] / N. So rho is (1/N²) [ cos²(φ)|α><α| + cos(φ) sin(φ) |α><-α| + sin(phi) cos(phi) |−α><α| + sin²(phi) |−α><−α| ].

Wait, but N is given as sqrt(1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²)), so N squared is 1 + sin(2φ) exp(-2α²). So maybe I'll need to calculate N when φ is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5.

Let me compute sin(2φ) when phi is -pi/4. 2*(-pi/4) is -pi/2, and sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) = -1. Then exp(-2α²) with alpha=0.5: alpha squared is 0.25, so 2*0.25 is 0.5. exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. So the N² becomes 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935? Or wait, wait: 1 + sin(2φ) * exp(...). So sin(2φ) is -1; so 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6274.

Hmm, but for the density matrix, I think I can proceed generally. Let me think about the structure of rho. It's a mixed state of |α><α|, |α><-α|, and |-α><-α|. The cross terms are |α><-α| and vice versa.

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau is probably the closest Gaussian state to rho. I think in the context of non-Gaussianity measures, the reference Gaussian state is often the one that minimizes the relative entropy. For a state that's a superposition of two coherent states, the reference Gaussian state might be a statistical mixture of the two coherent states. Because if the state were just |α><α|, it's a Gaussian state, but our state is a superposition, so the closest Gaussian would be a probabilistic mixture.

Wait, so the reference state tau could be the state with the same first and second moments as rho but is Gaussian. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the state that's the completely mixed state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for a state that's a superposition, the minimal relative entropy Gaussian state would be a probabilistic mixture of the two coherent states. Let me think: the state rho can be written as a probabilistic mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha> states, with probabilities cos^2(phi) and sin^2(phi), respectively, but scaled by N^2, which may not be 1.

Wait no, wait: |ψ> is ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. So rho is (1/N^2) [ cos^2(phi)|alpha><alpha| + sin^2(phi)|-alpha><-alpha| + cos(phi) sin(phi) (|alpha><-alpha| + |−alpha><alpha|) ].

So if I consider the probabilities, the state is a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with probabilities |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2. But wait, because N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}), the probabilities would be [cos^2(phi)] / N^2 and [sin^2(phi)] / N^2. So the probabilities are p1 = cos^2(phi)/(1 + sin(2phi) e^{-2 alpha^2}) and p2 = sin^2(phi)/(1 + same term).

Now, the reference Gaussian state tau would be a classical mixture of |alpha><alpha| and |-alpha><-alpha|, with the same probabilities as in rho. Because that's the Gaussian state closest to rho in terms of relative entropy. Because, the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state would be minimized when tau is the mixture of the same states but without the coherences.

So tau would be p1 |alpha><alpha| + p2 |-alpha><-alpha|.

Then, the relative entropy del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy, S = - Tr(rho ln rho). Alternatively, perhaps it's the relative entropy between rho and tau, which would be S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). Wait, but the question says del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). Hmm, that's a bit different from the usual relative entropy.

Wait, the relative entropy is usually S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in the question, the user says it's [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). So it's the difference between the entropy of rho and the entropy of tau. That's a bit different from the usual relative entropy, but perhaps that's what they're using here.

So, to compute del_b, we need to compute S(rho) and S(tau), then subtract.

Let me think about how to compute these entropies.

First, let's compute S(tau). Since tau is a mixture of two pure states, its entropy is the Shannon entropy of the probabilities p1 and p2. Because von Neumann entropy for a classical mixture is just Shannon entropy. So S(tau) = - p1 ln p1 - p2 ln p2.

Now, what about rho? rho is a superposition, so it's a pure state if N is 1. But wait, N is sqrt(...) which is not 1 in general. Wait, wait, no: because the state is a superposition of two different coherent states, and the coefficients involve cos(phi) and sin(phi), but normalized by N. So rho is a mixed state only when the two terms are orthogonal, but wait, coherent states are not orthogonal. Wait, no. The state |psi> is a normalized state, so rho is a pure state? Because it's |psi><psi|, so rho is a pure state, hence its von Neumann entropy is zero. Wait, wait a minute, that doesn't make sense. Oh, because |psi> is a pure state, so rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. But wait, that can't be, because in the question, del_b is S(rho) - S(tau), which would be negative. But looking at the options, the answer could be zero. Hmm, but wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are themselves pure states. But when you write |psi> as a superposition of two different coherent states, the state |psi> is a pure state because it's a single ket vector. Therefore, rho = |psi><psi| is a pure state, so the entropy S(rho) is zero. But tau is a mixed state of two coherent states, so its entropy S(tau) is non-zero. So the del_b would be 0 - S(tau), which is negative. But the options are positive. Hmm, that suggests I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says that the relative entropy measure is del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau). But if rho is a pure state, S(rho) is zero. So del_b = - S(tau), which is negative. But the options are positive. That can't be right. So I must have misunderstood the definition.

Wait another thought: perhaps the relative entropy measure is the other way around. Like, maybe it's S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive. Because if rho is non-Gaussian, its entropy might be higher or lower than the Gaussian state. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the question measures the non-Gaussianity as the relative entropy of the non-Gaussian state with respect to the Gaussian one, which would be S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). So that would be positive.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the relative entropy is given as del_b = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau). So it's S(rho) - S(tau). So if S(rho) is zero (since rho is pure), then del_b = - S(tau). But this would give a negative number, which is not among the options. So either I'm making a mistake, or perhaps I'm thinking about the states incorrectly.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong about rho being a pure state. Let me compute rho again. The state |psi> is a normalized state, so rho is a pure state. So S(rho) is zero. So that would mean del_b is negative S(tau). But the options are positive. So perhaps the question actually defines del_b as S(tau) - S(rho), which would be S(tau) in this case. Or perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the state |psi> is a mixture, not a pure state. No, the state is given as a single ket vector, so rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state.

Hmm, this is confusing. So maybe I'm supposed to consider that rho is mixed because the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which are not orthogonal. Wait, but no, the state is normalized, so rho is pure. So why then would the del_b be positive?

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the structure of rho and tau. Let me think again. The state rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. The reference state tau is a Gaussian state, which in this case is a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, so S(tau) is the Shannon entropy of p1 and p2.

So del_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But the options are positive, so maybe I have the sign wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as S(tau) - S(rho), which is S(tau). So the non-Gaussianity would be S(tau).

Wait, but the problem statement defines del_b as [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)}]. That is, S(rho) - S(tau). So if S(rho) is zero, del_b is negative.

But the options are positive, so perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again about the state.

Wait, maybe the state |psi> isn't a pure state in this context. No, the way it's written, it's a single vector, so it's a pure state. So rho is pure, so its entropy is zero. Hence, del_b is negative. But the options are positive, which suggests that perhaps the definition is S(tau) - S(rho) instead.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the von Neumann entropy of rho, which is zero, and the relative entropy is compared to a different Gaussian state. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho, perhaps a squeezed state or something else. But I'm not familiar enough with the exact form of such a state.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is quantified as the relative entropy between tau and rho. But that would be Tr(tau ln tau) - Tr(rho ln rho), which would be S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). 

Wait, but the question says it's rho and tau, so it's the relative entropy between rho and tau. Let me think again: relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(rho, tau), which is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But in this case, the problem defines del_b as [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). So, if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero, so del_b = - S(tau). But the options are positive.

Hmm. Maybe I should proceed and compute S(tau) and see what the options are.

So, let's compute p1 and p2. From the given phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

First, compute N:

phi = -pi/4. So 2phi = -pi/2. So sin(2phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha = 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. So 2 alpha squared is 0.5. So exp(-2 alpha²) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N² = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6274.

Now, cos(phi) is cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So cos²(phi) is (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5. Similarly, sin²(phi) is also 0.5.

So p1 = cos²(phi)/N² = (0.5) / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. Wait, wait, that can't be right because probabilities can't exceed 1. Oh wait no, wait N² is 0.3935, so 0.5 / 0.3935 is approximately 1.27. But that's a probability greater than 1, which is impossible. That can't be right.

Wait, that suggests I made a mistake in computing N². Let me recheck.

N² is 1 + sin(2phi) * exp(-2 alpha²). So sin(2phi) is -1, exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=exp(-0.5)≈0.6065.

So N² = 1 + (-1)(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. Correct.

So p1 = cos²(phi) / N² = 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. But that's impossible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So what's wrong here?

Wait, because phi is -pi/4, so cos(phi) is positive, but sin(phi) is negative. So when I compute p1 and p2, I might need to take the modulus squared. Wait, but cos(phi) is real, so cos²(phi) is positive. So p1 = 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.27, which is greater than 1. That can't be right.

Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the N expression.

Wait, the normalization N is given as N = sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). Wait, is that correct? Because for a state |psi> = a |alpha> + b |-alpha>, the norm is |a|² + |b|² + 2 Re(ab^* ) <alpha | -alpha> }.

Wait, because |a|^2 ||alpha>||² + |b|^2 ||-alpha>||² + a b^* <alpha| -alpha> + a^* b <−alpha|alpha>.

Wait, but coherent states |alpha> and |-alpha> have inner product <alpha | - alpha> = exp( - |alpha|² - |alpha|^2 ) exp( 2i Im(alpha^2) ) )? Wait, no. Wait, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. The inner product <alpha | beta> = exp( - (|alpha|^2 + |beta|^2)/2 + alpha* beta ). So <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - (|alpha|² + |alpha|²)/2 + (alpha)* (-alpha) ) = exp( - alpha² + (-|alpha|^2) ). Wait, alpha is a real number here? Or is it a complex amplitude?

Wait, in the problem, alpha is the amplitude. It's given as alpha=0.5, which is a real number. So alpha is real. So <alpha | -alpha> = exp( - (alpha² + alpha²)/2 + alpha*(-alpha) ) = exp( - alpha² + (- alpha^2) ) = exp( -2 alpha² ) * exp( - alpha² )? Wait, no.

Wait, let me compute this correctly.

The inner product <alpha | beta> = exp( -( |alpha|^2 + |beta|^2 ) / 2 + alpha^* beta ).

In this case, beta is -alpha, which is a real number, so beta = -alpha.

So <alpha | -alpha> = exp( -( alpha² + alpha² ) / 2 + alpha * (-alpha) )

= exp( -( alpha² ) + (- alpha² ) )

= exp( - 2 alpha² )

Wait, so the inner product is exp( -2 alpha^2 ). 

So, the norm squared of |psi> is |cos(phi)|^2 ||alpha>||^2 + |sin(phi)|^2 ||-alpha>||^2 + cos(phi) sin(phi) [ <alpha| -alpha> + < -alpha | alpha> ].

But wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are normalized, so ||alpha>|| = 1, same for |-alpha>.

The cross term is 2 Re( cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha | -alpha> )

Which is 2 Re( cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2) )

Since alpha is real, exp(-2 alpha^2) is real and positive. So cross term is 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )

Putting it all together:

N² = cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )

But cos²(phi) + sin²(phi) =1. So N² = 1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )

Wait, 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) is sin(2 phi). So N² = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )

Which matches the given expression for N².

So now, with phi = -pi/4, 2 phi is -pi/2, sin(2 phi) is -1. So N² = 1 + (-1) exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6274.

Now, the probabilities p1 and p2 are:

p1 = |cos(phi)|^2 / N² = (sqrt(2)/2)^2 / 0.3935 = (0.5) / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. 

Wait, that's greater than 1. That can't be possible because probabilities can't exceed 1. So something must be wrong here.

Wait, no, wait. Because the state is |psi> = ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. So the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), but N is not 1, it's sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )).

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So the state is [0.7071 |alpha> - 0.7071 |-alpha> ] / N.

But with N being approx 0.6274.

So when I compute the density matrix rho, it's |psi><psi|, which is (0.7071 |alpha> -0.7071 |-alpha> ) / N times ( <alpha| 0.7071* - < -alpha| 0.7071 )

So expanding:

rho = [ (0.7071)^2 |alpha><alpha| + (0.7071)^2 |-alpha><-alpha| + (0.7071)^2 ( - |alpha><-alpha| - |-alpha><alpha| ) ] / N².

Wait, but N² is 0.3935.

So p1 = (0.7071^2) / 0.3935 ≈ 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. Again, same problem.

Wait, that can't be right. How can a probability be greater than 1?

Ah! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake. Because cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, but when you square it, it's (sqrt(2)/2)^2 = 0.5. So |cos(phi)|^2 / N² is 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. That's impossible.

So perhaps the initial assumption that the state is correctly normalized is flawed? Or perhaps the problem setup is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is written as ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) without the normalization? But no, the problem statement includes N.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a modulus somewhere. Because in the state, the coefficients are cos(phi) and sin(phi), which are real numbers, so their products are straightforward. But perhaps in the general case, the coefficients could be complex, but in this specific case, phi is real, so cos(phi) and sin(phi) are real.

Wait, but if p1 is 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.27, which is more than 1, that's impossible. So that suggests that my calculation is wrong.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cross terms are being miscalculated. Let me think again about the normalization.

Wait, the norm of |psi> is N. So the state |psi> is ( cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N.

So when I compute the norm squared:

|cos(phi)|^2 + |sin(phi)|^2 + 2 Re( cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha> )

= 1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) <alpha| -alpha>.

But <alpha| -alpha> = exp( -2 alpha^2 ), as we determined earlier.

So the norm squared is 1 + 2 cos(phi) sin(phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 ) = 1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2 )

Which is correct, because N is the square root of that.

So in our case, phi = -pi/4.

So sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

exp(-2 alpha^2) with alpha=0.5 is exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N² = 1 + (-1)*0.6065 = 0.3935.

So that's correct.

So when we compute p1 = |cos(phi)|^2 / N² = (0.5) / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270. Which is still greater than 1. That can't be.

But that's impossible because probabilities can't be greater than 1. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the state.

Wait, perhaps the state is not a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, but a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each scaled by something else. Or perhaps the state is written as (|alpha> + exp(i phi) | -alpha> ) / N. Because that would make the coefficients complex, leading to different terms.

Wait, in the problem statement, the state is written as ( cos(phi) |alpha> + sin(phi) |-alpha> ) / N. So the coefficients are real. So when I compute the probabilities, it's (0.5) / 0.3935, which is larger than 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a modulus. Because if the coefficients are real, then |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2 are correct.

But in this case, the probability p1 is 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270, which is impossible. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait a second. N is sqrt(0.3935), which is approximately 0.6274. So |psi> is (0.7071 |alpha> -0.7071 |-alpha> ) / 0.6274.

But when I compute the density matrix, the terms are:

rho = [0.7071 |alpha> -0.7071 |-alpha> ] [0.7071 <alpha| -0.7071 <-alpha| ] / (0.6274)^2.

So rho = [ (0.7071)^2 |alpha><alpha| + (0.7071)^2 |-alpha><-alpha| - (0.7071)^2 ( |alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) ] / (0.6274^2).

Which is [0.5 |alpha><alpha| + 0.5 |-alpha><-alpha| - 0.5 (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) ] / 0.3935.

Wait, so the terms are 0.5, 0.5, and -0.5 each.

But when I divide by N^2 (0.3935), the coefficients become:

(0.5 / 0.3935) |alpha><alpha| + same for |-alpha>, and (-0.5 / 0.3935) for the cross terms.

So 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270, which can't be correct because that's a probability greater than 1.

Wait, this suggests that the state as given is not correctly normalized, but that can't be because the problem statement provides N as the normalization constant.

So perhaps the conclusion is that the state is actually a mixed state, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps the state is a superposition only when phi is not zero, but in this case, for phi = -pi/4, the state is a superposition that leads to a probability p1 greater than 1, which is impossible.

But this is a problem because it's given in the question. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, when phi is -pi/4, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2, and cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2.

So cos(phi) is positive, sin(phi) is negative.

So the state is [ (sqrt(2)/2) |alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/2) |-alpha> ] / N.

So when I compute the density matrix, the diagonal terms would be (sqrt(2)/2)^2 (|alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N², and the cross terms would be (sqrt(2)/2)^2 ( - |alpha><-alpha| - |-alpha><alpha| ) / N².

So the diagonal terms are (0.5) ( |alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ) / N².

The cross terms are (0.5) ( - |alpha><-alpha| - |-alpha><alpha| ) / N².

So when I compute rho, it's:

rho = [ 0.5 ( |alpha><alpha| + |-alpha><-alpha| ) - 0.5 (|alpha><-alpha| + |-alpha><alpha| ) ] / N².

So the diagonal elements are each 0.5 / N², and the cross terms are -0.5 / N².

So when N² is 0.3935, the diagonal elements are 0.5 / 0.3935 ≈ 1.270, which again is impossible.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Maybe the state is not written as a superposition but as a tensor product or something else. Or perhaps the problem has a typo.

But given that the options are provided, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation under the assumption that p1 and p2 are [cos^2(phi)] / N² and [sin^2(phi)] / N², even if they exceed 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when the state is written as a superposition, the probabilities are |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2, but divided by N².

Wait, no, that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is such that when p1 and p2 are greater than 1, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that's just a guess.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 0. So maybe when p1 and p2 are not valid probabilities (i.e., greater than 1), the state is actually Gaussian, making nG=0.

But why would that be? If the state is a superposition of two coherent states, it's non-Gaussian, regardless of the values of phi and alpha.

Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe the non-Gaussianity is zero only when the state is Gaussian. Otherwise, it's non-zero.

Wait, but when would a Schrödinger cat state be Gaussian? Only when it's a coherent state, perhaps. But a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian.

So this suggests that the non-Gaussianity should be positive. But according to my earlier calculation, del_b is negative, which is not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps del_b is the other way around. Maybe it's S(tau) - S(rho). Since S(rho) is zero, del_b would be S(tau), which is the entropy of the mixture.

But in that case, let's compute S(tau).

S(tau) is the Shannon entropy of p1 and p2, where p1 = 0.5/0.3935 ≈ 1.270, which is impossible. So perhaps the Gaussian state in this case can't be a mixture of the two coherent states because the probabilities are not valid.

Wait, perhaps the Gaussian state is not a mixture but something else, like a thermal state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state with the same first and second moments as rho, but is Gaussian.

But to compute that, I'd need to find the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as rho. The first moment is <a> = Tr(a rho), where a is the annihilation operator.

The second moment is <a²> = Tr(a^2 rho).

But wait, since rho is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, the expectation values might be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the first and second moments for rho and then find a Gaussian state with the same moments.

But I'm not sure how to proceed without more detailed calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps given the time constraints, I should look for the correct approach.

Wait, another thought: the relative entropy between rho and tau is computed as S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But since rho is pure, S(rho) = 0, and this becomes - Tr(rho ln tau).

But I'm not sure how to compute that.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero when the state is Gaussian. So perhaps for some parameters, the state becomes Gaussian. For example, if the cross terms in rho vanish, then rho would be a mixture of |alpha> and |-alpha>, making it Gaussian. So when would the cross terms vanish?

The cross terms in rho are proportional to [ cos(phi) sin(phi) (|alpha><-alpha| + |−alpha><alpha| ) ] / N².

So if phi is zero, the cross terms vanish, so rho is a mixture of |alpha> and |alpha>, which is just |alpha>, making it Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, the state would be |-alpha>, also Gaussian.

So in those cases, the non-Gaussianity would be zero. But for other phi values, it's non-zero.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, so non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Looking at the options, option C is 1.38, which is a positive number. But earlier calculations suggested that the probabilities are invalid, which might imply that the state is actually Gaussian. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero only when the state is Gaussian. Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, it's non-Gaussian, except when the two coherent states are the same, i.e., when alpha=0 or phi=0.

But in our case, phi is -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, so it's a non-Gaussian state, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

So perhaps the correct answer is option C, 1.38.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that when the cross terms in rho are non-zero, the non-Gaussianity is non-zero, and when they are zero, it's zero. So for phi = -pi/4, non-zero, so the non-Gaussianity is non-zero.

But without doing the precise calculation, it's hard to be certain. However, based on the options, and the fact that the problem gives a specific setup, I think the answer is option C, 1.38.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \(N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)}\). The relative entropy measure is given as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Analysis:
1. **State Normalization**:  
   The normalization constant \(N\) is computed as:
   \[
   N^2 = 1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2).
   \]
   For \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\):
   - \(\sin(2\phi) = \sin(-\pi/2) = -1\),
   - \(\exp(-2\alpha^2) = \exp(-0.5) \approx 0.6065\),
   - \(N^2 = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935\), so \(N \approx \sqrt{0.3935} \approx 0.6274\).

2. **Density Matrix \(\rho\)**:  
   The state \(|\psi\rangle\) is a superposition of two coherent states, so \(\rho = |\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\). Expanding this, \(\rho\) contains terms proportional to \(| \alpha \rangle \langle \alpha |\), \(| -\alpha \rangle \langle -\alpha |\), and cross terms \(| \alpha \rangle \langle -\alpha | + | -\alpha \rangle \langle \alpha |\). The probabilities associated with the coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\) are:
   \[
   p_1 = \frac{\cos^2(\phi)}{N^2}, \quad p_2 = \frac{\sin^2(\phi)}{N^2}.
   \]
   For \(\phi = -\pi/4\), \(\cos^2(\phi) = \sin^2(\phi) = 0.5\), so:
   \[
   p_1 = p_2 = \frac{0.5}{0.3935} \approx 1.270.
   \]
   These probabilities exceed 1, which is unphysical. This suggests an issue with interpreting the state as a classical mixture of two coherent states.

3. **Reference Gaussian State \(\tau\)**:  
   The reference Gaussian state \(\tau\) is typically the closest Gaussian state to \(\rho\), often a classical mixture of the same two coherent states with probabilities \(p_1\) and \(p_2\). The von Neumann entropy of \(\tau\) is the Shannon entropy:
   \[
   S(\tau) = -p_1 \ln p_1 - p_2 \ln p_2.
   \]
   However, since \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) exceed 1, this calculation is invalid, indicating that the state may not be a classical mixture in this case.

4. **Non-Gaussianity Calculation**:  
   The non-Gaussianity is defined as \(\text{del}_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau)\). Since \(\rho\) is a pure state (\(|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\)), \(S(\rho) = 0\). Thus, \(\text{del}_b = -S(\tau)\). However, \(S(\tau)\) cannot be computed due to the unphysical probabilities \(p_1\) and \(p_2\).

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The state is a superposition of two coherent states, making it non-Gaussian. The non-Gaussianity should be positive, as the state deviates from Gaussianity. Among the options, \(1.38\) is the most plausible value for the non-Gaussianity.
