Okay, so I've got this question about whether certain stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph when coupled with a VLT telescope. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. It's mounted on the VLT, which is a big telescope, so it should be able to detect pretty faint stars, right? But I need to figure out the specific conditions here.

The question says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I think I need to calculate or compare the expected S/N for each star option and see which ones meet this condition.

Wait, but how do I find the S/N? I recall that the S/N ratio depends on factors like the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, and the spectrograph's efficiency. Oh and the formula I think is S/N = (flux) * sqrt(exposure time) / noise. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the concept that S/N increases with the square root of the exposure time and the square root of the area of the telescope. But I'm not confident about the exact formula.

Wait, the absolute magnitude is given for some stars. Absolute magnitude is how bright a star would appear at 10 parsecs away. So I need to calculate the apparent magnitude (m) for each star, then use that to find the flux, and then compute S/N.

Let me list the stars:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) V=15 mag, 10 pc
d) V=15, 200 pc
e) V=15, 5 pc
f) V=15, 50 pc

Wait, for Canopus and Polaris, I don't know their distances. So I need to find their apparent magnitudes.

I remember that Canopus is a very bright star. It's the second brightest star in the sky, I think. So its apparent magnitude is about -0.7 or something? Or wait, I thought Sirius is the brightest at around -1.46, and Canopus is next at maybe -0.7? I'm not sure about the exact number, but I know it's very bright, so m is low (negative).

Polaris, on the other hand, is a star in the northern sky, the North Star. I think it's not as bright as Canopus. I've heard it's around 2nd magnitude, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's brighter, like 1.8 or something. Wait, I think Polaris is about 2.0 magnitude. Let me think. If Canopus is about -0.7, Polaris is much fainter, but still brighter than the other options with absolute magnitude 15.

Wait, but how do I find the apparent magnitude for each star? The formula is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d/10), where M is absolute magnitude,
