Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem says we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Then, when treated with platinum upon heating, it forms another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids through a disproportionation reaction. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine water. When X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they both give only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen at 14.28%. Z is part of mixture Y and is used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated—no double or triple bonds left. Additionally, mixture X's compounds don't have conjugated multiple bonds.

So, I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Let me start by identifying what Z could be. Since Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28%, let's compute its molecular formula.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is 14.28%. That's roughly 14.28%, which is about 1/7. Wait, 14.28% is approximately 1/7 of the total mass because 1/7 is about 14.29%. So, the mass of hydrogen is 1/7 of the total mass of Z.

Assuming Z is CnH2m, so the molecular formula can be written as CnH2m. The molar mass of Z will be (12n + 2m) g/mol.

The mass fraction of hydrogen is (2m)/(12n + 2m) = 1/7.

So, 2m / (12n + 2m) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator: 2m *7 = 12n + 2m.

14m = 12n + 2m → 14m -2m =12n →12m =12n → m =n.

So, m=n, so the formula becomes CnH2n. Hmm, wait. Let me check that again.

Wait, 2m/(12n +2m) = 1/7.

Multiply both sides by denominator: 2m*7 =12n +2m →14m=12n +2m →14m -2m=12n →12m=12n → m=n.

Yes, so m=n. So the formula is CnH2n. But wait, that would imply the degree of unsaturation. Alternatively, maybe it's another structure.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, let's think about another approach. If the hydrogen mass fraction is 14.28%, that's about 1/7. So the ratio of H to the whole is 1:6.

Wait, in a molecule, the number of H atoms is 2m, and the molar mass is 12n + 2m.

So, (2m)/(12n +2m) = 1/7 → 14m =12n +2m →12m=12n →m=n.

So, the formula is CnH2n. But wait, that's the formula for an alkene, but if Z doesn't react with hydrogen, that can't be right because alkenes react with hydrogen. Ah, but the problem says Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So perhaps it's a fully saturated molecule. Wait, but CnH2n is an alkene, which would react. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me try a different approach.

The mass of hydrogen is 14.28% of Z's mass. Let's think about the possible hydrocarbons. Benzene is C6H
