Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the setup: There's a star similar to the Sun but a bit bigger—1.5 times the Sun's radius. Around it, there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and its orbital period is 3 days. Now, they're asking about a second planet, which is bigger—2.5 Earth radii. I need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still causing both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and the second one also has a circular orbit.

Hmm. So, transit and occultation events. Wait, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so from our view, the planet's light is blocked. Wait, no, actually, occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we wouldn't see its reflected light anymore. But wait, for this problem, I think the key is that both events (transit and occultation) need to happen. So the second planet must pass in front (transit) and behind (occultation) the star as seen from Earth.

But wait, for a planet to transit, it has to pass in front of the star. For it to occult, the planet must pass behind
