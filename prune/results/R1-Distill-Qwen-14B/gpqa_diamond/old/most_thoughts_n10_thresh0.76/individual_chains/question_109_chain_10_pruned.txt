Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the emission of a particle by a nucleon system. Hmm, let's see. The question is about determining which partial wave is not permitted based on conservation laws and Pauli statistics.

Alright, so the initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, particle X will have some angular momentum state, right? The options give different possibilities for the emitted particle's state, like p, s, etc.

The problem says Pauli statistics require that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Oh wait, wait. I think the Pauli exclusion principle here comes into play because the nucleons are identical fermions. So, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The total wavefunction is a product of spin, spatial, and isospin parts, and their product must be antisymmetric.

Wait, the given condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. So, T is the isospin quantum number, S is the spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. All these are quantum numbers, and their sum mod 2 should equal T.

The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So, substituting into the equation, 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L ≡ 1 mod 2. So, S and L must have opposite parities. If S is even, L must be odd, and vice versa.

So, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that. The notation is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 means 2S+1=1 → S=0. L is S, so L=0. J=0. So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

After emitting particle X, the final NN state must have T=0. So, according to the condition, their S (spin) and L (orbital) must satisfy S + L = 1 mod 2. So, for the final state, either S is 1 and L is 0, or S is 0 and L is 1, or S is 1 and L is 1 (but wait, 1+1=2 which mod 2 is 0, which doesn't satisfy 1 mod 2. Hmm, so perhaps I should clarify.

Wait, S and L are the quantum numbers. So S could be integer values, but for two nucleons, the total spin can be S=0 or S=1. Similarly, L can be 0,1,2, etc., but in the options, the emitted particle has specific L's.

But wait, the problem is about the partial waves of the emitted particle X. Each option gives a final state of NN and the emitted particle's state. The part after the arrow is the emitted particle's state. For example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the emitted particle is a p (which I think is a particle with angular momentum state p, which is l=1 since D is l=2? Wait, no, wait. Let me think. No, wait, the letters denote the orbital angular momentum. So S is l=0, P is l=1, D is l=2, F is l=3, etc. So the emitted particle's state is given by lowercase letters. So 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, etc.

Wait, but actually, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is part of the decay process. So the total angular momentum of the NN system and the emitted particle must satisfy angular momentum conservation.

So, the initial state has L=0 (from 1S0), and J=0. After emission, the final NN state will have some L, and the emitted particle X will have its own orbital angular momentum l. So, the total orbital angular momentum of the system (NN + X) must be conserved.

Wait, but the initial state is a bound system, and the particle X is emitted. So, the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0, and the final orbital angular momentum is L_final = L_NN + l_X, where L_NN is the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair, and l_X is that of X.

So, conservation of angular momentum requires that L_initial = L_NN + l_X. But L_initial is 0, so L_NN + l_X must equal 0 mod something? Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, vector addition applies, but in this problem, perhaps we are considering the possible total angular momentum states.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the orbital angular momentum of the system (NN) plus that of X must be equal to the initial orbital angular momentum, which is 0. So L_NN + l_X ≡ 0 mod something. Hmm, but maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, the problem says "make use of the conservation of both angular momentum and parity." So I need to use both.

Parity conservation: the parity of the initial state times the parity of the emitted particle should equal the parity of the final NN state times the parity of the emitted particle's state. Wait, maybe. Or, the parity of the process is conserved, so the product of initial parity (NN) and parity of X should equal the product of the final NN parity and the parity of X in the emitted state. Hmm, not sure. Let me think.

The parity operator P. The parity of a state is given by the product of the intrinsic parity of the particles and the parity from their spatial wavefunction. For orbital angular momentum l, the spatial parity is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital quantum number.

So, the initial state is 1S0, which has L=0. So parity is (-1)^0 = 1. The initial parity is also considering the intrinsic parity of the nucleons. But wait, nucleons are fermions, but in NN system, each has intrinsic parity +1, so the combined intrinsic parity is (+1)(+1) * (-1)^L_initial? Or perhaps I'm mixing things.

Wait, the intrinsic parity of a particle is a property. For identical fermions, the parity of the state involves the orbital angular momentum and the spin. But perhaps in this case, the initial state's parity is determined by the orbital part.

Wait, for the parity of the initial state: the parity is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum. So the initial state is 1S0, so L=0, parity is 1. The emitted particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. So, the parity of the emitted particle X is -1. But when X is emitted, the parity of the decay process must be conserved.

Wait, in a decay process, the initial parity should equal the product of the final states' parities. So:

P_initial = P_final_1 * P_final_2.

P_initial is parity of NN system, which is (-1)^{L_initial} times intrinsic parity.

Wait, but the NN system is a bound state, so their intrinsic parity is 1 each, so combined, it's 1. So P_initial = (-1)^0 * (1) = 1.

After emission, the NN system has parity P_NN = (-1)^{L_NN} * (1) [since their intrinsic parity is still 1, because they're the same particles], and the emitted particle X has parity P_X = (-1)^{l_X} * (intrinsic parity of X).

The intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So P_X = (-1)^l_X * (-1) = (-1)^{l_X + 1}.

So the total parity after decay is P_NN * P_X = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X +1}.

Set this equal to the initial parity, which is 1:

(-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)^{l_X + 1} = 1.

Which simplifies to (-1)^{L_NN + l_X + 1} = 1.

So, (-1)^{L_NN + l_X +1} = 1 → L_NN + l_X +1 must be even → L_NN + l_X must be odd.

So, L_NN + l_X ≡ 1 mod 2.

That's one condition.

Another condition is the conservation of orbital angular momentum. The initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial =0. The total orbital angular momentum after emission is L_NN (of the NN system) plus l_X (of X). So,

L_NN + l_X = L_initial + something? Wait, in the decay, the orbital angular momentum is conserved as a vector, but considering the possible states, the total must match. But since the initial L is 0, the final L_NN + l_X must have a component that allows the sum to be compatible. But for this problem, perhaps we're looking at the possible total angular momentum quantum numbers.

Wait, but I think the key point here is that the orbital angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, so the sum of the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair and the emitted particle X must be zero.

But that's not possible unless both are zero. Wait, no, because they are vectors. So their vector sum must be zero. So, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair and X must form a closed triangle.

But since the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the total after emission must also be zero. So, L_NN and l_X must combine to zero. So, the possible combinations are where L_NN and l_X can add up to zero.

So, for example, if L_NN is 1, then l_X must be 1, and their vector sum can be zero (if they are opposite). But in terms of quantum numbers, the possible total angular momentum would involve various possibilities.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to consider that the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers must satisfy L_NN + l_X = 0, but that's only possible if L_NN = l_X =0. Because L and l are non-negative integers. So that would imply that both must be zero. But that's not the case here, since the options have X with l=1 (p), l=0 (s), etc.

Wait, no, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, the total orbital angular momentum of NN and X must also be zero. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair (L_NN) and the orbital angular momentum of X (l_X) must be such that their vector sum
