Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electromagnetism, but let me think this through.

Alright, the question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, where theta is the angle with respect to the z-axis.

The question is asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f, which is given as lambda raised to some power.

So first, I need to remember what the radiation pattern looks like for an oscillating dipole. Oh right, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (the radiation zone) depends on the angle theta. The intensity (or power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sin theta)^2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no—did I get that wrong? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, I think for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern has a maximum along the equatorial plane, so when theta is 90 degrees, the intensity is maximum. And it's zero along the axis (theta = 0 or 180). So the intensity actually varies as sin^2 theta. Because when theta is 90 degrees, sin theta is 1, so that's maximum. So the function f(theta) is proportional to sin^2 theta.

Wait, but wait—this is an oscillating charge distribution. If it's oscillating, it's creating a dipole radiation, right? So the dipole's radiation has a particular pattern.

So the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity, I think it's given by the radiation formula for an oscillating dipole. The formula I remember is something like:

P(theta) = (some constant) * (d^2 phi/dt^2)^2 * (sin^2 theta) / (lambda^something).

Wait, let's think about the radiated power. The total power radiated by an oscillating dipole is known, but when considering the distribution in solid angle, each direction has a certain intensity.

So the function f, which is the power per unit solid angle, should depend on theta as sin^2 theta, because the dipole's radiation is strongest perpendicular to its axis.

Wait, but the question says f is a function of lambda and theta. So f would be proportional to (sin theta)^2, but also, how does it depend on lambda?

Hmm, the power radiated per unit solid angle: I think the expression involves lambda to some negative power.

Wait, the general expression for the intensity (power per unit area) for an electromagnetic wave is proportional to E^2, and for a dipole, E is proportional to (e^{ikr} / r) * (some terms), so E squared would involve (1/r^2). But in the radiation zone, r is large, so the intensity (which is P per unit area) would fall off as 1/r^2.

Wait, but this problem is in the radiation zone, and they're talking about the power per unit solid angle. So the intensity is P/(4 pi) multiplied by some directional factor, which is (sin theta)^2 perhaps.

Wait, let's think about the formula for the power radiated by a dipole. The total power is P_total = ( (e^2 omega^4 )/(6 pi epsilon_0 c^3 )) * something. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the power per solid angle.

Alternatively, I remember that for an oscillating dipole, the radiated electric field in the far zone is given by E = ( (dipole moment p) / (4 pi epsilon_0 c r) ) e^{i(kr - omega t)} } * (1 - cos theta ) / (sin theta) ). Wait, no, wait, I think the expression is E = (p0 (sin theta) e^{i(kr - omega t)} ) / (epsilon_0 c r) ), where p0 is some amplitude.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to recall the exact form. The electric field for a dipole is transverse, so it's in the plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation. So E will have components in the transverse directions, say, in the x-y plane.

The formula for E is usually given as E = ( (p_0 sin theta) / (epsilon_0 c r) ) e^{i(kr - omega t)} ), where p_0 is the amplitude of the dipole moment. The p_0 is related to the oscillating charge and its acceleration.

Wait, but for the intensity, which is the power per unit area, it's |E|^2 multiplied by some constants. So |E|^2 would be (p_0^2 sin^2 theta) / (epsilon_0^2 c^2 r^2). Then the intensity is proportional to sin^2 theta / r^2.

But wait, the question is about the power per unit solid angle. Let me think about this. The power per unit solid angle is the intensity integrated over a small area on the sphere. So, the intensity is the power per unit area, and the solid angle element is r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi. So when you have a certain intensity, the power per unit solid angle would be (intensity) * (dA / dOmega) ), but wait, no, perhaps I should think differently.

The total power is the integral of the intensity over the entire area (4 pi steradians). Alternatively, the intensity itself is power per unit area, and the area element in spherical coordinates is r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi. So the power per unit solid angle would be the intensity multiplied by the area element divided by the solid angle element (r^2 dOmega), but wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, another approach: the power per unit solid angle is the differential power dP divided by dOmega. So dP = I * dA, where I is the intensity, and dA is the area element, which is r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi. But since we're considering the radiation in the far field, where r is large and constant, then I(r) = dP/(dA) = (dP)/(r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi) ) * r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi = dP/(dA). Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the power per unit solid angle is simply the intensity (which is power per area) multiplied by the solid angle element. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense, because the solid angle is a measure of area over radius squared. So maybe I should think that the power per unit solid angle is (dP/dOmega) = (I) * (r^2) / r^2 )= I? No, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about this: the intensity I is the power per unit area. The solid angle dOmega is (r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi). So the differential power in a direction dOmega is I * r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi. But when considering per unit solid angle, that would be I * r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi / dOmega. But dOmega is r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi, so the differential power per unit solid angle is I * (r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi) / (r^2 sin theta dtheta dphi) ) = I. But that seems redundant. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I've confused the term. Let me look for another approach. The question says the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta. So f(theta) is the power per unit solid angle. So perhaps f(theta) is proportional to (sin theta)^2, as I thought earlier, because the dipole's radiation is strongest in the equatorial direction (theta=90 degrees).

So for the first part of the question, the maximum power in the radiation pattern occurs when sin theta is maximum. Which is at theta=90 degrees. So the maximum power is at theta=90, and the question is asking what fraction of the maximum A is radiated at theta=30 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the maximum power per unit solid angle is when sin theta is maximum, so at theta=90, sin theta=1. So if at theta=30, sin theta is 0.5, then the fraction would be (sin^2 30)/(sin^2 90) = (0.25)/(1) = 0.25, which is 1/4. So the fraction of the maximum A that is radiated at theta=30 is 1/4.

So that would match option B or C, which have 1/4.

Wait, but wait, is the power per unit solid angle proportional to sin^2 theta, or to cos^2 theta? Because I'm a bit confused about the orientation.

Wait, the dipole's radiation is maximum when theta is 90 degrees. So the pattern is sin^2 theta. So at theta=90 degrees, sin theta=1, maximum. So the function f(theta) should be proportional to sin^2 theta.

So the fraction is [f(30)] / [f(90)] = [sin^2(30)]/[sin^2(90)] = (0.5^2)/(1^2) = 0.25. So the fraction is 1/4.

So the first part of the answer is 1/4. Looking at the options, options B and C have 1/4 as the first part.

Now, the second part is the form of f, which is lambda to some power. So what is the dependence of the power per unit solid angle on lambda?

I think the function f should include a term that depends on the inverse of lambda to some power, since longer wavelengths (lower frequencies) would mean lower radiation power.

Wait, let's think about the dipole radiation formula. The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (e^2 a^2 omega^4 )/(6 pi epsilon_0 c^3) ), where a is the acceleration of the charge, I think.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the intensity I is proportional to (omega^2)^2, perhaps, because E is proportional to omega^2 (since E is related to acceleration, which is omega^2 times displacement). So E ~ omega^2, and since intensity I is proportional to E^2, that would make I proportional to omega^4.

But omega is 2 pi c / lambda, so omega^4 = (2 pi c / lambda)^4 = (2 pi)^4 c^4 / lambda^4. So substituting back, the intensity I is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Wait, but wait, the intensity also depends on the function of theta. But the question is about the form of f, which is the power per unit solid angle. So f should be proportional to sin^2 theta multiplied by 1/lambda^4.

So for the function f, it's something like f(theta) = k * sin^2 theta * lambda^{-4}, where k is a constant.

Looking at the options, option C says the form is lambda^-4, which matches this. So the function f is lambda^-4.

So putting it together, the fraction is 1/4, and the form is lambda^-4. So the correct option is C: 1/4, lambda^-4.

Wait, but I should double-check. Another approach: the far field radiation from a dipole is given by the electric field E proportional to (p0 sin theta) / (r) e^{i(kr -ωt)}, where p0 is the dipole moment amplitude.

The power is proportional to |E|^2, so E^2 is proportional to (p0^2 sin^2 theta) / r^2. The intensity (power per unit area) is then |E|^2 / (2 epsilon_0), I think. But when considering the power per unit solid angle, which is the intensity multiplied by the solid angle element. Wait, no, the power per unit solid angle is the intensity (power per area) multiplied by the area per solid angle, which is r^2 dOmega. But in the radiation zone, r is considered large and constant, so the power per unit solid angle is simply proportional to the intensity, which is (p0^2 sin^2 theta) / r^2, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, considering that the intensity is proportional to sin^2 theta and inversely proportional to lambda^4 (from the earlier substitution), so f(theta) = A sin^2 theta / lambda^4. So the function f is proportional to lambda^-4, which matches option C.


The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with symmetry along the z-axis, radiating at a wavelength $\lambda$. The power radiated per unit solid angle is a function $f(\lambda, \theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle with respect to the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power $A$ radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ and the form of $f$.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Radiation Pattern**:  
   For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field depends on $\theta$. The power per unit solid angle is proportional to $\sin^2 \theta$. This is because the radiation is strongest in the equatorial plane ($\theta = 90^\circ$) and zero along the axis ($\theta = 0$ or $180^\circ$).

2. **Fraction of Maximum Power**:  
   The maximum power is radiated at $\theta = 90^\circ$, where $\sin^2 \theta = 1$. At $\theta = 30^\circ$, $\sin^2 \theta = (0.5)^2 = 0.25$. Thus, the fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is:  
   \[
   \frac{\text{Power at } \theta = 30^\circ}{\text{Maximum Power}} = \frac{\sin^2 30^\circ}{\sin^2 90^\circ} = \frac{0.25}{1} = \frac{1}{4}.
   \]

3. **Dependence on $\lambda$**:  
   The power radiated per unit solid angle depends on $\lambda$. For an oscillating dipole, the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to $\omega^4$, where $\omega = 2\pi c / \lambda$. Substituting $\omega^4 = (2\pi c / \lambda)^4$, the intensity is inversely proportional to $\lambda^4$. Therefore, the function $f(\lambda, \theta)$ has the form:  
   \[
   f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \frac{\sin^2 \theta}{\lambda^4}.
   \]

4. **Matching with Options**:  
   From the above analysis, the fraction of the maximum power at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$, and the function $f$ depends on $\lambda^{-4}$. This matches **Option C**.

### Conclusion:  
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at $\theta = 30^\circ$ is $1/4$, and the function $f$ has the form $\lambda^{-4}$.
