Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's going on.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. The result is a mixture of gases. These gases are passed through some tubes, and we get some data from that.

The setup of the tubes is:
1. Tube №1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. It increased by 3.60 grams.
2. Tube №2: Ca(OH)2 solution. No change in weight.
3. Tube №3: Red-hot copper. Increased by 0.80 grams (CuO formed).

After these, only 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temperature and pressure (STP).

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are A to D, with numbers 13, 15, 17, 19.

Hmm. Let's break this down.

First, the gases formed when salts A and B are heated. Since they're heated without air, it's likely a decomposition reaction. The gases then pass through these tubes, which are used to identify the gases based on their reactions.

Tube №1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant but also reacts with water. Wait, or does it trap water vapor? I think Mg(ClO4)2 is used for drying because it's deliquescent. So if the gas passed through it caused the tube to gain weight, it suggests that the gas was carrying water vapor. Alternatively, maybe the gas was something like HCl, which would react with Mg(ClO4)2. Wait, but Mg(ClO4)2 is magnesium perchlorate. It's highly deliquescent, so it can absorb water from the air. So when a gas containing water vapor passes through, the Mg(ClO4)2 would absorb it, increasing the tube's weight. So the gas from the mixture must have water vapor. Or wait, maybe the gas is something else that reacts with it, like HCl or NH3? Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with water to form Mg(ClO4)2·nH2O, so the weight gain is due to water absorbed. Alternatively, maybe the gas is HCl. Let me think: Mg(ClO4)2 reacts with HCl? I think so. Mg(ClO4)2 is a salt, and HCl is a strong acid. But Mg(ClO4)2 is a magnesium salt, which is a metal, so perhaps it can react with HCl. Let me think: Mg would react with HCl to produce MgCl2, H2, and ClO4^- would remain? Or maybe Mg(ClO4)2 is a chlorate? Wait, perchlorate is ClO4^-.

Wait, Mg(ClO4)2 is Mg^2+ and 2 ClO4^-.

When HCl gas is passed, the HCl would react with Mg(ClO4)2. Let's write the reaction:

Mg(ClO4)2 + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + 2 HClO4?

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, and Mg(ClO4)2 is a salt of a strong acid (perchloric acid). So MgCl2 is a more acidic salt than Mg(ClO4)2? Hmm, maybe the reaction is:

Mg(ClO4)2 + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + 2 HClO4.

But if that's the case, the Mg(ClO4)2 would react with HCl, producing MgCl2 and HClO4. Since the tube's weight increased by 3.60 grams, perhaps the amount of HCl that passed through corresponds to that. Alternatively, maybe the gas is a mixture, but the Mg(ClO4)2 is only reacting with HCl, so the
