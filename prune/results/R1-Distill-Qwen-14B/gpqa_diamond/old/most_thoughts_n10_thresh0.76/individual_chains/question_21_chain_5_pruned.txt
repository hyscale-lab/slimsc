Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through it again.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. Then it asks about two compounds: benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. The first part (A) is about which of these doesn't show tautomerism. Then part (B) is about whether methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate or dimethyl fumarate shows optical isomerism.

Hmm, I need to tackle each part separately.

Starting with part A: Benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I remember that tautomerism involves the shift of a hydrogen and the reorganization of double bonds. For example, in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups, tautomerism can occur if there's a possibility for a hydrogen to move, causing the double bonds to shift.

Benzoquinone is a quinone, which has two ketone groups connected by a benzene ring. I think benzoquinone can exist in two forms: para and ortho. Wait, but wait, benzoquinone is usually 1,4-benzoquinone. It's an aromatic compound with two ketone groups opposite each other. Does it undergo tautomerism? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more about dihydroxy structures.

Wait, no. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, like between enol and keto forms. For that, the molecule must have adjacent carbonyl groups or a conjugated system that allows such a shift.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione has three ketone groups, each separated by a CH2 group. Wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have carbonyl groups at positions 1,3, and 5 around the ring. So, each is separated by two CH2 groups. Wait, actually, each carbonyl is on alternating positions. So, the structure is O=C-(CH2)-O=C-(CH2)-O=C- in a ring.

Wait, that's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, the ring is fully conjugated with three double bonds? No, wait, each ketone is a carbonyl
