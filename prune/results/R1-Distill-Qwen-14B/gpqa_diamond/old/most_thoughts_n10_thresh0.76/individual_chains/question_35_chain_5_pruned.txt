Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about the Y-component of the angular momentum operator, Ay. It's given that Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's expressed as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), right? And S is a 2x2 matrix whose first row is (0, -i) and the second row is (i, 0). 

Wait, S looks familiar. Oh right, S is the Pauli sigma y matrix. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2 and have those structures. So, S is σy, which has eigenvalues +1 and -1, but wait, what about when multiplied by c?

So, Ay = c * S. So the eigenvalues of Ay should be c times the eigenvalues of S. Since the eigenvalues of σy are ±1, then the eigenvalues of Ay would be c*(±1). Substituting c, which is h/(4π), so the eigenvalues are (h/(4π)) * (1) and (h/(4π))*(-1). So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π). 

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts are ±h/(4π). But wait, the eigenvalues here are real? Because the eigenvalues of Ay would be real. Because S is Hermitian? Wait, S is Hermitian because σy is Hermitian. So Ay is c times a Hermitian matrix, so Ay is Hermitian. Therefore, its eigenvalues should be real. So the eigenvalues a are real numbers.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: Imaginary parts are ±2πh. That can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Eigenvalues have real and imaginary parts. For instance, the statement says imaginary parts are ±½ and real are ±1. Oh wait, but wait. If Ay is Hermitian, the eigenvalues are real. So option B's eigenvalues have imaginary parts, which is impossible. So B is incorrect.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ. So a is an eigenvalue, which should be real because Ay is Hermitian. So both options A and B can't be correct because they suggest complex eigenvalues. Oh wait, let me read the options again.

Option A says the imaginary part is ±2πh and the real part is ±h/(4π). So composites like a = h/(4π) + i(2πh) or something? That can't be right because a should be real.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something about the matrix S. Let me compute S's eigenvalues. The matrix S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

To find eigenvalues, the characteristic equation is det(S - λ I) = 0. So determinant is (−λ)(−λ) − (−i)(i
