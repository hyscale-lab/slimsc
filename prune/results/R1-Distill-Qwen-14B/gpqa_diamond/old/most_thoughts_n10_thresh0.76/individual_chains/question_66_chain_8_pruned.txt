Okay, so I've got this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, or SMEFT. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries. The choices are combinations of these.

Hmm, first, I remember that SMEFT is a framework that generalizes the Standard Model by including higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension and the symmetries they respect. So, SMEFT is supposed to preserve some fundamental symmetries, but not necessarily all.

Let me recall the basics. The Standard Model (SM) has several symmetries like gauge symmetry (SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1)), Lorentz symmetry, and others. SMEFT should maintain the same gauge symmetry because it's an effective theory built upon the SM.

Wait, but wait. The question is about which symmetries all operators must respect. So which ones are absolutely necessary beyond the gauge?

Lorentz symmetry is a big one. Because the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory, any effective theory like SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, you'd have different physics in different reference frames, which doesn't make sense. So Lorentz symmetry (point 1) is a must. So option 1 is definitely in.

Then, Poincare symmetry. Wait, isn't Poincare symmetry a combination of Lorentz and translations? Oh right, Poincare includes Lorentz transformations and spacetime translations. So if a theory respects Poincare, it must respect Lorentz. But does SMEFT require Poincare? I'm a bit confused here. Because SMEFT is an effective theory, it's valid below a certain energy scale. But effective theories are usually considered in a Poincare-invariant framework. Wait, but wait—some effective theories might not be Poincare symmetric if they have explicit breaking, but no, I think SMEFT is constructed to maintain Poincare symmetry. Or wait, no—because SMEFT is valid up to some cutoff, but the effective operators are built respecting Poincare. Hmm, but wait, the individual terms in the Lagrangian must transform correctly under Poincare. So, yes, all operators must respect Poincare symmetry. So point 2 (Poincare) is also a must.

Wait, but wait again. Because when you have an effective theory, sometimes you can have operators that are not invariant under Poincare, but that's not the case here. SMEFT is constructed with operators that are Poincare-invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries are required. So options 1 and 2 are both correct.

But wait, the question is about which must be respected by all operators. So does SMEFT require all operators to respect Poincare? Or is it that the entire theory respects Poincare symmetry, but individual operators might break it? No, no, the operators themselves must be Poincare-invariant. Because if an operator isn't, then the whole theory wouldn't be. So yes, operators must respect Poincare.

Wait, but Poincare includes translations, which are global
