Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

The question says that there's a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. The magnetic field's strength is B = 1 Tesla, and m is small, which I think refers to the orbital magnetic quantum number. I need to compare the magnitude of the paramagnetic coupling term (which I believe is the Hamiltonian term due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom given a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? Oh right, in the context of atoms in a magnetic field, the Zeeman effect comes into play. The Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B. For an electron, the magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m_s (magnetic quantum number). But wait, in this case, the problem mentions m as the orbital magnetic quantum number. Oh wait, orbital angular momentum m is l, but I'm a bit confused. Oh no, wait, the orbital magnetic quantum number is actually m_l, right? So the orbital contribution would be μ_orbital = μ_B * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. But wait, the paramagnetic effect is usually due to the electron's spin, isn't it? Or does it include orbital contributions too? Hmm, paramagnetism can involve both, but maybe in this context, they're referring to the orbital contribution.

Wait, but looking again, the question says "paramagnetic coupling term." Paramagnetism is caused by the spin of unpaired electrons. Oh wait, no, maybe in this case, it's the orbital contribution. Hmm, perhaps I should focus on the formula.

The energy due to the magnetic field would be H = -μ·B. The orbital magnetic moment μ_orbital is given by μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (l(l+1))^(1/2) * m_l, but wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e), so μ_orbital = μ_B * m_l. But wait, actually, the orbital magnetic moment is μ = μ_B * m_l * something else? Or perhaps it's μ = μ_B * sqrt(l(l+1)) * m_l, no,
