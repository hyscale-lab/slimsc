Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in energy given the uncertainty in the electron's location and its speed.

Wait, the problem states that the electron is moving at v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. Oh right, 0.1 nm is 0.1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 meters. So, Δx is 1e-10 m.

The Uncertainty Principle says that Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where Δp is the uncertainty in momentum. Since they're asking for the minimum uncertainty, I think I should use the equality: Δx * Δp = ħ/2. That would give the smallest possible Δp.

So, first I'll compute Δp. Momentum p is mass times velocity, but wait, here it's the uncertainty in momentum. So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx). Oh wait, no, that's when you set the minimum product. So, Δp = ħ/(2Δx).

Wait, let me think again. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So to find the minimum Δp, it's equal to ħ/(2Δx). Ok, so plugging in the numbers.

The reduced Planck constant ħ is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So Δp = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 1e-10). Let me calculate that denominator: 2e-10. So 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 is about 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1.05457e-34 divided by 2e-10 is (1.05457e-34) / (2e-10) = (1.05457 / 2) * 1e-24. Because 1e-34 / 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1.05457/2 is about 0.527e-24, which is 5.27e-25 kg·m/s. So Δp is approximately 5.27e-25 kg·m/s.

Now, the question is about the uncertainty in energy, ΔE. Hmm, how does that relate? I think the Uncertainty Principle also applies to energy and time, but wait, that's another form. Oh, but wait, the electron's kinetic energy is related to its momentum. So maybe I should calculate the kinetic energy based on the uncertainty in momentum.

Yes, because the uncertainty in momentum will relate to the uncertainty in energy. The kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So maybe the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be approximately related to (Δp)²/(2m), assuming that p is large compared to Δp, so that the square is manageable.

Wait, but wait. The electron's mass is about 9.11e-31 kg. Let's compute (Δp)^2/(2m). So (5.27e-25)^2 is (5.27)^2 = approx 27.77e-50, since (e-25)^2 is e-50. So 27.77e-50 kg²·m²/s². Divided by (2 * 9.11e-31 kg) gives (27.77e-50) / (1.822e-30) ) J.

Wait, let me compute denominator: 2 * 9.11e-31 = 1.822
