Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's see what the question says.

We have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube (x-axis). The wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measure the position, all particles are found between x=1 and x=3. So the question is to find the value of 'a' from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that the wave function's modulus squared gives the probability density. So the particle's probability of being found in a region is the integral of |ψ|^2 dx over that region. Since in this case, all measurements are between x=1 and x=3, that means the probability from x=1 to x=3 should be 100% (i.e., the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx equals 1).

Wait, but wait. The wave function given is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Oh, right, that's a complex wave function. So the modulus squared would be ψ*ψ, right? Because the probability density is |ψ(x)|².

So let me compute that. The wave function is a function of x: (a / sqrt(1+x)) ) minus (0.5i). So ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - 0.5i. To find |ψ(x)|², I need to multiply ψ*(x) and ψ(x).

So ψ*(x) is the complex conjugate, which would be [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + 0.5i. So when I multiply them:

[ a/(sqrt(1+x)) ]^2 + (0.5i)(-0.5i) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(-0.5i)

Wait, no, that's getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to compute |A + B|² where A is real and B is imaginary. Wait, ψ(x) is A + Bi, where A is a/(sqrt(1+x)) and B is -0.5. So the modulus squared is A² + B². Oh yeah, because (A + Bi)(A - Bi) = A² + B².

Oh right, that's much better. So |ψ(x)|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

So that's [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

The integral of this from x=1 to x=3 must be equal to 1 because the total probability is 1.

So the integral ∫ from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

I can split this integral into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx plus integral of 0.25 dx.

Let me compute each part separately.

First part: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3. The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x), so this becomes a² [ln(1+3) - ln(1+1)] = a² [ln(4) - ln(2)] = a² ln(2). Because ln(4) is 2 ln(2), minus ln(2) gives ln(2).

Second part: integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25 * 2 = 0.5.

So the total is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So we have a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Therefore, a² = 0.5 / ln(2). I'll compute ln(2) which is approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.721. Taking square root, a ≈ sqrt(0.721) ≈ 0.849, which is approximately 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by noting that the wave function is given as \( \psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i \). The probability density is \( |\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25 \).

Since the particle is only found between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the total probability over this interval must equal 1. Thus, we integrate \( |\psi(x)|^2 \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \):

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:
1. \( \int_1^3 \frac{a^2}{1+x} dx \): The integral of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln(1+x) \), so this evaluates to \( a^2 [\ln(4) - \ln(2)] = a^2 \ln(2) \).
2. \( \int_1^3 0.25 dx \): This evaluates to \( 0.25 \times (3 - 1) = 0.5 \).

Adding these results, we have:
\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \), we find:
\[
a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we calculate:
\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.721.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.721} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately \( 0.85 \), which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B
