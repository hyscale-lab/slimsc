Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical isomerism has to do with chirality, right? Chiral molecules are those that aren't superimposable on their mirror images. So, if a molecule has a chiral center, it can have optical isomers.

The question lists four moieties, and I need to figure out which ones can exhibit optical isomerism. Let's go through each one by one.

1. The first one is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm, biphenyl rings. So the structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but in biphenyls, the substituents can be para, meta, or ortho. Here, it's 1,1', so the rings are connected at position 1. The substituents at positions 2 and 6â€”so on each ring, at 2 and 2' positions, there are carboxylate groups, and at 6 and 6', nitro groups.

Wait, but for a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center. Alternatively, it can have a plane of symmetry or not. Biphenyl systems can sometimes have axial chirality if there's a substituent on each ring that's not in a plane of symmetry. So if the substituents are arranged in such a way that makes the molecule chiral.

In this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 2' on each ring, and 6 and 6' have nitro groups. Let me try to visualize this. If the two rings are connected at position 1, the substituents at 2 and 2' would be on the same side? Or opposite? Wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. 1,1' biphenyl means the two benzene rings are connected via C1 of each. So, each ring has substituents at positions 2 (so adjacent to the connecting point), and 6, which is across from 2 on the benzene ring.

Wait, but for a molecule to have axial chirality, like in biphenyls, the substituents on each ring should be arranged in a way that the two rings are connected and have substituents that create a lack of internal plane of symmetry. I think if the substituents on each ring are in the same relative positions, it might not be chiral, but if they are in a way that the molecule isn't symmetric... Alternatively, perhaps this compound has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but maybe the substituents are in such a way that the molecule is not symmetrical. Let me think: If the two rings each have a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, and the rings are connected at 1,1', then the molecule might be symmetrical. So perhaps the two substituents on each ring are mirror images, making the whole molecule symmetrical. So, maybe this doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think
