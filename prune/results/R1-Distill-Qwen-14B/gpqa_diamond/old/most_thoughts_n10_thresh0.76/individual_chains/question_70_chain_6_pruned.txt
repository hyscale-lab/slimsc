Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what the molecular symmetry group of product E is. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.

The question gives a series of reactions, so I think the key is to figure out what each substance is. Let me list out the reactions again:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E. E is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

So I need to figure out the possible compounds involved in each step.

Starting with the first reaction. Solid A and gas B. 8 equivalents of B. Hmm, what could that be? Let's think about common reactions where a solid reacts with a gas in such a ratio. Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else? Or perhaps a metal reacting with a halogen?

Wait, in the first reaction, product C is bright red. Bright red suggests maybe something like a sulfur compound? Or perhaps a transition metal complex. Wait, another thought: maybe A is a metal and B is a halogen. For instance, sodium reacting with chlorine (but I don't think that's right). Or perhaps, let's think of a reaction where a metal oxide reacts with a gas. Wait, no, maybe it's a reaction that forms a compound with a high ratio.

Alternatively, think about something like phosphorus and chlorine gas. Phosphorus (solid) and Cl2 gas. The reaction of P with Cl2 could form PCl5. The formula for PCl5 is PCl5, which has a formula weight of 208.39 g/mol. Wait, but in terms of moles, how would that fit? Let me think. If A is P (solid), and B is Cl2 gas, then the reaction would be:

4 P + 5 Cl2 → 4 PCl5.

Wait, but in this reaction, 5 equivalents of Cl2 are used per 4 equivalents of P. Hmm, but the question says 8 equivalents of B. So maybe the ratio is different.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal like sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). The reaction would be:

2 Na + Cl2 → 2 NaCl.

But that's 2 equivalents of Cl2 per 2 Na. So for 8 equivalents of Cl2, you need 8 / 2 * 2 = 8 equivalents of Na? That doesn't add up, because the ratio is 1:1 per mole. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (S8) and B is something else. Sulfur reacts with other elements in different conditions. Alternatively, think about the formation of something like SO3. For that, S reacts with O2, but I don't know if that's relevant here.

Wait, another angle: the product C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. So when C is treated with water, it produces A, F, and G. F is strong, G is weak. Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, etc. Weak acids include H2O (but that's not an acid), more like H3PO4 (but that's weak), or maybe something like H2S (but that's a weak acid too). Wait, but F and G are different.

Let me think of C as a salt that when hydrolyzed gives two acids. For instance, if C is a sulfite or something similar. Wait, maybe C is a metal sulfide? Or perhaps a compound like (NH4)2CO3, which upon hydrolysis gives NH4OH (weak) and HCO3^- which becomes H2CO3 (weak). No, but F is strong. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: if C is a nitride, like Na3N. When it reacts with water, it would produce NaOH (strong acid? No, NaOH is a strong base. Wait, but F and G are acids, so maybe C is a higher oxide of a metal that produces two different acids upon hydrolysis. For example, sodium peroxide (
