Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, we've got two electrons in p orbitals, right? And we're considering their orbital angular momentum states. The question is about finding the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ when we measure them.

Wait, so each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So each has l1 = 1 and l2 = 1. The given state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, wait, that doesn't seem right. Because when you couple two angular momenta, the maximum possible total l is l1 + l2, which in this case would be 2. So the state is |l1, l2, L, M>, which is |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum L is 2, and M is -1.

But the question is about measuring each individual L_z. So L1z and L2z. Each of these operators corresponds to the z-component of each electron's orbital angular momentum. So L1z = ħ * m1, and L2z = ħ * m2, where m1 and m2 are the magnetic quantum numbers for each electron.

Wait, so when we measure L1z and L2z, we're measuring m1 and m2, each of which can be -1, 0, or +1, since l=1. But wait, each electron's orbital angular momentum is in a p state, so l=1 for each. So each has possible m values of -1, 0, +1.

Now, the state given is |1,1,2,-1>. So what does that state look like in terms of m1 and m2? Because L_total_z = m1 + m2 would be M, which is -1 in this case.

So the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state where the total angular momentum is 2, and the z-component is -1. But we need to find the possible m1 and m2 that contribute to this state.

Wait, but the state given is a coupled state, right? So it's a combination of all possible |l1, l2, L, M> states. But when you have two electrons, each with l=1, the coupled states can have L from
