Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein. They're interested in its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Theyâ€™re using a construct that overexpresses this gene, with an added hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. Then they transfected it into Chinese hamster ovary cells but can't get the protein expressed as expected.

The problem is that the sequence provided for the plus strand of their construct has an issue. I need to look into the DNA sequence and see what's wrong.

Wait, the options given are A to D. Let me go through each option and see which one could be the issue.

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation. That would mean that the HA tag's DNA sequence is wrong, leading to an incorrect amino acid. But the question doesn't mention any issues with the tag's expression. Also, the problem is about overexpression not happening, so maybe it's more about expression issues than the tag's correctness.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a premature stop codon in the mRNA. So the ribosome would stop translating before the full protein is made. Looking at the DNA sequence, perhaps there's an early stop codon. Wait, the plus strand is the coding strand, right? So the mRNA would be complementary to this. Let me look for any in-frame stop codons in the DNA sequence.

Stop codons in DNA would be TGA, TAA, or TAG on the coding strand. Let me scan the sequence.

Looking through the DNA sequence:

I see a bunch of ATG (start codon) at the beginning. Let me scan for TGA, TAA, TAG.

Looking...

Hmm, towards the end, I see ...GCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA...

Wait, the last part is GAGTGA. The last three nucleotides are AGTGA. Wait, the last part is GAGTGA. So looking at that, the last codon is AGA, right? Because each codon is 3 nt. So the last codon would be the last 3 nucleotides, which is AGA. Wait, no, let's see:

The entire sequence ends with ...GAGTGA3'. So the last part is GAG TGA. Oh wait, TGA is a stop codon. So in the DNA coding strand,
