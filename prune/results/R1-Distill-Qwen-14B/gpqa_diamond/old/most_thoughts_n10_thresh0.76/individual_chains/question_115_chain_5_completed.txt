Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

Alright, the problem says an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left, which I guess is the negative x-direction, and the positron is moving from the right, so positive x-direction. Both have Lorentz factors given—4 for the electron and 2 for the positron. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured as one moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I'm supposed to find the angle between them.

Hmm, first, I remember that when particles annihilate, their energy and momentum must be conserved. So the total energy before collision should equal the total after, and same with momentum.

Wait, but electrons and positrons have opposite charges. Oh, but in terms of annihilating, I think they produce gamma rays, but here it's two photons. So the system's total energy and momentum will be carried by these photons.

Let me think about the initial setup. The electron has a Lorentz factor gamma_e =4, and the positron gamma_p=2. The positron is moving to the right, and the electron to the left.

Wait, but the electron is moving from the left, so its velocity is in the negative x-direction. The positron is moving from the right, so positive x-direction.

So for the initial momenta, momentum is gamma * m * velocity. But since velocity is a vector, I need to pay attention to directions. Let me denote the positron's direction as positive.

So, electron's momentum: p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since it's moving left, v_e is negative. So p_e is negative.

Positron's momentum: p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. v_p is positive, so p_p is positive.

Wait, but speed of the positron: since gamma_p is 2, and gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so maybe I should compute their velocities?

But maybe I can just calculate the total energy and momentum.

The initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

Each particle's energy is gamma * m_e c². So total energy E_total = gamma_e * m_e c² + gamma_p * m_e c².

Similarly, the initial momentum is p_e + p_p. Since p_e is negative and p_p positive.

Wait, but for momentum, the direction matters. Let me assign the positron's direction as the positive direction. So the positron has momentum gamma_p * m_e v_p, and the electron has momentum gamma_e * m_e v_e, but v_e is negative.

Wait, but actually, v_e and v_p could be in opposite directions, but their magnitudes depend on their gamma and masses.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the total momentum and total energy in terms of gamma.

Wait, also, because the electron and positron have the same mass, right? Because positron is just the antimatter counterpart of the electron. So m_e for both.

So, E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) * m_e c².

Wait, no. Because each contributes gamma * m_e c², and since gamma_e is 4 and gamma_p is 2, E_initial = (4 + 2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

Hmm, but wait, the positron is moving in the opposite direction to the electron. So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait no, the electron is moving left, so its velocity is -v_e (if v_e is speed), and the positron is moving right with velocity v_p. But since they have different gamma factors, their speeds are different.

Wait, perhaps I should find their velocities in terms of gamma.

Because gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the electron, gamma_e =4. Let's find v_e:

gamma_e = 4 → 4 = 1/sqrt(1 - v_e²/c²) → sqrt(...) =1/4 → 1 - v_e²/c²=1/16 → v_e²/c²=15/16 → v_e= (sqrt(15)/4) c ≈ 0.968 c.

Similarly, for the positron, gamma_p=2 → 2=1/sqrt(1 - v_p²/c²) → sqrt(...) =1/2 → 1 - v_p²/c²=1/4 → v_p²/c²=3/4 → v_p= sqrt(3)/2 c ≈0.866 c.

So the electron's velocity is v_e= -sqrt(15)/4 c (since moving left), and positron's v_p= sqrt(3)/2 c (moving right).

Now, the momenta:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 m_e ( (-sqrt(15)/4 ) c ) = - m_e sqrt(15) c.

p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p =2 m_e ( (sqrt(3)/2 ) c )= m_e sqrt(3) c.

So total initial momentum P_initial = p_e + p_p = (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, and sqrt(3) is about 1.732. So -3.872 +1.732 ≈-2.14 m_e c. So net momentum is negative, meaning overall to the left.

Wait, but wait, wait. The positron is moving right (positive direction) and the electron left (negative). So the question is whether the positron's momentum is larger in magnitude than the electron's. Let me compute the actual numbers.

Wait, p_e =4 * m_e * ( -sqrt(15)/4 c )= - m_e * sqrt(15) c ≈-3.872 m_e c.

p_p= 2 * m_e * ( sqrt(3)/2 c )= m_e * sqrt(3) c≈1.732 m_e c.

So total momentum P_initial = (-3.872 +1.732) m_e c ≈(-2.14) m_e c. So the initial total momentum is to the left.

But when they annihilate, they produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy. And their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So both moving to the right. Wait, but that would be strange because the initial total momentum is to the left. So if both photons are moving to the right, their momenta would be in the positive direction, adding to the right, but initial momentum was to the left. Hmm, that's a conflict.

Wait, but the problem states that one photon is upper-right and another lower-right. So both are moving to the right. But that would mean their momenta are in the same direction. So their momenta vectors would add, and the total would be twice the magnitude of one photon's momentum, in the right direction. But initial total momentum is left, so that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the initial momenta? Let me double-check.

Wait, the positron is moving to the right, so its momentum is positive. The electron is moving to the left, so negative. So the initial momentum is p_e + p_p = (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Which is negative, so net left.

So when the photons are emitted, their momenta must add up to this net left. However, the problem says each photon is moving in the upper-right and lower-right direction. So both photons are moving to the right (positive x), but in opposite y directions.

Wait, but that would make their total momentum in the x-direction sum to 2p_x (since each has p_x). But if each photon has the same energy, then their momenta have the same magnitude. Wait, because for photons, E = pc. So if both photons have the same energy, their momenta magnitudes are the same. So each photon's momentum has magnitude E/c.

But their directions are symmetric in the right half-plane—so upper-right and lower-right. So their y-components would have opposite signs, but same magnitude.

So let's model the photons' momenta. Each photon has momentum vector (p_x, p_y), but for photon 1: (p_x, p_y) and photon 2: (p_x, -p_y). Because they have the same energy, so same p magnitude.

Wait, but no. Because the photons are moving in different directions. Photon 1 could have (p_x, p_y) and photon 2 has (p_x', p_y'). Since both are in the right direction, their x-components are positive. But one is upper (positive y) and the other lower (negative y). So maybe their momenta are (p_x, p_y) and (p_x, -p_y). But that would make the sum in the x-direction 2p_x and y-direction zero.

Wait, but the initial momentum was in the x-direction, so the total after annihilation must have same x and y components.

Wait, the initial momentum is in the x-direction (left, so negative). So the total momentum after must also be in the x-direction (probably negative). So the two photons must have their y-components cancel each other, but their x-components add up.

So for the photons, their y-components should be opposite. So if photon 1 has momentum (p, θ) and photon 2 has (p, 360-θ), but that might not fit the problem's description.

Wait, the problem says one photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So their angles from the x-axis are θ and 360-θ, but in right half-plane, so θ and -θ.

Wait, but in terms of vectors, their y-components would be symmetric about the x-axis. So if photon 1 has an angle θ above the x-axis, photon 2 has an angle θ below.

So their momenta are:

Photon 1: (p cosθ, p sinθ)

Photon 2: (p cosθ, -p sinθ)

Because each photon has the same energy, hence same p.

So the total momentum after annihilation is:

Total P_x = p cosθ + p cosθ = 2 p cosθ

Total P_y = p sinθ + (-p sinθ) = 0.

But the initial momentum was P_initial = (-2.14) m_e c (approximate earlier calculation), which is in the x-direction. So the total momentum after must be equal, so 2 p cosθ = P_initial.

But wait, I should be precise with the signs. Because P_initial is negative.

Wait, more accurately: the initial total momentum is P_initial = (p_e + p_p) = (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) m_e c.

Which is approximately (-3.872 +1.732) m_e c ≈ (-2.14) m_e c.

So the total x-momentum after must be same: 2 p cosθ = (-2.14) m_e c.

Wait, but wait, each photon's momentum is in the positive x direction. So their P_x is positive. But the initial momentum is negative, so how can two positive P_x add up to a negative?

Wait, that's a problem. Because P_x after is 2 p cosθ, but initial is negative. So 2 p cosθ must be negative. But p is positive (since for photons, p is magnitude), so cosθ must be negative. So θ would be in the second quadrant, meaning the photons are moving to the left? But the problem says they are moving to the right.

Wait, no, wait. The problem says one photon moves upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving to the right, which is positive x-direction. So their P_x is positive. But if the initial P_initial is negative, this can't happen. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe I messed up the direction of the electron's momentum. Let me double-check.

The electron is moving from the left, which I assumed as negative x-direction. Its velocity is negative. So its momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e =4 * m_e * (-v_e) = negative. The positron's momentum is positive.

So their sum is negative. So the initial momentum is to the left.

But the photons are moving to the right. So their momentum is in positive direction. So the sum of their P_x is positive. So how can that be equal to initial negative total momentum?

Hmm, that's a problem. Because the total momentum must be conserved. So either the photons can't both be moving to the right, or perhaps I've misunderstood the problem.

Wait, the problem states that both photons are moving in the right direction. That can't be, because the initial momentum is to the left. So their total x-momentum would be positive, but initial is negative. So that would violate momentum conservation.

Wait, unless my initial assumption about the direction of the electron's motion is wrong.

Wait, the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, so in the negative x-direction. The positron from the right, positive x.

So initial momentum is negative. So the photons' total x-momentum must be negative. But photons moving to the right have positive x-components.

Hmm, so that's conflicting. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps the photons are moving to the left? Or maybe one is moving left and the other right? But the problem says both are moving to the right.

Wait, maybe the initial momentum is to the right. Maybe I messed up the calculation of the initial momentum.

Wait, let's recompute the initial momentum.

Electron's velocity: v_e is to the left → negative. Gamma_e=4.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = sqrt(15)/4 c → approximately 0.968 c. Since moving to the left, v_e = -0.968 c.

So p_e =4 * m_e * (-0.968 c) = -3.872 m_e c.

Positron's velocity v_p= sqrt(3)/2 c ≈ 0.866 c. Moving right, so positive.

p_p= gamma_p * m_e * v_p →2 * m_e * (0.866 c) = 1.732 m_e c.

So total initial momentum P_initial= p_e + p_p = (-3.872 +1.732) m_e c ≈ (-2.14) m_e c → negative, to the left.

So the total momentum after annihilation must be negative, to the left. So the two photons must have a net negative x-momentum. But the problem says both are moving to the right, which would make their x-momentum positive. So this is a contradiction.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me re-read.

The problem says: "a positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2." So the positron's moving right, velocity positive. The electron is moving left, velocity negative. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

So initial momentum is negative, as calculated. So the photons must have a net negative x-momentum. But the photons are both moving to the right, so their x-components are positive. So adding to a positive total, which can't be.

So perhaps the problem is that I assumed both photons are moving to the right. But wait, the problem says one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. So both are moving in the right direction, but one is up and the other down.

Wait, but then their total x-momentum would be 2 p cosθ, and y-momenta would cancel. So total momentum would be in the x-direction, positive, which contradicts the initial momentum being negative.

Hmm, so this suggests that perhaps my initial assumption is wrong, and that the photons can't both be moving to the right. Or maybe the problem is designed such that despite the initial negative momentum, the photons' total momentum is negative, but their individual directions are such that their x-components sum to a negative value.

Wait, but photons can't have negative momentum in the x-direction. Because if a photon is moving to the right, its x-component is positive. So for the sum of their x-components to be negative, each photon's x-component would have to be negative, meaning they are moving to the left. But that contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, or I'm misunderstanding it. Let me read again.

The problem says: "the directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction."

So both are moving to the right. Hmm.

Wait, but that's impossible if the initial momentum is to the left. So the only way this can happen is if the photons' x-components sum to a negative value. But if both photons are moving to the right, their x-components are positive. So sum is positive, which can't match the initial negative momentum.

So perhaps the error is in the problem statement, but assuming it's correct, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the annihilation produces photons moving in opposite directions, but their x-components are such that their sum gives the initial negative momentum.

Wait, perhaps the photons are moving in opposite directions, but not necessarily both to the right. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let's model the situation.

We have two photons with same energy, so same momentum magnitude (since E=pc for photons). Let's denote the momentum magnitudes as p.

Photon 1: direction (θ above x-axis), so its momentum components are (p cosθ, p sinθ).

Photon 2: direction (-θ below x-axis), so (p cos(-θ), p sin(-θ)) → (p cosθ, -p sinθ).

Total momentum after annihilation:

Total Px = p cosθ + p cosθ = 2 p cosθ.

Total Py = p sinθ - p sinθ = 0.

So total momentum vector is (2 p cosθ, 0).

But initial momentum is P_initial = (p_e + p_p, 0) = (-sqrt(15) + sqrt(3)) m_e c ≈ (-2.14) m_e c.

So 2 p cosθ = (-2.14) m_e c.

But p is the magnitude of each photon's momentum. Since E_photon = p c, and both photons have same energy, E1 = E2 = E.

So p = E/c.

But the initial total energy is E_initial = 6 m_e c² (from 4 + 2 times m_e c²).

The total energy after annihilation is E_photon1 + E_photon2 = 2 E.

So 2 E = 6 m_e c² → E = 3 m_e c².

So each photon has E = 3 m_e c².

Thus, p = E/c = 3 m_e c.

So plug back into the momentum equation:

2 * (3 m_e c) * cosθ = (-2.14) m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

2 *3 cosθ = -2.14.

6 cosθ = -2.14 → cosθ = -2.14 /6 ≈ -0.3567.

So θ = arccos(-0.3567) ≈ 111 degrees.

Wait, but then each photon is moving in a direction θ and -θ, but θ is 111 degrees, so one is 111 degrees (upper-left) and the other is -111 (lower-left?), but that's conflicting with the problem statement that says they are moving upper-right and lower-right.

Hmm, that's confusing. Because according to this, the photons are moving in the left direction, but the problem states they move to the right.

So where is the mistake here?

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the initial momentum. Let's re-examine that.

Electron moving left (negative x) with gamma_e=4.

Positron moving right (positive x) with gamma_p=2.

Total momentum is p_e + p_p.

p_e =4 * m_e * v_e, where v_e is negative.

v_e = [sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e^2))] c → wait, no. Wait, gamma =1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

So for gamma_e=4, v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c * sqrt(15/16) = (sqrt(15)/4)c ≈0.968 c. But moving left, so v_e = -0.968 c.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e=4 * m_e * (-0.968 c) =-3.872 m_e c.

p_p= gamma_p * m_e * v_p. Gamma_p=2, so v_p= c * sqrt(1 -1/4) = c * sqrt(3/4) = (sqrt(3)/2)c ≈0.866 c. Moving right, so v_p is positive.

p_p= 2 * m_e * (0.866 c ) =1.732 m_e c.

Total p_initial = p_e + p_p = (-3.872 +1.732) m_e c ≈ (-2.14) m_e c.

So the initial momentum is negative, left.

So the photons must have a total momentum of (-2.14 m_e c, 0).

But according to our earlier calculation, the photons' total momentum is (2 p cosθ, 0) =2 *3 m_e c * cosθ=6 m_e c cosθ.

Setting this equal to -2.14 m_e c.

So 6 m_e c cosθ= -2.14 m_e c → cosθ= -2.14/6 ≈-0.3567.

So θ ≈111 degrees.

So each photon is moving at 111 degrees from the positive x-axis. So one is at 111 degrees (upper left), the other is at -111 degrees (lower left).

But the problem states that one photon is moving upper-right, and another lower-right. So 111 degrees is not in the right half-plane. So this is a contradiction.

Thus, perhaps my earlier assumption about the photons' directions is wrong. Maybe one is moving left and up, the other left and down. But the problem says both are moving right. So this is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the electron is moving to the right, and the positron to the left? No, the problem states electron is moving from left (so right is positive, so electron is moving negative x). Positron from right, moving positive x.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I need to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when the electron and positron annihilate, they produce photons which must carry away the total energy and momentum. So in this case, the initial total momentum is to the left, but the photons need to have their combined momentum equal to that.

But if photons are moving to the right, their total momentum would be to the right, which can't match.

So perhaps one photon is moving to the right, and the other to the left. So their x-components would be opposite.

Wait, but the problem says both are moving to the right. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the problem statement. But given that, maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the initial setup is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is to the right. Let me see.

Wait, maybe I got the directions wrong. Suppose the electron is moving to the right (from the left, but in the positive x direction). Wait, no, the problem says the electron is moving from the left, which would be in the positive x direction. But the positron is moving from the right, so negative x direction.

Wait, no, wait. If the positron is moving from the right, that means it's moving to the left. So the positron's velocity is in the negative x-direction, same as the electron.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. If the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, that would mean it's moving to the left, towards the origin. So yes, its velocity is in the negative x-direction.

Wait, wait, that changes everything! Oh! I think I messed up the positron's direction earlier.

So, the electron is moving from the left, which is the negative x-direction. So its velocity is negative. The positron is moving from the right, which is the positive x-direction. Wait, no, if it's moving from the right, it's moving towards the left, so negative x-direction.

Wait, perhaps I got this wrong earlier.

Let me clarify:

The electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So it's moving to the right (positive x-direction). The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so it's moving to the left (negative x-direction).

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if a positron is moving from the right, it's coming towards the left, so velocity is negative.

So let me recompute the initial momentum.

Electron: gamma_e=4, moving right (positive x), so v_e is positive.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e.

v_e = sqrt(15)/4 c ≈0.968 c.

p_e=4 * m_e * (0.968 c) ≈3.872 m_e c.

Positron: gamma_p=2, moving left (negative x), so v_p is negative.

v_p= sqrt(3)/2 c ≈0.866 c. So v_p = -0.866 c.

p_p=2 * m_e * (-0.866 c) ≈-1.732 m_e c.

So total initial momentum P_initial= p_e + p_p =3.872 -1.732 ≈2.14 m_e c. So positive, to the right.

Ah! So that makes sense. Now the initial momentum is to the right, positive. So the photons' total x-momentum must be positive. So their x-components must add to a positive value.

So now, the photons are moving in such a way that their x-components sum to positive. So each photon is moving to the right, which fits the problem's description.

So let's re-calculate.

Total initial energy is E_initial = (gamma_e + gamma_p) m_e c² = (4 + 2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

Each photon has energy E, so 2 E =6 m_e c² → E=3 m_e c².

Photon's momentum p = E/c =3 m_e c.

Now, the total momentum after annihilation is (2 p cosθ, 0 ), since the photons are moving symmetrically in upper-right and lower-right directions.

Set this equal to initial momentum: 2 p cosθ =2.14 m_e c.

So:

2 *3 m_e c * cosθ =2.14 m_e c.

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cosθ =2.14 → cosθ =2.14/6 ≈0.3567.

So θ= arccos(0.3567)≈69 degrees.

So each photon has an angle of 69 degrees above and below the x-axis.

So the angle between them is 2θ=138 degrees.

Wait, but the options include 138 as option C. So the angle between the two photons is 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the photons are moving at +69 and -69 degrees, so the angle between them is 69 - (-69)=138 degrees. Yes, that makes sense.

So the answer is 138 degrees, option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, with the electron moving to the right (positive x-direction) and the positron moving to the left (negative x-direction). Their Lorentz factors are given as $\gamma_e = 4$ and $\gamma_p = 2$, respectively. After annihilation, two photons are produced, both with the same energy, and their directions are symmetric about the x-axis (one moving upper-right and the other lower-right). The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Step 1: Initial Energy and Momentum
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = (\gamma_e + \gamma_p) m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]
The total momentum before annihilation is the sum of the momenta of the electron and positron. Using the relativistic momentum formula $p = \gamma m v$, we calculate:
- For the electron: $\gamma_e = 4$, $v_e = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}c \approx 0.968c$, so $p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e \cdot 0.968c = 3.872 m_e c$.
- For the positron: $\gamma_p = 2$, $v_p = -\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c \approx -0.866c$, so $p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e \cdot (-0.866c) = -1.732 m_e c$.

Thus, the total initial momentum is:
\[
P_{\text{initial}} = p_e + p_p = 3.872 m_e c - 1.732 m_e c = 2.14 m_e c.
\]

### Step 2: Energy and Momentum After Annihilation
After annihilation, the two photons have equal energies, $E_1 = E_2 = E$. Since the total energy is conserved:
\[
2E = E_{\text{initial}} = 6 m_e c^2 \implies E = 3 m_e c^2.
\]
For photons, energy and momentum are related by $E = pc$, so the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c.
\]

The photons are moving symmetrically in the upper-right and lower-right directions, making angles $\theta$ and $-\theta$ with the x-axis. The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
P_{\text{final}} = (p \cos\theta, p \sin\theta) + (p \cos\theta, -p \sin\theta) = (2p \cos\theta, 0).
\]

### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum
Momentum is conserved, so the total momentum after annihilation must equal the total momentum before annihilation:
\[
2p \cos\theta = P_{\text{initial}} = 2.14 m_e c.
\]
Substituting $p = 3 m_e c$:
\[
2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cdot \cos\theta = 2.14 m_e c \implies 6 \cos\theta = 2.14 \implies \cos\theta = \frac{2.14}{6} \approx 0.3567.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.3567) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
The photons are moving at angles $\theta$ and $-\theta$ relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:
\[
\Delta\theta = \theta - (-\theta) = 2\theta = 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

ANSWER: C
