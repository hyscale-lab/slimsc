Okay, so I have this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is a complex quantity, and the imaginary part is related to the cross-section or something like that. 

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. All right, so I think for the imaginary part, I need to sum over all the phase shifts multiplied by the appropriate factors. Wait, I think the formula is something like Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum over l of (2l+1) * sin(δ_l). Oh wait, but wait, wait—no, I might be mixing things up. Or is it the sum of (2l+1) times the phase shifts?

Wait, the scattering amplitude f is given by a partial wave expansion. The partial wave amplitudes are f_l, and the total amplitude f is the sum over l of f_l * (2l+1) * (sin δ_l / (2ik)), where k is the wave number. So the imaginary part of f would come from the imaginary parts of each f_l. 

But wait, f_l is given by something like r_l e^{iδ_l}, right? So the imaginary part of f is the sum over l of the imaginary part of f_l multiplied by (2l+1) times the factor. Let
