Okay, I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to think through it step by step. So, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E=-J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT).

Wait, but first, I should figure out all possible states and their corresponding energies. Since there are three spins, each with two possible states, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. That makes sense.

Let me list all the possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and compute the energy for each.

The spins can be either +1 or -1. So, the possible states are all combinations of these. For each state, I'll compute S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me make a table:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum is 3 → E = -J*(3) = -3J

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum is 1-1-1= -1 → E= J*1 → +J

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 → sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1 → E= +J

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → sum -1-1+1 =-1 → E=+J

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1 → sum -1-1+1 =-1 → E=+J

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
   S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1 → sum -1 +1 -1 =-1 → E=+J

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1 → sum 1-1-1= -1 → E=+J

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
   S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum 3 → E= -3J

Wait, so looking at the energies:

States 1 and 8 have E = -3J. Each of the other 6 states has E=+J.

So the energies are either -3J or +J.

Now, the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E). So each state contributes exp(β * E) because E is -J(...), so -β E becomes positive.

Wait, more precisely, E = -J(...), so -β E = β J(...). Let me compute each term.

For the two states with E = -3J, the contribution is exp(β *3J) each.

Wait wait, wait. Let me recheck. The partition function term is exp( - β E ), right? Because Z is sum_{s} exp( -β E(s) ).

So E(s) is -J * (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So for state 1, E is -3J. So -β*E is +3Jβ. So the term is exp(3Jβ).

Similarly, for states 2 through 7, each has E=+J. So exp(-β * J) → exp(-Jβ).

Wait no, wait, wait. No, wait! Let me think again. Wait for each state, E is calculated, and then the term is exp( -β E ). So for state 1, E is -3J → term is exp( 3Jβ ). For states 2-7, E is +J → term is exp(- Jβ ). And state
