Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some immunology processes. Hmm, let's think through it. The question involves tagging inner capsid proteins with GFP and delivering them to mice. Then they observed fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid and some getting stuck in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They isolated proliferating cells from the Peyer patches and found high variability in the variable heavy chain genes. The question is asking which process is happening.

Wait, so Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen, right? So when the rotavirus proteins are given orally, they're taken up by these patches.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. Stomach acid probably destroys some because it's a harsh environment. But some make it through and get to the Peyer patches. Once there, the antigens are taken up by antigen-presenting cells, like M cells or dendritic cells. Then these cells present the antigens to T and B cells.

The cells they isolated are proliferating, so they're likely activated B cells. When B cells get activated, they undergo several processes. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes suggests something is causing mutations in the B cell receptor genes.

So the options are:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This process occurs during the generation of B and T cell receptors, especially after activation. It introduces point mutations, increasing diversity. This happens in the germinal centers where B cells proliferate.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the immune response, but it's more about marking pathogens for destruction, not about gene variability.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but it doesn't increase variability in the antigen-binding site. It happens after the variable regions are set.

D) VDJ recombination: That's during the initial formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow. It's the process of joining V, D, and J segments to create diversity. But once a B cell has its receptor, this process doesn't happen again unless in certain contexts like during lymphocyte development.

Wait, so after the B cells are activated and enter the germinal centers, they undergo somatic hypermutation. This process increases the diversity of the variable regions, leading to higher affinity antibodies. High variability in the variable heavy chain would be due to somatic hypermutation.

So the process observed is somatic hypermutation. Therefore, the answer should be A.


The question involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and observing their fate in mice. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, where they are taken up by antigen-presenting cells and activate B cells. The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes of the proliferating cell population isolated from the Peyer patches suggests a process that increases genetic diversity in the B cell receptors.

- **Option A (somatic hypermutation):** This process occurs in germinal centers during B cell activation. It introduces point mutations into the variable regions of B cell receptors, increasing diversity and affinity. The observed high variability aligns with this mechanism.
- **Option B (complement activation):** While complement activation is part of the immune response, it does not directly contribute to the variability in the variable heavy chain genes.
- **Option C (class switching recombination):** This process alters the class of antibody produced (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not increase variability in the antigen-binding site.
- **Option D (VDJ recombination):** This process generates initial diversity during B cell receptor formation in the bone marrow but does not occur in mature B cells after activation.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs in activated B cells in germinal centers. 

Answer: A
