Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. The question is about isomers, specifically focusing on tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers can be constitutional or stereoisomers. But the question is about two parts, A and B, each involving different compounds.

Let's break down part A. The question is asking which of the two compounds doesn't show tautomerism. The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Wait, what's tautomerism again? Oh right, it's when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, like in keto-enol tautomerism. So, if a compound has adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups or something, it can tautomerize.

Benzoquinone—I think that's a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups opposite each other on the benzene ring. Wait, but for tautomerism, you usually need a conjugated system with adjacent carbonyls. Benzoquinone has two carbonyls separated by a single bond, perhaps. Wait, no, benzoquinone (like para-benzoquinone) is O=C6H4=O. So two ketone groups on opposite positions. I don't think it can undergo tautomerism because the structure is O=C6H4=O. If I tried to shift any hydrogen, like from the ring, would that form an enol? But the ring is aromatic. Alternatively, maybe not—because the positions are such that any shift would require a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl. Wait, benzoquinone doesn't have hydrogens adjacent to the carbonyl groups because they're on the benzene ring. Oh wait, no, the carbonyl groups are directly attached to the benzene ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached to the carbonyl carbon. So maybe benzoquinone doesn't have any alpha hydrogens, which are necessary for keto-enol tautomerism. So it can't undergo tautomerism. That would mean that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Then, what about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione? That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,
