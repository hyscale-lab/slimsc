Okay, so I've got this genetics question here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a barley cultivar that's resistant to drought but has an anti-nutritional compound. The problem is that this compound makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and sequenced the target gene in all of them. The changes are in the first exon area.

The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the idea is that if the gene's function is disrupted, the compound won't be synthesized. So, the mutations that cause a loss of function would be the desired ones.

Looking at the intact gene and the mutants, I need to see which mutations cause a frameshift or a premature stop codon, which would likely disrupt the gene's function.

Let's look at each mutant:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Comparing to the intact gene, let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for differences. Let me count the nucleotides.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to see where the mutations are. The question says the changes are at the beginning of the sequence, so first exon. So the mutations must be in the first part.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Let's compare each position. Intact has ...TTCTCG... I think the first few changes are in the third codon. Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let's look at the sequences:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So, in the intact gene, the next part after ATG is TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), etc. In Mutant1: after TTT, it's CTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), etc. So the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu) — same amino acid. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the actual sequences.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the sequences:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So the beginning of the sequence in the first exon, perhaps in the third codon. Let me see each base:

Intact: 5’ ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA 3’
Mutant1: 5’ ATG TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA 3’

Looking at the third codon: Intact is CTC (Leu), Mutant1 is CTA (Leu). No change in amino acid. Wait, that's a silent mutation. Wait, but maybe it's a different position.

Wait, perhaps I should look for insertions or deletions. Because if there are indels, that can cause frameshifts. Let's see.

Count the number of nucleotides in each mutant's first part.

Wait, the question says all sequences are the same except for the mutations. So perhaps the mutations are SNPs, not indels.

Wait, the question says "changes at the beginning of its sequence in the first exon area." So maybe it's a substitution that affects the reading frame.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Looking at the sequences, their first part is ATG TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So, let me count the number of nucleotides after the ATG.

ATG is 3, then TTT is 3 (6), then CT is 2? No, because each codon is three bases. So perhaps the third codon is altered.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's look for the exact mutations.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the presence of a stop codon, as that would eliminate the protein, thus the compound.

A stop codon is one of UAA, UAG, or UGA. Since the reading frame matters, any mutation that creates a stop codon early would disrupt the gene.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The sequence is ATG TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... Let me see if any codon becomes a stop.

Looking at the third codon: TTT is Phe, then CT ACG — wait, CT ACG would be CT (Leu) and then ACG (Thr)? Wait, perhaps the third codon is altered. Or maybe the reading frame shifts.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is an insertion or deletion. Let me see. If it's a substitution, it's a point mutation.

Let me check each mutant for any possible stop codon.

Mutant 1: Let me look at the amino acids.

Intact: After ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), … TGA (stop).

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA.

Wait, the third codon is CTC in intact, but in mutant1, it's CT ACG. Wait, that would be a substitution. Wait, perhaps I should line them up.

Wait, perhaps the first 12 bases of the intact gene: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT ...

Mutant1: 5' ATG TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT ...

So, the third and fourth codons are different. Let's count the bases:

Intact: positions 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CTC, 10-12: GCT, 13-15: GGT, etc.

Mutant1: 1-3: ATG, 4-6: TTT, 7-9: CT A (so 7-9 is CT A? No, because 7-9 would be the third codon. Wait, perhaps the third codon is altered. Wait, perhaps the third codon is CTC in the intact, but in mutant1, it's CTA? No, looking at the sequences, maybe the third codon is CTA in mutant1. Let me see:

Intact: ...CTC GCT...
Mutant1: ...CTA CGC...

Wait, perhaps in the third codon, the third base is changed. Let's see:

Intact: CTC (Leu) → C, T, C.

Mutant1: CTA (Leu) → C, T, A. So same amino acid, no change. Then, next codon: GCT in intact becomes CGC in mutant1.

GCT is Ala (codon GCT), and CGC is Arg. So that's a change from Ala to Arg. Not a stop codon, so no effect on the protein's termination.

So, mutant1 doesn't introduce a stop codon. So probably not the right choice.

Mutant2:

5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So compare to intact:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant2: ...CTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm, let me line it up:

Intact: CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant2: CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, so their third codon is CTC in intact, which is Leu. In mutant2, it's CTA (Leu again?), then AGC is Ser, TGG is Trp, TAC is Tyr, TCT is Ser, etc.

Wait, so the third codon is CTA (Leu), then the next codon would be AGC (Ser), but in the intact gene, the next codon after CTC is GCT (Ala).

So, the third codon is same as mutant1, and the next codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So, point mutations but no stop codons.

So, no stop introduced. So, not likely to eliminate the compound.

Mutant3:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, how does that line up? Let me see:

After ATG, it's TTT (Phe), then TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), etc.

Wait, so the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant3, it's TTA (Leu again, same amino acid). Then next codon: GCT (Ala) becomes CGC (Arg). Then GGT becomes TGG (Trp) — different amino acid. Wait, but more importantly, is there any stop codon in the mutant3 sequence?

The reading frame is still the same, right? Because it's a substitution. So, any stop codon would have to be within the same frame.

Looking at the sequence: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, the third codon is TTA (Leu), fourth is CGC (Arg), fifth is TGG (Trp), sixth is TGT (Cys), seventh is CAC (His), eighth is TCT (Ser), ninth is GTG (Val), tenth is GAT (Asp), eleventh is GAA (Glu), and so on until TGA.

Wait, the last two codons in the provided sequences are TGT CGT in intact, and TGT CGT in mutant3? Or does mutant3 have ...GTCGT...?

Wait, looking again:

Mutant3: ...GTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, after the initial changes, I see ...TGT CAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So, the codons after the initial substitution would be TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc., ending with TGA (stop). So the TGA is still intact as the stop codon. So, the presence of TGA remains but is further downstream. So, mutant3 may not have any stop codon introduced early. So, probably not the desired mutation.

Wait, unless a mutation introduced an earlier stop codon. Let me check each codon in mutant3.

After the first few codons, is any of them a stop? Let's see.

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), … TGA (stop).

So, no stop codon before the original TGA. So, the protein might be longer, but not terminated early. So, possibly a missense mutation but not a loss of function.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Hmm, let's compare:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the third codon and beyond are different.

Breaking it down:

Intact: CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Mutant4: TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Wait, let me see the exact sequence:

Mutant4: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, the third codon is TTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then TAC (Tyr), then TCT (Ser), etc.

Wait, but wait, after the ATG, the first codon is TTT (Phe), second is TTA (Leu), third is CGC (Arg), fourth is TAC (Tyr), fifth is TCT (Ser), and so on.

So, the third codon is CGC (Arg), fourth is TAC (Tyr). But in the intact gene, after the second codon (GCT, Ala), the third is GGT (Gly), and so on.

So, in mutant4, perhaps the third codon is CGC, then TAC.

Wait, but looking at the entire sequence from the beginning:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, after TTT, the next in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant4 it's TTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), then TAC (Tyr), then TCT (Ser), etc.

So, the third and fourth codons are changed. Let's see if any of these changes introduce a stop codon.

Wait, the original sequence had TGA as the stop. In mutant4, does any codon become a stop earlier?

Looking at the codons:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), … TGA (still at the end).

So, no stop codon introduced early. So, the protein would be longer, but not truncated.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let's look for indels. Because if the mutation is an insertion or deletion, that could cause a frameshift, leading to a premature termination codon.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant3: ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, maybe I should count the number of nucleotides in each mutant's beginning.

For instance, if in the first exon, an insertion or deletion occurs, the reading frame would shift.

Looking at mutant4's sequence:

Looking at the beginning, the intact gene had five exons. The first exon's sequence after ATG is as given.

In mutant4, the first part is ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT ... So, perhaps it's a deletion or insertion.

Wait, let's count the number of nucleotides in the first part of each mutant.

Intact: let's count the first 15 nucleotides after ATG:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT → 3*5=15.

Mutant4: TTT TTA CGC TAC → 3*4=12.

Wait, perhaps there's a deletion. Because in the intact gene, it's 15, but mutant4 shows 12? Or maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, perhaps I should write the sequences.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Wait, let me count the number of nucleotides after ATG.

Intact: 3 (ATG) + 3 (TTT) + 3 (CTC) + 3 (GCT) + 3 (GGT) + 3 (ACT) → 3+3+3+3+3+3=18.

Mutant4's first part: 3 (ATG) +3 (TTT) +3 (TTA) +3 (CGC) +3 (TAC) +3 (TCT) → 18. Hmm, same length.

So no indel. Must be substitutions.

Wait, another approach: looking for any of the mutants that have a frameshift, which would cause a premature stop.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation elsewhere.

Wait, another thought: maybe the gene is expressed, and any frameshift causing a stop codon would disrupt the gene. So, if a mutation causes a shift in the reading frame and introduces a stop codon earlier, that would be good.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: No frameshift, substitutions but no stop codon.

Mutant2: No frameshift, substitutions but no stop.

Mutant3: No frameshift, substitutions but no early stop.

Mutant4: No frameshift, but wait, let me look again.

Wait, mutant4's sequence is ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

So, the first few codons are TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), then GTG (Val), etc.

In the intact gene, after TTT (Phe), it's CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

So, in mutant4, from position 7-9: CGC (Arg), then TAC (Tyr) instead of GCT (Ala) and GGT (Gly) in the intact. So substitution, not frameshift. So, no frameshift, no stop codon.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 is a deletion of a nucleotide, leading to a frameshift. Let's check.

Looking at the sequences again:

Intact: ...CTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides. Let's see:

Intact after ATG:

1-3: TTT

4-6: CTC

7-9: GCT

10-12: GGT

13-15: ACT

16-18: TCT

And so on.

Mutant4:

1-3: TTT

4-6: TTA

7-9: CGC

10-12: TAC

13-15: TCT

16-18: GTG

So, the same length. So no frameshift.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Another angle: perhaps the anti-nutritional compound is caused by a specific domain in the protein. If the gene is knocked out, the compound isn't made. So, which mutation would completely disrupt the gene?

If any of the mutations introduces a stop codon early, that would truncate the protein.

Looking back:

Wait, in the intact gene, the last codon is TGA (stop). So, if in any mutant, a TGA appears earlier, that would cause a stop.

Looking at the provided sequences. Let me check each mutant for any occurrence of TGA before the end.

Intact has TGA at the end.

Mutant1: ...CGC…TGA. So, same as before.

Mutant2: ...CGC…TGA.

Mutant3: ...CGT…TGA.

Mutant4: ...CGT…TGA.

So, none of the mutations introduce an earlier TGA, except the original one.

Wait, but wait: perhaps a mutation changes a codon into a stop.

Looking again:

Mutant4: The fifth codon is TAC (Tyr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), then GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc., with TGA at the end.

So, no earlier stop.

Mutant3: Looking at the codons, after TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc., and then TGA.

No early stop.

Mutant2: The third codon is CTA (Leu), next is AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), etc. No stop before TGA.

Mutant1: No stop before. So, none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon.

Wait, but maybe a mutation causes a frameshift that leads to a stop codon. Let's reevaluate each mutant for possible indels.

Looking at the sequences again:

Mutant1: Length same as intact. So no frameshift.

Mutant2: Same length? Let me check.

Intact: Let's count the first part.

After ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

That's 3+3+3+3+3+3+3 = 21 nucleotides.

Mutant1: TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, perhaps not. Maybe I'm miscounting.

Wait, let me count the letters: in the first part, how many letters are there.

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA → each is 3 letters, so 3*8=24.

Mutant1: TTT CT ACG C GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA → 3 + 2 +3 +1 + ... Wait, this doesn't seem right because each codon must be 3 nucleotides. So perhaps the alignment is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is an insertion or deletion, causing a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, there's a deletion of a nucleotide, causing a frameshift.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Let me compare the sequences more carefully.

Intact: ...TTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TTCTGTGGAT...

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing it. Another approach: think about which mutation would most likely disrupt the gene, perhaps through a frameshift leading to a premature stop.

Looking at each mutant, only Mutant4 seems to have a different codon structure that could potentially cause a frameshift.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a change in the number of nucleotides in the sequence. For example, an insertion or deletion that changes the reading frame.

Looking at Mutant4: Its sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

The intact is 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, comparing the initial part:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, so in the intact, after TT, comes CT CGC TGG TAC TCT ...

In mutant4, after TT, it's TT TAC GCT ACT TCT ...

So, perhaps in the intact, it's CT CGC TGG TAC.

In mutant4, it's TAC GCT ACT.

So, perhaps a substitution that changes several codons. Doesn't seem to be frameshift.

Wait, another thought: perhaps a deletion of a base would cause a frameshift, leading to a shorter reading frame and an early stop. For example, a deletion of one or two nucleotides would shift the reading frame.

Looking for any mutations that have a different length.

Wait, let me count the number of letters in each mutant's sequence.

Assuming the target gene is the same length, any difference in length indicates an indel.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: The sequence has ...CGT… which is same as the intact, so same length.

Mutant2: Ends with ...CGC… same as intact.

Mutant3: Ends with ...CGT… same length.

Mutant4: Ends with ...CGT… same length.

Hmm, all same length. So no indels, meaning no frameshifts. So all mutations are substitutions.

If all are substitutions, then the only way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is to disrupt the gene's function. That could be done by a nonsense mutation (introducing a stop codon) or a missense mutation that disrupts a critical region.

Looking for any mutation that introduces a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) early.

Looking at the sequences again:

Mutant1: Ends with ...CGC… before TGA. So no stop.

Mutant2: Ends with ...CGC… before TGA.

Mutant3: Ends with ...CGT… before TGA.

Mutant4: Ends with ...CGT… before TGA.

So, in all, none of the mutations introduce a stop codon before the original one.

Wait, unless I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps one of the codons in the mutants becomes a stop codon. For example, if a codon is mutated to UAA, UAG, or UGA.

Looking for any of the mutant sequences where a codon becomes a stop.

Mutant1:

Looking at each codon:

TTT (Phe), CT A (Wait, no, each codon is 3 bases. So after TTT, it's CTA (Leu), then CGC (Arg), etc.

No stop in any of the codons.

Mutant2:

TTT (Phe), CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), etc. No stop.

Mutant3:

TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc. No stop.

Mutant4:

TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc. No stop.

So, none of the mutations introduce a stop codon early. That suggests that perhaps the correct approach is to look for a frameshift that causes a stop codon.

Wait, but earlier I thought all have the same length, so no frameshift.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in that assessment. Let me recheck.

Looking at Mutant4's sequence again:

Intact: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Comparing base by base:

Intact: positions 4-21: T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T

Mutant4: T T T T A C G C T A C T T C T G T G G A T

Wait, perhaps the number of letters is same. Let me count each.

Intact after ATG has:

TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT → Let's see: TTCTC (5) GCTGG (5) TACTT (5) CTGTG (5) GAT → Wait, perhaps I'm not counting correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for insertions or deletions.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the gene is in a region where a point mutation disrupts a critical site, such as the start codon or a splice site.

Looking at the start codon: all mutants have ATG, so the start is intact.

Alternative idea: perhaps a mutation in the splice site. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon, so maybe intron-exon boundaries aren't involved here.

Wait, but the question says the changes are in the first exon, so perhaps a mutation in the exon doesn't affect splicing but affects the protein.

Wait, if a substitution leads to a nonfunctional enzyme, that would be good. But without a stop codon, the protein would be longer but potentially nonfunctional.

But the question is asking which mutation 'will most probably let you eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.' So, it's about disrupting the gene's function.

Another thought: perhaps the gene is a regulatory gene, but the question says it's the gene for the anti-nutritional compound. So, disrupting it would stop the compound.

So, any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would work. If a mutation creates a premature stop, that's good. If the mutation is a missense but disrupts a critical domain, that's also good.

But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best bet is to look for a frameshift that introduces a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps mutant4 has a frameshift. Let me see:

Mutant4: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing the correct alignment.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutant has a frameshift leading to a stop codon.

But all sequences appear to have the same length, so no frameshifts.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think differently.

If the gene's structure is five exons and four introns, the exons are spliced together. The mutations are in the first exon.

Looking for a mutation that disrupts the reading frame of the first exon, leading to a premature stop.

In that case, perhaps a frameshift mutation in the first exon would cause the entire downstream sequence to be misread, leading to a stop codon.

Looking again for any indels.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, there's a deletion of one or two nucleotides.

Looking at the sequences again:

Intact: ...TTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant4: ...TTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, no, same sequence. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe in Mutant3, a substitution leads to a stop codon.

Wait, let me re-examine Mutant3.

Mutant3's sequence: ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...

So, after ATG, TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TGG (Trp), TGT (Cys), CAC (His), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Wait, but in the intact gene, after TTT (Phe), it's CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

So, in Mutant3, after Phe, it's Leu, Arg, Trp, Cys, His, Ser, Val, Asp, etc. The codons are different but no stop.

Wait, but perhaps the fourth codon in Mutant3 is TGG (Trp), which is different from GCT (Ala) in intact. So, a substitution, but no stop.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a point. The correct answer is a mutation that creates a stop codon in the same reading frame, or a frameshift leading to a stop.

Since all mutations are substitutions, perhaps the correct answer is the one where a stop codon is introduced.

Wait, but in none of the mutants is a stop codon present except the original one.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe a mutation creates a stop codon in a different frame, but that's less likely to disrupt the gene's function.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider which mutation leads to a frameshift. But earlier I thought all have the same length.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of nucleotides in the sequences.

Intact sequence: Let's count the first part.

ATG (3) + TTT (3) + CTC (3) + GCT (3) + GGT (3) + ACT (3) + TCT (3) + GTG (3) + GAT (3) + GAA (3) + CAT (3) + ATT (3) + TAT (3) + TGT (3) + CGT (3) → 3+3*14=45.

Mutant1: ATG (3) + TTT (3) + CT ACG ... Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps all mutants are same length.

Since all seem same length, no frameshift, so perhaps the only way is to find a mutation that creates a stop codon.

But I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Another approach: look for a change in the sixth codon or so, where a stop codon might be formed.

Wait, another thought: perhaps a mutation leads to a stop codon in another reading frame. But that's less likely to disrupt the gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it disrupts the structure in a way that the gene is nonfunctional.

Wait, looking back at the options:

The choices are A) Mutant2, B) Mutant3, C) Mutant1, D) Mutant4.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it introduces a stop codon. Let me check again.

In Mutant4, looking at the sequence:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ... So, the codons are:

1. ATG → start
2. TTT → Phe
3. TTA → Leu
4. CGC → Arg
5. TAC → Tyr
6. TCT → Ser
7. GTG → Val
8. GAT → Asp
9. GAA → Glu
10. CAT → His
11. ATT → Ile
12. TAT → Tyr
13. TGT → Cys
14. CGT → Arg
... TGA → stop.

No stop codon before the end, so no early stop.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find which mutation disrupts the gene's function through a missense mutation in a critical region.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a large change in the first exon, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes a codon from CTC to CTA (Leu to Leu), so no change, and CGC (Ala to Arg). So, that's a substitution but doesn't introduce a stop.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers. The options are A (Mutant2), B (Mutant3), C (Mutant1), D (Mutant4).

Looking at the sequences, perhaps Mutant4 has a deletion that causes a frameshift.

Wait, let me count the letters again for each mutant.

Intact first part: Let's take the first 12 nucleotides after ATG.

Intact: TTT CTC GCT → 9 nucleotides.

Mutant4: TTT TTA CGC → 9 nucleotides.

So same length. So no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a large portion of the codons in the beginning, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes the third codon to CTA (Leu) and the fourth to CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Ala) and GGT (Gly). So, the reading frame remains the same but the amino acids change. But unless it's a critical region, it might not eliminate the compound.

Wait, considering all, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a substitution that affects the open reading frame earlier, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant3, which changes the fourth codon from GCT (Ala) to CGC (Arg), and the fifth from GGT (Gly) to TGG (Trp). But without knowing the structure, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps another approach: think about what each mutation does.

The question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. The gene is responsible for synthesizing it. So, any mutation that disrupts the gene's function will do.

If the mutation leads to a premature stop codon, the protein will be truncated, possibly nonfunctional.

Looking for any mutation that introduces a stop codon.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me check each mutant's sequence again for the presence of TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Mutant4's sequence:

Looking at each codon:

ATG (start), TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), … TGA (stop).

So, no stop codon before TGA. So, the protein would be longer, but not stopped early.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that all have the same length. Let me check the number of letters in each mutant's sequence.

Intact: let's see, the given sequence is 74 nucleotides long (from ATG to ...TGA). So, 74 nucleotides after ATG, but that's not correct because ATG is the start.

Wait, perhaps the entire sequence is 74 nucleotides, including ATG.

Wait, the intact gene is 74 nt: ATG (3) + 71 nt.

But perhaps all mutants are same length, so no frameshift.

So, I'm stuck. Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes a key part of the gene, like a splice site, but the question says the mutations are in the first exon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the gene has a promoter region or other regulatory elements, but the question doesn't mention that the mutations are in regulatory regions. The mutations are in the first exon.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because of a nonsense mutation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sixth codon is TAC (Tyr), which is different from GCT (Ala) in the intact. No stop.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes the third codon to CTA (Leu) and the fourth to CGC (Arg), which could disrupt the function.

But without knowing the exact function, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one with a mutation that could cause a frameshift. But earlier I thought all are same length.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, one of the codons becomes a stop.

Wait, let me see:

Mutant4 sequence: ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Looking for any triplet that is TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking at the sequence:

TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

The triplet TAC is Tyr, TCT is Ser, GTG is Val, GAT is Asp, GAA is Glu. No stop codons.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1.

But I'm not making progress. I'll have to make an educated guess.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. The best way is to disrupt the gene's function. A frameshift leading to a premature stop is ideal.

But all mutations are substitutions, so perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon, but I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Looking at Mutant4 again.

Mutant4's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, ...TTACGCTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it correctly.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a mutation that causes the gene to produce a truncated protein.

Wait, but I'm not seeing a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a substitution that disrupts the gene's function, even if it doesn't introduce a stop codon. For example, a missense mutation in a critical region.

But without knowing the structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it's the only one with a mutation that could disrupt the gene enough.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the reading frame, but earlier analysis says no.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the intended answer is Mutant4, option D.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This can occur through a frameshift mutation (causing a premature stop codon) or a missense mutation in a critical region of the protein. The question provides four mutant sequences, and the goal is to analyze each for potential functional disruption.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:

1. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`
   - Compared to the intact gene, the third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `CTA` (Leu), and the fourth codon changes from `GCT` (Ala) to `CGC` (Arg). These are point mutations, and no stop codon is introduced. The reading frame remains intact, so this mutation is unlikely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

2. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`
   - The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `CTA` (Leu), and the fourth codon changes from `GCT` (Ala) to `AGC` (Ser). These are also point mutations, and no stop codon is introduced. The reading frame remains intact, so this mutation is also unlikely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`
   - The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TTA` (Leu), and subsequent codons are altered. However, no stop codon is introduced, and the reading frame remains intact. While some amino acids are changed, there is no evidence of a frameshift or an early stop codon, making this mutation less likely to disrupt the gene's function.

4. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`
   - The third codon changes from `CTC` (Leu) to `TTA` (Leu), and subsequent codons are altered. Notably, the fourth codon changes from `GCT` (Ala) to `CGC` (Arg), and the fifth codon changes from `GGT` (Gly) to `TAC` (Tyr). These changes disrupt the original sequence significantly. While no stop codon is introduced early, the altered amino acids could disrupt a critical functional region of the protein. This makes Mutant 4 the most likely candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

### Conclusion:
Mutant 4 introduces the most significant changes in the sequence, which could disrupt the gene's function by altering critical regions of the protein. While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, Mutant 4's changes are the most likely to render the gene nonfunctional and eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
