Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the problem is about a star that's similar to the Sun in radius. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotted, when we observe the star's brightness over time (like through photometric observations), we'll see periodic brightness changes as the star rotates. These changes can sometimes look like the presence of an exoplanet. The question is asking: what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet needed to produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve, assuming the star wasn't spotted.

Hmm. So the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to that caused by a transiting exoplanet. I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star.

In this case, the spots are causing the brightness variation. The spots are cooler, so when they're facing us (as the star rotates), they make the star appear dimmer. The effect is similar to a planet blocking light, but the cause is different. So the question is about equating the two effects in terms of the observed brightness variation.

First, I need to figure out the amplitude of the brightness change caused by the spots. Then, I'll compare that to what a planet would cause and solve for the planet's radius.

The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, R_sun. Let's denote R_star = R_sun.

The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Wait, the filling factor is 20%—does that mean 20% of the hemisphere's surface is covered by spots? So each hemisphere (northern and southern, perhaps) has some spots.

Wait, no. The problem says one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. So the entire hemisphere has 20% of its surface area covered by spots. Since the star is a sphere, each hemisphere has a surface area of 2πR² (since the surface area of a sphere is 4πR², each hemisphere is half that, so 2πR²). So the area covered by spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR².

But wait, the star is rotating, and only one hemisphere is spotted. So as it rotates, the spotted hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So the maximum effect would be when the entire spotted area is facing us. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Wait, the problem says it's a single hemisphere, so maybe only one side has spots. So as the star spins, we see the spotted side moving in and out of view.

But wait, the star's rotation period would cause the brightness to vary as the spots come into and go out of view. The maximum dip would occur when the entire spotted
