Okay, so I've got this crystallography problem here, and I'm a bit rusty on my interplanar distances, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about a rhombohedral crystal. I remember that a rhombohedral structure is a type of crystal lattice where all the edges are of equal length, and all the angles between the edges are the same. So in this case, the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. Oh right, and the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance in a crystal usually refers to the lattice parameter, which is the edge length of the unit cell. So a is 10 Angstrom.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I recall that the formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by:

d_{hkl} = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) ) )

Wait, is that right? Or was it a different form? Alternatively, another formula comes to mind involving the reciprocal of the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. Oh wait, the formula I have in my notes is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) - 2(hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α)/(a²)

Wait, no, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) )

Wait, but since in a rhombohedral crystal, all the angles are equal. So alpha = beta = gamma = 30 degrees. That might simplify things.

So the Miller indices here are h=1, k=1, l=1 for the (111) plane.

Plugging in the values:

d = a / sqrt( (1² + 1² + 1²) + 2(1*1 cos 30) + 2(1*1 cos 30) + 2(1*1 cos 30) )

Let me compute each part step by step.
