Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through carefully. Let's see... The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. Hmm. Wait, parallax is plx, right? I remember that parallax is inversely related to distance. Oh right, because the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So parallax (plx) is 1 over distance (d), or plx = 1/d. But wait, is that in parsecs? Oh yeah, I think parallax in arcseconds is 1 over distance in parsecs. So d = 1/plx.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. They're asking about the number per unit range of distance. Hmm. So if I have a certain volume of space, the number of stars depends on the density and the volume. But I'm not sure about the exact relation here.

The given relation is number ~ 1/plx^5. Wait, let me write that down. So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in: N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Which is the same as N ∝ d^5. Because (1/d)^5 is 1/d^5, so 1 over that is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

But wait, the question is
