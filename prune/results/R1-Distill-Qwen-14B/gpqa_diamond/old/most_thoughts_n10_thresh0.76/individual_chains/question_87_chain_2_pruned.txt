Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says: I have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options A to D.

Hmm, let's break this down. First, the compound is a di-substituted benzene ring. Di-substituted means there are two substituents on the benzene ring. The ring is 6-membered, so that's a benzene ring. It has 8 carbons in total. Wait, benzene is 6 carbons. So the substituents must account for 2 more carbons. Because 6 (from benzene) + substituents = 8. So each substituent is one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is two carbons and the other is zero? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents. So 6 + (x + y) =8, where x and y are the carbon counts of each substituent. So x + y =2. So possibilities are substituents like -CH2- (but that would be a group, not a substituent), or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and the other is a halogen (like -Cl or -Br). Wait, but a carbonyl is a functional group, so that could fit. Let me think.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene ring could be groups like -OCH3 (which is 2 carbons: O and CH3), but that's a possibility. Alternatively, maybe a carbonyl group like -CO-R where R is something.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group. So there's a C=O somewhere. Also, an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen (like Cl, Br, I). So the other substituent is a carbonyl group.

Wait, but benzene has 6 carbons. So substituents: one is a halogen (like Cl, which is one substituent, but adds no carbons), and the other is a carbonyl group. Oh wait, but a carbonyl group is a functional group attached to the ring. So for example, a ketone group attached to the ring. Like a benzophenone but that's two substituents. Wait, but wait, the ring is 6 carbons; substituents must add up to two carbons total.

Wait, maybe the substituents are -CO- and something else. Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and a halogen (like -Cl). But let's think about the structure.

Wait, wait, maybe the substituents are a carb
