Okay, so I've got this question about a Lagrangian in quantum field theory, and I'm trying to figure out what the mass dimension of κ is and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I remember that in QFT, the mass dimension of the coupling constants is important because it tells us whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizable theories have couplings with non-positive mass dimensions, I think. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, a coupling with positive mass dimension would actually make the theory non-renormalizable because higher dimension operators are less relevant or something like that. Or wait, no, wait again. Let me think.

So, the general approach is to assign mass dimensions to the fields and then figure out the dimension of the coupling. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c = 1), and the integral over d^4x gives dimension 4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

In the Lagrangian, each term is like (dimension of the coupling) + (sum of dimensions of the fields) = 4. So for this term, which is L_int, it's the interaction term, so it's part of the Lagrangian.

So the fields involved are ψ (fermion), ψ̄ (conjugate fermion), and F^{μν} which is the field strength tensor of a gauge field, probably the electromagnetic field or something similar. Wait, F^{μν} is like the field tensor for a gauge boson. Let me think about the dimensions.

First, the fermion field ψ has mass dimension 3/2, because in four dimensions, for Dirac spinors, each ψ has [ψ] = 3/2. Because the Lagrangian terms like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ must be dimension 4. So let's see: ψ̄ has dimension 3/2, γ^μ is dimensionless, ∂_μ is dimension 1 (since derivative is ∂/∂x, x has dimension -1, so ∂ has dimension +1). ψ has dimension 3/2. So [ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ] is 3/2 + 1 + 3/2 = 4. Right.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is derived from the gauge field A, which is a vector potential. The field strength is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each A has dimension 1, because the kinetic term is like (∂A)^2. Let's think: [A] = [∂A] / [∂] → [∂A] is dimension 2 (since (∂A) is a term in the Lagrangian, which must be dimension 4; wait no, the term is (∂A)^2, which is [∂A]^2 = 4. So [∂A] is 2. [∂] is 1, so [A] is 2 -1 = 1. So F^{μν} is ∂A → dimension 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, because F_{μν} is like ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ. So each term is dimension [∂][A] = 1 * 1 = 2. So F has dimension 2.

Wait, but wait, when I'm looking at the term F^{μν} in the Lagrangian, it's part of the interaction, so in L_int, which has dimension 4. So let's write out what is in
