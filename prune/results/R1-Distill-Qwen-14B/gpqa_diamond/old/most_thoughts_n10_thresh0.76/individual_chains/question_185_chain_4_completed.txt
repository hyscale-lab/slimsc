Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator and finding its eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question gives the Hamiltonian as H = ε σ · n. Oh right, σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So σ · n is the dot product of the vector of Pauli matrices with the unit vector n. Wait, right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each being 2x2 matrices. So when you take their dot product with n, you're essentially taking a linear combination of them weighted by the components of n.

So H is a 2x2 matrix because each Pauli matrix is 2x2. The eigenvalues of H would be the solutions to the equation H |ψ> = E |ψ>, where E are the eigenvalues.

I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the Pauli matrices are related to the spin operators. The spin operator S is (ħ/2)σ. So if I have H = ε σ · n, I can think of this as a scaled version of the spin component in the direction of n.

Wait, the general form of the Hamiltonian for a spin in a magnetic field is something like H = -γ B · S, where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, and B is the magnetic field. The eigenvalues are then the energy levels, which depend on the spin component along B. So the eigenvalues would be ± (ħ γ B / 2), or something like that.

But in this problem, H is ε σ · n. Let me write out σ · n. Suppose n has components (n_x, n_y, n_z). Then σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

The eigenvalues of a matrix like σ · n would be the same as the eigenvalues of each Pauli matrix scaled and summed, but wait, no, that's not right. Actually, for any vector v, the eigenvalues of σ · v are the eigenvalues of the matrix v_x σ_x + v_y σ_y + v_z σ_z. So I should find the eigenvalues of this matrix.

Alternatively, I remember that the trace of σ · n is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. The trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, so if the trace is zero, the eigenvalues must be λ and -λ, so their sum is zero.

Wait, more specifically, the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. So when you take a linear combination, what's the eigenvalue? Let's think.

Let me think about the Pauli matrices. Each of them individually has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have a linear combination, like σ · n, where n is a unit vector, then the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1. Because each Pauli matrix squares to the identity matrix, and the combination σ · n also squares to the identity. Let me check: (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + ... )^2. Each term squares to the identity, and the cross terms would be σ_i σ_j which are i ε_ijk σ_k, so when summed over, they cancel out because n_i n_j is symmetric and the antisymmetric terms would have i factors. So overall, it's (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I, which is I since n is a unit vector. So (σ · n)^2 = I. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ · n must be ±1.

So the Hamiltonian H is ε times σ · n. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. Since the latter are ±1, the eigenvalues of H are ±ε.

Looking at the options, option B is ±ε. Option C has ε multiplied by ħ/2. But wait, in the Hamiltonian, is there a ħ factor? The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1, but dimensionally, the Hamiltonian has to have units of energy. So if H is ε σ · n, and σ is dimensionless (since the Pauli matrices are dimensionless), then ε must have units of energy. So the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Wait, but wait a second. In spin systems, the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ. So sometimes in the Hamiltonian, you might see factors involving ħ. But in this case, the Hamiltonian is given as ε times σ · n. So the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n, which are ±1, so ±ε.

So the correct answer should be option B: +ε, -ε.


The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices and \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by analyzing the properties of the Pauli spin matrices.

The Pauli matrices \(\vec{\sigma}\) have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). When combined as \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the resulting matrix retains the eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). This is because \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix, ensuring that the eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\).

Since the Hamiltonian is \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) are simply \(\varepsilon\) times the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\), not \(\pm 1\).
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not include a factor of \(\hbar/2\).
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B
