Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it says. The question is about how the number of stars in a region of the sky changes with distance. The given information is that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power, like N ∝ 1/plx^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance in some way.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in the position of a star as seen from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I remember is that distance (in parsecs) is the reciprocal of parallax. So, distance r = 1 / plx. So, plx is 1/r. Therefore, plx = 1/r, which means r = 1/plx.

The question says that N varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that as N ∝ (1/plx)^5. But since plx is 1/r, I can substitute that in. So 1/plx is r, so (1/plx)^5 would be r^5. So N ∝ r^5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the given is N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/r, 1/(plx) is r. So 1/(plx)^5 is r^5. So N is proportional to r^5.

But wait, the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance. Specifically, per unit range of distance, r. So like, if you go from r to r+dr, how does the number of stars in that shell (like a thin spherical shell at distance r with thickness dr) depend on r?

Oh, right! Because when we talk about the number of stars in a region, it's not just N proportional to r^5, but we also have to consider the volume. Because the number of stars depends on how many there are in a certain volume, and that depends on the volume element, which depends on r squared (since it's a spherical shell). Wait, no, the volume element for a shell at radius r with thickness dr is 4π r² dr. So the number of stars in such a shell would be proportional to r² dr if the density is uniform. But wait, here the number isn't uniform
