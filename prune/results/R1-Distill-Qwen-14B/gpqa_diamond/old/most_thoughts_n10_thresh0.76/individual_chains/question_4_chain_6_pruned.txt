Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a hypothetical scenario where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both poles; you can't isolate a single pole. But how does that affect Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations describe how electric and magnetic fields propagate, interact, and behave. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0.
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: divergence of B is zero.
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: curl of E is negative the time derivative of B.
4. Amp√®re's Law with Maxwell's addition: curl of H equals the time derivative of D plus J.

In our universe, the second equation says that the divergence of B is zero. Which implies that there are no isolated magnetic monopoles, right? So if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated poles, that would mean magnetic monopoles exist. Then, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore.

So thinking about that, which equation would change? Definitely the Gauss's Law for magnetism. Because if there are monopoles, the divergence of B would be proportional to the monopole density, similar to how Gauss's Law for electricity works with charge.

Wait, but the question is about which equations in Maxwell's set would look different. The original four equations include Gauss's Law for magnetism (div B =0). So in this scenario, that equation would change. Let me see the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A) The one related to the divergence of the magnetic field. That's exactly the second equation. So that equation would change.

Option B) The ones related to the circulation of the electric field (which is Faraday's Law) and the divergence of B. So Faraday's Law might change? Hmm, wait in our case Faraday's Law is curl E = - dB/dt. If there are magnetic monopoles, does that affect Faraday's Law? Or maybe not. Because Faraday's Law relates E and B fields in a way that's more about how changing B fields induce E fields.

Wait, but wait, if there are magnetic monopoles, then perhaps Maxwell's equations would need to be adjusted in another way. Let me think. If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B would be non-zero, so that equation changes. Also, maybe the curl of E equation would change because in the presence of magnetic current, Faraday's Law would have an additional term.

Wait, in standard Maxwell's equations, Faraday's Law is curl E = -dB/dt. If there are magnetic charges, perhaps there's a magnetic current density. So the equation might become curl E = -dB/dt - J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current.

But wait, in the current form, if monopoles exist, then the equation for the curl of E would change because it would involve the magnetic current. So that would affect Faraday's Law. So which equations are different?

So originally, the equations were:

1. div E = rho_e / epsilon_0
2. div B = 0
3. curl E = -dB/dt
4. curl H = dD/dt + J_e

If magnetic monopoles
