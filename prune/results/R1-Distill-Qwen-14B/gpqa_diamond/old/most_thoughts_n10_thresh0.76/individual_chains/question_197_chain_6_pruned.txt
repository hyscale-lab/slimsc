Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, and I have to identify the final product. The options are A, B, C, D, which are various substituted benzoic acids and benzene derivatives.

First, I need to figure out what Compound X looks like. They've given IR and NMR data, so I'll have to analyze those to determine the structure.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3400-2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an alkyne or an O-H stretch. Looking more closely, the peak around 3400 is a broad one, which makes me think of an O-H groupâ€”like a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a broad peak around 2500-3300. Also, the peak at 1720 cm-1 is indicative of a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or an ester or maybe a carboxylic acid. But if the O-H is present, that might point to a carboxylic acid because the carbonyl in a carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm-1. Also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the molecule has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the 1H NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5 ppm is typical for an aldehyde proton. But wait, no, aldehyde is usually around 9-10 as a singlet. Alternatively, it could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acids have a broad peak due to hydrogen bonding, often around 10-12 ppm. So this could be a COOH group.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These look like aromatic protons. The doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. So, maybe two substituents on the benzene ring in para positions? Or perhaps one substituent with two protons in each adjacent position. Wait, two doublets each integrating to 2H could mean a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, but the coupling would depend on the substitution pattern. Alternatively, maybe a substituent that causes the aromatic protons to split into two doublets, like a para-substituted group with two substituents in the para position, but that doesn't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mono-substituted benzene with two sets of protons. Hmm, perhaps a substituent in the para position, but that would cause each set of protons to be a pair. Wait, let me think: in a para-substituted benzene, the two protons ortho to the substituent would be a pair, and the two meta would be another pair. So, for example, if the substituent is at position 1, then positions 2 and 6 would be one doublet, and positions 3 and 5 would be another. But wait, in some cases, like when the substituent is strong, the coupling can lead to doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. Wait, but if there were two substituents in the para positions, the aromatic protons would split into more peaks. Maybe it's a single substituent with an ortho and para H. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent that's causing the coupling, like a vinyl group or a substituent that's activating in a certain way.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group. For example, if it's a benzoic acid, then the substituent is a COOH group at the para position. Then, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Let's see: in benzoic acid, the COOH is at position 1, the protons at 2 and 6 would be the ortho, and 3 and 5 would be the meta. But in the case of a para
