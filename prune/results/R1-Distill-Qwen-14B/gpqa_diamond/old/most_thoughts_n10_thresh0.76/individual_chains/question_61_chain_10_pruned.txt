Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let's take it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through each reaction carefully.

The starting material is benzene. The first step is treating it with HNO3 and H2SO4. I remember that nitrating benzene typically involves these reagents. Benzene reacts with concentrated sulfuric acid and nitric acid to form nitrobenzene. So product 1 should be nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a meta director.

Next, product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder. Oh wait, iron is usually a catalyst in bromination, but wait, bromine with iron might be a free-radical substitution. Or, more likely, perhaps it's a substitution where the nitro group directs the incoming bromine. Wait, nitro is a strong meta director. So when we brominate nitrobenzene, the bromine should enter at the meta position relative to the nitro group. So the structure would be meta-bromo-nitrobenzene. Wait, nitro comes in first, then bromine substitution is meta to it. So the benzene would have a nitro group in position 1 and a bromine in position 3. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so the positions are relative. So product 2 would have Br in the position meta to nitro.

Wait, but another thought: when benzene is nitrated, the nitro group is in the para position? No, no, wait. When
