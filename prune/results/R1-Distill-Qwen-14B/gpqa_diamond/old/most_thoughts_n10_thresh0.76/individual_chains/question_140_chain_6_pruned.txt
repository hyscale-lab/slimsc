Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W and forming a precipitate G. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. Plus, X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it has a heavier isotope in one of its elements. The question is asking for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's think about the reaction. X reacts with Y to produce gas W, which has the same number of neutrons and protons. Wait, if W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons, that suggests that each atom in the molecule has equal numbers. So maybe W is a molecule where each atom has an equal number, like maybe H2O has 8 neutrons and 8 protons (for oxygen)? Wait, no, that's not right. Or perhaps another molecule. Wait, let's think about possible gases that are products of such reactions.

Alternatively, maybe W is something like O2, but O2 would have each O atom with 8 protons and 8 neutrons (if it's O-16). So in O2, each molecule has two atoms, each with 8p and 8n. So for each molecule, there are 16p and 16n. But the problem states that the molecule (W) has the same number of neutrons and protons. So 16p and 16n would make that molecule fit. Alternatively, if W is CO2, but that's not likely because the numbers wouldn't match. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: if W is CO. Let's see. C has 6 protons. O has 8. So CO's molecule would have 6+8=14 protons, and 6 + 8 (assuming C is C-12, so 6 neutrons, O is O-16, 8 neutrons) gives 14 neutrons. But 14p and 14n? No, because CO has 14p and 14n? Wait, 6 +8 =1
