Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and going through compounds B, C, D, and finally E. I need to determine what compound E is based on the reaction steps and the given hints.

First, let's break down each reaction step:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 (nitrous acid) to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

Additionally, there are two hints provided:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is at 1715 cm^-1.

Let me think about each part.

Starting with the IR data. The strong peak in A is around 1750 cm^-1. That's a region where carbonyl groups (C=O) absorb. So A likely has a ketone or aldehyde group. But since HCN adds to carbonyl compounds, perhaps A is a ketone? Because HCN typically adds to ketones via a nucleophilic addition.

So, when A reacts with HCN to form B, that suggests a nucleophilic addition. The product could be a cyanohydrin. For example, if A is a ketone, HCN would add to the carbonyl, forming a cyanohydrin (compound B). 

Then, compound B is hydrogenated (H2 with Pd) to form C. Hydrogenation of a cyanohydrin (which has a C≡N group attached to a CH(OH) group) would probably reduce the nitrile group. Wait, but hydrogenation of a nitrile usually requires more specific conditions. Alternatively, maybe I'm thinking about the wrong reaction. Let me think: H2 with Pd is often used for hydrogenation of alkenes or alkynes, but in this case, since B is a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol group and a nitrile.

Wait, perhaps B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group attached. So when B is hydrogenated, perhaps the nitrile is being reduced. Nitriles on hydrogenation with H2 and a catalyst like Pd might form amines, but that's not common. Alternatively, maybe the catalyst is for reducing the nitrile to an amine, but that's not right because H2 and Pd typically don't reduce nitriles directly; perhaps under certain conditions or with other catalysts, like Raney Ni, but maybe I'm getting that mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe B is a ketone that's been converted into a secondary alcohol. Wait, no, because HCN addition would form a cyanohydrin, which is an alcohol and a nitrile. So when H2 and Pd are used, perhaps the nitrile group is being hydrogenated. Let me recall: nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines, but that's typically under high pressure and with a catalyst like Raney Ni. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrile is being converted to an alkane.

Wait, another approach: perhaps B is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group. Then, when you hydrogenate it, perhaps the nitrile is reduced to a methylene group or something else. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted into an amine, but I'm not entirely sure.

Hmm, maybe I should consider the structure of A first. Let's look at the first hint. Hint a says that when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So that product is a cyclopentane ring with substituents. The substituents are methyl groups at positions 1 and 2, a propan-2-ylidene group at position 4.

Wait, what's a propan-2-ylidene group? A ylidene group is like a =CH- group. Propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, I think. Wait, no, wait: propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2. So propan-2-ylidene would be CH2-C(CH3)=, but wait, the structure as a substituent on the cyclopentane would be a cyclopentane ring with a substituent that's a methyl group attached to a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclopentane with a substituent that's a methylene group (like =CH2) but with two methyl groups attached to the carbon of the ylidene.

Wait, the product is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. So the cyclopentane has methyl groups at positions 1 and 2. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a substituent that's an alkenyl group. Propan-2-ylidene would be =CH–CH(CH3)2? No, wait, propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2. The ylidene would be =C–, so propan-2-ylid
