Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, the question is about isomers and some specific compounds. The question has two parts, A and B, and I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, let's understand what the question is asking. The question mentions benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. I need to determine which of these does not exhibit tautomerism. Then, for the second part, between methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, I have to find out which shows optical isomerism.

Wait, what's tautomerism again? Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two atoms, resulting in different structures called tautomers. This usually occurs in compounds with conjugated double bonds or where there are adjacent double bonds and hydrogens that can move. For example, in compounds with enol and keto forms.

So for part A, the compounds are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Let me think about each structure.

Benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone can have two forms: para and ortho. Wait, no, benzoquinone is when benzene has two ketone oxygens attached. Oh wait, actually, benzoquinone is a cyclic structure with two ketone groups. So, it's like O=C6H4=O, but in a ring. Wait, no, wait. No, benzene can't have two ketone groups as adjacent because that would cause some issues. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic di-ketone. So, it's a six-membered ring with two ketone groups opposite each other (para positions). So, its structure is similar to 1,4-benzoquinone.

Now, does benzoquinone exhibit tautomerism? Well, tautomerism typically requires an enol and keto form. Enols have adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups. Benzoquinone has two ketone groups in para positions. Can it undergo tautomerism? Let me think. For tautomerism, you need a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group so that the hydrogen can shift, leading to the formation of an enol. But in benzoquinone, each carbonyl is flanked by two benzene carbons. So, there are no adjacent hydrogens that can shift. Wait, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is connected to a benzene ring. Therefore, each carbonyl is attached to a carbon that's part of the ring. So, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens attached because they're spÂ² hybridized. Therefore, the carbonyl groups in benzoquinone don't have any adjacent hydrogens to shift, so tautomerism isn't possible. So benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe I'm mistaken. Let me think. If the structure is a benzene ring with two ketones, maybe as 1,4-diketone. Each ketone is O=C-R. The
