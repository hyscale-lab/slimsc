Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to walk through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about two reactions and the products formed. Then, when these products are combined, how many peaks do they show on different HPLC columns. Hmm.

First, let's look at Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. Reaction conditions are LAH followed by an acidic workup. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually for ketones and esters. LAH typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the 3-ketone in hexan-3-one would be reduced. Let me draw the structure.

(S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one structure: the chain is six carbons. The ketone is on C3, so positions are 1,2,3,4,5,6. Methoxy is on C5. So, structure is CH2CH2(OCH3)CO... no, wait, more accurately: the molecule is CH2CH2CH(OCH3)CO something. Wait, actually, I think the correct structure is: CH2CH2CH2-C(O)-OCH3? No, wait, 5-methoxy means the methoxy is on C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3? Wait, maybe it's CH2CH2 is positions 1 and 2, then C3 is the ketone (so C3 is a carbonyl group), then C4, C5 (with OCH3), and C6. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-?

Wait, no. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Or wait, hexan-3-one would be pentyl with a ketone on C3. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, hexan-
