Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says the operator is P with components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given as (ħ/2) times a 2x2 matrix. Wait, right, in quantum mechanics, these are spin operators for a spin-1/2 particle, like a muon. So the operator P is probably the spin operator S, but in any case, the same approach should apply.

The question is about finding the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, an arbitrary direction, but lying in the x-z plane. So the direction vector n would have components (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. The eigenvector would be the spin state along this direction.

The operator for a direction n is usually given by the dot product of the vector with the Pauli matrices. So, the operator P would be something like P = (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But wait, since n is in x-z plane, ny=0. So, P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the question is asking for the eigenvector of the operator P along direction n. So first, I need to construct the matrix for P.

Let me write down each component:

Px is (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py is (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P would be n_x * (ħ/2 [[0,1],[1,0]]) + n_z * (ħ/2 [[1,0],[0,-1]] )

But since n is a unit vector, we have n_x^2 + n_z^2 =1.

Now, the eigenvalue equation is P |v> = (ħ/2) |v>, since the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

Wait
