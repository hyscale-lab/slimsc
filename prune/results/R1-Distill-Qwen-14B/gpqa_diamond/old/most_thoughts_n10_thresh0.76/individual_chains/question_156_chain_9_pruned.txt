Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the answer step by step. Let's break it down.

The question is about two reactions involving mCPBA and then aqueous acid. The starting materials are (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Then the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each will show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's a peracid, which I think is commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is when the double bond is converted into an epoxide. So, each of these alkenes will react with mCPBA to form an epoxide.

Wait, though, wait. Epoxidation of alkenes with mCPBA is a stereospecific reaction. For each starting alkene, the configuration of the double bond (E or Z) will influence the product epoxide's stereochemistry. Oh right, because mCPBA is an electrophilic peracid, it adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the alkene.

So, for Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA. Since E is trans, the addition will form a trans epoxide? Or wait, no, the epoxidation leads to a specific configuration. Let me think. The peracid approaches the less substituted side. Wait, no, the peracid adds across the double bond, and the endo transition state leads to the formation of the epoxide. The endo rule says that the peracid's oxygen will add to the more substituted carbon because of better orbital overlap or something. But more importantly, whether the starting alkene is E or Z affects the diastereomer formed.

Wait, when (E)-oct-4-ene is epoxidized, the two substituents on each carbon of the double bond are on opposite sides. So when the epoxide forms, the oxygen adds in a way that the two new oxygen atoms are on the same face or opposite faces.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. (E)-oct-4-ene has the two CH2CH2 groups on opposite sides. So the double bond is between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2 on each side, but trans.

When mCPBA adds, the oxygen comes from the same face (I think that's how it works). So the epoxide that forms will have the oxygen atoms on the same face as the peracid attacks.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's try to visualize. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents on either side are on opposite faces. When mCPBA adds across, the epoxide will form a trans or cis ring? No, wait, the epoxide ring is a three-membered ring with two adjacent oxygen atoms. Wait, no, the epoxide is an ether with two adjacent oxygen atoms connected as a bridge. So the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on how the peracid adds.

Wait, actually, I think that the epoxidation of an alkene with mCPBA leads to a cis addition of the
