Okay, so I've got this question about black holes, entropy, and angular size. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon of a supermassive black hole is θ = 10^-17 degrees, and the galaxy is at a distance d = 10^10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole. The options are from A to D, each with different exponents.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is related to its area. The formula is something like S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, c is the speed of light, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, G is the gravitational constant, and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. But wait, sometimes I've seen it written as S = (k_B c^3 A)/(4 ħ G ℏ), but I think I might be mixing up some terms. Oh wait, actually, the formula is S = (A k_B c^3)/(4 G ħ ℏ) )? Hmm, I might need to check the exact formula, but maybe I can proceed without getting too bogged down in the constants right now.

Alternatively, I think another approach is to use the Schwarzschild radius. The area A is 4π R_s^2, where R_s is the Schwarzschild radius. And R_s is given by (2 G M)/(c^2), where M is the mass of the black hole. So A would be 4π (2 G M / c²)^2. Substituting that into the entropy formula would give S in terms of M.

But wait, maybe I should first find the radius R of the event horizon, then get the mass M from that, and then compute the entropy.

Let me think about how to find R. The angular size θ is given by θ = R / d. Oh wait, no, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ R / d when R is much smaller than d, which it is here because the galaxy is very far. So R ≈ θ * d.

But wait, θ is given in degrees, and I need to convert that into radians because the formula for θ in terms of radians is θ ≈ R/d (
