Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. I remember that in scattering theory, phase shifts are related to the scattering amplitude. 

Wait, right, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed using the partial wave expansion. Oh, right, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) exp(iδ_l - i l π/2) sinδ_l, where l is the orbital angular momentum quantum number, and δ_l are the phase shifts.

But wait, the question specifically asks for the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh, wait, I think when the scattering angle θ is zero, which is the direction of the incident beam. So, when θ approaches zero, the behavior of f(θ) is dominated by the first few terms, maybe.

Wait, but how does the phase shift relate to the scattering amplitude? Oh right, the partial wave expansion for f(θ) in terms of Legendre polynomials might come into play, but perhaps for forward scattering (θ=0), we can approximate it.

Wait, I think for forward scattering, the dominant term comes from the l=0 partial wave. Because for higher l, sin(lπ/2 - δ_l) might not contribute as much at θ=0. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The general expression for the scattering amplitude is:
