Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the minimum energy of a system of charges. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand everything.

Alright, the setup is that there's an isolated system with 13 identical particles, each having a charge of 2e. So each charge is twice the elementary charge. Oh, wait, the elementary charge is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs, so 2e would be 3.2 x 10^-19 C.

Out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. So I'm picturing point P with a charge, and 12 other charges all sitting 2 meters away from it. But wait, the 12 charges are identical and each is 2e, right? Oh, but wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P—so that must be the charge that's at point P. So the 12 charges are each 2e, and the one at P is also 2e? Or is the 13th charge something else?

Wait, the problem says all 13 are identical particles each with charge 2e. So the 13th is also 2e. So the setup is: 1 charge is fixed at point P, and 12 charges are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. But wait, if each of the 12 is 2 meters away from P, then their positions are on a sphere of radius 2 m around P. But since they are constrained, maybe they can't move closer or farther than 2 m.

The question is about the minimum energy of this system. Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system is the electrostatic potential energy. So I remember that the potential energy of a system of point charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential due to the other charges already in place.

Wait, but doing the calculation for 13 charges? That sounds complicated, especially with 12 charges all at the same distance. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Let me think. The system is isolated, so no external fields are influencing it. So the potential energy will be the sum of the potential energies between each pair of charges. Since each charge is 2e, the potential energy between any two charges would be (2e)*(2e)/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between them. But wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P, and the others are 2 meters away from P, but how are the 12 charges arranged relative to each other?

Wait, the 12 charges are all at 2 meters from P, which is where the 13th charge is. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the 13th charge (which is fixed). But what about the distance between the 12 charges themselves? Are they arranged in some regular pattern? Oh, wait, the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to assume that they are all at the same distance from each other as well. Or maybe not—since it's
