Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about the decay of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, I remember that the Lagrangian describes the interaction between fields. Here, X is a bosonic field interacting with fermion fields ψ_f. The λ is probably a coupling constant.

The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing possible fermion-antifermion pairs.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy of the boson must be enough to produce the particles. So, the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermion pair. Because when a particle decays, the rest mass of the decay products can't exceed the mass of the decaying particle.

So, X can decay into a fermion-antifermion pair only if 2m_fermion ≤ m_X. Since m_X is 6 GeV, each fermion in the pair must have mass less than or equal to 3 GeV. Because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV.

Now, I need to recall the masses of the known fermions. Let's think:

- Up quark (u): very light, around 2-5 MeV. So way less than 3 GeV.
- Down quark (d): similar, about 4-8 MeV. Also much less than 3 GeV.
- Strange quark (s): about 95-105 MeV. Also much less than 3 GeV.
- Charm quark (c): around 1.2-1.5 GeV. That's under 3 GeV.
- Bottom quark (b): around 4.1-4.7 GeV. Oh wait, 4.7 is more than 3 GeV. So 4.7 is bigger than 3, so b quarks can't be produced since 2*4.7 is 9.4 GeV which is way more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b bbar.
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV. So no way.

What about leptons? Let's see:

- Electron (e-): mass ~0.511 MeV. So way less than 3 GeV.
- Muon (μ-): ~105.7 MeV. Still under 3 GeV.
- Tau (τ-): ~1.777 GeV. Hmm, 2*1.777 is about 3.554 GeV. Oh wait, that's more than 3 GeV. So tau pairs would require X mass at least 3.554 GeV. Since X is 6 GeV, that's okay. Wait, but wait, 6 GeV is more than 3.554, so tau decay is allowed.

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the tau is about 1.77 GeV. So 2*1.77 is ~3.54 GeV. So since X is 6 GeV, which is more than 3.54, so tau pair decay is allowed.

Wait, but wait another thing. So for each fermion f, m_f is the mass. So for X to decay into f fbar, m_X >= 2m_f.

So let's list the possible fermions:

Possible quarks:
u: 2-5 MeV → 2m_u ~ 4-10 MeV → allowed.
d: 4-8 MeV → 8-16 MeV → allowed.
