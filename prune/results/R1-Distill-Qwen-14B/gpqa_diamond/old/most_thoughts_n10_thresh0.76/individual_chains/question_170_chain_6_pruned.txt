Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, let me think. I've studied a bit about spin states and expectation values, so maybe I can work this out.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, that notation might represent a two-component spinor, right? So I'll write it as a column vector. Let me jot that down: χ = [3i, 4]^T. Or maybe it's [4, 3i]^T? Wait, no, the way the question wrote it is (3i, 4), so the first component is 3i, the second is 4. So χ is a 2x1 vector with 3i on top and 4 at the bottom.

The expectation value of S_y is what we're after. I remember that the spin operator S_y for an electron is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh right, the Pauli matrices. The σ_y matrix is given as:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y is (ħ/2) * σ_y. That makes sense because the spin operators are (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrices.

The expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is calculated as the conjugate transpose (bra) of χ multiplied by S_y multiplied by χ (ket). So mathematically, it would be ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩.

Let me write that out. So first, compute χ† (the conjugate transpose) times S_y times χ.

Breaking it down step by step.

First, compute χ†. Since χ is [3i, 4]^T, the conjugate transpose would be [ -3, 4*], but wait, 4 is a real number, so the conjugate doesn't change it. Wait, 3i's conjugate is -3, right? So χ† is [-3, 4].

Wait, wait, let me double-check: χ is [3i; 4], so row vector would be [3i, 4], and the conjugate would be [ -3, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 stays 4. So χ†
