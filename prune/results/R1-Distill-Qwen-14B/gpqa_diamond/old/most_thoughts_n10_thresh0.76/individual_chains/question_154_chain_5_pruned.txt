Okay, so I've got this question about identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. Hmm, let's see. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at 158 that's 32%. I remember that molecular ion peaks can give clues about the molecular formula and possible fragments. The 156 is the main one, but the 158 is 32%â€”maybe that's a fragment or an isotope?

Looking at the IR data: a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1 likely indicates an O-H stretch, maybe from a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That high value is probably a carbonyl group, like a carboxylic acid or an ester. Wait, carboxylic acids have O-H stretches, which are broad. If it were an ester, the O-H wouldn't be present. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Now the 1H NMR: There's a peak at 11.0 ppm, which is a singlet for 1H. That's a strong downfield shift. I remember that carboxylic acid protons typically show up around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Wait, but wait, in a carboxylic acid, the proton is usually a broad singlet because of hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an aldehyde proton is around 9-10 ppm, but that's a bit lower. Or maybe an aromatic -OH in phenol? No, because that's usually around 7-8, and broad.

Wait, but the other peaks are important too. 8.02 ppm is a doublet with 2H, and 7.72 ppm is another doublet with 2H. This looks like two sets of aromatic protons. Maybe a para-substituted benzene ring? Because in para-substitution, you get two doublets each integrating to 2H. So for example, if the ring has substituents in para positions, like two groups opposite each other.

Putting this together: the molecule has a benzene ring with substituents. The IR indicates a strong carbonyl, possibly a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows a proton at 11 ppm, which could be a carboxylic acid -OH. But wait, in the NMR, the -OH of a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, but here it's a singlet. Hmm, maybe it's an exchange process that's causing it to be sharp, or perhaps it's not a -OH, maybe something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde proton, but that would be lower ppm, like around 9-10.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a phenolic OH. But phenol OHs are usually around 5-6 ppm, and broad. Wait, no, that's not matching. What else could cause a peak at 11 ppm? Maybe an aldehyde proton, but that's usually a bit lower. Alternatively
