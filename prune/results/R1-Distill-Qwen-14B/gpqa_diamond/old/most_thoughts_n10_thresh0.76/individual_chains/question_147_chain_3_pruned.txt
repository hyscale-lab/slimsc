Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an annihilation process involving protons and antiprotons. The reaction given is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. Oh wait, wait, no, the antiproton is moving slowly. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, and they annihilate to produce four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻.

Wait, the mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. I remember that in particle physics, masses are often given in MeV/c², but here it's already multiplied by c², so it's 300 MeV of energy. So the rest mass energy of each A particle is 300 MeV.

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So I need to find the velocity v of each A particle in the final state. The options are given as fractions of the speed of light, like 0.77c, and so on.

Hmm, I think I should start by considering conservation of energy and momentum. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe its speed is much less than the speed of light, so perhaps we can approximate it as non-relativistic. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe it's not at relativistic speeds. But when particles annihilate, energy is converted into other forms, including kinetic energy and
