Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that includes all possible terms beyond the Standard Model, respecting certain symmetries. The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT.

The options are Lorentz symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices given are combinations of these.

Wait, what do I know about these symmetries? Lorentz symmetry is about how the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames and under rotations and boosts. Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations, so it's like the bigger symmetry group. But wait, SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory. Do effective theories require Poincare symmetry? Or is Lorentz enough?

I think in high-energy physics, theories like the Standard Model respect Poincare symmetry because they include translations and Lorentz transformations. Effective theories are usually Lorentz-invariant. So SMEFT operators should respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Poincare symmetry includes both Lorentz and translation symmetries. But if the theory is a four-dimensional effective theory, how does translation symmetry come into play? Well, SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so it must respect Lorentz symmetry, which is part of Poincare. But does SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry? I'm a bit confused here. Wait, Poincare
