Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through two dipole transitions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels via dipole transitions. The selection rules for these transitions are important. Oh right, the selection rules for the hydrogen atom in the non-relativistic theory state that during a dipole transition, the angular momentum quantum number l changes by ±1. So, Δl = ±1. Also, the magnetic quantum number m can change by 0, ±1, but I think that m must change by at most ±1 as well. Wait, for the dipole transitions, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. But I think in the case of a dipole transition, the change in l is only ±1, and the change in m can be -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. It's an s-orbital, since l=0. It decays via two dipole transitions. That means it goes through two steps. The first transition would be from n=3, l=0 to n=2 or something else? Wait, no, for each dipole transition, the electron drops from a higher energy level to a lower one. So in each step, the principal quantum number n decreases by 1, but wait, no, that's not necessarily true because the transition could be between different n's as long as l changes by ±1.

Wait, no, the initial state is |3,0,0>. So the first transition must have l go from 0 to something else. Since Δl is ±1, the next l can be 1 (because 0+1=1) or -1, but since l can't be negative, l goes to 1. So the first transition must go to a state with l=1, which is a p-orbital.

So after the first transition, the state must be |n', 1, m'>, where n' is less than 3, right? Because it's a decay, so energy is decreasing, so n should decrease
