Okay, so I've got this question here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember from my studies that renormalizability depends on the dimensions of the coupling constants. Let's think this through step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. I think σ_{μν} is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices, which often comes up in theories involving spinors and field strength tensors.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each field in the Lagrangian and see how they balance out.

I remember that in natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the mass dimension is a measure of the units of each term. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless because it's integrated over spacetime (which has dimension 4 in 4D spacetime), so the action is dimensionless, hence the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4.

Wait, wait, actually, the Lagrangian density should have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate it over d^4x (dimension 4), the whole action becomes dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian L must have [L]_M = 4.

The term in question is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let's break this down.

First, what's the dimension of ψ? Spinor fields ψ have a mass dimension of 3/2 each, right? Because in 4D, the Dirac field has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ is also 3/2 because it's the adjoint.

Next, σ_{μν} is made from gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), so σ_{μν} is also dimensionless. So when we have ψ̄ σ ψ, that's (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3.

Then we have F^{μν}, which is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F is derived from the vector potential A, which has dimension 1. The field strength is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so each derivative (d/dx^μ) has dimension 1, so each term in F is dimension 1 + 1 = 2. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimensions [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] + [F]. So that's [κ] + (3) + (2) = [κ] +5.

Wait, no, because the product is κ multiplied by all these terms. So the total dimension of the term is [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ] * [F] ?

Wait, no. Each field in the term contributes its own dimension. So in the term ψ̄ σ ψ F, each field contributes. So:

ψ̄: 3/2,
σ_{μν}: 0,
ψ: 3/2,
F: 2.

So adding them: 3/2 + 3/2 = 3 for the ψ̄ and ψ. Then F contributes 2, so total is 3 + 2 = 5.

But wait, η is a scalar, so when you multiply fields together, their dimensions add. So the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So the dimension of the entire term is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [σ] + [F}.

Wait, but ψ̄ and
