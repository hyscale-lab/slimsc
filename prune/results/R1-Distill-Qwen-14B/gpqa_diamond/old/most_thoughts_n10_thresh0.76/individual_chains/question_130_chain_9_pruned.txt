Okay, so I have this question about quasars and neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm. Let me think. I remember that quasars emit a lot of light, and when their light passes through intergalactic medium, like these clouds of hydrogen, some of it gets absorbed. Specifically, the Lyman alpha line, which is around 1216 Angstroms. Right, the Lyman alpha forest is what that's called, right? Those absorption lines are from hydrogen in the intergalactic medium.

The question is about the redshift. They want the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Wait, what's the deal with redshift here? So, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen, which is at some redshift z. But the quasar itself must be at a higher redshift than the hydrogen clouds, because the clouds are in front of it. So, the quasar's light is redshifted more.

Wait, but the question is about the detection. Oh, right, because optical telescopes can't see beyond certain wavelengths due to the atmosphere. The atmosphere is opaque to certain UV wavelengths. So, the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha absorption line must be in the optical range for ground-based telescopes to detect it.

The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is in the far UV. But when it's redshifted, its observed wavelength increases. If the redshift z is such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical range, then it's detectable. What's the optical range? Well, optical is roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Converting that to Angstroms: 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms, 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So, the Lyman alpha line must be redshifted into this range.

So the condition is 4000 <= 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit, the smallest z where this is possible. So, the minimum z would be when the observed wavelength is just entering the optical, which is 400 nm. So setting 1216*(1+z) = 4000 Angstroms.

Solving for z: 1+z
