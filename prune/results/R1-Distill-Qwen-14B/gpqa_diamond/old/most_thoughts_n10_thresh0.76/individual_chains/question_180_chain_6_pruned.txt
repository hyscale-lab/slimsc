Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy in a system of charges. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through step by step.

So the setup is an isolated system with 13 identical particles. Each has a charge of 2e, right? And their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about kinetic energy or anything like that. 

12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. Oh wait, so point P is where the 13th charge is fixed. So the 13th charge is at P, and the other 12 are all at a distance of 2 meters from P. 

The question is asking for the minimum energy of the system. Minimum energy... Hmm, I remember that in electrostatics, the potential energy of a system of charges is the work done to assemble them, bringing each charge from infinity to their positions. But wait, since the system is isolated, maybe the potential energy is just the sum of the interactions between each pair of charges.

Wait, but in this case, the 13th charge is fixed. So the energy would come from the interactions between the 12 charges and the fixed one, plus the interactions among the 12 charges themselves.

Let me break it down. The total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So, first, the interaction between each of the 12 charges and the 13th fixed charge. Then, the interactions between each pair of the 12 charges.

So for the first part: Each of the 12 charges is at distance 2 meters from P. The 13th charge is at P. So each of the 12 has a charge of 2e, and the 13th is also 2e. The potential energy for each pair (13th and each of the 12) would be U1 = (k * q1 * q2) / r. Here, q1 and q2 are both 2e, and r is 2 meters.

But wait, there are 12 such pairs, so the total for this part would be 12 * U1. Let me compute that.

Second part: The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges. Since they're all at 2 meters from P, but their positions relative to each other matter. Wait, wait
