Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about particle physics and conservation laws. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says: Pi(+) is at rest and decays into mu(+) and a neutrino (nu). The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I need to find the kinetic energies of the product particles.

Wait, neutrinos are tricky because they have almost no mass. So in this case, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, right? So when the pion decays, the products are the muon and the neutrino.

Conservation of energy and momentum must apply here. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Hmm. So let me think. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so its energy is just its kinetic energy. Or wait, no, neutrinos have some rest mass, but in this problem, the rest mass of the neutrino is probably considered zero. Because the problem only gives the rest mass of the pion and muon, so I'll assume the neutrino's rest mass is zero.

So, the energy conservation equation would be:

m_pi * c² = E_mu + E_nu

But E_nu is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero. Similarly, E_mu = m_mu * c² + K_mu.

Wait, but wait. The pion is at rest, so initial momentum is zero. So the momenta of the muon and neutrino must cancel each other out. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|, and their directions are opposite.

So, let's denote the magnitude of their momenta as p. Then, for each particle, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So, for the muon: E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 c²
