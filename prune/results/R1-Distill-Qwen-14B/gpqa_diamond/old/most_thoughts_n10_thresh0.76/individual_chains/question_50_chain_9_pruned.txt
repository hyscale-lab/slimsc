Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams, which I'm a bit rusty on, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague had a Feynman diagram and a "size estimate" written next to it. The size estimate is given as alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. The task is to figure out how many loops the diagram had based on this expression.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process and the divergence of integrals. Each loop typically contributes a factor of the coupling constant raised to a certain power and also introduces factors from integrals, which often involve terms like 1/(4π)^n where n is the number of loops or something related.

Wait, the general structure of a Feynman diagram's contribution usually involves a term that depends on the number of vertices and loops. For example, each loop brings in a factor of the coupling constant and possibly a 1/(4π)^something term.

Let me think about the general scaling. For a Feynman diagram with L loops, the typical scaling estimate would involve terms like (coupling constant)^L multiplied by some factors from the loop integrals. The integral factors usually come from the loop momentum integrals. In four-dimensional spacetime (which is what the question says), each loop integral in a scalar loop would typically produce a logarithmic divergence, but when regularized, I think each loop contributes a 1/(16π²) factor. Wait, or is it 1/(4π)^something?

Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have a loop integral, in 4 dimensions, the loop integral might have a superficial degree of divergence. Each loop can contribute a 1/(16 π²) factor if it's a loop in a scalar theory, but for gauge theories or other interactions, the factors might be different.

Alternatively, for a loop diagram, the amplitude often scales with (α/(4π))^L, where L is the number of loops. Or wait, maybe each loop contributes a factor of (α/(4π)) multiplied by some power, depending on the vertices.

Wait, the term (alpha^3 * g^2) suggests that the coupling constants are involved in the prefactor. Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4π), where e is the electric charge. So alpha ~ e²/(4π) ≈ 1/137.

In Feynman diagrams, the number of loops is related to the perturbation order. For example, a tree-level diagram has 0 loops, first-order (like a single vertex) has 0 loops, and each additional loop adds a higher order.

Wait, maybe the formula given is a dimensionless quantity that estimates the size of a loop integral. Let's break down the given factors:

The expression is: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

So let me count the factors:

- alpha^3: alpha is a dimensionless coupling constant. So alpha^3
