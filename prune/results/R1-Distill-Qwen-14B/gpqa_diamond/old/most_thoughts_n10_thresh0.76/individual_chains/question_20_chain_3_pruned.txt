Okay, so I've got this question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations, and I need to figure out which assumptions lead to that approximation. Hmm, I remember from my notes that the impulse approximation is used in situations where nucleons are treated almost like free particles. But wait, why does that happen? Let me think.

The question lists four assumptions, and I need to pick which three together imply the impulse approximation. Let's look at each assumption one by one.

Assumption 1 says the interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That makes sense because, in the impulse approximation, each nucleon is treated independently. So if the current only interacts with one nucleon at a time, that supports the approximation.

Assumption 2 is that the nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Transparent meaning that other nucleons don't affect the interaction much. So if the nucleus is mostly transparent, the other nucleons don't interfere, so each one behaves as if it's alone, which is the free nucleon idea. So this must be part of the assumptions.

Assumption 3 states that the quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Wait, non-relativistic quarks... I thought quarks are held together by strong forces and are relativistic? Or is this about the approximation? Maybe if the quarks are non-relativistic, their motion is simpler, so the nucleon itself behaves more like a point particle. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? The impulse approximation is about treating the nucleon as free, so perhaps if the quarks are non-relativistic, the structure of the nucleon is considered static, making the nucleon appear as a point particle. So this assumption would contribute to treating the nucleon as free.

Assumption 4 says the interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right! If the nucleon isn't bound, it can move freely, so any force from the interaction imparts a momentum without being constrained. This sounds like a key part of the impulse approximation because it's assuming the nucleon isn't held tightly and can react impulsively to the interaction.

So the impulse approximation requires that each nucleon interacts individually (1), that the rest of the nucleus doesn't interfere (2), and that the nucleon isn't bound (4). Wait, what about assumption 3 about quarks being non-relativistic? I'm not sure. The impulse approximation is more about the dynamics
