Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That happens when a molecule has chiral centers, which are carbons attached to four different groups.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Hmm, this is an alkene with a chloro group and a methyl. The structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2, but with substituents. Wait, the formula is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure should be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double-bonded to the second. So, the first carbon has Cl, the second has a CH(CH3), because the substituents on the double bond are Cl on one end and CH(CH3) on the other?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH... but wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro-2-methyl would mean Cl is on C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure would be Cl-C=CH(CH3)-CH2-? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's CHCl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, perhaps I should think of the double bond as between C1 and C2. So for 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, the structure is Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(R)=CH2, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so substituting Cl on C1 and methyl on C2: Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, wait, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So adding substituents: Cl on C1 (so CH2Cl?), but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so the 1-chloro would make it ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? But wait, that's not correct because it's but-1-ene, which is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, making it ClCH2-CH=CHCH3? Wait, no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The structure should be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 2-methyl would make it CH2=CH-C(CH3)H? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is Cl on C1, methyl on C2, and double bond between C1 and C2. So:

Structure: Cl
           |
C1=C2
           CH(CH3)

So C1 has Cl, double bond to C
