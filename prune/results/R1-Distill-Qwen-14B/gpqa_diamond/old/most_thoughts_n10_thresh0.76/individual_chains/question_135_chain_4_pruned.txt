Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about bosons and their decays. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll think it through.

The question gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, I'm not entirely sure what the variables mean here, but I think λ is the coupling constant, and v is probably the vacuum expectation value or something related to the mass. Oh wait, the mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. So I need to find its possible decay products.

So the question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. Kinematically allowed means that the decay products' rest masses must be less than the mass of X. Because in decay processes, the conservation of energy and mass comes into play—so the daughter particles can't each have a mass higher than the parent's mass.

Wait, but actually, each of the decay products must have a mass such that their total is less than or equal to X's mass. But since X is a boson and decays into fermion-antifermion pairs, each fermion and antifermion will have half the mass of X maybe? No, wait, the mass of each fermion (like quarks or leptons) must be less than X's mass divided by 2
