Okay, so I've got this science problem in front of me. Let's see, the question is about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to the area of the event horizon of a black hole. Oh right, the formula is something like S = (k c^3 A)/(4 ħ G), where k is Boltzmann's constant, c is the speed of light, A is the area, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and G is the gravitational constant.

Wait, but wait. The question gives me the angular size θ of the event horizon. So, I guess I need to find the radius of the event horizon first, and then calculate the area.

The distance to the galaxy is d = 10^10 parsecs. Oh, parsecs to meters conversion—right, 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. Let me write that down: d = 3.086e26 m.

The angular size θ is 1e-17 degrees. Since angles in radians are easier to use, I should convert θ from degrees to radians. The conversion is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180. Let me compute that. 1e-17 * π is about 3.14e-17, divided by 180 is roughly 1.75e-19 radians. So θ ≈ 1.75e-19 radians.

The angular size θ is approximately the size of the object (like the diameter of the event horizon) divided by the distance. So, if R is the radius, then the diameter is 2R. So, θ ≈ (2R)/d. So solving for R: R ≈ (θ * d)/2.

Plugging the numbers in: θ is 1.75e-19 rad, d is 3.086e26 m. So R ≈ (1.75e-19 * 3.086e26) / 2.

Calculating the numerator: 1.75e-19 * 3.086e26. Let's see, 1.75 *3.086 is about 5.40e1 (wait, because 1e-19 *1e26 is 1e7). So 5.40e7 * 1e7? Wait, wait, 1e-19 * 3.086e26 is 3.086e7. Because 1e26 / 1e19 is 1e7. So 1.75 *3.086 is about 5.4005, so 5.4005e7 meters.

Divide by 2: R ≈ 2.70025e7 meters. Wait, that's 2.7e7 meters, which is about 2.7e4 kilometers. That seems plausible for a supermassive black hole? I think supermassive ones have radii on the order of millions of kilometers or more, but maybe this is a smaller one or I made a mistake. Wait, wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, 1e-17 degrees is a very small angle. So the event horizon is small in the sky, but at 1e10 parsecs, which is a very far distance. So the radius R would be (θ in radians) * d. Wait, no, the formula is θ = (2R)/d. So R = (θ * d)/2.

Hmm, let me re-calculate. θ in radians is 1e-17 degrees converted. 1e-17 * (pi/180) = approx 1.745e-19 radians.

So R = (1.745e-19 rad * 3.086e26 m) / 2. Let me compute 1.745e-19 * 3.086e26. That's 1.745 *3.086 = about 5.388. Then exponents: 1e-19 *1e26 = 1e7. So 5.388e7. Divided by 2 gives R ≈ 2.694e7 meters. So approximately 2.7e7 meters.

Wait, another way to think: 1 parsec is about 3.26 light-years. 1e10 parsecs is 10 billion parsecs, which is a huge distance. So the angular size of the event horizon is 1e-17 degrees, which is tiny, so the actual size R must be small compared to the distance. But wait, for a supermassive black hole, the event horizon is maybe a few Schwarzschild radii. Let's think: the Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c². For a black hole of mass M, say, the Milky Way's SMBH is about 4e6 solar masses. Solar mass M_sun is ~2e30 kg. So M =4e6 * 2e30 =8e36 kg. R_s = 2* G*M/(c^2). G is 6.67e-11 N m²/kg², c is 3e8 m/s.

R_s = 2 * (6.67e-11) * (8e36) / (9e16) Let's compute numerator: 6.67e-11 *8e36 =53.36e25. Multiply by 2: 106.72e25. Divide by denominator 9e16: 106.72e25 /9e16 ≈11.86e8 meters, so ~1.186e9 meters, which is about 1.2 million kilometers. My R was 2.7e7 meters, which is 27,000 km. Hmm, that's smaller than the Schwarzschild radius, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R. Let me double-check.

Wait, wait. R is the radius of the event horizon, which is equal to the Schwarzschild radius. Wait, no, the formula I have is correct. So perhaps my approach has a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the angular diameter. The angular diameter θ (in radians) is approximately 2R/d. So R = θ * d / 2. So that's correct. So in this case, with θ being 1e-17 degrees, which is very small, and d being 1e10 parsecs, which is a huge distance. So R should be (1e-17 degrees) * 1e10 parsecs. Let me compute that.

Wait, perhaps using parsecs in the angular size formula. The formula is θ (in radians) ≈ (size in parsecs) / (distance in parsecs). So if R is the radius in parsecs, then θ ≈ R / d. But wait, R is in parsecs, d is in parsecs. So R (parsecs) = θ (radians) * d (parsecs). Because θ (rad) = R (parsecs) / d (parsecs) → R = θ_rad * d.

Wait, but I think I should be careful with units. Let me think again. The formula for small angles is θ (in radians) ≈ (diameter) / (distance). So if θ is in radians, diameter is in meters, distance in meters. But perhaps if I use parsecs, I can compute it that way.

Alternatively, let's think of it as the angular diameter θ in radians is approximately (2R) / d, where R is in meters and d in meters. So R = (θ_rad) * d / 2.

So plugging in θ_rad =1.75e-19 rad and d=3.086e26 m. So R= (1.75e-19 *3.086e26) /2 = (5.39e7) / 2 ≈ 2.695e7 meters. Which is about 2.7e7 meters, as before. So that's 27,000 kilometers. But earlier, the Schwarzschild radius for M=4e6 solar masses is 1.186e9 meters, which is 1.186e6 kilometers. So R is 27,000 km, which is about 22 times smaller than the Schwarzschild radius. That can't be right, because the event horizon radius R is the Schwarzschild radius. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the distance. Wait, 1e10 parsecs is 10,000,000,000 parsecs. But 1 parsec is 3.086e16 meters, so 1e10 parsecs is 3.086e26 meters. That's correct.

Wait, let me compute R again. 1.75e-19 *3.086e26 = (1.75 *3.086) = 5.3915, and 1e-19 *1e26 =1e7. So 5.3915e7. Divided by 2, that's 2.695e7 meters. So perhaps the mass is different?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the mass of the black hole using the angular size, then use that mass to compute the entropy.

Wait another approach: The Schwarzschild radius R_s = 2GM/c². So M = (R_s c²)/(2 G). Once I have M, I can compute the entropy.

But wait, I have R from θ. So R = R_s, so M = (R c²) / (2 G).

Once M is known, the entropy S can be found. The entropy formula I mentioned earlier: S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G), where A is the area of the event horizon, which is 4π R². So S = (k c^3 * 4 π R²) / (4 ħ G) = (k c^3 π R²) / ( ħ G).

Alternatively, S = (k c^3 A) / (4 ħ G) → A=4 π R².

So, to compute S, I need R, then compute A, then plug into the formula.

So let's proceed step by step.

1. Compute R (radius of event horizon) from θ and d.
2. Compute A = 4 pi R².
3. Plug A into entropy formula.

So first, R: I have R = (θ_rad * d) / 2.

Wait, θ is given as 1e-17 degrees. Let's compute θ in radians accurately.

θ_deg = 1e-
