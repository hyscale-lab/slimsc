Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh wait, and the energy difference between those levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. The problem is in the context of LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So each small region of the photosphere behaves like a perfect blackbody in terms of emission and absorption.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. The Boltzmann equation relates the relative populations of different energy states in a system in thermal equilibrium. The formula is something like (n_upper / n_lower) = (g_upper / g_lower) * exp( -ΔE / (k*T) ), where ΔE is the energy difference between the states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, in this case, the problem states that the level in star_1 is twice as excited. So, n1_upper / n1_lower = 2, and in star_2, it's n2_upper / n2_lower = 1. Because it's twice as excited, maybe. Or wait, the question says iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So perhaps n1_upper/n1_lower is twice (n2_upper/n2_lower)? Or maybe the ratio is 2:1 between the two stars.

Wait, let me restate the problem. It says the excitation is twice as much in star_1 compared to star_2. So for the same energy level pair, the ratio of excited to lower states is higher in star_1.

So let's define the excitation ratio as (n_upper / n_lower) for each star.

For star_1: ratio_1 = 2 * ratio_2

Wait, no. The wording says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation (i.e., population in the excited state) is double for star_1. So the ratio (n_upper / n_lower) for star_
