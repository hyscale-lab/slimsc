Alright, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Okay, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He ran qPCR on serially diluted samples, each with three technical replicates. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, which means the data perfectly fits the curve. The slope is -3.3.

The results for each concentration are as follows:

- 100,000 copies/µl: Ct values 33.9, 34.2, 34.5
- 10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2
- 1,000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9
- 100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6
- 10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3

The question is asking why there are discrepancies in his results. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that in qPCR, the Ct (threshold cycle) is inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid. More copies mean lower Ct. The formula is usually something like Ct = Ct0 - log(E) * log(Q), where E is efficiency and Q is quantity.

Wait, since the efficiency here is 100%, that's perfect, so E is 1. Which would mean the equation simplifies because log(1) is 0. Wait, no, actually, the efficiency in the formula is (E/100), right? Or is it log(E)?

Wait, the standard formula is Ct = Ct0 + (1/log(E)) * log(Q/Q0), where Ct0 is the intercept, Q is the target quantity, and Q0 is the reference quantity. Alternatively, sometimes it's written as Ct = slope * log(Q) + intercept. Oh wait, in this case, the R² is 1 and the slope is -3.3. So the equation is Ct = (-3.3) * log(Q) + intercept.

But wait, let's think about the data. Each tenfold dilution reduces the copy number by a factor of 10. So, for each tenfold dilution, the log(Q) decreases by 1 (since log10(10) is 1). So, for each tenfold dilution, the Ct should increase by the slope's value. The slope is -3.3, so each log(Q) decrease by 1 would lead to a Ct increase of 3.3.

Looking at the data points:

At 100,000 copies, Ct is around 33.9-34.5. Next, 10,000 copies (which is 10 times less) should have a Ct about 3.3 higher. Let's see. 33.9 +3.3 is 37.2. But the next Ct is 30.6, which is lower. That doesn't make sense because less copies should give a higher Ct. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I have the direction wrong.

Wait, more copies mean more target, so the Ct should be lower because it reaches the threshold sooner. So higher concentration, lower Ct. So when you dilute (lower concentration), Ct increases. So each tenfold dilution should increase Ct by 3.3 cycles.

Looking at the data:

From 100,000 to 10,000 (tenfold dilution), Ct goes from ~34 to ~30.6. Wait, that's a decrease, which contradicts. Hmm, wait that can't be right. Because 10,000 is a tenfold lower than
