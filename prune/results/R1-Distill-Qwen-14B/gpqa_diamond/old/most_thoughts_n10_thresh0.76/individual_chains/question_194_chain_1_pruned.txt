Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I've been told that beta is 1/(kT), and I need to find the partition function Z.

Wait, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-beta E), right? So I need to consider all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate E for each, then sum exp(-beta E) across all configurations.

But wait, with three spins, each having two possible states (+1 and -1), the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. So I can list all possible states and compute E for each.

Let me list them:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now for each, compute E.

Let me compute each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 and their sum.

But wait, the energy E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each term is multiplied by J and with a negative sign.

Let me compute for each state.

1. All +1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1 = -1. E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1= -1. E=J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1. S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1= -1. E=J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1. S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1= -1. E=J.

8. All -1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -3J.

Wait, so let's categorize the states based on their energy.

Looking at the E values:

- State 1: E = -3J
- States 2-7: E = +J each (so 6 states)
- State 8: E = -3J

Wait no, wait. Wait, in state 8, all are -1, so S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum =3, so E= -J*3 = -3J.

So from the 8 states:

- Two states have E = -3J (state 1 and 8)
- The other six states have E = J.

So the partition function Z is the sum of exp(-beta E) for each state.

So for each state:

Z = sum_{i=1 to 8} exp(-beta E_i)

Which is:

For E=-3J: exp(-beta*(-3J)) = exp(3 beta J). There are two such states, so 2 * exp(3 beta J).

For E=+J: exp(-beta*J) = exp(-beta J). There are six such states, so 6 * exp(-beta J).

So Z = 2 e^{3 beta J} + 6 e^{- beta J}.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 2 e^{-3Jβ} +6 e^{Jβ} → that's E positive so negative exponent? No, because for E=-3J, exp(-beta E) = exp(3 β J), which is what I have here.

So let's check the options. Option B is 2 e^{3βJ} +6 e^{-βJ}. That matches what I just calculated.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is: Z=2 e^(3Jβ) + 6 e^(-Jβ). Yes, that's exactly what I have.

Wait, but wait. The options are given as:

Option B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)

Yes, which is what I derived.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating E for each state.

Wait, in each state, E is -J times (sum of products).

Wait, let me recheck state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = 1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1.
