Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acid solutions are mixed with a base. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says: when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids reacting with bases to form water and possibly some salt. The enthalpy change is usually measured in kilojoules per mole, but the options here are a mix of kcal and kJ, so I'll have to watch the units.

Wait, wait, but first, I need to figure out which is the limiting reagent here. Because if one of the reactants runs out, that's going to determine how much neutralization happens.

So the acids are HCl and H2SO4. The base is Ba(OH)2. Let me break down each component.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+ ions. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but wait, does it fully dissociate? I think the first dissociation is complete, giving 2 H+ and SO4^2- ions. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When it dissolves, it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH^- ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-.

The neutralization reaction between an acid and a base generally looks like H+ + OH- → H2O, and each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-.

So I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from the acids and the total moles of OH- from the base. Then, the limiting reagent will be whichever is less between H+ and OH-.

Let's compute each:

1. HCl:
Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 500 mL → 0.5 L.
Moles of HCl = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.
Each mole gives one mole of H+, so 0.1 mol H+.

2. H2SO4:
Molarity 0.3 M, volume 300 mL → 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.
Each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

So total H+ from acids = 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 mol.

3. Ba(OH)2:
Molarity 0.5 M, volume 200 mL → 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.
Each mole gives 2 moles OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So now, comparing H+ and OH-:
H+ = 0.28 mol
OH- = 0.2 mol
So OH- is the limiting reagent. Only 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- will react, because that's the smaller amount. The remaining H+ will be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 mol, but that doesn't react.

But wait, wait a second. Oh, wait! H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in the first dissociation, it's strong, but the second (HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-) is weak, but I think in aqueous solution, especially when hot, that might not matter. But for the purpose of neutralization, do we consider all H+ from H2SO4 as available? I think in neutralization, especially when excess acid is present, all the H+ (both from HCl and H2SO4) is available to react. Because the problem doesn't specify anything about the strength beyond the initial dissociation, so I can probably proceed with the initial calculation.

So, the reaction consumes 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH-, producing 0.2 mol H2O.

The enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ or OH- consumed. Wait, but wait: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is typically for the reaction where 1 mole of H+ reacts with 1 mole of OH- to form 1 mole of H2O. So each mole of H+ (or OH-) contributes to the enthalpy change.

I remember that the enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each mole of H+ reacts with a mole of OH-). So the enthalpy change, ΔH, is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+.

So in this case, the reaction uses 0.2 moles of H+ (and 0.2 moles of OH-). So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but looking at the options: option B is -11.42 kcal. Hmmm, that's in kilocalories. Oh wait, but let me check the units. Because 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ.

Wait, no, wait. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as about -57 kJ per mole, which is -13.66 kcal per mole, because 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is 57 / 4.184 ≈ 13.62 kcal. So negative, so -13.62 kcal per mole.

So if we have 0.2 moles, then 0.2 * (-13.62) = -2.724 kcal. Which is close to option A, which is -2.72 kcal. But wait, the calculation I did earlier in kJ was -11.4 kJ, which is option D. But option D is -16 kJ, which is larger in magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me double-check.

Wait, the question asks for the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. The neutralization reaction's ΔH is typically given per mole of acid or base. But the problem is that different sources might give the value in different units.

Wait another thought: The overall reaction when mixing these acids and the base would be the sum of the H+ from all acids and the OH- from the base. But for enthalpy, each mole of H+ (or OH-) contributes -57 kJ.

So the total enthalpy change is moles of H+ reacting multiplied by ΔH per mole.

Wait, but wait: I have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ, which is approximately -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -11.4 * 4.184 ≈ 47.6 kJ? No, wait, wait, no. Oh, wait, no, the units matter. Hold on.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up units. Let me get this straight. If the value is given per mole, then:

If the neutralization enthalpy is -57 kJ/mol (per mole of H+), then 0.2 mol would give -11.4 kJ. So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, but looking at the options, option D says -16.0 kJ, which is quite a bit larger. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molarity, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating moles.

Let me recheck the moles:

HCl: 500 mL * 0.2 M = 0.5 L * 0.2 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mole H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.3 L * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+ is 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL * 0.5 M = 0.2 L * 0.5 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So the reaction uses 0.2 mol of H+ and OH-.

Thus, the neutralization releases 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, so ΔH is -11.4 kJ.

So looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bigger number, but option B is -11.42 kcal. Let's see, 11.4 kJ is how many kcal? 11.4 kJ * (1 kcal /4.184 kJ) ≈ 2.723 kcal. So if the answer is -11.4 kJ, but the options have -11.42 kcal (option B), which would be about 11.42 * 4.184 ≈ 47.6 kJ. That's way off.

Wait, maybe I messed up the enthalpy value. Is the neutralization enthalpy per mole of H+ or per mole of acid?

Ah, wait, for strong acids and strong bases, the neutralization enthalpy is about -57 kJ per mole of H+. So if I have 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, then it's 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ. So that's -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. But wait, perhaps I have a mistake in the assumption. Maybe the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the enthalpy per mole of acid reacting.

Wait, but HCl is a monoprotic acid, and H2SO4 is diprotic. So perhaps that affects the calculation.

Wait, but when H2SO4 is mixed with a base, the first H+ is very strong, the second is weak. But in neutralization, if the base is strong, the second H+ can also be neutralized.

Wait, wait, I think Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So maybe the H+ from both the first and second dissociations of H2SO4 would react.

Wait, but earlier I assumed that all H+ from H2SO4 is available, so 0.18 mol. So the total H+ is 0.28, which is more than the OH- of 0.2 mol. So the OH- is the limiting reagent.

So only 0.2 mol of H+ reacts, and the remaining 0.08 mol of H+ remains unreacted.

So the neutralization involves 0.2 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH- → 0.2 mol H2O.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

So looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. The options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, let me look at the options again. Option B is -11.42 kcal. That's approximately -48.3 kJ. Because 11.42 kcal *4.184 ≈ 47.68 kJ. So that's much higher than the 11.4 kJ I calculated.

Hmm. Perhaps I made a mistake in the units of the enthalpy value. Let me check what the standard enthalpy is.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid and a strong base is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (which would be per mole of acid if it's monoprotic). For diprotic acids, each mole contributes two moles of H+, so the neutralization per mole would be about -114 kJ (if both H+ are fully neutralized).

But in this case, H2SO4 is in excess H+ beyond what the base can neutralize. Let me think: The total H+ available is 0.28 mol, and the OH- is 0.2 mol. So all OH- is consumed, and 0.08 mol H+ remains.

So the enthalpy is based on 0.2 mol H+ reacting. So 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. So the answer should be -11.4 kJ, but that's not an option exactly. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -47.6 kJ, which is much higher.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the use of the enthalpy per mole of H2SO4 or per mole of acid. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the H2SO4 only donates one H+ in this context, perhaps because the second H+ is not considered a strong acid for neutralization. Wait, but that's conflicting with what I know. H2SO4's first dissociation is strong, the second is weak but still significant in dilute solutions.

Wait, but if in this problem, the second H+ is not reacting, perhaps because the base is insufficient, then only 0.18 mol H+ from H2SO4 (if it's one H+ per mole) would be used. But no, that's not the case because I calculated 0.28 mol H+ in total, and the base can neutralize 0.2 mol.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 contributes one mole of H+ because it's a diprotic but only one H+ is reactive in neutralization. No, that doesn't make sense because the first H+ is definitely strong.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If the total H+ is 0.28 mol, and the OH- is 0.2 mol, then 0.2 mol H+ is neutralized. So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

So in kJ, that's -11.4. But option D is -16.0 kJ. So maybe the enthalpy value is different. Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value, like -28.3 kJ per mole of H+? Or perhaps I'm making a mistake with the limiting reagent.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem involves calculating the total moles of H+ and OH-, then seeing which is in excess.

Wait, let me recheck:

HCl: 0.5 L *0.2 = 0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 L *0.3 =0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 0.2 L *0.5=0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

Thus, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So OH- is limiting.

So moles of H+ reacting = 0.2.

So ΔH = 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But none of the options exactly match. Option D is -16.0 kJ; option B is -11.42 kcal.

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different value for the enthalpy of neutralization. Let me think, perhaps it's per mole of H2O formed.

Wait, for each mole of H2O formed from H+ and OH-, the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ. So if 0.2 mol H2O is formed, then ΔH is 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

But perhaps the problem uses a different value. Let's think. Another source I recall says that the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ for strong acid and strong base. So the calculation should be correct.

So why is option B -11.42 kcal? Because if 0.2 mol reacts, and the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole, which is about -13.66 kcal per mole, then 0.2 * (-13.66) = -2.732 kcal.

Wait, that's about option A, which is -2.72 kcal. So that would be if they used the enthalpy in kcal per mole of H+.

Hmm, but why the discrepancy? Because the problem gives the options in mixed units, I'm confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles calculation.

Wait, let me compute the moles again.

HCl: 500 mL is 0.5 L. 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl. HCl → H+ + Cl-. So 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol.

So H+ total: 0.28. OH-: 0.2. So limiting is OH-: 0.2.

So 0.2 mol of H+ and OH- react.

So, if the enthalpy is -57 kJ per mole of H+, then 0.2 → -11.4 kJ. So that would be the answer in kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the total H+ from both acids and the OH- and using the neutralization per mole of solution, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the enthalpy per mole of each acid and base, but that complicates things.

Wait, another approach: maybe the problem is considering the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of acid, regardless of the number of H+ ions. So for HCl, it's 1 H+ per mole, so 0.1 mol contributes 57 kJ. For H2SO4, it's 2 H+ per mole, so 0.09 mol would contribute 0.09 * 2 * 57 kJ.

Wait, but that approach doesn't seem right because the neutralization is about the moles of H+ that actually react.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the total neutralization, including any excess acid, but that doesn't make sense because excess H+ doesn't react.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is considering that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, and both H+ are being neutralized. But since the OH- is 0.2, and the H+ from H2SO4 is 0.18, which is less than 0.2, but HCl contributes 0.1. So in this case, all H+ from both acids are neutralized, but that can't be right because 0.28 H+ is more than 0.2 OH-.

So the limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 H+ reacted.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation, assuming the answer is -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that. So maybe the correct answer is option B, which is -11.42 kcal, but that would imply a much larger enthalpy change.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting kJ to kcal. Let me compute 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ. To convert to kcal, I divide by 4.184.

Wait, wait no: 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.723 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.723 kcal, which is option A.

But why would the problem report the enthalpy in kcal when most modern usage is in kJ? Well, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The enthalpy of neutralization is typically given in kJ per mole. So I calculated -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. So perhaps the problem uses a different enthalpy value.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem uses the enthalpy of neutralization as -28.3 kJ per mole of OH- or H+.

Wait, no, I think it's more likely that the problem intended for the calculation to be in kJ and option B is a distractor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me recheck.

HCl: 500 mL *0.2 M = 0.5 L *0.2 =0.1 mol → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL *0.3 M=0.3 L*0.3=0.09 mol → 0.18 H+.

Total H+ = 0.28.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL *0.5 M =0.2 L *0.5=0.1 mol → 0.2 OH-.

So, OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So limiting is OH-.

So 0.2 mol H+ and OH- react.

Enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

The options are:

A) -2.72 kcal → ≈ -11.4 kJ.

Wait, no, because 2.72 kcal is 11.488 kJ. Because 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.4 kJ. So option A is -2.72 kcal, which is approximately -11.4 kJ. So that would make option A correct.

Wait, but that would mean the answer is option A.

So, the calculation in kJ is -11.4, which is -2.72 kcal (since 2.72 *4.184 ≈ 11.4). Therefore, the correct option is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why are the options mixing kcal and kJ? Because option B is -11.42 kcal which is about -48 kJ, which is way higher.

So the correct answer is option A, which is about -11.4 kJ when converted, but presented as -2.72 kcal.

So the conclusion is that the enthalpy change is approximately -11.4 kJ, which is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl:  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from HCl = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).
   - H₂SO₄:  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ contributes 2 moles of H⁺, so moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Total moles of H⁺ = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - Total H⁺ = \( 0.28 \, \text{mol} \), Total OH⁻ = \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).  
     OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it is present in the smaller amount. Only \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacts with \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of H⁺.  
     For \( 0.2 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ reacting, the enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

5. **Convert units if necessary:**
   - To express the enthalpy change in kilocalories (kcal), use the conversion factor \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \):  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

6. **Match the result to the options:**
   - The calculated enthalpy change is \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \), which corresponds to \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \) when converted. This matches option A.

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value when converted from kJ to kcal.
- **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** This would correspond to approximately \( -48.3 \, \text{kJ} \), which is much larger than the calculated value.
- **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** This is inconsistent with the calculation.
- **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** This is larger in magnitude than the calculated \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A (-2.72 kcal)**.

Answer: A
