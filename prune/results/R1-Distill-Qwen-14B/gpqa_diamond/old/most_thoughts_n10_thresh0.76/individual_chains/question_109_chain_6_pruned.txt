Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted. Let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Hmm, okay, not entirely sure what that equation means yet, but I'll get there.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. So, the isospin is zero. I remember that isospin is a quantum number related to the strong interaction, and for two nucleons (like a deuteron), the isospin can be 0 or 1. Since it's 0 here, that might affect the possible states.

The problem is asking which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing a transition from 1S0 to some other state plus a particle (p, s, f, etc., which I think denote orbital angular momentum letters). So each option is an initial state emitting X and becoming a new state.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0. Let me parse that term. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), I think. So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1, so S=0. The L is S here, so orbital angular momentum L=0, since S is the letter for orbital angular momentum in spectroscopic notation. And J is 0. So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. I remember that parity is a multiplicative quantum number. For a particle, parity is +1 or -1. So emitting X would change the parity of the system.

The Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Wait, what are S, L, and T here? Oh, perhaps S is the spin, L orbital angular momentum, and T the isospin. So the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, let's plug that in: 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. So S + L must be 1 mod 2, meaning their sum is odd. So S and L have opposite parity.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. So for the initial state, S_initial =0, L_initial=0, T_initial is probably 1 (if I recall, the deuteron has isospin T=1, but in this case, we're looking at the final state after emission). Wait, no, wait. The initial system is two nucleons in a state, and they emit a particle X. So the initial state is 1S0, which is the state of the two nucleons before emission. But after emission, the two nucleons are in a different state, and X is emitted.

Wait, no, the initial state is the system before emission. So the initial state is 1S0, and then they emit X, so the final state is the new NN state (with T=0) and X.

Wait, the problem states that the final NN state has T=0. So the NN system after emission has T=0. So the initial NN state must have had T=1, because when they emit X (which has some isospin?), the total isospin must be conserved? Or maybe not, because the emission is via the strong force, which conserves isospin, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps in the decay, the isospin is considered for the NN system, and the emitted particle X is a boson or something else.

Wait, particle X here is probably a meson since it's emitted by the NN system. Common mesons are pions (like π+ etc.), which have isospin 1. But in this problem, I think the isospin of X might not directly affect the isospin of the NN system. Or perhaps it's a pion, which has isospin 1 and parity -1. The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, which is the case for pions.

Wait, but the question is more about angular momentum and parity conservation. Let me focus on that.

So, initial state: 1S0. So initial S (spin) is 0, L is 0 (since 1S0 implies L=0, S=0), and J=0.

After emission, the NN state has T=0. So the final state's NN has T=0, and they must now be in some other state.

The process is NN (initial state) → NN (final state) + X. So, the initial NN (1S0) emits X, and becomes another state.

The problem is about the partial waves allowed for the emission of X. Each option gives a possible transition, and we need to find which is not allowed.

So, for each option, the initial is 1S0, and the final NN state is some (some L', S', J'), and X has a certain orbital angular momentum.

Wait, the options specify the angular momentum state of X. For example, option A is 7D1 + p. Hmm, I'm not sure about the notation. Wait, the letters after the numbers are the orbital angular momentum: S=0, P=1, D=2, F=3, etc. So, in option A, X is emitted in a D state, which is L=
