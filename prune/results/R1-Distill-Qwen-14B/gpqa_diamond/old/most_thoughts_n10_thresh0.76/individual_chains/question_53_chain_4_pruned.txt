Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying the chemical formula of an unknown compound based on its spectral data. The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, it's an aromatic compound with two substituents on a benzene ring, right?

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have a carbonyl (C=O) stretch around 1740 cm^-1 and an O-C-O stretch around 1250-1050 cm^-1. So, the presence of an ester functional group is confirmed.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum: there are six signals. Let's break them down.

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. So, the substituents on the benzene must be in positions that split the aromatic protons into two sets. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, the aromatic protons would split into two sets of two each, but wait, in that case, maybe more signals? Or maybe if the substituents are in such a way that they create two distinct environments for the aromatic Hs.

Wait, but benzene is usually symmetric, so if the substituents are in certain positions, like para or ortho, the number of signals changes. Wait, if there are two substituents, and it's a di-substituted benzene, the structure could be either para, ortho, or meta. 

If the substituents are para, the aromatic Hs would split into two sets of two each, giving two signals. Oh wait, no. For para substitution, the benzene would have two sets of equivalent Hs. So each set would have two Hs, but since they are equivalent, each set would give a single peak. So that's two signals. That makes sense because the question says two aromatic signals. So the substituents are likely in para positions.

2. Next, two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. Vinyl Hs are those on a double bond. So there's another group attached to the benzene which has a double bond, possibly an ester group since the IR suggests ester. Wait, but ester groups are typically OCOOR. So the ester group could be attached as a substituent on the benzene. But how would that affect the NMR?

Wait, if the substituent is an ester, like OCOOR, that might not have vinyl Hs. Oh, wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to another part, like maybe an ester with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR says two signals for vinyl Hs. One is a doublet, the other a doublet of quartets. Let me think about what that implies. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. A doublet of quartets suggests coupling with two sets of protons, maybe two neighboring groups each with two protons?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a trans coupling or something else. Or maybe it's part of an ester group that's connected to a double bond. Wait, but esters are usually R-O-CO-O-R, but that's not right. Wait, no, esters are R-O-CO-R'. So that doesn't have double bonds unless the R group has a double bond.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is an ester where the R group is a vinyl group. For example, something like Ar-O-CO-CH2CH2-... No, that wouldn't have vinyl Hs. Wait, maybe the substituent is attached to the benzene in such a way that there's a double bond adjacent to the ester. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a vinyl ester group, like Ar-O-CO-CH2CH2-... No, that wouldn't have vinyl Hs. Alternatively, the substituent could be a group like an ester with a benzyl group, but that doesn't really create vinyl Hs.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester with a double bond, like an allyl ester. For example, something like O-CO-CH2CH2CH2- but that's not a double bond. Or maybe O-CO-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-, but no. Alternatively, the substituent could be a propenoate ester, like O-CO-CH2CH2CH2- but that's not a double bond either. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ester. Let me think: perhaps the structure is something like benzene with two substituents, one of which is an ester group, and the other is a vinyl group. But wait, the problem says it's a di-substituted compound. So both substituents are on the benzene? Let me think about that.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent could be two ester groups, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is a vinyl group. So for example, benzene with OAc (ester) and a CH2CH2 group attached. But that's not a vinyl group. Wait, a vinyl group is CH2=CH-. So, maybe the substituent is a CH2=CH-O-CO-... Hmm, not sure.

Wait, alternatively, the substituent could be part of a ring, like a cyclohexene ring attached to the benzene. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group where the R group is a vinyl group. For example, the structure could be benzene-O-CO-CH2CH2-. No, that's an ether, but wait, no, it's an ester. So, maybe the structure is benzene-O-CO-
