Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The problem says that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit. Its transit impact parameter is 0.2, and it's orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. This planet has an orbital period of 3 days. We need to find the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has a radius 2.5 times Earth's, so bigger. This second planet should also have a circular orbit and share the same orbital plane as the first. The goal is that both transit and occultation events happen. So, the question is asking for the maximum possible period of this second planet.

Hmm, okay. So, transit and occultation. I remember that a transit happens when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light gets blocked, making it seem like the total brightness drops a bit more. Both events require that the planet's orbit is aligned in such a way that it can pass in front and behind the star.

Wait, but for occultation, the planet must be larger than the star? No, wait, no. Occultation happens when the planet is behind the star, so the star must block the planet's light. So, the star's disk must be large enough to cover the planet when it's behind. But the star's radius is larger than the planet's, for sure. So, for the occultation to be observable, the orbital distance should be such that when the planet is behind the star, the planet is within the star's light disk.

But how does that affect the orbital period? Oh, right, the alignment. For both transit and occultation to occur, the second planet's orbit must be such that the same line of sight allows both events. That probably means that the two planets are in a configuration where their orbital periods are in a certain ratio, maybe a resonance or something.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should think about the timing of the transits and occultations. The first planet transits every 3 days. The second planet transits less frequently, depending on its period. But for both events to occur, perhaps their orbital periods have to allow for mutual transits or something. Not sure.

Wait, maybe it's about the relative positions. For a second planet to transit, it has to be in the same orbital plane and aligned in such a way that it can pass in front of the star. But since both planets are in the same plane, their orbital periods would determine how often they line up. But the question is about the maximum possible period for the second planet so that both transit and occultation are possible.

Wait, another thought: For the second planet to transit, it must be closer to the star than the first planet. Because the transit impact parameter is 0.2 for the first planet, but the second has a larger radius. Hmm, no, maybe not. Wait, the impact parameter is a measure of how far the planet's path is from the center of the star. So a lower impact parameter means the planet is
