Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which molecule has C3h symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is all about the operations that map the molecule onto itself. C3h symmetry... wait, what's that again? Oh right, C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that has a threefold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation and also have a mirror plane that's horizontal.

The options are four different molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, and two others with long names. Let me think about each one.

First, triisopropyl borate. I recall that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is connected to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups are like two methyl groups attached to a CH2. So the structure is symmetric because all three groups are the same. Wait, does that give it C3v symmetry or something else? Or maybe C3h? Because if it's trigonal symmetry with three identical substituents, it's likely to have a threefold axis. Triisopropyl borate is known as a tricoordinate boron compound. I think its structure is symmetrical with a threefold rotation axis. But wait, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Or is it maybe in a trigonal planar arrangement, which would have a C3v symmetry, not C3h. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between C3v and C3h. Alternatively, C3h has a threefold rotation plus a horizontal mirror. So the molecule should look the same when flipped over the mirror plane.

Next, quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic compound, specifically a norbornane derivative. Its structure is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. I think it's a bridge structure with seven carbons. Quinuclidine has a certain symmetry but I'm not sure if it's C3h. I remember that it has a threefold rotational symmetry because when you rotate it by 120 degrees, the structure remains the same. But wait, does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? Or is it maybe C3v? Quinuclidine's structure has a bridge, so perhaps the mirror
