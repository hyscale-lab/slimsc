Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully and think through each step.

The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, all chlorinated benzoic acid derivatives or something similar. Let me jot down the given data and then analyze each piece.

The data provided includes mass spectrometry (MS), IR, and 1H NMR spectra.

First, the Mass Spectrum: Molecular ion peak at m/z 156 (100%), and a peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, so the molecular ion is at 156, which suggests the molecular weight is 156 g/mol. The other peak is at 158, which is 2 units higher. I remember that in mass spectrometry, a common fragment is the loss of a small group. For example, losing HCl would add 36.46 (but that's not exactly matching here), but wait, 158 is 2 more than 156. Oh wait, maybe it's a double bond rearrangement? Or perhaps the molecular ion is even, and the fragment is even too.

Next, the IR data: a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching, especially if it's broad. The sharp peak at 1720 is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound probably has both a hydroxyl group and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the 1H NMR: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H). 

The 11 ppm singlet suggests an aldehyde proton, but wait, no, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10, but sometimes can be downfield. Alternatively, a phenolic OH might be in that region, but in NMR, a broad peak for OH is expected, but in this case, it's a singlet. Wait, the 11 ppm could be a carboxylic acid proton. Carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as a broad peak. But here it's a singlet, which is a sharp peak. Wait, but in the IR, the broad peak could be from the O-H stretch. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because if it's a carboxylic acid, the -COOH group would give a broad O-H peak in IR and a broad singlet in NMR around 11 ppm. But wait, in the NMR data, the 11.0 ppm is a singlet, and the integration is 1H. So maybe it's a deprotonated carboxylic acid? No, because the compound is in an acidic solution? Wait, but the 1H NMR of a carboxylic acid is usually a broad peak, not a sharp singlet. Hmm, perhaps the compound isn't a carboxylic acid then.

Wait, another possibility: the 11 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So maybe it's a strong deshielded aldehyde, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton, but that seems unlikely. Another thought: could it be a ketone or amide? No, because the IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which is more indicative of a carbonyl group, such as in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, acid, or amide.

Let me consider the aromatic region. The NMR shows two doublets, one at 8.02 and another at 7.72, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if there are two substituents opposite each other on a benzene ring. So maybe it's a para-substituted phenyl group with two substituents. But looking at the options, all except option C are benzoic acid derivatives.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: Structure would be an aldehyde at position 2, hydroxyl at 3, and Cl maybe elsewhere? Wait, no, the positions would be 2-hydroxy-3-chlorobenzaldehyde? Or wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 4 (para to COOH), which is benzene ring with -Cl and -COOH in para positions.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That's Cl-CO-O-Ph. So phenyl group attached to O-CO-Cl.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So Cl is at position 2, and COOH at position 1.

Wait, let me think about each option's spectral data.

Starting with the molecular formula: molecular ion at m/z 156.

Let me calculate the molecular weights for each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding Cl and another OH: Wait, wait. Let's calculate:

Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. If it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Because:

Benzaldehyde: C7H6O (7 carbons, 6 hydrogens, 1 O)

Adding Cl (replacing a H?), so total Cl: 1, and another OH (so O becomes 2). So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2.

Molecular weight: (12*7) + (5*1) + (35.5) + (16*2) = 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5 g/mol. So molecular weight is ~156, which matches the molecular ion.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1.

Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2.

Same as option A: same MW, 12*7=84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5, so m/z 156.5, which would round to 157. But the molecular ion is at m/z 156, so maybe that's close. Wait, but in the MS data, molecular ion is at 156, and another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, so if the molecular weight is 156, then a fragment at 158 would mean it's higher by 2. That's possible in some cases, like if the molecular ion was even and the fragment is an isobar, but that's less likely. Wait, maybe the molecular formula is different. Let me check.

Wait, the options' molecular formulas:

Option A: C7H5ClO2 (MW 156.
