Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. So, the question is about organic chemistry reactions and structures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's break it down step by step.

So, the first part says that compound A has a proton NMR with two signals. It's a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting can indicate neighboring protons. A triplet usually means each proton is next to two others, so maybe a CH2 group next to a CH3? Wait, wait, the triplet is for 6H. Let me think: a triplet of 6H. If it's a triplet, maybe it's two equivalent sets of CH3 groups. Like maybe two CH3 groups each next to a CH2. Because a triplet in a CH3 would come from being adjacent to a CH2. So, each CH3 would see the two protons on the adjacent CH2, causing splitting into a triplet. 

And the quartet is 4H. A quartet means each proton is next to three others. That sounds like a CH2 next to another CH2. Because if two CH2 groups are adjacent, each CH2 would be next to the other, so each CH2 would be a quartet. Wait, no. Wait, the quartet for each CH2 would split into a quartet if each is adjacent to a CH2 with two protons. Because the coupling would be with two neighboring protons. Wait, no, a quartet occurs when a proton is adjacent to a CH2 group with two protons. Because the splitting would be n+1, where n is the number of neighboring protons. So if a CH2 is next to a CH3, then the CH2 would be a quartet (since 3+1=4). 

Putting it together: For compound A, we have 6H as triplet, likely two CH3 groups. And 4H as quartet, likely a CH2 next to another CH2. Wait, wait, but in the quartet case, if it's a quartet for 4H, that would mean two sets of CH2 groups each being a quartet. Or maybe a CH2 connected to a CH2 which is connected to a CH3. Let me think of possible structures.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl ether? Because diethyl
