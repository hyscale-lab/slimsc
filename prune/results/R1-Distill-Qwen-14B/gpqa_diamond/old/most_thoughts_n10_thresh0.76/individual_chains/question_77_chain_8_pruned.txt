Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Cope rearrangement. Hmm, not too familiar, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question has two parts, A and B, each being a product of a reaction. I need to pick the correct options from A to D.

First part: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Then it's treated with BuLi and H+ to give product A.

Wait, BuLi is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation. In the presence of an enol ether, maybe it's deprotonating to form an enolate or something else. Oh wait, maybe it's a Claisen rearrangement? Or wait, no, the question states it's a Cope rearrangement. Oh right, the Cope rearrangement is for 1,5-dienes, but the molecule here seems to be an enol ether. Oh wait, maybe the structure is a 1,5-diene. Let me draw it.

The structure is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So benzene ring with an OCH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2? Wait no, wait. Let me parse that correctly. The group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the butenyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3), but wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, butenyl with double bond at position 2.

Wait, the group is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is: OCH2-CH(CH2CH2...) Hmm, wait, let's break it down. But-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2-. So 3-methyl would have a methyl on the third carbon. So the structure would be CH2=CH-C(CH3)H- ? No, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3
