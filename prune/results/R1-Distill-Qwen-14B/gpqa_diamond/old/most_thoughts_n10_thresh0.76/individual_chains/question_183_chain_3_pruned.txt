Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. Hmm.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. I need to visualize its structure first. So, cyclohexene means a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. 

Wait, the numbering: position 3 is where the double bond starts, right? So cyclohex-3-ene would have a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (which is a CHO group), and at position 5, a vinyl group (which is CH2CH2, but wait no, vinyl is CH2=CH-). So the structure should be a cyclohexene ring with a double bond, and at positions 2 and 5, there are substituents.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh, right! That sounds like the HI in presence of red phosphorus, which is used for the hydrolysis of nitriles, but wait, no. Alternatively, red phosphorus is used in the preparation of alkenes from alcohols, like the oxymercuration or something else? Wait, another thought: maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or a replacement reaction. Or perhaps it's a diels-alder reaction? Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, I think red phosphorus with HI is used for deoxygenation. Oh, wait, no. Alternatively, it's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and HCl, but maybe red phosphorus with HI is a different setup. Alternatively, I remember that when you have a carbonyl group, especially an ester or acid, and you treat it with something like HI and red phosphorus, it might be a reaction where the carbonyl is being reduced.

Wait, another thought: the reaction could be the Prins reaction, but no, that's for alkenes and alcohols, forming ethers. Alternatively, maybe it's a halogenation reaction. Wait, the compound has an acid group, but HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile.

Alternatively
