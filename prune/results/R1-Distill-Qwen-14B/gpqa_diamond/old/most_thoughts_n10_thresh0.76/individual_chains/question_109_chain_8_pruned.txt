Okay, so I have this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let's think this through step by step.

The problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics are involved, requiring that T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, I remember that Pauli's exclusion principle relates to the exchange symmetry of identical particles. Since nucleons are fermions, their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. That includes spin, spatial, and any other quantum numbers. 

The final NN state has T(NN)=0. So, the isospin is zero. Wait, I'm not too clear on isospin, but I think it's a part of the nuclear force interactions, related to proton and neutron number. But since T is zero, that's their isospin state.

We are to determine which partial wave is not permitted. The options involve different angular momentum states for the emitted particle X. The options are A to D, each with different transitions. Each option is 1S0 → some state with a letter (like D1, S1, etc.) plus a particle type (p, s, f maybe?).

So, the key here is to use conservation of angular momentum and parity. Oh, and the Pauli statistics condition.

Let me break down what I need to do.

First, the initial state is 1S0. Let's parse that. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so 1S0 means 2S+1=1 → S=0, L is S (so L=0), and J=0. So initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

The final state after emitting X is some state. Let's take each option and see.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So its parity is -1. For bosons, parity is even or odd, but X is a particle, could be a meson? Anyway, its parity is given.

Parity is a multiplicative quantum number. So the total parity of the system (final state) must be conserved, considering the initial parity and the parity of X.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the initial state is the NN system plus nothing, because they are emitting X. So before emission, the total system is NN. After emission, the system is NN plus X. But I think the problem is considering the NN state after emission, so perhaps X is the emitted particle and the remaining system is the NN, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the NN system is the one that emits X, so the final state is NN plus X. Hmm, but the problem statement says the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So perhaps the X is a separate particle, and the NN state is the one that's changed.

Wait, I think the problem is that the initial state is NN in 1S0, and after emitting X, the NN system
