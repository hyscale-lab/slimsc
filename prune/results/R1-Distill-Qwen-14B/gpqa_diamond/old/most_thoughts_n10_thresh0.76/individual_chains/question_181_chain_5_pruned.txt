Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is about neutrino flux from the sun when a specific branch of the proton-proton chain stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps, and neutrinos are a byproduct of these reactions.

Wait, the pp-III branch stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. Oh right, because that's the approximate time it takes for changes in the Sun's core to reach the Earthâ€”light takes about 8 minutes to get here, so neutrinos would too, since they move at nearly light speed.

So the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain. If I recall correctly, the proton-proton chain has multiple branches. The main one is pp-I, then pp-II, and pp-III. Oh, right, pp-III is the branch where a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-4 to form carbon-12. But wait, no, isn't that the CNO cycle? Or maybe I'm mixing things up. Wait, the pp chain starts with two protons fusing. The first step is two protons combining to form a deuteron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. Then, that can either go through pp-I or pp-II or pp-III.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the branches. The main branch is pp-I, where after forming deuterium, another proton adds to make helium-3. Then, two helium-3 nuclei can combine to make helium-4 and two protons. But that's the main branch. The pp-III branch is when a helium-3 nucleus captures a helium-4 nucleus (from the main branch) to form carbon-7, but that's not very stable, right? Oh wait, I think I might be getting confused with the CNO cycle here. Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is when a helium-3 captures a proton to form carbon-12, but I'm not sure. Either way, the key point is that pp-III produces neutrinos, and if it stops, that affects the flux.

Neutrinos are produced mainly in the beta decay steps. So the pp chain produces neutrinos in the first step, which is when a proton converts into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. So if the pp-III branch stops, does that affect the number of these
