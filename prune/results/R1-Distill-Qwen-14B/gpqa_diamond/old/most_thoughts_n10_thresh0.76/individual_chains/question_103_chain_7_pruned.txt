Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a series of reactions. I need to determine which sequence is correct.

First, I should sketch the target molecule to better visualize what's happening. The molecule is ethan-1-one with a benzene ring substituent. The substituent has a bromo group and a nitro group. Let's see, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So the benzene ring has nitro at position 5 and bromo at position 3, relative to the ketone group.

Wait, ethan-1-one is acetophenone, right? So the structure is a benzene ring attached to a ketone (CO) which is then attached to two CH2 groups? No, wait, ethan-1-one is (phenyl)methyl ketone. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one structure is CH3-C(O)-R, where R is the aryl group. So, the ketone is at the end, so the structure is Ph-CO-CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-CH2- something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. Ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-, so it's an acetyl group. So the molecule would be benzene ring connected to a COCH3 group, and with substituents on the benzene ring.

Wait, no, in this case, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the ethan-1-one part is (CH2)1-CO-CH3? No, wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(O)-CH2- something? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the nomenclature. Let me clarify. Ethan-1-one is CH2(CO)CH3. No, that can't be right. Wait, no. The general formula for an aliphatic ketone is R-CO-R'. For ethan-1-one, the carbonyl is at position 1. So it's (CH3)2CO? Wait, no, that
