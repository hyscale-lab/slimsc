Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². That potential looks familiar—I think it's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because the potential energy for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2) m ω² x², and since this is in three dimensions and isotropic, it's the same in all directions. So the particle is in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question is about finding the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions that have the same energy eigenvalue as that state.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, each energy level in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the energy levels are the same in x, y, and z directions. The energy for each direction is (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is a non-negative integer (0,1,2,...).

So the total energy E is the sum of the energies in each direction. So E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. Because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2) ħω, so adding all three gives (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Wait, but sometimes I've heard that the energy is given in terms of a total quantum number N, where N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (N + 3/2) ħω. That makes sense because each direction contributes n_i + 1/2, so sum is N + 3/2.

So the ground state is when N=0, which is (3/2) ħω. The first excited state is the next possible level, which would be N=1, so E=(1 + 3/2) ħω = 5/2 ħω. Then N=2 would be 7/2 ħω, and N=3 would be 9/2 ħω. Wait, but wait—what's the third excited state? Because the ground state is the zeroth excited state. Let me think: ground state is N=0 (0th), first excited N=1, second excited N=2, third excited N=3. So the third excited state is N=3.

So the energy would be (3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. That part seems clear.

Now the next part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions have the same energy eigenvalue as the third excited state? That's the degeneracy of the state with N=3.

In a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy for a given N is given by the number of ways to write N as the sum of three non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z). So the number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = N.

The formula for this is (N + 3 - 1 choose 3 - 1) ) = (N+2 choose 2). Because it's a combination with repetition problem. So for N=3, it's (3+2 choose 2) = (5 choose 2) = 10. Wait, but wait: for N=3, the number of ways to distribute the quanta is (3 + 2)! / (2! 3!) ) which is 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait—am I sure? Let me think of some examples. For N=0, only one way: (0,0,0). So (0+2 choose 2) = (2 choose 2)=1. Correct. For N=1, ways are (1,0,0) and permutations. So 3 ways. Using the formula: (1+2 choose 2)=3. Correct. N=2: (2,0,0), (1,1,0), etc. The number of states is 6, which is (2+2 choose 2)=6. So yes, the formula works.

So for N=3, the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: (9/2) ħω, 10. That fits.

Option C: same energy, but 3 eigenfunctions. That's wrong because for N=3, it's 10.

So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, what about the other options?

Option B and D have energy expressions that don't look like what I derived. The energy given in B and D seems to be 11... which doesn't match 9/2 ħω. So they can be ruled out.

So the answer is option A.


The problem involves a particle of mass \( m \) in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are determined by the quantum numbers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) in the \( x, y, z \) directions, with the total energy given by:

\[
E = \left(N + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where \( N = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to \( N = 0 \), the first excited state to \( N = 1 \), the second excited state to \( N = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( N = 3 \). For \( N = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

The degeneracy of a given energy level \( N \) corresponds to the number of ways to distribute \( N \) quanta among the three directions \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is given by the combinatorial formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \binom{N + 2}{2}.
\]

For \( N = 3 \), the degeneracy is:

\[
\binom{3 + 2}{2} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy eigenvalue.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches the derived results.
- **Option B** and **Option D**: The energy expressions do not match the derived energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \).
- **Option C**: While the energy is correct, the degeneracy is incorrectly stated as 3 instead of 10.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
