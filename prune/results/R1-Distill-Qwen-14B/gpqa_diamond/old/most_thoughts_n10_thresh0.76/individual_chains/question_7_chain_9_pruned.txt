Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it fills the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The process is gamma gamma -> e+ e-.

The question is asking from what energy gamma-rays would have their lifetimes limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. The options are A to D, all in the GeV range, so these are really high-energy gamma rays we're talking about.

I think this has something to do with photon-photon interactions and the probability of such interactions happening. So the gamma-ray's lifetime would be limited by how often it interacts with the CMB photons. When the interaction rate is high enough, the gamma-ray doesn't travel far before it annihilates, so its effective lifetime is short.

I remember that the mean free path is the average distance a photon travels before interacting. If the mean free path is shorter than the size of the universe, then the lifetime is limited. So the gamma-ray's lifetime is determined by the interaction rate with the CMB.

The cross-section for the gamma-gamma interaction is probably important here. I think the cross-section for two photons producing an electron-positron pair depends on the energy of the photons. For high-energy photons, the cross-section increases, but I'm not exactly sure of the formula.

Wait, the cross-section for photon-photon annihilation into electron pairs is given by the so-called "Dremin" formula or something similar. Let me think. The cross-section Ïƒ is proportional to (E_cm)^2, where E_cm is the center-of-mass energy. But wait, E_cm would be the sum of the two photon energies? Or is it the product? No, wait, photons are massless, so for two photons colliding, the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so (p1 c + p2 c) would be (p1 c - p2 c) in magnitude, but it's probably better to think in terms of the invariant s.

Alternatively, when both photons are moving in opposite directions, the center-of-mass energy is sqrt( (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + (-p2 c))^2 ), but I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of the photon energies.

Wait, for a gamma-ray photon of energy E and a CMB photon of energy E_cmb (which is 1e-3 eV), the center-of-mass energy squared is s = (E + E_cmb)^2 - (p E c)^2. Wait, for a photon, E = p c, so s = (E + E_cmb)^2 - (E c * p_dir - E_cmb c * p_dir') )^2. Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the formula for s when photons are colliding head-on.

So, if the gamma photon is moving in one direction and the CMB photon in the opposite, then their momenta are opposite. Let me consider the two photons: photon 1 (gamma-ray) has energy E and momentum p=E/c in the +z direction. Photon 2 (CMB) has energy E_c = 1e-3 eV and momentum p_c = E_c / c in the -z direction.

The total energy in the center-of-mass frame is sqrt( (E + E_c)^2 - ( (E/c) c + (E_c/c) c )^2 ) because the momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, wait. The invariant s is (sum E)^2 - (sum (p c))^2. So sum E is E + E_c. Sum p c is (E/c)c (for gamma) in +z, plus (E_c/c) c (for CMB) in -z. So the vector sum is (E - E_c) in +z, multiplied by c. Wait, no, because the CMB photon is moving opposite, so its momentum vector is - (E_c / c) in the same direction as the gamma. So sum p is (E/c) - (E_c/c) in the same direction.

So s = (E + E_c)^2 - ( (E - E_c) )^2 c^2. Wait, let's do the math:

s = [ (E + E_c) ]^2 - [ ( (E - E_c) ) c ]^2.

Wait, no. Because the momentum vectors are in opposite directions, the sum of the 3-momenta would have a magnitude equal to E/c - E_c/c (if E > E_c), because they're in opposite directions. So the vector sum is (E - E_c)/c in the direction of the gamma. So the invariant s is
