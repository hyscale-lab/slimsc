Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, I remember that pions are subatomic particles, and when they decay, they produce other particles. The question is asking about the kinetic energy of the product particles. The given reaction is Pi(+) at rest decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino nu. The rest masses are given: Pi is 139.6 MeV, and mu is 105.7 MeV. 

Wait, right, when a particle decays at rest, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is initially at rest, its momentum is zero. After decay, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to sum back to zero. Also, the total energy should be conserved.

So, the initial energy of the pion is just its rest mass energy, which is 139.6 MeV. The muon and neutrino will each have their rest mass energy plus their kinetic energies. But wait, neutrinos are really light, right? I think for most purposes, their rest mass is negligible. So the neutrino's energy is approximately its kinetic energy.

Let me consider the energies. The total energy after decay should equal the initial energy. So:

E_initial = E_mu + E_nu

E_initial is 139.6 MeV. E_mu is the muon's rest energy plus its kinetic energy, and E_nu is just its kinetic energy (since m_nu is almost zero).

So,

139.6 MeV = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu

But that's not enough. I also need to consider momentum conservation. The pion is at rest, so the total momentum after decay is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So, p_mu = -p_nu. The magnitudes are equal: |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p.

Now, the energy of each particle is related to their momentum and rest mass. The energy equation for each particle is:

E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Wait, no, the units are in MeV, so probably better to work in units where c=1
