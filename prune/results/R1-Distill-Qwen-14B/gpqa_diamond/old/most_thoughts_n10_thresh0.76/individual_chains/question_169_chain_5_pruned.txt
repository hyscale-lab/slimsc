Okay, so I'm trying to solve this nuclear decay problem. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the original decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. The emitted particles E and V are much lighter than A and B. It's given that the E particles have a continuous energy spectrum with an endpoint Q.

Now, in the variant, the decay emits one exotic, massless particle M instead of the two V particles. So the new reaction is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. The question is about how the energy spectrum of E changes in this new case compared to the original.

Hmm. I remember that in beta decay, when a neutron turns into a proton, it emits an electron and an antineutrino. The emitted electrons have a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy, leading to a range of possible energies for the electron. The maximum energy Q is when the neutrino is at rest (or massless), so the electron gets all the energy available, minus any other particles' rest mass.

Wait, but in this problem, E and V are emitted along with B. Since in the original decay, there are two E and two V. Let me think about what their presence means for the energy spectrum.

In the original case, with two E and two V emitted, the E particles must have a continuous spectrum. So each E can have varying energies, which suggests that the other particles (V and B) share the energy. The maximum energy (endpoint Q) occurs when the other particles are emitted in a way that gives E maximum energy. For example, if the two E particles are emitted in the same direction, and the other particles (like B and V) are at rest, but since they are moving, perhaps the maximum energy is determined when they carry away the least energy.

Wait, but in the original problem, since there are two V's, maybe they are neutrinos or something massless. If V is massless, their energy is just their momentum times c squared. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps E and V are charged particles, but that might complicate things.

Wait, no, E is a lighter particle. Let's think about the case when you have two particles emitted—like in beta decay, when you have beta and antineutrino. But in that case, their energies are related. So the electrons have a continuous spectrum because the neutrino carries away some energy.

But in the original problem, it's 2A → 2B + 2E + 2V. So two E and two V are emitted. Maybe E is an electron and V is a photon? Or perhaps E and V are other leptons or bosons. But their exact nature might not matter here.

In the original decay, the E particles' energy spectrum is continuous with endpoint Q. So each E can have energy up to Q. Now, what happens when instead of two V, we have one M that's massless.

Wait, the problem says in the variant, it's emitting one M instead of two V. So the decay is 2A → 2B + 2E + M. So, the number of E particles is the same—two E—but the number of V (or other particles) is reduced.

So, the original decay has 2E and 2V, and the variant has 2E and 1M. The question is about how the E's total energy spectrum changes.

In the original case, the two E and two V are emitted. Since V are presumably massless (if V is a neutrino), their energy is carried away, which affects the maximum energy available for E.

Wait, in the original decay, because there are two V's, perhaps their presence causes the E's to have a lower endpoint. Because each V takes away some energy. So when you have more particles being emitted, the maximum energy each E can have is less because energy is shared.

Now, in the variant, there's only one M, which is massless. So perhaps less energy is carried away by M, meaning that more energy is available for the E's. So the endpoint Q should increase.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about it
