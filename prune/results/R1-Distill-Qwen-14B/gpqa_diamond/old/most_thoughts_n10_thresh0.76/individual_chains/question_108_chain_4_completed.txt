Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me think about what I know.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. Oh right, I remember that in paramagnetism, the magnetic field interacts with the electrons in the atom. The orbital magnetic quantum number m is small, so maybe m is like 0 or ±1? I'm not sure, but I'll keep that in mind.

Wait, the paramagnetic coupling term is probably the energy due to the interaction between the magnetic moment of the electron's orbital motion and the external magnetic field. Oh right, the formula for that is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = (eħ)/(2m_e) * (L), where L is the angular momentum. Or wait, maybe it's μ = g * (eħ)/(2m_e) * m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio? Hmm, I might be mixing things up a bit.

The problem also mentions the transition energy ΔE of a hydrogen atom with a wavelength λ of 0.4861 micrometers. That's the Balmer series, right? Specifically the H-alpha line. I remember that the energy levels of hydrogen are given by the Rydberg formula. The transition from n=2 to n=1 gives the H-alpha line. Wait, no, wait: n=3 to n=2 gives H-alpha, I think. Because the Balmer series is transitions to n=2, so H-alpha is 3→2. The wavelength λ is about 0.486 micrometers.

So first, I should probably calculate the energy of that transition. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e7 m^-1. The formula for the wavelength λ is 1/λ = R (1/(n_final^2) - 1/(n_initial^2)). For H-alpha, n_initial is 3 and n_final is 2. So plugging in, 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/9) which is R*(5/36). Let me compute that.

Wait, λ is given as 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. So 1/λ is approximately 2056.3e3 m^-1. Let me check: 1/(486.1e-6 m) ≈ 2056.3e3 m^-1. Then, R is 1.097e7 m^-1. So 2056e3 = R * (5/36). Let me see: R*(5/36) is (1.097e7) * (5)/(36) ≈ (1.097e7)*0.1389 ≈ 1.524e6 m^-1. Wait, but that doesn't match the 2056e3 I got. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Oh wait, perhaps I should compute ΔE using the Rydberg formula directly.

Alternatively, the energy levels of hydrogen are E_n = - (Ry) / n², where Ry is the Rydberg energy, approximately 13.6 eV. So ΔE for the transition from n_initial to n_final is E_final - E_initial = Ry (1/n_final² - 1/n_initial²). Wait no, wait: the energy is E_n = -Ry/hc * hc/(n²), so the energy difference is (Ry) * (1/n_final² - 1/n_initial²) multiplied by hc, but wait, no, because E_n is negative. So the transition energy ΔE is E_final - E_initial, where E_final is lower energy than E_initial if the electron is moving to a lower orbit.

Wait, maybe I should compute the transition energy using the wavelength. The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s), c is speed of light (3e8 m/s), and λ is 486.1e-9 meters. So E_photon = (6.626e-34)(3e8)/(486.1e-9) = let's calculate that.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then denominator: 486.1e-9 m is 4.861e-7 m.

So E_photon = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ let's calculate that. Let's see, 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878/4.861) * 1e-18 ≈ 0.4085e-18 J. Hmm, that's 4.085e-19 J.

Wait, but that's a very small energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should express it in eV since we're comparing energies. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.085e-19 J is about 2.55 eV. Hmm, but wait, that's not right because the Balmer transition (n=3→n=2) should be about 1.89 eV? Or maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula E = hcRy (1/(n_final)^2 - 1/(n_initial)^2). Ry is approximately 13.6 eV. So for n_initial=3, n_final=2: E = 13.6 * (1/4 - 1/9) = 13.6 * (5/36) ≈ 13.6 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.89 eV. Oh right, that makes more sense. So the transition energy ΔE is about 1.89 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic coupling term. I think the energy shift due to the magnetic field is given by the Zeeman effect. For the orbital Zeeman effect, the energy shift is ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

Wait, but the Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e), and the value is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So μ_B = 9.274e-24 J/T.

Given B = 1 T, and m is small. Let's say m is ±1 or 0. Let's take m=1 for maximum effect. So ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m. So (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 T * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but that's in joules. Let's convert it to eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV. Oh, that's a very small energy compared to the 1.89 eV transition energy of hydrogen.

Wait, but wait a second. The orbital magnetic quantum number m can be up to the value of l, but for small m, perhaps m=0 or ±1. So for m=1, the shift is 5.79e-5 eV. That's way smaller than 1.89 eV. So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Wait, but wait, the question says that m is small. So perhaps m could be 0, but then the shift would be zero. So perhaps the maximum possible shift is for m=1. So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV, while the transition is 1.89 eV. So the paramagnetic energy is much smaller than the transition energy.

So comparing the two, the average energy ⟨H⟩ (which I think refers to the paramagnetic coupling term) is much less than ΔE. So the answer would be option C: ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the values. The Bohr magneton is 9.274e-24 J/T, right? And B is 1 T. So μ_B * B is 9.274e-24 J.

Wait, but wait, the orbital Zeeman effect for hydrogen is given by ΔE = (μ_B * B * m) / ħ? No, wait, I think the formula is ΔE = (μ_B * B * m), but perhaps I should double-check the formula.

Wait, no, more accurately, the energy shift is given by ΔE = μ_L · B, where μ_L is the orbital magnetic moment. μ_L is (eħ)/(2m_e) * L_z/(ħ) ), so perhaps the energy is (eħ/(2m_e)) * m * B.

Wait, maybe I should look up the formula again. The orbital Zeeman energy is given by ΔE = μ_B * B * m, where m is the magnetic quantum number. So yes, that's correct.

So for m=1, it's about 9.274e-24 J, which is 5.79e-5 eV.

Comparing to the transition energy of 1.89 eV, the paramagnetic term is about 5.79e-5 eV, which is 1.89eV divided by 1.7e4 (approximately 18,900 times smaller). So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Therefore, the average value of the paramagnetic term (⟨H⟩) is much smaller than ΔE, so the correct option is C: ⟨H⟩ << ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters:

1. **Transition Energy (ΔE):**  
   The transition energy for the Balmer series (e.g., H-alpha, n=3→n=2) is calculated using the Rydberg formula:  
   \[
   \Delta E = Ry \left( \frac{1}{n_{\text{final}}^2} - \frac{1}{n_{\text{initial}}^2} \right),
   \]  
   where \( Ry \approx 13.6 \, \text{eV} \). For \( n_{\text{initial}} = 3 \) and \( n_{\text{final}} = 2 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E = 13.6 \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right) = 13.6 \left( \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9} \right) = 13.6 \cdot \frac{5}{36} \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Paramagnetic Coupling Term:**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \mu_B \cdot B \cdot m,
   \]  
   where \( \mu_B = \frac{e \hbar}{2 m_e} \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, and \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number. For small \( m \), such as \( m = 1 \) (maximum value for small \( m \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}) \cdot (1 \, \text{T}) \cdot 1 = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
   \]  
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} = \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
   \]

3. **Comparison:**  
   The paramagnetic coupling term (\( \Delta E_{\text{Zeeman}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \)) is approximately \( 1.7 \times 10^4 \) times smaller than the transition energy (\( \Delta E \approx 1.89 \, \text{eV} \)). Therefore, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

**Conclusion:**  
The paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Thus, the correct option is:

**Answer: C**
