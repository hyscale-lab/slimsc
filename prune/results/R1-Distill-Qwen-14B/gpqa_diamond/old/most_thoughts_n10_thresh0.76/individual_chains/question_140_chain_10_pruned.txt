Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, it's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question carefully and break it down.

So, the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing a gas W. The gas's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is around 277 K, which I think is close to room temperature. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has two oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially its analogs.

Hmm. Let's think about each part.

First, the reaction between X and Y. The reaction is violent, so probably a strong acid-base reaction or something explosive. When it reacts, a gas W is released. The gas's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about common gases. Hydrogen has H2, but that's 1 proton and 0 neutrons each. Wait, wait. No, wait, the molecule's protons and neutrons are the same. So the total number of protons in the molecule equals the total number of neutrons.

Wait, each molecule. So for a molecule, the sum of protons and neutrons should be equal. Wait, no, the molecule's total protons equals the total neutrons. So, for example, if the molecule is H2O, that's 2 H (each with 1p, 0n) and O (8p, 8n). So total protons: 2 + 8 = 10. Neutrons: 8. Not equal. Another example, CO2: C has 6p, 6n; O has 8p each. So total protons: 6 + 16 = 22. Neutrons: 6 + 16 = 22. Oh wait, CO2 has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So gas W is CO2? But wait, CO2 is a gas, but is it released in such a reaction? Alternatively, maybe it's something else.

Wait, another possibility: O2. O2 molecule has 16 protons (each O has 8, so 16 total) and 16 neutrons (each O has 8, so 16). So the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. That fits: the number of protons equals the number of neutrons. So gas W could be O2. But O2 is diatomic. Or maybe H2, but as I thought earlier, H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons. Not equal.

Wait, what about CH4? Protons: 6 (C) + 4*(1) =10. Neutrons: C has 6, each H has 0. So 6. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a noble gas. Let's think. For example, Argon has atomic number 18. So each Ar atom has 18 protons and 22 neutrons (since Ar's standard isotope is about 40, so 18+22=40). So a molecule of
