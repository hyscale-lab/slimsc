Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particle emissions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics come into play, and the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 modulo 2. Wait, I think T stands for isospin, S for spin, and L for orbital angular momentum. Oh, and the final NN state has T(NN) = 0.

So, the question is asking which partial wave is not permitted. The options are A to D, each showing the transition from 1S0 to another state plus a particle (like p, f, etc.).

First, let me remember the basics. The initial state is 1S0. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J), right? So 1S0 would mean S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L=0 (since S is in spectroscopic notation; S is 0, but I might be mixing that up), and J=0. Wait, no. Wait, the term symbol is (2S+1) for the spin part, followed by L (the orbital angular momentum) and then J, the total angular momentum. So 1S0 would be S=0, L=0 (since S is the orbital), and J=0? Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused between S as spin and S as orbital. No, in the term symbol, the first part is 2S+1, where S is the total spin. The next part is the orbital angular momentum L, written as a letter: S, P, D, F, etc. Then J is the total angular momentum.

So 1S0: 2S+1=1 implies S=0. Then 'S' as the orbital part means L=0. So J=0. That's the initial state.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So parity is involved here. Also, angular momentum and spin must be conserved. Plus, the Pauli exclusion principle applies, which relates isospin, spin, and orbital angular momentum.

The condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Hmm. So T is the isospin of the NN system, S is the spin, L is the orbital angular momentum. So T = S + L +1 mod 2. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Because these are quantum numbers, so they're either integers or half-integers, but mod 2, so whether they are even or odd.

The final state has T(NN) = 0. So T=0. So plugging into the equation: 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2. Which means S + L +1 must be even. So S + L must be odd. Because 0 mod 2 is even. So S + L must be odd.

So the sum of the spin and orbital angular momentum quantum numbers must be odd. So if S is integer, L integer... wait, but S is spin, which can be integer or half-integer for particles. Wait, nucleons are fermions, so each has spin 1/2. So when two are bound together, their total spin S can be 0 or 1 (since 1/2 +1/2 can combine to 0 or 1). So S can be 0 or 1.

Wait, the initial state is S=0, as per 1S0. But after emitting a particle, the final state's spin S could be different? Or is S the same because spin is conserved? Oh, but the spin here is the total spin of the NN system. Wait, but when a particle is emitted, the system's spin can change. Wait, no—spin is conserved in a process, but in this case, the NN system is emitting a particle, so the total spin must be considered along with the spin of the emitted particle. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step for each option.

Each option shows the transition from 1S0 to another state, plus a particle. The options are:

A) 1S0 → 7D¹ + p
B) 1S0 → 3S¹ + p
C) 1S0 → 3D³ + f
D) 1S0 → 3P⁰ + s

Wait, I'm looking at the options, each has a final state (like 3D^3), and a particle emitted (like 'p'). The letters p, s, f denote the type of particle, but their intrinsic parity is given as -1. Wait, no, the particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So the emitted particle is X, which is each option's last letter: p, s, f, etc. Wait, perhaps p is a proton, s is a sigma or something, but parity is given for X as -1.

Wait, but the parity of the emitted particle X is -1. So each emitted particle has parity -1. For example, a pion (π) has parity -1. But the options just denote X as p, s, f—maybe these are labels for different particles, but their intrinsic parity is given as -1. So for each emission, the parity of X is -1.

Wait, but when considering the process, the parity of the final system (the NN state) must be considered along with
