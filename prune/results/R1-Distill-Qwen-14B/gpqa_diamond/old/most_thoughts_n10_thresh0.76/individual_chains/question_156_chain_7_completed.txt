Okay, I need to figure out this chemistry problem. So, the question is about two reactions involving (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are run on HPLC columns, both standard and chiral. I need to determine what the chromatograms show.

First, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But wait, does it do anything else? Like, maybe some ring-opening?

Wait, the reaction is followed by aqueous acid. Oh right, I think after epoxidation, when you add acid, the epoxide might undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening. Epoxides under acidic conditions typically undergo ring-opening via a carbocation mechanism. So, the structure of the epoxide will influence the products.

Let me think about each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene is treated with mCPBA. The epoxidation of (E)-oct-4-ene. Epoxidation is stereospecific, right? Because mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that depends on the geometry of the starting alkene.

Wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. The substituents on each carbon are higher priority groups. For (E), the higher priority groups are opposite each other.

When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For (E)-dienes, the epoxidation leads to a trans-epoxide? Or is it cis?

Wait, I think that mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition. So, the oxygen adds to the same face. So for an (E) double bond, the substituents are opposite, so adding the epoxide in a syn fashion would lead to a trans epoxide, perhaps? Or maybe the configuration depends on the starting geometry.

Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. Let me think. For the epoxidation, mCPBA adds across the double bond in such a way that the two new oxygens are added to the same face as the peracid. So for an (E) double bond, which has the substituents on opposite sides, adding the epoxide in a syn fashion would create a cis epoxide or a trans epoxide?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structures. (E)-oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2 on either end, but wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2. No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's not right. Let me think. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 groups on C4 and C5. So, structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, octane is eight carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's too long. Wait, the structure should be: for oct-4-ene, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let's get the structure right.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 at C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5. So, the molecule is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no—that's seven carbons. Oh wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be longer. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of the reaction.

When mCPBA epoxidizes (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide will depend on the starting geometry. For (E), the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide would have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite faces.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about how the epoxide ring forms. mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond in a syn addition. So for a trans double bond (E), the addition would lead to a cis epoxide? Or maybe the opposite.

Wait, no. Let me think: when you have a trans (E) double bond, and you add the epoxide in a syn fashion, the substituents on each carbon would be on the same face. So if originally the substituents were on opposite sides (E), adding an epoxide in syn would lead the oxygens to be on the same face, making the epoxide have those substituents on the same side. So the epoxide would have a cis configuration.

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. The starting (E) isomer has the two higher priority groups on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the peracid's oxygen attacks the same face of the double bond. So for each carbon, the oxygen adds to the same face. So for (E), the two substituents (like the higher priority groups on each end) are opposite. So adding the oxygen in a syn way would result in the oxygen atoms being on the same face, causing the two substituents (which were opposite) to end up on the same side in the epoxide. Hmm, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, maybe the configuration of the epoxide depends on whether the starting alkene is E or Z. For (E)-dienes, the epoxidation leads to a trans epoxide. Or maybe it's the other way around. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should find a way to proceed.

Assuming that each reaction produces an epoxide, and then under aqueous acid, the epoxide ring opens. Since the starting epoxide's configuration is different for each isomer, the ring-opening products might be different.

Wait, no. Let me think: (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are epoxidized with mCPBA, each giving a specific epoxide. Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, leading to ring-opening.

In acid, the epoxide ring opens via protonation, leading to a carbocation intermediate. The nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon in the most stable carbocation.

Wait, but in a symmetrical epoxide, like from a trans-alkene, the ring-opening might lead to a specific product. Or if the epoxide is from a cis-alkene, the ring-opening might be different.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product of each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide (let's say trans) → ring-opening under acid → forms a diol.

Wait, no, no. Wait, when an epoxide is opened under acidic conditions, it forms a diol. But the configuration of the diol depends on the epoxide's structure and the ring-opening mechanism.

Wait, perhaps the diastereomers are formed based on the epoxide structure.

Wait, maybe each epoxide (from E and Z alkenes) would form different diastereomers upon ring-opening.

Wait, but wait, for (E)-oct-4-ene: the starting alkene is trans. Epoxidation would form a cis or trans epoxide?

Wait, wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry of the epoxidation. mCPBA adds an epoxide group via a cyclic transition state, which leads to a syn addition. So, the two new oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the double bond.

So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon of the double bond are opposite each other. Adding the epoxide in a syn fashion would lead to the two oxygen atoms being on the same face, which means that the substituents on each end of the epoxide are on the same face. So the epoxide would have a cis configuration. So the epoxide from the E alkene would be a cis epoxide.

Wait, but E and Z alkenes would form different epoxides. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis, and for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans?

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again. Suppose you have an E double bond: groups on each carbon are opposite. When mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, the two oxygen atoms add to the same face. So the two substituents (the ones that were opposite) end up on the same face in the epoxide. So the epoxide would have a cis configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the opposite. For (E), the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide's substituents are on the same face, making it a trans epoxide? I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I can think of an example.

Take propene. Epoxidation of propene (which is a trans double bond? No, propene is CH2=CH2CH3, which is a cis arrangement because the substituents on each carbon are the same. Wait, no, that's not right. Propene is CH2=CHCH3, which is a trans arrangement between the two methyl groups (if any). Wait, no, perhaps I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, let's think of (E)-but-2-ene. Structure is CH2CH2 (E). So, when mCPBA adds, the epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on the same face. So, for (E)-but-2-ene, the substituents on each carbon are opposite, and adding the oxygen in a syn fashion would make the epoxide's substituents on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the epoxide as having the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because mCPBA adds in a way that depends on the double bond's geometry.

Wait, perhaps. For (E)-alkene, the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide would have the substituents on the same face. So the epoxide would be a cis epoxide.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move forward, assuming that each reaction produces a different epoxide.

So, Reaction 1: (E) → epoxide A.

Reaction 2: (Z) → epoxide B.

Then, each epoxide is treated with aqueous acid, leading to ring-opening.

In acid, the epoxide protonates, leading to ring opening. The nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon because that forms the more stable carbocation.

Wait, but in an oct-4-ene-derived epoxide, the structure is symmetric? Because oct-4-ene is symmetric around the double bond. So, the epoxide would be symmetric, leading to only one product upon ring-opening under acid conditions.

Wait, but wait. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the two substituents (like CH2 groups) on the same face. When acid is added, the epoxide opens to form a diol. But if the epoxide is symmetric, would the diol be a single compound or a mixture?

Wait, no. Because the epoxide is symmetric, the ring-opening would lead to the same product regardless of which side the water attacks. So each epoxide from E and Z would form a single diol upon acid hydrolysis.

Wait, but wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would only have one possible structure. For example, if the epoxide is symmetric around the central axis, the attack from either side would give the same diol.

But if the epoxide is not symmetric, then the ring-opening could lead to different diastereomers.

Wait, but oct-4-ene is symmetric. So the epoxide would be symmetric. So, each reaction would produce a single diol. So, for Reaction 1, the product is diol A, and for Reaction 2, the product is diol B.

But wait, are diol A and diol B different? Because the starting epoxides are different.

Wait, no. Because the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene would be different? Because mCPBA adds in a way that depends on the starting geometry.

Wait, but if (E)-oct-4-ene forms a cis epoxide and (Z)-oct-4-ene forms a trans epoxide, then upon ring-opening, each would form a different diol.

Wait, but wait, no. Because oct-4-ene is symmetric, the epoxide from (E) and (Z) would be different but when you open them, perhaps the diols are same or different.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide from (E) and (Z) are enantiomers, but when you open them, the diols would be same or different.

Wait, let's think: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A (cis), which upon acid hydrolysis forms diol A.

(Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B (trans), which upon acid hydrolysis forms diol B.

But in a symmetric epoxide, opening would give the same product regardless of which side you attack.

Wait, but in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is a cis arrangement. So, when you open it, you have two chiral centers.

Wait, no, because the epoxide is symmetric. So each carbon in the epoxide has two identical groups. For example, if the epoxide is between C4 and C5 of octane, and the substituents are symmetric, then each carbon in the epoxide is attached to two CH2 groups and two other CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me think about the structure.

Oct-4-ene: CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that can't be right. Let me get the structure correctly. Octane has eight carbons. So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 between carbons 4 and 5, which would be: CH2CH2 on the ends of a four-carbon chain.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a very long chain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting tangled up in the structure and should proceed.

Assuming that each reaction produces a different epoxide, which upon treatment with acid gives a different diol.

Wait, but wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would have two identical chiral centers, making it a meso compound. For example, in the case of cis-epoxide, when opened, the diol could be a meso compound because of the symmetry.

Similarly, a trans-epoxide might open into a diol that is a pair of enantiomers, but if the molecule is symmetric, it would again be a meso form.

Wait, no. Let me think again: for a symmetric epoxide, when it opens under acid, the resulting diol would have two chiral centers, but due to the symmetry, it would be a meso compound. So it would be a single compound, not a pair of enantiomers.

So, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A (cis) → acid → diol A (meso compound).

Similarly, Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B (trans) → acid → diol B (also meso compound? Or not?)

Wait, no. Let me think about the epoxide formed from (Z)-oct-4-ene. Since (Z) has substituents on the same side, and mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, the epoxide would have substituents on the same face. So, if the starting alkene is Z, the epoxide would be trans?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of it this way: the configuration of the epoxide depends on the starting double bond's geometry and the addition of mCPBA.

mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon are opposite. Adding the oxygen groups to the same face would result in the substituents being on the same face in the epoxide, making the epoxide a cis epoxide.

For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on the same face. Adding the oxygen groups to the same face would make the substituents on the same face in the epoxide, resulting in a trans epoxide.

Wait, that seems a bit conflicting. Let me try a different approach. Suppose the double bond is E. The substituents on C4 and C5 are opposite. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen adds to the same face, so the substituents (which were on opposite faces) end up on the same face in the epoxide. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same face, making it cis.

For the Z isomer, the substituents are on the same face. Adding the oxygen in a syn fashion would make those substituents on the same face in the epoxide. So the substituents would be on the same face, leading to a trans epoxide?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing cis and trans here. Alternatively, perhaps for (E) double bonds, the epoxide is trans, and for (Z), the epoxide is cis. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the stereochemistry of the epoxide is the same as the starting alkene. So, (E) becomes trans epoxide, (Z) becomes cis epoxide.

Wait, no, that doesn't align with the addition mechanism.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the epoxide's configuration is the same as the starting alkene's configuration. So, (E) gives a trans epoxide, (Z) gives a cis epoxide.

If that's the case, then during acid treatment, each epoxide would open to form a diol.

But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol would be a meso compound, regardless of whether the epoxide is cis or trans.

Wait, no. Let me think about the epoxide structure.

Take for example, cis-epoxide: when you open it, the diol would have the two hydroxyl groups on the same side, leading to a certain configuration. Trans-epoxide would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a different diastereomer.

Wait, but in the case of a symmetric epoxide (like from oct-4-ene, which is symmetric), the diol from a cis epoxide would have both hydroxyls on the same side, but due to symmetry, it would be a meso compound. Similarly, the trans epoxide, when opened, would form a diol which is also a meso compound because of the symmetry.

Wait, but how?

Let me imagine the epoxide as a four-membered ring. If the epoxide is cis, the two substituents on each carbon are on the same face. So when the ring opens, the hydroxyl groups are added to the same face, leading to a diol where both hydroxyls are on the same side.

But in a symmetric molecule, this would make the diol a meso compound because the two chiral centers are mirror images.

Similarly, a trans epoxide would have the substituents on opposite faces. When it opens, the hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides, but due to symmetry, the diol would still be a meso compound.

Wait, that can't be, because meso compounds are a result of having multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry.

Wait, let's imagine the diol from the cis epoxide. Each OH is on the same face. So, for the diol, each of the two adjacent carbons has an OH group. But because the original molecule is symmetric, the two OHs would be on the same side, leading to a meso structure.

But if the epoxide is trans, the OHs would be on opposite sides, but the molecule would still be symmetric, making it a meso compound.

Wait, that suggests that both diols are meso compounds, so each would be a single compound.

But wait, that can't be right because the epoxide's structure would determine the diol's structure.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the products of each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → trans-epoxide → acid → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → cis-epoxide → acid → diol B.

Wait, but since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol from each would be a meso compound, meaning each reaction produces a single diastereomer.

Wait, but does that make diol A and diol B the same or different?

Wait, no, because the starting epoxides are different. For (E), the epoxide is trans, and upon opening, the diol would have the OH groups on opposite sides. For (Z), the epoxide is cis, leading to OH groups on the same side.

But wait, if the epoxide is symmetric, then diol A and diol B could be the same or different.

Wait, perhaps it's the same diol, but that doesn't make sense because the epoxide is different.

Alternatively, perhaps both epoxides, when opened, give the same meso diol. But that doesn't seem right because the starting epoxides are different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual structures.

Let me imagine the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene. It's a trans epoxide. When opened under acid, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides. Because the molecule is symmetric, the diol would be a meso compound, so it's a single compound (not a pair of enantiomers).

Similarly, the epoxide from (Z)-oct-4-ene is a cis epoxide. When opened, the diol would have both hydroxyls on the same side. But because the molecule is symmetric, it would also be a meso compound, so again a single compound.

Wait, but wait, if both epoxides upon opening give the same diol, then combining the products would give only one compound. But that can't be the case because the starting materials are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the diols are different. Because the epoxide's configuration affects the diol's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the diol from the trans epoxide is a meso compound, and the diol from the cis epoxide is another meso compound. Or perhaps one is a meso compound and the other is a pair of enantiomers. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the actual reaction.

In the case of epoxide opening under acidic conditions, the attack occurs on the more substituted carbon. But in oct-4-ene, both ends of the epoxide are equally substituted because the molecule is symmetric.

So, each epoxide would open in a way that forms a single diol.

But in the case of a cis epoxide, the diol would have both hydroxyls on the same side, making it a meso compound. Similarly, a trans epoxide would open to form a diol with the hydroxyls on opposite sides, but because of symmetry, it's still a meso compound.

Wait, but then both diols would be the same meso compound, which doesn't make sense because the starting materials are different.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Maybe each epoxide leads to a different diastereomer.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (E) is a different diastereomer than the diol from (Z).

Alternatively, perhaps the diol from (E) is a meso compound, and the diol from (Z) is another meso compound, but they are different.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck. Maybe I should try a different approach.

Assuming that Reaction 1 produces a diol with two chiral centers, and Reaction 2 produces another diol with two chiral centers.

But wait, the starting materials are E and Z, so perhaps the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, if the epoxide from E is a trans epoxide, and the one from Z is a cis epoxide, then upon opening, the diols would have different configurations.

But in each case, due to the molecule's symmetry, each diol is a meso compound, meaning each is a single compound.

So, each reaction produces a single diol. So, when the chemist combines the products, they have two diols: diol A and diol B.

What are diol A and diol B?

Diol A: from E-epoxide → meso.

Diol B: from Z-epoxide → meso.

But wait, if the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on the same side (cis) because the ring opens with attack from the opposite face.

Wait, perhaps in the epoxide, the two oxygens are on opposite faces (trans), so when the ring opens, the hydroxyl groups end up on the same side, making a cis diol.

Wait, no. Let me think about the mechanism: when the epoxide is protonated, the ring opens with the nucleophile (water) attacking the more substituted carbon. But in this case, both carbons are equally substituted, so it's symmetric.

But the key is the stereochemistry. For a trans epoxide, the two oxygens are on opposite sides. When the ring opens, the water attacks from the opposite side, leading to the hydroxyl groups being on the same face.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

In a trans epoxide (from E-alkene), the oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. When the ring opens, the nucleophile (water) attacks the more substituted carbon (which is the same on both ends due to symmetry). The attack occurs from the opposite face of the protonated oxygen. So, each hydroxyl is added to the opposite face of the epoxide oxygen.

Wait, but in a trans epoxide, each oxygen is on opposite faces. So when the ring opens, the two hydroxyl groups end up on the same face, leading to a cis diol.

Similarly, in a cis epoxide (from Z-alkene), the oxygens are on the same face. When the ring opens, the hydroxyls would be on opposite faces, leading to a trans diol.

But wait, in both cases, the molecule is symmetric. So, the diol from trans epoxide would be a cis diol and a meso compound. The diol from the cis epoxide would be a trans diol and also a meso compound.

Wait, that can't be right, because a trans diol with symmetry would be a meso compound as well. So, both diols would be meso compounds, but different ones.

So, diol A (from E) is a cis diol (meso), and diol B (from Z) is a trans diol (meso).

Wait, but cis and trans diols in a symmetric molecule would both be meso. So, each diol would be a single compound.

But if the diols are structurally different, then when the products are combined, you would have two different compounds.

Wait, but how can diol A and diol B be different if they are both meso? Let me think about their structures.

Diol A: cis diol, meso.

Diol B: trans diol, meso.

Wait, but for a molecule like 2,3-diol, the cis and trans would be different structures. So, diol A would have both OH groups on the same side, and diol B would have them on opposite sides.

But since the molecule is symmetric, each diol would be a meso form, which is a single compound.

So, each reaction produces a single meso diol. But are these diols the same or different?

Wait, if Diol A is a cis diol and Diol B is a trans diol, then they're different compounds. So, when combined, you have two different diols.

But wait, in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is trans, which upon ring-opening gives a cis diol (meso). For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is cis, which upon ring-opening gives a trans diol (meso).

But wait, in a symmetric molecule, a cis diol would be a meso compound, and a trans diol would also be a meso compound, but they're different structures.

So, when the products are combined, we have two different diols: one cis and one trans (each meso).

But wait, no. Because for each reaction, the starting material produces a specific diol. So, when you combine them, you have two diols.

Now, when running HPLC, both standard and chiral columns.

In the standard HPLC (achiral), how would the diols appear?

Each diol (cis and trans) is a single compound (meso), so in the standard HPLC, each would elute as a single peak. So, two peaks in total.

But wait, when you run a mixture of two different diastereomers on a standard column, they would elute separately. But wait, the diols are diastereomers (cis and trans), so they would have different retention times.

Wait, but for each diol, it's a single compound. So, if there are two diols (cis and trans), each being a single compound, then the standard HPLC would show two peaks.

Similarly, the chiral HPLC would resolve enantiomers. But since both diols are meso compounds (achiral), the chiral column would not separate them. So, each meso diol would elute as a single peak.

Wait, no. Wait, if the diol is a meso compound, it's achiral. So, a chiral HPLC column wouldn't separate it into enantiomers because there are none. So, each meso diol would appear as a single peak on the chiral column as well.

Wait, but if you have two different meso diols, which are themselves diastereomers, would the chiral column separate them?

Wait, no, because diastereomers are separated on standard columns, but chiral columns are used to separate enantiomers. Diastereomers would have different physical properties, so a standard column would separate them, but a chiral column would also separate diastereomers if they have different interactions with the stationary phase.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think.

In a standard (achiral) HPLC, diastereomers will elute as separate peaks because they have different physical properties. So, cis diol and trans diol would be two separate peaks.

In a chiral HPLC column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, diastereomers might still be separated because they may interact differently with the chiral stationary phase.

Wait, but wait, a chiral column can separate enantiomers and also diastereomers if their interactions with the stationary phase are different. So, in this case, if the two diols are diastereomers, the chiral column would separate them as well, leading to two peaks.

But wait, the diols are both meso and achiral. So, if they are different diastereomers, perhaps the chiral column would not separate them because they are not enantiomers. Or maybe the column can separate diastereomers as well.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Let me think about the products again.

Each reaction produces a single diol: one is a cis diol (meso), and the other is a trans diol (meso). But these are two different diastereomers.

When you combine them, you have two different diastereomers. On a standard HPLC, these would be two separate peaks because they are diastereomers.

On a chiral HPLC, which is designed to separate enantiomers, would diastereomers also be separated? I think yes, because diastereomers have different physical properties and would interact differently with the stationary phase.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Some sources say that chiral columns can separate enantiomers but may not separate diastereomers effectively, while achiral columns can separate diastereomers.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Chiral columns are specifically designed for enantiomeric separation, but diastereomers may have different affinities and could be separated as well, depending on their structures.

Alternatively, maybe the diols are actually the same compound, but I don't think so because the diastereomers would have different structures.

Wait, in this problem, the two diols are diastereomers. So, in the standard HPLC, they would give two peaks. In the chiral HPLC, they would also give two peaks because they are diastereomers and the column can separate them.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the situation.

If the two diols are diastereomers and have different physical properties, then in both standard and chiral HPLCs, they would show as separate peaks. So, standard HPLC would show 2 peaks, and chiral HPLC would also show 2 peaks.

But wait, the options don't have this. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A) 4 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

B) 2 peaks in standard HPLC and 3 peaks in chiral HPLC.

C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

D) 3 peaks in standard HPLC and 4 peaks in chiral HPLC.

Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the standard HPLC would show two diastereomers as two peaks, and the chiral HPLC would also show two peaks. So option C would be correct.

But wait, is that the case?

Alternatively, perhaps each diol can exist in multiple stereoisomers, leading to more peaks.

Wait, but each diol is a meso compound, which is achiral. So, each would give a single peak on both standard and chiral columns.

Wait, in that case, combining two diols (each a single meso compound) would give two peaks on standard HPLC and two peaks on chiral HPLC as well.

So, the standard HPLC would have two peaks (for the two diols), and the chiral HPLC would have two peaks (since the diols are diastereomers and the chiral column can separate them).

But wait, if the diols are diastereomers, the chiral column would separate them into two peaks. So, both HPLC would show two peaks each. So, the correct answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps each epoxide leads to more than one product.

Wait, no. Because each epoxide is symmetric, the acid hydrolysis would give only one product per reaction.

So, combining the products, you have two different diols (each meso), which are diastereomers. So, on standard HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

So the answer would be C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

C) 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Yes, option C is present. So, the correct answer is C.


The question involves the reaction of (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the subsequent analysis of the products on standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction Overview**:  
   - mCPBA is a peracid that reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via syn addition.  
   - The stereochemistry of the starting alkene (E or Z) determines the configuration of the resulting epoxide.  
   - Under acidic conditions, epoxides undergo ring-opening to form diols.  

2. **Epoxide Formation**:  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the double bond geometry is trans. mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, resulting in a **cis epoxide**.  
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the double bond geometry is cis. mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, resulting in a **trans epoxide**.  

3. **Ring-Opening Under Acid**:  
   - Both epoxides are symmetric due to the structure of oct-4-ene.  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the cis epoxide produces a **cis diol** (meso compound).  
   - Acid-catalyzed ring-opening of the trans epoxide produces a **trans diol** (meso compound).  

4. **Final Products**:  
   - Reaction 1 produces a cis diol (meso compound).  
   - Reaction 2 produces a trans diol (meso compound).  
   - The two diols are **diastereomers** of each other.  

5. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers have different physical properties and will elute as separate peaks. Thus, two peaks are observed.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**: While chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers, they can also separate diastereomers if their interactions with the stationary phase differ. Therefore, two peaks are observed.  

6. **Conclusion**:  
   - On both standard and chiral HPLC columns, the chemist observes **2 peaks** corresponding to the two diastereomeric diols.
