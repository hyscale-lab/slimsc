Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the problem says we have 10,000 identical systems, each with a particle moving along the x-axis in a tube. The wave function for each particle is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. The i here is the imaginary unit, the square root of -1. When they measure the position of the particles, none are found outside the region between x=1 and x=3. So all the particles are confined to this interval.

The question is asking for the numerical value of "a". The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. Okay, so I think I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must satisfy certain conditions, like normalization. The total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 1. So the integral of the absolute square of the wave function from negative infinity to positive infinity should equal 1.

But wait, in this case, the wave function is given as (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. I'm a bit confused because a wave function usually is a complex function, but the way it's written here, I think it's split into real and imaginary parts. So the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. Or is the entire expression a complex number? Let me parse that again.

The wave function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. So that's a complex function where the real part is a/sqrt(1+x), and the imaginary part is -0.5. So the function is ψ(x) = (a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (-0.5)i.

Wait, but when you have a wave function, the square of its magnitude should integrate to 1. The magnitude is the square root of (real part squared plus imaginary part squared). So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)².

But wait, the problem states that when measuring the position, no particles are found at x <1 and x>3. So all the probability is between x=1 and x=3. So the integral of |ψ(x)|² from x=1 to x=3 must be 1, and zero outside.

So first, to normalize the wave function, we set the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

But wait, let me write out |ψ(x)|².

ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i → |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, but that's the square of the modulus. So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

But wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if the wave function is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, then the modulus squared is (a/sqrt(1+x))² + (0.5)^2, which is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx = 1.

But wait, that's the integral of |ψ(x)|² over the region where the particle is found. So that's the normalization condition.

So let's compute the integral:

Integral from 1 to 3 of [ a²/(1+x) + 0.25 ] dx.

Let's split it into two parts: integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute each integral separately.

The first integral, ∫ a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln(1+x). So the first part is a² [ ln(1+x) ] from 1 to 3.

So that is a² [ ln(4) - ln(2) ] = a² ln(4/2) = a² ln(2).

The second integral is ∫ 0.25 dx from 1 to 3. The integral is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So adding both parts:

a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So the equation is a² ln(2) = 1 - 0.5 → a² ln(2) = 0.5.

Solving for a²: a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute the value of ln(2). I recall that ln(2) is approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213).

What's sqrt(0.7213)? Let's compute that.

I know that 0.85² is 0.7225, which is very close to 0.7213. So sqrt(0.7213) is approximately 0.849, which is roughly 0.85.

Wait, but wait. Let me recheck the calculations because I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, the integral of |ψ(x)|² from 1 to 3 is 1. So we have:

a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1 → a² = (0.5) / ln(2).

Compute 0.5 / ln(2):

0.5 is 0.5, ln(2) is about 0.69314718.

So 0.5 / 0.69314718 ≈ 0.72134752.

So a² is approximately 0.7213, so a is sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849, which is about 0.85. Looking at the options, option B is 0.85.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The wave function given is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i. So the modulus squared is (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25. That part
