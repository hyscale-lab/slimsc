Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted aromatic compound. Let me start by understanding the given information.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, so substituents add up to 2 more carbons. But wait, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the ring. Each substituent can be a single atom or a group. 

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, so the ring has both a carbonyl group and a halogen substituent. Let me think. Common halogens are Cl, Br, I. So, maybe it's something like a nitro group or an aldehyde group? Wait, carbonyl could be part of a ketone, aldehyde, or ester, etc. But since it's an aromatic ring, the substituents are likely in positions ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, the aromatic ring has two substituents: one is a carbonyl group, and the other is a halogen. Or maybe one substituent is a group that contains both a carbonyl and a halogen. Wait, but the FTIR shows peaks for both, so each is present. So the ring has two substituents: a carbonyl-containing group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.).

Wait, but wait. A di-substituted ring with substituents including a carbonyl group and a halogen. Let me think about possible structures. For example, phthalic acid derivatives, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's an aromatic aldehyde with another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group (like -CO-) and the other is a halide.

Wait, another possibility: the ring could have
