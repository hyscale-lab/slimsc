Okay, so I have this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that scalar potential is usually associated with electric fields and the vector potential with magnetic fields. Let's think about how these potentials are derived when a charge is moving.

So the setup: a charge q is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field is observed at point r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. The velocity at the generating time is v.

Wait, the potentials are at time t, and t is greater than tr, which makes sense because the field generated at tr would take time to reach the observer at r. So, I think this is a retarded time situation, where we're considering the fields (or potentials) based on the charge's position and velocity at an earlier time.

The scalar potential V is typically given by Coulomb's law, but when the charge is moving, maybe it's different. Oh wait, no, the scalar potential is still the same as Coulomb's potential, but I might be forgetting something. Or wait, maybe the scalar potential is just the static Coulomb potential, but the vector potential comes into play because of the motion.

Wait, no. The scalar potential for a moving charge should account for the fact that the charge's velocity affects the field. Or does it? Hmm. I'm a bit confused here.

I remember that the scalar potential due to a charge moving with velocity v is given by V = (q / (4πε₀)) * (1 / r'), where r' is some expression involving the distance and the velocity.

Wait, wait. The general expressions for the potentials in the case of a moving charge involve the Lorentz transformation. The scalar potential V is the Coulomb potential, but the vector potential A is related to the motion of the charge.

Let me think about how these potentials are calculated. The scalar potential for a charge at rest is V = q/(4πε₀ r). But when the charge is moving, there might be a correction because of the motion. Or perhaps it's just V = q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is a function of the distance and the velocity.

Wait, another approach: I think the scalar potential is just the static potential evaluated at the retarded time. Because the scalar
