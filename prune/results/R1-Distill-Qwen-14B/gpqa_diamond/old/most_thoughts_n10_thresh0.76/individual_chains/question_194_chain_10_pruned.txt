Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Each spin can be either +1 or -1, right? The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Wait, J is probably a coupling constant, but I don't know if it's positive or negative. Oh, well, maybe the problem just keeps it as J.

The partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to calculate all possible configurations of S1, S2, S3 and for each, calculate the energy and then sum exp(-βE) for each.

First, let's figure out all the possible states. Each spin has two options: +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. Let me list them out:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, I need to compute E for each of these states. The energy is E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's compute the terms S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 for each case.

Let me make a table:

State | S1 S2 | S1 S3 | S2 S3 | Sum = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 | E = -J*(Sum)
-----|-------|-------|-------|--------------------------|-------------
1    | (+)(+) | (+)(+) | (+)(+) | 3                      | E = -3J
2    | (+)(+) | (+)(-) | (+)(-) | 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1    | E = J
3    | (+)(-) | (+)(+) | (-)(+) | (-1) + 1 + (-1) = -1    | E = J
4    | (+)(-) | (+)(-) | (-)(-) | (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1    | E = J
5    | (-)(+) | (-)(+) | (+)(+) | (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1     | E = J
6    | (-)(+) | (-)(-) | (+)(-) | (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1     | E = J
7    | (-)(-) | (-)(+) | (-)(+) | 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1    | E = J
8    | (-)(-) | (-)(-) | (-)(-) | -3                      | E = 3J

Wait, let me double-check some calculations. For state 2: S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (+)(+) = +1
S1S3 = (+)(-) = -1
S2S3 = (+)(-) = -1
Sum: 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. So E is -J*(-1) = J. That's correct.

Similarly, state 4: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)
S1S3 = (-1)
S2S3 = (+1) because (-1)(-1) = +1.
Sum is (-1) + (-1) + 1 = -1. So E is J.

Wait, same for state 5: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = -1*(+1)= -1
S1S3 = -1*(+1)= -1
S2S3 = (+1)(+1)= 1
Sum: -1 -1 + 1 = -1. E= J.

And state 6: S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = (-1)(+1)= -1
S1S3 = (-1)(-1)= +1
S2S3 = (+1)(-1)= -1
Sum: -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

State 7: S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1.

S1S2 = (-1)(-1)= +1
S1S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1
S2S3 = (-1)(+1)= -1
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = J.

Wait, that seems correct. So states 2,3,4,5,6,7 all have E= J. Only states 1 and 8 have E= -3J and 3J respectively? Wait no, state 1 sum
