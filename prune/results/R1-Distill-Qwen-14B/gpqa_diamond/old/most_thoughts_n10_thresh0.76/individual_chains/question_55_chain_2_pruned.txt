Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Let me try to figure this out step by step. So, the question is about identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are all acetates with either propenyl or butenyl groups, and the substituents are either cis or trans. 

First, I'll recall what each of these structures looks like. Acetate esters typically have the structure R-O-CO-O-R, wait no, wait. No, acetate is CH3COO-. So, the ester would be something like R-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, no, wait, actually, the ester is formed from an acid and an alcohol. So, for example, ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. So, in this case, the options are propenyl or butenyl acetates. 

So, the acetate part is CH3COO-, and the R group is either propenyl or butenyl. Now, propenyl would be like CH2CH2CH2, but wait, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but wait, more accurately, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- when it's propenyl. But wait, wait, propenyl is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, but the position of the double bond might vary. 

Wait, the options are Cis and Trans for both propenyl and butenyl. Hmm. So, for example, propenyl acetate would have the structure CH2=CHCH2OAc, but depending on the configuration, the substituents around the double bond could be cis or trans. Wait, but propenyl is a three-carbon group, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. For propenyl, it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But if it's propenyl, then the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, and the substituents are on either side. 

But then, what about the NMR data? The data given is:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm
