Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through this.

The question has three parts, A, B, and C, each involving different reactions. I need to figure out what each product is and match them with the options.

Starting with reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat. Hmm. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements often involve the shift of a pi bond to a sigma bond. The Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, but I'm not sure what's happening here.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine sounds like a primary amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Maybe it's something like CH2(OCH3)2NH2. But-3-en-2-ol is allyl alcohol, I think. The structure is CH2CH2CHOH? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol would be HOCH2CH2CH2CH2? No, that's butanol. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 with the double bond between carbons 2 and 3? No, but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on carbon 2, and the double bond between 3 and 4? Wait, but but has four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2 but that can't be right because that's five carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol has four carbons: the OH is on C2 and the double bond between C3 and C4? So it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? No, that's but-1-en-4-ol. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the positions. Let me think again.

But-3-en-2-ol: the longest chain
