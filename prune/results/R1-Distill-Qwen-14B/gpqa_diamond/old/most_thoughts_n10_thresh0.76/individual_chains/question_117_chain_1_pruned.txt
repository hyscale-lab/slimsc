Okay, so I've got this question about isomers, specifically optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they have a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. These compounds are then capable of existing as enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. If a compound doesn't have any chiral centers, it can't exhibit optical isomerism.

The compounds given are four in number, and the options are combinations of these. Let me go through each one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at the 2 and 6 positions on each ring. Wait, but the substituents are nitro groups and methyl ester groups. Let me visualize this. So each benzene ring has a nitro group at 6' and 6, and the ester groups at 2 and 2'. The structure is symmetrical because the substituents are in positions that mirror each other across the central bond. Wait, but does this create any chiral centers? Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, so even if the substituents are present, the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for rotation, but in biphenyls, the rotation isn't free, but in this case, the substituents might make the molecule symmetrical. I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Or does it? Wait, the ester groups are on the 2 positions, which are on each benzene ring. So each ring has substituents at 2, 6, and 2' positions. Wait, no, each benzene has a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2, and the other ring has similar. Hmm. Maybe the molecule has a center of symmetry. So, perhaps it's symmetrical, meaning no chiral centers. So this compound might not show optical isomerism. Or maybe I'm missing a chiral center elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the central bond allows for a meso form. Wait, if the molecule is symmetrical, it might not have optical isomers. So maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's break this down. The structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, wait. 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. So the acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When esterified, it becomes CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Now, the hydroxyl group is on the second carbon, which is adjacent to the carbonyl. So the structure is: O

CH3-C-O-CO-OCH3 ?
