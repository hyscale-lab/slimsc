Okay, so I've got this question here about organic chemistry reactions and HPLC chromatography. Hmm, let's see. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation reactions. So when alkenes react with mCPBA, they form epoxides.

The question mentions two reactions. Both are treating oct-4-ene in either E or Z configuration with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Both reactions go to 100% completion.

Wait, E and Z. So for Reaction 1, it's (E)-oct-4-ene. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene to form an epoxide, the stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For trans alkenes (E), the epoxide forms with a trans configuration. For cis alkenes (Z), the epoxide would be cis.

But wait, what's the structure of (E)-oct-4-ene? It's CH2CH2CH2CH2CH=CHCH2CH3, but with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. Wait no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me think. Octane is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me correct that. Structure should be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, that can't be right. Let's imagine the structure. It's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, no, oct-4-ene has the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. So it's CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Let me write the structure properly.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH₂-CH₂-
