Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with operators and uncertainties yet. But let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. The problem is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty ΔA for an operator A is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So, I'll need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

The system is said to be in the eigenstate of P_x corresponding to the eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Wait, but wait, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So, the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

Wait a second, because the basis of the state is in the P_z eigenstates. So, the state vector components are the coefficients in that basis. That should make things easier because to find the expectation value, I can just take the inner product of the state with the operator matrix multiplied by the state.

So, the state is |ψ> = [ a, b, c ]^T where a=-1/2, b=1/sqrt(2), c=-1/2. Let me write that down.

To find ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩. Then, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but wait—since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, the matrix P_z is diagonal. Because in its own eigenbasis, the matrix representation is diagonal. Let me check the given P_z matrix. Oh, right, the matrix for P_z is given as:

[[ ħ, 0, 0 ],
 [0, 0, 0 ],
 [0, 0, -ħ ]]

Wait, wait, that's a diagonal matrix. So, that's correct because in the eigenbasis of P_z, the matrix is diagonal with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ. So, each diagonal element corresponds to the eigenvalue for that basis vector.

Wait, but then the state
