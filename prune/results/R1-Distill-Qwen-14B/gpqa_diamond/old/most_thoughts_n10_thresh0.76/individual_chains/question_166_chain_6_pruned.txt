Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model extension and calculating the mass of a pseudo-Goldstone boson through radiative corrections. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, the Lagrangian is given. Let's see. The terms include i times conjugate N_R gamma mu partial mu N_R, which looks like a Dirac term for some fermions. Then there's (1/2)(partial mu phi)^2, which is a kinetic term for the scalar phi. The next term is |D^mu S|^2, which is the covariant derivative for the scalar S. So S must be a doublet since it's under D_mu.

Then, there are terms with y_i phi bar N_iR^c N_iR^c. Wait, N_iR is a singlet, so its conjugate would still be a singlet. The term looks like a Yukawa coupling, maybe between phi and these right-handed neutrinos. Then there's another term with g_{i alpha} bar N_iR L_alpha S. Oh, L_alpha is probably a lepton doublet, so this is a coupling between N_i (right-handed neutrinos) and the lepton doublet and the scalar S.

The potential V is given with phi, S, and H. Wait, but in the question, the vev of phi is given as ⟨phi⟩² = x² + v², and ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, h is another field? Or is h the scalar H? Because in the potential V(phi, S, H), H is another scalar field. So maybe the Higgs field is H, and phi is another singlet. Or perhaps phi is the field whose vev is x, and H is another field, but I'm not entirely sure.

The question is about the mass of the pseudo-Goldstone boson H_2 when considering radiative corrections. Pseudo-Goldstone bosons arise from spontaneous symmetry breaking when a symmetry is broken but some part remains exact (like a custodial symmetry). So, if the model has some symmetry breaking that leaves a U(1) symmetry, the Goldstone would be eaten, but if the symmetry is approximate, you get a pseudo-Goldstone like the Higgs in the Standard Model.

In the Standard Model, the Higgs field is a doublet, and after EWSB, three of the four Goldstone bosons are eaten by the W and Z bosons, leaving the Higgs as the physical Higgs. But here, the model has more scalars, so maybe there are multiple Higgs bosons.

The problem says that the vev of phi is ⟨phi⟩ = x and ⟨h⟩ = v. Wait, no, the question says ⟨phi⟩ squared is x² + v², and ⟨h⟩ is v. Hmm, perhaps phi has a vev, but h is a different field. Or maybe h is the same as phi? Wait,
