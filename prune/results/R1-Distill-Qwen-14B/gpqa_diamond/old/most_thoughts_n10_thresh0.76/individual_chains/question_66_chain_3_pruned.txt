Okay, so I've got this question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that operators must respect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Possible answers are combinations of these.

Wait, first I need to remember what SMEFT is. From what I remember, SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model (SM) by adding higher-dimensional operators. These operators are organized by their dimension, such as dimension-6, which is commonly considered.

Now, operators in the SMEFT are constructed in a way that they respect the underlying symmetries of the SM. So I should think about which symmetries are part of the SM.

Lorentz symmetry is definitely part of the SM. All the interactions in the SM are Lorentz-invariant. So any operator in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. So option 1 is correct.

Poincaré symmetry is a bit trickier. Poincaré includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. The SM respects Poincaré, so SMEFT operators should too. Wait, but I think SMEFT is built in a way that the new operators are consistent with the underlying Poincaré symmetry. So operator terms would have to be Poincaré invariant as well. So option 2 is also correct? Or wait, do the SMEFT operators have to respect Poincare? Or is it already included if they respect Lorentz? Hmm. Because Poincare includes both Lorentz and translations, but if the operators are inserted into the SM Lagrangian, which already respects Poincare, then the SMEFT operators probably do too. So 1 and 2 would both apply.

Wait, but wait. Are there any cases where an operator could break Poincare but not Lorentz? I can't think of any. So if an operator respects Lorentz, it doesn't necessarily mean it's Poincare, but the SMEFT operators must respect the SM's symmetry, which includes Poincare. Or maybe SMEFT is constructed in a way that all operators are Poincare-invariant, meaning both translations and Lorentz. So perhaps 1 and 2 are both required.

Then comes CP symmetry. I remember that the SM doesn
