Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about spin-half particles and expectation values. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question says the particle is in a linear superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2|↓⟩. Oh wait, I remember that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of the σz operator. So σz acting on them just gives the eigenvalues, right?

The operator we're looking at is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value would be the sum of the expectation values of each term. That is, ⟨10σz⟩ + ⟨5σx⟩. Since expectation is linear, I can compute each part separately.

First, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. Because σz is diagonal in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The state is a linear combination, so the expectation of σz is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, what are the eigenvalues of σz for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩? Oh right, σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So each term's coefficient squared gives the probability.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. Let me square them: (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75. So the probabilities are 25% and 75% respectively.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Then, ⟨10σz⟩ is 10 times that, which is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now for the σx part. Hmm, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is off-diagonal. The expectation value of σx is a bit trickier. The formula for ⟨σx⟩ when the state is a superposition a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩ is (a*b* + a^* b) because σx is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). Or wait, more accurately, the expectation value is 2*Re(a b^* ), because the overlap is between the coefficients.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value of σx for a state |ψ⟩ = c_↑|↑⟩ + c_↓|↓⟩ is given by 2*Re(c_↑ c_↓^* ), because σx has matrix elements ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ = 1 and vice versa.

Wait, let me think differently. The matrix for σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So let's compute that. The state is ψ = [0.5, sqrt
