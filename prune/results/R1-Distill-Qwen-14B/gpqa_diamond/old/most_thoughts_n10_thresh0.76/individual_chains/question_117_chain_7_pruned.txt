Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about organic chemistry, specifically about optical isomerism. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question asks which of the given organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism. The options are four different compounds, and I have to pick which ones do. Let's go one by one.

First, I need to remember what optical isomerism is. Optical isomerism, also known as enantiomerism, occurs when a molecule has the potential to rotate plane-polarized light. This happens when a compound has chiral centersâ€”atoms bonded to four different groups. Alternatively, it could be due to other forms of chirality, like axial chirality (like in allenes or certain bicyclic compounds) or planar chirality (like in certain biaryls). 

So, looking at each compound:

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - This one's a bit complex. Let me parse the structure. It's a biphenyl system, two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 6' on each ring with nitro groups, and at positions 2 and 2' with carboxylate ester groups (since it's a dimethyl ester, so each is OMe attached to the carbonyl).
   - Wait, biphenyls can exhibit axial chirality if there's a substituent on each ring at the 2 and 6 positions relative to the connecting bond. Oh wait, in this case, the substituents are at the 6 and 2 positions. Wait, no: in biphenyl, the main substituent is at the 1 and 1' positions (the point of connection). So if each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 on each ring, that's symmetrical perhaps?
   - Wait, the structure is 6,6'-dinitro and 2,2'-dicarboxylate. So each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So the two rings are symmetric in a way? Because each has substituents at 2 and 6. Hmm. But the biphenyl can have substituents that cause the molecule to be non-superimposable on its mirror image.
   - Alternatively, maybe it's a case of diastereomers or enantiomers. Wait, axial chirality occurs when the two substituents on each benzene ring are in such a way that they can't be mirrored. For example, in biphenyls, if each benzene has two substituents that are not symmetrical, the molecule can have a plane of symmetry or can lack one.
   - Wait, but in this case, both rings have a nitro and a carboxylate group. Let me imagine the structure. The central bond is between the two benzene rings. On each ring, position 2 has a COOCH3 group, and position 6 has a NO2 group. So the substituents are in positions 2 and 6 on each ring. Wait, but in biphenyl, positions
