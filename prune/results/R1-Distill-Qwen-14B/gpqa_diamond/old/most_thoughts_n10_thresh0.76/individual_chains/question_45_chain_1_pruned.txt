Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it.

Wait, the question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. Right, and each of these states is a different configuration of the particles in the well. Oh, right, and the particles are identical spin-1/2, so they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers, right?

The potential well is one-dimensional and infinite, so the energy levels for a single particle are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²), which is given as E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E, where E is the base energy unit defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²).

Alright, so for each particle, the energy depends on the quantum number n. Since they're spin-1/2, each can have spin up or down. So each quantum state is characterized by (n, spin), and because of the exclusion principle, each (n, spin) state can hold two particles—one for each spin direction.

Wait, but when you're putting multiple particles into the well, you have to fill up the lower energy states first, considering the spin. So for four particles, how do their quantum numbers look?

Let me think. The ground state would be the lowest energy configuration. The first excited state is the next higher energy, and the second excited state the next after that.

So, for the ground state (lowest energy), we need to fill the lowest possible n states, each with two particles (spin up and down). Let's list out the possible n values and how many particles they can hold.

n=1: can hold 2 particles (spin up and down)
n=2: can hold 2 particles
n=3: 2 particles
n=4: 2 particles, and so on.

But we only have four particles. So let's see.

In the ground state, the first two n levels will be filled. n=1 holds 2 particles, and n=2 holds the other 2. Because 2+2=4, which is all we have. So in the ground state, the particles are in n=1 and n=2, each with both spins.

Wait, but when you have four particles, how do you distribute them? Each n can take two particles (since spin allows two states). So for four particles, you can have two filled n levels.

So, the energies: each particle in n=1 has energy E(1)=1² E = E. Each in n=2 has E(2)=4E. But wait, no, wait. Each particle's energy is E multiplied by its n squared, so the total energy for the system is the sum of each particle's energy.

Wait, that's right. So in the ground state:

- Two particles in n=1: each contributes E, so total 2E.
- Two particles in n=2: each contributes 4E, so
