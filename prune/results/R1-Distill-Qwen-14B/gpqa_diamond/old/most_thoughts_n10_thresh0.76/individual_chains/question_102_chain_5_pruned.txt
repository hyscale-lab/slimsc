Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a genetic construct and why a green signal isn't showing up in the mice. Hmm. Let's start by breaking down the setup.

So, the main experiment involves a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two coding regions, right? So, the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which usually means the downstream gene can be expressed without a promoter, depending on the context.

Between ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop in a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop in a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Oh wait, the loxP and lox2272 are different lox sites. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and deletes the intervening sequence. But wait, different lox sites might cause issues because Cre might not flip them as intended.

Then, antibodies were made against the overexpressed proteins. They tested expression via Western blot and saw a signal proportional to actin. So, the construct is being expressed. But when they breed the mice, and use SOX10-Cre, the offspring don't show a green signal under the confocal.

So, the green signal is from eGFP, which is attached to the receptor. So why isn't it showing up?

Looking at the options:

Option A: ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if the construct is expressed in the same cells, maybe autocrine? Not sure how this affects expression. Maybe if they're paracrine, the ligand acts elsewhere, but I'm not sure how that would prevent eGFP expression.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. The receptor is a transmembrane protein. So, if it's stuck in the Golgi, it might not reach the cell surface. Then, you wouldn't see the fluorescent signal. But how does the construct affect this? Maybe if the eGFP is added correctly. The vector's design includes a stop cassette, which is removed by Cre. Wait, what's the setup again.

The ligand is under CBA promoter. Then, after the ligand ORF, there's a stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP). Then comes the IRES, then the receptor ORF. The receptor has a stop cassette with lox2272. Wait, the bicistronic vector is such that the first gene (ligand) is under CBA, and then the second gene (receptor) is under IRES.
