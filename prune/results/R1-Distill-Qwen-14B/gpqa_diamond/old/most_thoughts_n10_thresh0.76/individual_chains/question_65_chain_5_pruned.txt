Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B for each. Then, match them to the options provided. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible pairs for A and B.

Let's break down the first reaction. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The reagents used are THF, KH, and H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base. H+ is probably an acid workup.

Wait, but wait. I think when you have a spiro alcohol and treat it with a strong base like KH, it's likely to undergo an elimination reaction. Spiro compounds can form rings when they lose a proton, especially if there are adjacent hydroxyl groups. But wait, in this case, the spiro compound has a vinyl group attached. So maybe it's a conjugate elimination.

Alternatively, maybe it's an enolate formation. But wait, the solvent is THF, which is a good solvent for such reactions. If the alcohol is deprotonated by a strong base like LDA or KOtBu, then it could form an enolate and undergo an elimination to form a double bond. But in this case, the base is KH, which is a strong base but maybe not as bulky as LDA. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The starting material is a spiro alcohol with a double bond. When you deprotonate the alcohol, perhaps it leads to a conjugate elimination, forming a bicyclic structure. Because when the hydroxyl is removed and a proton is abstracted, the adjacent double bond could help form a ring.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on spiro compounds. A spiro[3.5]nonane would have two rings sharing only one atom. So in this case, the molecule has a spiro structure with a five-membered ring and a seven-membered ring? Or wait, no, the numbers are 3 and 5, so maybe a four-membered and a six-membered ring? Wait, the formula is spiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So non
