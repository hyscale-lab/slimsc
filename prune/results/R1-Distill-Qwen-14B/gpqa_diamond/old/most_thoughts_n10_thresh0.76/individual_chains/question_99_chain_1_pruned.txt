Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying a compound based on FTIR and 1H NMR data. Alright, let's break this down.

First, the FTIR spectrum. It shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. Since the options are carboxylic acids, it makes sense—the O-H stretch in carboxylic acids is usually very broad, around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. But wait, the peak here is at 3000, which is a bit lower than the typical O-H. But maybe it's because of hydrogen bonding or something else. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. That sounds like a carbonyl group, which is typical for a carboxylic acid (the C=O stretch). So that's consistent with the options given, which all end with COOH.

Now, the 1H NMR part. The question states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, vinyl would be like double bond hydrogens, but all the options seem to be aliphatic, so that makes sense. No alkenes or aromatic rings here.

Looking at the NMR signals: one is a doublet of triplets of quartets, another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me think about splitting in NMR. Each split indicates coupling with neighboring protons. So, the first signal is split into a doublet (two peaks), then each of those is split into a triplet (three peaks), and each of those into a quartet (four peaks). So, perhaps each step of splitting comes from different neighboring groups. Let me figure out what kind of structure would cause such splitting.

Wait, another signal is a doublet of triplets of triplets. So, it starts as a doublet, then each part splits into a triplet, and each of those into another triplet. That's a lot of splitting. So, each proton is coupling with multiple sets of neighboring protons.

Let me look at the structures given in the options. All of them are substituted carboxylic acids. The general structure is something like CH3-CH2-C(something)-C(something)-COOH. So, the middle part is a geminal di-substituted carbon, perhaps.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Wait, that's  CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2-COOH. So, the structure is symmetrical around the central two CH groups. Because each C has a CH3 and a C2H5 group attached. So the CH groups would be identical on both sides.

Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
So, structure is CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Let me count the carbons. Wait, CH3CH2 is the first two carbons, then C(H)(C2H5) is a carbon attached to H and C2H5, then another C(H)(C2H5), and then COOH. So, the structure would be like:
CH3-CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-COOH. So, the central two carbons each have a hydrogen and an ethyl group (C2H5). So, the central part is CH2-CH2? Wait no, the central part would be two carbons, each bearing H and C2H5. So, it's like:
CH3CH2-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H
