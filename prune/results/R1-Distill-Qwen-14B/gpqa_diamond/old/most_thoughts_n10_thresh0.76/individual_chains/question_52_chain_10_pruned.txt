Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, the question is about a star with certain characteristics. The star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and its mass is 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots on its surface, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The real question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find by what factor this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, so the ratio is n1/n2, right? And this ratio is decreasing when spots are present. So, when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. So, when the star is spotless, the ratio is higher.

The problem says we are to find the factor by which the ratio changes. That is, factor = (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

They also mention that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Ã…. Oh, that's in the near-ultraviolet range, I think. 1448 Angstroms is about 144.8 nm, which is UV. Titanium lines are common in stellar spectra, so I remember that.

The problem states that the stellar photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That means the populations of the energy levels can be described using the Boltzmann equation.

Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Here, n1 and n2 are the number of atoms in levels 1 and 2. Let me denote level 1 as the lower energy level and level 2 as the higher one, but wait, I need to confirm that. Because if E_1 < E_2, then the ratio n1/n2 would be higher when T is higher, because the exponent would be less negative.

Wait, but the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. So, the ratio is lower because T is lower. But why? Let's think.

The effective temperature of the star changes when spots are present. So, the star's overall temperature is lower when spots are there. So, the photospheric effective temperature affects the ionization and excitation states.

Wait, but the problem is about the photosphere when the star has spots. Wait, no, the spots are on the surface, so when the spots are present, the overall surface has 40% spots and 60% normal. But wait, the Teff in the presence of spots is given as 5500 K. So, the entire photosphere's average Teff is 5500 K when spots are present, but wait, that's not quite accurate. Because the spots are cooler regions, the overall star's luminosity would change. But the question is about the observed Teff as a blackbody. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the star's entire photosphere's temperature.

Wait, perhaps the effective temperature is a measure of the star's overall blackbody emission. So, when spots are present, the star's total luminosity is lower, and thus the effective temperature is lower.

But the problem is about the photospheric conditions when the star has spots. So, the effective temperature of the photosphere when spots cover 40% of the surface is 5500 K. But wait, does the spot coverage change the Teff of the entire photosphere? Or is the photosphere itself at 5500 K when spots are present?

Wait, the question says when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. Oh, so the effective temperature is the overall measurement, not the individual component. So, the entire photosphere's effective temperature is lower when spots are present.

So, when there are no spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% spots, Teff is 5500 K.

We need to find the ratio of (n1/n2) when the star is spotless (Teff = 6000 K) compared to when it has spots (Teff = 5500 K).

Wait, but wait. The problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when T is lower, the ratio (n1/n2) is lower. So, the ratio is inversely related to the temperature.

Using the Boltzmann equation: n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, because E2 is higher than E1, so E2 - E1 is positive. So, as T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases.

Wait, let me write the Boltzmann equation correctly. The ratio is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k T) )

Assuming E_2 is higher than E_1, so E_i - E_j would be E2 - E1 when i is level 2 and j is level 1. Wait, wait: Let me get this right. Let me set i=2 and j=1. Then, the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, but in our problem, the ratio given is n1/n2. So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because E2>E1, (E2-E1) is positive. So, when T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, making the exponential factor larger. So, n1/n2 increases as T decreases? Wait no, because the exponent is (E2-E1)/(k T), which is a positive number. So, exp( positive number ) is larger than 1. So, as T decreases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(kT) becomes larger, so the exp term is larger. So, n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So, when T decreases, (E2 -
