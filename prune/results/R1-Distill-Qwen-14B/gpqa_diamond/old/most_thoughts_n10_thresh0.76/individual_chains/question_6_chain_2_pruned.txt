Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem states that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I need to find the energy spectrum from the given options.

Hmm, alright. So first, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the potential often determines the form of the solutions. Since the particle is moving in two dimensions, but the potential is given in polar coordinates (r and θ), I think it might be easier to work in polar coordinates here. 

Wait, the potential looks like it's a combination of a radial part and an angular part. Let me rewrite the potential to see it more clearly. V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, I can factor out the kr² term: V(r,θ) = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Alternatively, I could write that as kr² [ (1/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ) ].

Now, I remember that potentials that can be expressed in such a way often lead to separable equations in quantum mechanics. Since the potential has a term dependent on r² and another on cos²θ, perhaps the problem can be separated into radial and angular parts.

Wait, maybe I can write this potential as a sum of terms that depend only on r and only on θ. Let me see. The first term is (1/2)kr², which is purely radial. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ, which is a product of a radial term (r²) and an angular term (cos²θ). 

So in polar coordinates, the Hamiltonian for a 2D system is H = (-ħ²/(2m)) (∇²) + V(r,θ). The Laplacian in 2D polar coordinates is (1/r)(d/dr)(r d/dr) + (1/r²)(d²/dθ²). 

But wait, the potential here includes r² and cos²θ. Let me think about how this affects the separation of variables. If I can write the potential as a sum of functions each dependent on only r or θ, then the Hamiltonian might be separable.

Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the potential to make it a sum of terms. Let's see: (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ = kr² [ (1/2) + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Wait, another approach: Maybe this potential is similar to the 3D isotropic oscillator but in 2D? Or perhaps it's a kind of an anisotropic oscillator, where the potential is stronger in one direction.

Alternatively, perhaps I can rewrite the potential in terms of angular variables. I remember that cos²θ can be expressed using the double-angle identity: cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (1/2
