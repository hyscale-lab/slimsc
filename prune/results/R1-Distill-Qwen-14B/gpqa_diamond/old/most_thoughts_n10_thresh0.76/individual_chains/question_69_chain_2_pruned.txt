Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. The particle X^0 decays into Y+ and Z-. The proper lifetime of X^0 is given as tau_0 = 8e-16 seconds. The question is asking about the minimum resolution needed in the chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy of the setup is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to time dilation if they're moving at relativistic speeds. So the observed lifetime tau is gamma times the proper lifetime tau_0. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

Wait, but how does this relate to the resolution needed? Oh right, the resolution of the detector is the smallest distance it can distinguish. For a particle moving for a certain time, the distance it travels is v * tau. If the particle doesn't travel far enough, the decay products might not be detected properly, so the detector needs a good enough resolution to see the decay.

The problem says we need to observe at least 30% of the decays. That probably refers to the fraction of decays that occur before the particles move too far and the tracks can be recorded. So the proper fraction is 30%, which is like 0.3 probability.

Wait, but wait. The probability that the particle decays within a certain time is given by the decay equation. The number of decays is N = N0 * (1 - e^(-t/tau)). But wait, tau here is the mean lifetime. Oh wait, mean lifetime tau is the same as the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma, right? Because tau = gamma * tau_0.

Wait, but the mean lifetime is also the average lifetime of the particle. The decay probability is 1 - e^(-t/tau), where t is the time the particle is observed. But in this case, the time is the time it's moving in the chamber. So perhaps we're considering the decay length, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.

But wait, the problem is about the fraction of decays observed. So to observe the decay, the particle must decay while it's inside the chamber or within the region that the chamber can detect.

Wait, no, the chamber's resolution is the minimum distance it can detect. So the decay length must be greater than that resolution, otherwise, the decay points can't be resolved. So perhaps the minimum resolution refers to the minimum distance that the particle needs to travel so that the decay is detected.

Wait, perhaps the formula to use is the average decay length. The average decay length L is c * gamma * tau_0 * (1 - 1/e). Because the average proper time for decay is tau_0, and L = gamma c tau_0 (1 - 1/e), since the average time for a decay is (1 - 1/e) times the mean lifetime. Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, the probability that the particle decays within a certain time t is 1 - e^(-t/tau), where tau is gamma tau_0.

But in this problem, the question is about the fraction of decays observed, which is 30%. So the fraction is 0.3. So we have that (1 - e^{-t/tau}) = 0.3. Hmm, wait no. Because if the detector can only resolve decays that happen within a certain distance, perhaps we're looking for the length where 30% of the decays have decayed within that length.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimum
