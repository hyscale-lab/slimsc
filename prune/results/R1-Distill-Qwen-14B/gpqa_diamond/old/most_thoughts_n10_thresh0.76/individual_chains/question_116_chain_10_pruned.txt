Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the first part talks about Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton is next to two others, and a quartet means each is next to three others.

Wait, but the integration is 6H and 4H. So total of 10 protons? Wait, no, because perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Let me think. The triplet at 0.9 ppm is probably from a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, maybe? Because if each of those protons is next to two others, like in a CH2CH2 situation. Oh wait, maybe it's a di-substituted CH2 group. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about common structures.

Wait, 6H as a triplet. That could be two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. Like maybe (CH2CH3)2CH2? No, wait, that would be two CH2CH3 groups attached to a central CH2. So the structure would be (CH2CH3)2CH2-. But wait, the central CH2 would have two adjacent groups. Wait, but in that case, the central CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH2CH3 groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's a neopentyl group or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppmâ€”common for methyl groups adjacent to a CH2. So perhaps the structure has two CH3 groups each attached to a CH2. So, the triplet comes from the CH2 groups next to two CH3s. For example, if it's (CH2CH3)2CH2, but wait, that would be a triplet for the CH2 groups because each is next to two CH3s. Wait, no, the CH3s would be split by the adjacent CH2. Let me think again. Suppose we have a structure where each CH2 is next to two CH3 groups. So, for each CH2, the neighboring group has two CH3's, which would split the CH2 signal into a triplet. Because each CH2 is attached to two CH3 groups, each CH2 would be a triplet. But the integration is 6H for the triplet, which would mean 3 CH2 groups? No, wait, each triplet in this context would be two H's from a CH2. So 6H would be three CH2 groups, but that doesn't fit with the quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like (CH2CH3)2CH2CH2CH3? No, that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexane derivative. Hmm. Let me think about the quartet at 1.3 ppm. Quartet means each H is next to three H's. So perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 group next to another CH2 group that has three H's. Wait, that doesn't make sense because a CH2 would have two H's. Oh wait, maybe the quartet is from a CH2 group attached to a CH2CH2? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: the triplet at 0.9 ppm (2.0 ppm might be a triplet for CH2 next to a CH3). Wait, no, 0.9 is lower field than typical for CH3 groups. Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group. Diethyl ether has CH2CH3 groups, and their CH2 would be around 1.2 ppm, but the CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm. Oh wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H would be three CH3 groups. Because 6H divided by 2 H per group would be 3 CH2? Or wait, no. Wait, each CH3 has 3 H, so 6 H would be two CH3 groups. So triplet for 6H would mean each of the 6 Hs is split into a triplet. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH3)2CH2, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's 2,2-dimethylpropane? No, that's neopentane, but its NMR would be a singlet for the central CH2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a cyclopropane derivative? Probably not, but cyclopropane rings can cause shifts. Alternatively, perhaps the compound is neopentyl something.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible structure. The triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H suggests that each H is adjacent to two others, so maybe two sets of equivalent CH2 groups. For example, if the structure is CH2CH2(C H2CH3)2, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another thought: if the compound is 2,2-dimethylpentane or something similar. Maybe the structure is (CH2CH3)CH2CH(CH2CH3)2. No, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is 2,2-dimethylbutane. Let's draw that: CH2CH(CH2CH3)2CH2. No, wait, that would give certain splitting.

Wait, perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to something. For example, diethyl ether is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The CH2 groups in diethyl ether are split into quartets because each CH2 is next to the O, which is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no, in diethyl ether, the CH2 next to O is a quartet, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is
