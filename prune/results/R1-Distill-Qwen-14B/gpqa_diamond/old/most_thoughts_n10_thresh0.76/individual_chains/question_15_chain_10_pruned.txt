Okay, so I've got this question about transit probabilities for two Earth-like planets, and I'm trying to figure out which one the researchers should observe. Let me think through this.

So, the question says both planets have been detected via the Radial Velocity (RV) method. That means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Both have the same mass, which is interesting. Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Also, their orbits are circular, which probably simplifies things.

The host stars: Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, why would that be? Oh, wait, maybe because Planet_2's host is slightly evolved. But regardless, their radii are the same. So that's a key point.

Now, the main thing here is transit probability. I remember that the probability of a planet transiting its star is higher when the planet's orbit is more edge-on relative to us. But how do other factors like the star's size and the planet's orbital distance affect that?

I think the formula for transit probability is something like P = (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet, but wait, no, that's the approximate calculation for when a transit might occur. Alternatively, the probability is the ratio of the star's disk that the planet can pass in front of. The exact formula I think is (R_p / a_p) * (something with the star's size), but maybe I'm mixing it up.

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star from our point of view) depends on the size of the star and the size of the planet relative to the orbital distance.

The formula for the probability (P) that a planet transits is approximately (R_star + R_planet) / a_planet. But wait, no, that's the condition for a transit to occur. The actual probability is the fraction of the sky where the planet's orbital plane is aligned to cause a transit. Oh right, I think the probability is given by (R_*/a_p) * something else, but maybe I should just think about the factors.

Wait, let me think again. The probability that a planet transits is proportional to (R_p + R_*) / a_p, but actually, since the planet's size is negligible compared to the star
