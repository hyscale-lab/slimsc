Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

So, the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors, right? Let me check the magnitude of this vector. The components are -1, 2, 1. So the squared magnitude is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which means it's not a unit vector. Hmm, wait, maybe I should normalize it. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector needs to be normalized. So the actual state would be 1/sqrt(6) times the vector (-1, 2, 1). Okay, that makes sense.

The problem talks about two observables, P and Q, with their respective matrix representations. The operator P has a matrix where the first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Operator Q has a diagonal matrix with elements (1, 0, -1) on the diagonal.

The question is, if someone measures Q just after measuring P, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, but wait. When you measure an observable, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the operator. So for P, the possible eigenvalues are the ones that come from solving the characteristic equation, and similarly for Q.

But for Q, the matrix is diagonal, so the eigenvalues are just 1, 0, and -1. So when you measure Q, you can get 1, 0, or -1. The question is about getting -1 for Q.

But the main thing here is the sequence of measurements. So first, they measure P, and then they measure Q. But the initial state is given, so perhaps the order of measurements affects the state after the first measurement.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Oh no, wait: someone measures Q just after measuring P. So the first measurement is P, then Q. So the order is: measure P, then measure Q. So first, we have to find the outcome of P, which is 0, then after that, measure Q and get -1.

Wait, no, the question says: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So it's the joint probability of first measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.

But in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable corresponding to the measured eigenvalue. So after measuring P=0, the state will be the projection of the original state onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on this new state gives the probability of getting -1.

But wait, let me think again. So the process is: first measure P, get outcome 0. So the state collapses into an eigenstate of P with eigenvalue
