Okay, so I'm trying to answer this physics problem about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, the question gives me phase shifts for different l values, right? And I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. 

Wait, I remember that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) has real and imaginary parts. The imaginary part is related to the phase shifts. Oh right, the formula is something like f(θ) = sum over l of ( (2l + 1) * e^{2iδ_l} * (something) )... Wait, maybe it's better to think about the partial waves.

Oh wait, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 (along the incident direction) is given by summing over all the partial waves. The formula I think is Im f(0) = 4π/(k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) sin δ_l, where k is the wave number.

But wait, the question says to ignore rest of the phase shifts, so perhaps they only gave the phase shifts up to l=4? Let me check the given phase shifts. The phases are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°. So probably l goes from 0 to 4.

Wait, but wait, the units are in degrees, so I need to convert them to radians when calculating sine, right? Because the formula uses sin δ_l, which expects δ in radians.

So first, I need to compute sin(δ_0), sin(δ_1), etc., for each l from 0 to 4.

Let me list them:

l=0: δ0=90° → π/2 radians. So sin(π/2)=1.

l=1: δ1=67° → let me compute sin(67°). Hmm, 67 degrees is approximately, sin(60)=0.866, sin(70)=0.9397, so 67 is maybe about 0.9205? Or I should calculate exact value. Wait, perhaps I can just calculate each in radians and then take sin.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use exact values. But for the purposes of this calculation, I'll proceed step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term (2l+1)*sin δ_l, then sum them, and multiply by 4π/k.

But wait, what is k? The wave number. The electrons are 50 MeV. So I need to compute the wave number k for 50 MeV electrons.

The energy E is 50 MeV. The mass of an electron is m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the kinetic energy is E = (p²)/(2m), but wait, since electrons are non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is a lot. The rest mass is 0.511 MeV, so 50 MeV is about 97.8 times the rest mass. So this is a highly relativistic electron. Hmm, maybe I should use the relativistic relation.

Wait, relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). But since
