Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. I need to find the maximum speed v_max. Oh right, and the speed of light is c.

Wait, in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So the potential energy U is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy K is (1/2)mv². At maximum speed, U is zero, so K equals the total energy, which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The options here have some involving c, so this must be a relativistic scenario.

Right, in relativity, the equations change. The kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Also, the potential energy in relativity might have a different form, but I think in this case since it's a harmonic oscillator obeying F = -kx, the potential is still (1/2)kx², but I'm not sure if that's valid in relativity.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the problem is treating the potential classically, but the kinetic energy relativistically. Or perhaps both are treated relativistically. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to use conservation of energy in the relativistic context. The total energy would be the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. At maximum displacement (x = A), the oscillator is at rest, so all energy is potential. At maximum speed (x=0), all energy is kinetic.

So let's model it that way. At x=A, potential energy U = (1/2)kA². Then, the total energy E is U plus rest energy mc², right? Or wait, in the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² and the kinetic is zero. So E_total = (1/2)kA².

Wait, but in the relativistic scenario, the
