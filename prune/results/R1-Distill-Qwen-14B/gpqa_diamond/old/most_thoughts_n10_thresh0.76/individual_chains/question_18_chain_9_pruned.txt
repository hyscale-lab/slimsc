Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, let me read the question again. Alright, so we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun. The question gives some abundance ratios using the EW method, assuming LTE.

The data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photospheric composition is given as:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
Similarly for Mg:
12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log is -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5.

We're asked to find the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, so [Si]_1 / [Si]_2.

Wait, but wait, [Si/Fe] is the abundance ratio of Si to Fe relative to the Sun. Similarly for [Mg/Si] and others.

I think I should express each element's abundance in terms of the Sun's values.

Let me think about Star_1 first.

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 means that the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that in the Sun. So [Si/Fe] = log(n_Si/n_Fe)_star / log(n_Si/n_Fe)_sun = 0.3. So n_Si/n_Fe, star = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Wait, no. The [X/Y] notation is log(n_X/n_Y)_star – log(n_X/n_Y)_sun. So [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y)_star – log(n_X/n_Y)_sun → 10^[X/Y] = (n_X/n_Y)_star / (n_X/n_Y)_sun.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → (n_Si/n_Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si/n_Fe)_sun.

Similarly, [Fe/H]_1 = 0. [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (n_Fe /n_H)_star / (n_Fe /n_H)_sun. So [Fe/H]_1 =0 → (n_Fe/n_H)_1 = (n_Fe/n_H)_sun.

So for Star_1, n_Fe/n_H = same as the Sun. So n_Fe = n_H * (10^-4.5) in the Sun.

Wait, no. Wait, the Sun's n_Fe/n_H is 10^(-4.5), since 12 + log(nFe/nH)=7.5 → log(nFe/nH)=7.5-12= -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^-4.5.

So Star_1 has [Fe/H]_1 =0 → n_Fe,1 /n_H,1 = Sun's n_Fe/n_H → n_Fe,1 = n_H,1 * 10^-4.5.

So for Star_1, n_Si,1 /n_Fe,1 = 10^0.3 * (n_Si,sun /n_Fe,sun).

But wait, (n_Si,sun /n_Fe,sun) = [Si/Fe]_sun. Wait, but the star's [Si
