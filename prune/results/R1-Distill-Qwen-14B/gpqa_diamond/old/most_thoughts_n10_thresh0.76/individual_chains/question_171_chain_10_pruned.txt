Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is asking me to arrange six substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer formed when they undergo bromination with excess Br2. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, I remember that in electrophilic aromatic substitution, the directing effects of substituents on the benzene ring play a crucial role. Activating groups (like -NH2, -OH, -OCH3, etc.) are ortho/para directors, while deactivating groups are meta directors. But wait, wait—no, some deactivating groups are meta directors, others are para or ortho. Hmm.

Wait, the substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and each has its own directing effect. Activating groups are electron-donating, making the ring more reactive. Deactivating are electron-withdrawing, making it less reactive. Ortho/para directors can be either activating or deactivating, but the positions depend on the group's nature.

Let me list each compound and their substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3 → Toluene (methyl group)
2) C6H5-COOC2H5 → Phenyl ester (probably ethyl benzoate)
3) C6H5-Cl → Chlorobenzene
4) C6H5-NO2 → Nitrobenzene
5) C6H5-C2H5 → Ethylbenzene
6) C6H5-COOH → Benzoic acid

Now, each substituent's effect:

1) Methyl (-CH3) is an activating group (because it's an alkyl chain, donates electrons via induction and hyperconjugation). So it's an o/p director. So when bromine is added, the bromine will add more at ortho and para positions relative to the methyl group.

2) COOEt (ester group) is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Because esters are electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl group. So, meta substitution is favored.

3) Cl is a deactivating group but o/p director. Wait, is that correct? Chlorine is a deactivating because it's more electronegative, but being an electronegative atom with lone pairs, it can donate electrons through resonance, but in reality, the inductive effect (withdrawing) dominates. So Cl is a deactivating, o/p director, but I think it's a weakly deactivating and ortho/para-directing. Wait, no, wait: Cl is deactivating (because it's EWG), but it's ortho/para directing because of resonance. So, for chlorobenzene, the substitution occurs in ortho and para positions more than meta.

Wait, wait, I might have confused. Let me think again. Groups that are strong deactivating are meta directors. Weak deactivating can be o/p directors. So, for example, nitro groups are strongly deactivating and meta-directing. Chlorine is a deactivating group but an o/p director. So in chlorobenzene, substitution occurs mainly at ortho and para positions.

4) NO2 is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. So nitrobenzene would undergo substitution mainly at the meta position relative to the nitro group.

5) C2H5 (ethyl group) is similar to methyl. It's an activating, o/p director. So ethylbenzene will have substitution at ortho and para.

6) COOH (carboxylic acid group). That's a strong deactivating group. Wait, carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group, and it's meta-directing. Because, like esters, the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, so the group is deactivating and meta-directing.

So, for each compound, the substituent directs the incoming Br+ to certain positions, but the bromination reaction is influenced by the substituent's directing ability and the activation of the ring.

But wait, the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction. So the main thing is, how much para product is formed as compared to other positions.

Wait, but in some cases, the substituent may not allow para substitution. For example, a substituent in one position may have another substituent in the ortho or para position, making the ring more or less reactive in certain positions.

Wait, no, the substituent is on the benzene ring, and when you add Br, it adds to the ring in positions relative to the substituent.

So, let's think about each compound:

1) Toluene (methyl): activating, o/p. So bromine can add at ortho, para, and maybe meta but less likely. Because activating groups make the ring more reactive
