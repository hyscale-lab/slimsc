Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, I've got a spin-half particle in a specific superposition state. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, right, expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩ where O is the operator. 

Wait, σz and σx are the Pauli matrices, right? Oh right, σz is diagonal with eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, respectively. And σx is the Pauli X matrix, which swaps the spin states. 

So the operator is 10σz +5σx. To find the expectation value, I can separate this into two parts: the expectation of 10σz and the expectation of 5σx. Because expectation is linear, so ⟨A+B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩. 

First, let's handle the 10σz part. Since σz is diagonal in the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, and the given state is a linear combination of these, the expectation of σz should be straightforward. 

The state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. So, the coefficients are a = 0.5 for |↑⟩ and b = sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. 

The expectation value of σz is a²*(+1) + b²*(-1), because |↑⟩ has eigenvalue +1 and |↓⟩ has -1. Let's compute that. a² is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. b^2 is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So, 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. So the expectation of σz is -0.5. Multiply by 10, that's 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the 5σx part. The expectation of σx is a bit trickier because σx is not diagonal. The matrix representation of σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, the expectation value ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ can be found by expanding the inner product. 

Alternatively, another formula for expectation of σx is 2*(|a|^2 - |b|^2) Re(b/a) ??? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Oh wait, another approach: for a state α|↑⟩ + β|↓⟩, the expectation of σx is (α β* + α* β). Because σx = |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|, so when you compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, it's (α* ⟨↑| + β* ⟨↓|) (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) (α |↑⟩ + β |↓⟩). 

Breaking that down, it's α* α ⟨↑|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + α* β ⟨↑|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩ + β* α ⟨↓|↑⟩⟨↓|↑⟩ + β* β ⟨↓|↓⟩⟨↑|↓⟩. But ⟨↑|↓⟩ is zero, so only the cross terms survive. So it's α* β ⟨↑|↓⟩ + β* α ⟨↓|↑⟩. Wait, wait, no, let's compute this more carefully.

Wait, let me write it out: 

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (α* ⟨↑| + β* ⟨↓|) (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|) (α |↑⟩ + β |↓⟩)

Expanding this:

α* α ⟨↑|↑⟩
