Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about optical isomerism in different organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with stereoisomerism where molecules are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they must have chiral centers or some kind of stereogenic element.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which of them show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**
   - Biphenyl structures often have the possibility of being chiral if the substituents are in a way that creates a plane of symmetry or not. Wait, in this case, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. So 2,2' and 6,6'... Let me visualize the structure. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The positions 2 and 2' are each substituted with a carboxylate group, and 6 and 6' with nitro groups. The substituents on each ring are symmetrical, but does that prevent the molecule from being chiral?

   Oh wait, the biphenyl itself can have a twist, but whether it's chiral depends on if there's a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are such that the molecule is symmetrical, like in para positions, then maybe it's not chiral. But here, each ring has two substituents, but their arrangement—like, the positions 2 and 2' on each ring—might lead to asymmetry. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a center or plane that makes it achiral.

   Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that there's no plane of symmetry, the molecule could be chiral. Wait, the substituents on each ring are at 2 and 6. Wait, benzene rings are symmetric, so if the substituents are in positions that mirror each other, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, if the substituent positions make the entire molecule lack a plane of symmetry, then it could be chiral.

   I'm a bit confused about this one. Maybe I'll come back to it.

2. **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**
   - Let's see.
