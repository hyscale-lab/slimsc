Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work it out.

The question says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh wait, and the temperature is 25°C, which I guess is room temperature. The K for the Ca-EDTA complex is 5x10^10. The options are A to D, so I need to pick the right concentration of calcium ions.

Wait, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent. It forms complexes with metal ions like calcium. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and I think the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- or something similar. Or maybe it's Ca²+ + EDTA^4- → CaEDTA²−. Oh, right, the formation constant (Kf) is given as 5x10^10. But wait, the problem states K_ca-EDTA is 5e10. So that should be the formation constant for the complex.

The concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. So the solution is made by dissolving this complex, which dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But wait, if it's a 1:1 complex, then each mole of CaEDTA gives one mole of Ca²+ and one
