Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars compared to each other. Let me break down the information given.

First, the two stars are Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass respectively, but I don't know if that's directly relevant here. The problem is about elemental abundances, so maybe their masses affect other factors, but perhaps not directly the abundance ratios.

The data given are in terms of dex, which stands for decimal exponent. So, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3 dex. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the notation [X/Y] represents the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y relative to the Sun. So [Si/Fe]_1 is log(Si/Fe)_star1 - log(Si/Fe)_sun. But wait, the Sun's values are given, so maybe I can use those to find the actual abundances.

Wait, the Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Hmm, so let me parse that. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12? Wait no, wait. The way it's written is 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that means log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Because 12 plus that log equals 7.5. So log(nFe/nH) is -4.5.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The notation 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So that would mean log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH is 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg.

So for the Sun:
log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =
