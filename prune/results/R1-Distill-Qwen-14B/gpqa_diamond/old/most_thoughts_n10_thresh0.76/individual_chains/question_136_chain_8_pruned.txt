Okay, so I've got this problem here about vector calculus, specifically involving divergence and a vector field. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude of the field is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Hmm, wait, so the field is radial, which means it points directly away from or towards the origin. And its magnitude is 1 over r squared. So, in spherical coordinates, the vector field would be f(r) = (1/r²) er, where er is the unit vector in the radial direction.

Divergence... right, divergence measures the magnitude of a vector field's source or sink at a given point. For a vector field that's purely radial, I think the divergence formula in spherical coordinates might be simpler. Oh right, the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component is (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f_r). So in this case, f_r is 1/r².

Let me write that down. The divergence ∇·f would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). Let me compute that. The term inside the derivative is r² * (1/r²) which simplifies to 1. So d/dr of 1 is zero. Wait, that can't be right because that would imply the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin.

Wait, but wait a second. If the field is f(r) = (1/r²) er, then f_r is 1/r², right? Plugging into the divergence formula:

∇·f = (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) 

= (1/r²) * d/dr (1)

= (1/r²) * 0 

= 0

So the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at r=0. But wait, the divergence of such a field is only non-zero at the origin? Or perhaps not? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the divergence formula for a purely radial vector field is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). So f_r is 1/r², so:

d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = d/dr (1) = 0. So yes, the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the field might have a singularity.

So if I integrate the divergence over the volume of the sphere, the integral would be the volume integral of zero, which is zero. But wait, that's only if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the volume. But wait, what about point r=0? Because the field might have a delta function there. Like, think of electric fields: the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, and for a point charge, rho is a delta function. So maybe here, the divergence is zero except at the origin, where it might have a delta function contribution.

Wait, but the question says f(r) falls off as 1/r². So for points away from the origin, the divergence is zero. So the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But
