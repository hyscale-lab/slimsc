Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, let's see what the question says.

So, the problem states that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. I need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. So the key here is probably relative velocity and time dilation, considering special relativity effects. Because if the frames are moving relative to each other, time might not pass the same way in both.

Right, let's think about this step by step. First, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at the same speedâ€”because the relative motion is symmetric. Wait, no, actually, velocities are symmetric only in classical mechanics. But in relativity, velocities don't add like that.

Wait, no, wait. If the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s according to the ejecta's frame, then what is the ejecta's speed according to the Galaxy's frame? Well, according to the problem, the ejecta is moving directly towards the center, so perhaps the speed is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction in the other frame. But no, because of the way velocities transform in relativity, but maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the relative velocity is 60,000 km/s between the two frames. So the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s in the Galaxy frame. Or wait, no. Let me think.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s. So the ejecta's speed is v = 60,000 km/s. So when the problem says, "from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s," that suggests that the relative velocity between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. But wait, in reality, in relativity, velocities don
