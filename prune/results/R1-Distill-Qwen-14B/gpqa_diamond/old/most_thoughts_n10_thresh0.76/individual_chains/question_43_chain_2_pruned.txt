Okay, so I've got this IUPAC naming problem here about a benzene ring with several substituents. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

First, the question says the benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is the formyl group), and a cyano group, all meta to one another. So meta means they're separated by two carbon atoms, right? So like positions 1, 3, and 5 if we start numbering from somewhere.

Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid is one of the substituents, and the numbering is based on the substituents. The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid because it has the highest priority. Oh right, in the order of functional groups, carboxylic acid is higher than aldehyde and nitrile, I think. So the numbering starts from the carboxylic acid.

So the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then, the other substituents are meta to each other. So the meta positions would be 3 and 5. But let me see: if the carboxylic acid is at 1, the meta positions would be 3 and 5, but wait, all three substituents (carboxylic acid, aldehyde, and cyano) are meta to one another. Hmm, that might not be possible because they can't all be meta. Wait, maybe only the aldehyde and cyano are meta to the carboxylic acid. Because a benzene ring can't have three substituents all mutually meta; each pair would have to be meta, but that's not possible on a benzene ring, which only has six positions. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says all three substituents are meta to one another. Wait, perhaps that's a typo, but let's proceed.

Wait, no, the question says: a benzene ring has a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, and a cyano group all meta to one another. So each pair is meta. So let's think about that. Let's imagine the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Then the aldehyde would be at position 3 (two positions away), and the cyano at position 5, which is two positions away from position 3. Wait, but position 5 is two away from position 3? Wait, positions 1, 3, and 5 form a meta arrangement, but let me check: position 1 to 3 is two positions apart (so meta), 3 to 5 is two positions apart (meta), and 5 back to 1 is also two positions apart (since 5 is next to 6 and 1 is next to 6, wait no: 5 is next to 6 and 1 is next to 6, so the distance between 5 and 1 is one position (they're adjacent), but that's ortho. Wait, no, wait, in numbering, the positions are in a circle. So the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Wait, the positions go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and then back to 1. So the distance between 1 and 3 is two carbons apart (so meta), 3 and 5 is also two apart, and 5 and 1 is two apart (since 5 to 6 is one, 6 to 1 is another, so 5 to 1 is two positions). So that works. So all three substituents are at 1, 3, and 5 positions. Wait, but the substituent positions are 1 (carboxylic acid), 3 (aldehyde), and 5 (cyano). Wait, but the question says the carboxylic acid is at position 1, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

Wait, no. The principal functional group is the carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts at the carboxylic acid as position 1. Then the other
