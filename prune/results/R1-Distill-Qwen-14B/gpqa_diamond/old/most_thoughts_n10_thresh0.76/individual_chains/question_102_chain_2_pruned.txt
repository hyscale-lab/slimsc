Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a genetic experiment involving a ligand-receptor pair in neural crest cells. They've used a bicistronic lox-Cre vector, which I think means it has two coding regions in one vector, right? The setup involves some specific promoters and stop cassettes, and then they're looking for fluorescent signals in mice.

So the main issue is that when they breed their mouse model homozygous for the construct and cross it with SOX10-Cre mice, they don't see a green signal under the fluorescent confocal. The green signal is from eGFP, which is fused to the receptor. So why isn't the eGFP showing up?

Let me break down the setup. The vector is bicistronic, meaning it has two ORFs. The ligand is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I believe is a strong promoter used for expression. The receptor is after an IRES element, which I remember allows internal ribosome entry, so the receptor might be expressed as a separate transcript, or perhaps in a different way.

Looking at the stop cassettes: between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP, a lox2272-stop-lox2272. LoxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants used in recombination. So, when Cre is present, it can excise specific regions.

Wait, the vector is a lox-Cre vector. So, in the presence of Cre, the stop cassettes would be removed. So, the ligand would be expressed along with mCherry, and the receptor along with eGFP, but only if the appropriate Cre is present.

But in the experiment, they used SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, which aligns with the initial expression of the ligand and receptor in neural crest cells. So the Cre should be active in those cells, right? So the Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

Wait, but in the vector, for the ligand, the stop is between ligand and mCherry, and the receptor's stop is between receptor and eGFP. So, when Cre is present, which lox sites would it recognize?

The loxP sites are for Cre, I think. Lox2272 is a variant that can't recombine with loxP, but can with another lox2272. So in the ligand's stop cassette, it's loxP-stop-loxP. For the receptor, it's lox2272-stop-lox2272.

So when Cre is present, it would cut the loxP sites and remove the stop cassette in the ligand's region. That would allow the ligand ORF to be expressed, and then the mCherry would be expressed as well? Wait, but the ligand is fused to mCherry. Oh wait, no, the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, and mCherry is somewhere else. Wait, no, the way it's described is that the ligand ORF is at the 5' and fused to mCherry. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the setup says the ligand ORF is at 5', fused to mCherry. So perhaps the ligand is at the beginning, followed by a stop, then mCherry. But the stop is in a loxP cassette. So, when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand to be expressed and mCherry to be expressed as a separate thing? Or perhaps, the ligand is a fusion protein with mCherry. Hmm, not sure, but perhaps that's not the main issue here.

Similarly, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus, with a lox2272 stop cassette. So, when Cre is present, the stop cassette is removed, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed. But wait, the Cre used is SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest-derived cells, like the astrocytes perhaps?

Wait, but in the experiment, they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. They did a Western blot, but when they breed the mice and use SOX10-Cre, the eGFP isn't showing up.

Wait, the question is
