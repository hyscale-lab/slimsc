Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and their flux in two different energy bands. Hmm, I need to figure out the ratio of flux between two energy ranges: 700-800 keV (Band 1) and 800-900 keV (Band 2). The question is a bit tricky because it involves the pp-III branch suddenly stopping in the Sun's core about 8.5 minutes ago. 

Wait, first, let me recall what the pp-III branch is. I remember that the proton-proton chain is the primary source of energy in the Sun. The pp-I branch produces deuterium by fusing two protons. Then, pp-II might involve more steps, but I'm not too sure. Oh, right, the pp-III branch produces helium-4 through a different pathway, involving boron-8. So the pp-III reactions are an important part of the Sun's fusion processes.

The question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped. So, about 8.5 minutes ago. Why 8.5 minutes? Oh, that's the approximate time it takes for photons to travel from the Sun's core to the Earth. So, if the pp-III stopped, the neutrinos produced from that process would still reach Earth because neutrinos move much faster and can escape the Sun quickly. But wait, neutrinos are produced in various parts of the Sun, not just the core. But if the pp-III in the core stops, then the neutrinos from that source would stop arriving.

Wait, but what kind of neutrinos are we talking about here? Solar neutrinos, right? They are mainly from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. But the main neutrinos come from the proton-proton chain, and specifically from the pp-I and pp-III branches. Oh right, and in the pp-III branch, boron-8 is produced, which then undergoes further reactions. The neutrinos from pp-III are higher energy compared to those from pp-I. 

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those higher-energy neutrinos would stop. The neutrinos we're considering here are from the pp reactions, right? So, the flux of neutrinos from the pp-III would drop off, but what about the pp-I and CNO cycle?
