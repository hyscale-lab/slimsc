Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a pion into a muon and a neutrino. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is: Find the kinetic energy of the product particles when a Pi(+) is at rest and decays into a mu(+) and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. Oh, and the neutrino... wait, neutrinos are tricky because their mass is usually negligible compared to other particles. So I think I can treat the neutrino as massless here.

So the reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. That means the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So p_mu = p_nu, but in opposite directions. But wait, the neutrino has negligible mass, so its momentum p is related to its energy E by E ≈ p c, since for massless particles E = pc. While for the muon, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ). 

But I'm trying to find the kinetic energy of the products. So I need to find the energies of the muon and neutrino, and then subtract their rest masses to get KE.

Let me think about the conservation of energy and momentum. The initial energy is just the rest energy of the pion, since it's stationary. So Energy_initial = m_pi c².

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino: Energy_final = E_mu + E_nu.

So m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

And for momentum: since the pion is at rest, the vectors for p_mu and p_nu must cancel each other. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p. Let me denote this magnitude as p.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c²? Wait, no, units might be a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of MeV. Typically, in these problems, c=1 is assumed, so energies and masses are in MeV, and momenta in MeV/c. So E = sqrt( p² c² + m² c^4 ) / c²? Wait, maybe not. Let me get the units right. Since E is in MeV, m is in MeV/c², and p is in MeV/c. So E = sqrt( (p (MeV/c))^2 c² + (m (MeV/c²) c² )² ) ) → E = sqrt( p² c² + m² c^4 ) → since c² is factored, but when using MeV, and if we set c=1 for simplicity, then E = sqrt( p² + m² ), right?

Wait, maybe it's easier to just work in units where c=1. So, m_pi is 139.6 MeV/c², m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c². So when c=1, E = sqrt(p² + m²).

So the neutrino's energy is E_nu = p, since for massless particles, E = p. And the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( p² + m_mu² ).

So the energy equation becomes:

m_pi = E_mu + E_nu → 139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) + p.

Hmm, that's the equation I need to solve for p. Let me write that:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - p.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2 *139.6 p + p².

So,

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 p + p².

I can subtract p² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 p.

Now, calculate the squares. Let's compute 105.7^2 and 139.6^2.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let me estimate that. 100^2 =10,000, 5.7^2=32.49, and cross terms 2*100*5.7=1140. So approximately (100+5.7)^2 =10000 + 1140 + 32.49=11172.49. But exact value would be better. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 105.7^2: 100^2=10000, 5.7^2=32.49, 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000 + 1140 +32.49 = 11172.49.

Similarly, 139.6^2: Let's
