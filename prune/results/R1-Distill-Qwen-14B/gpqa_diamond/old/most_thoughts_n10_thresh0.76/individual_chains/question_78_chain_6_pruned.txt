Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the scalar and vector potentials due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I remember that potentials are related to the electromagnetic fields, but I need to think carefully about the formulas here.

Wait, the question mentions the scalar potential V and vector potential A at time t, given that the charge is moving along a trajectory s(t). The field point is r, and d is the vector from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. Oh right, so d would be r - s(tr), because s(tr) is where the charge was at time tr, and r is where we're observing now.

The velocity at the generating time tr is v. So I need expressions for V and A at time t, which is greater than tr. That means the charge has moved since then, but the potentials depend on its position and velocity at tr.

I remember that the scalar potential for a static charge is V = q/(4πε0 r), where r is the distance from the charge. But when the charge is moving, things get a bit more complicated because of the motion—maybe because of the retarded time or something related to special relativity effects.

Wait, but the options don't seem to involve time delays in an obvious way. Maybe it's using the Lienard's potentials or the retarded potentials approach. Let me think. The scalar potential due to a moving charge can be written as something like V = [q/(4πε0)] * [γ (1 - (v·r̂)/c²)] / |r - (v/c²)(r·v) t'|, but this might get complicated. Hmm, but perhaps for small velocities or in a non-relativistic case, the expressions simplify?

Alternatively, I remember that when charges are moving, the potentials can involve terms from both the charge and the motion. The vector potential A is usually related to the current, which comes from the charge's velocity.

Wait, another approach: the potentials can be expressed in terms of the charge's position and velocity at the retarded time. The retarded time tr satisfies r = s(tr) + v (t - tr), multiplied by something maybe. But I'm not sure if that's the right way to approach it here.

Looking at the options, let's analyze them one by one. Option A says V is q/(4πε0 r), which is the static case. And A is (v squared over c squared) times V. Hmm, but vector potential is a vector, so the expression for A would have to involve v, not v squared. So maybe A isn't correct.

Option B: V is again the static expression. A is (v/c²) times V. That seems plausible because A is typically proportional to (v × something) over c². But wait, the vector potential A is usually (μ0 q v)/(4π c²) times some factor, perhaps. Let me think about the standard form.

In the case of a moving point charge, the vector potential A is given by A = (μ0 q v)/(4π c²) * [ (r - (v t)/c² ) / |r - (v t)/c² |^3 ] evaluated at the retarded time. But wait, perhaps in the non-relativistic limit, or if r is much larger, maybe it simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that the vector potential A is (μ0 q v)/(4π (something)) times some term. Let me think about the general expression. The scalar potential is V = q/(4πε0) [1/(r')] where r' is the distance at the retarded time. The vector potential is A = (μ0 q v)/(4π c²) [ (r' - (v t_r)/c ) / (r')^3 ] evaluated at the retarded time. Maybe not exactly, but something like that.

Wait, perhaps in the context of this problem, since the observation point is r, and the charge was at s(tr) at time tr, the vector d is r - s(tr), which is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. So d = r - s(tr). Then, the velocity v is at time tr, so the motion affects the potentials through terms involving d and v.

Let me think about the expressions. The scalar potential V is due to the charge q, which is at s(tr). So V would be q/(4πε0 d), but wait, d is the vector, but in the denominator it would be |d|. So V should be q/(4πε0 |d|). But looking at the options, option C and D have denominators with (d c - d·v) and (d c + d·v), respectively.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, perhaps we can Taylor expand or make some approximations. Alternatively, in the case of a moving charge, the scalar potential can involve a term with (1 - v·d/(c² d)), because of the time delay. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential is given by (q/(4πε0)) ∫ (1/r) δ^4(x - x'(t')) dt', where x' is the charge's position and t' is the time. But for a point charge, this simplifies. Alternatively, perhaps considering the retarded time approach, the potential V is (q/(4πε0)) (1/|r - s(tr)|) * [1/(1 - (v·(r - s(tr)))/(c^2 |r - s(tr)|)) ].

But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, in the case where the charge is moving with velocity v, and we're considering potentials at time t, the expressions involve terms like 1/(d - (v/c²) (t - tr)), but I'm not exactly sure.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C has V = qc/(4πε0 (d c - d·v)). So the denominator is (d c - d·v), which can be written as c (d) - (d · v). Similarly, option D has (d c + d·v) in the denominator.

Wait, let me see. If d is r - s(tr), then d·v is (r - s(tr))·v. Hmm, perhaps in the denominator, it's (d c² - d·v c) or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps this is part of the Lorentz contraction or time dilation factor.

Wait, another point: The potentials for a moving charge are often expressed using the retarded time. The scalar potential is V = [ q/(4πε0
