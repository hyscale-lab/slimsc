Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. They're using a plasmid to overexpress this protein by introducing the coding sequence with an additional influenza hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. After transfecting Chinese hamster ovary cells with Lipofectamine, they can't get the protein overexpressed. So, they checked the construct and found that the plus strand sequence starts with 5' ATG... and ends with ...TGA 3'.

The options given are A to D, each suggesting a different reason why the protein isn't being expressed.

Hmm. So, the main issue here is that the construct isn't expressing the protein as expected. Let's think about possible problems in the construct's sequence.

First, I'll look at the ends of the given DNA sequence. The start is ATG, which is the methionine start codon, so that's good. The end is TGA. Wait, TGA is a stop codon. Oh, wait, no, the plus strand ends with TGA, but in DNA, the coding strand is the same as mRNA (except T for U). So the mRNA would have UGA. Oh right, UGA is a stop codon. So the construct's coding sequence ends with UGA.

Wait, but wait a second. The GADD45G coding sequence is supposed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the HA tag is added before the GADD45G sequence. Let me imagine how the construct would be. The HA tag's coding sequence would be added before the GADD45G's ATG.

But looking at the given DNA sequence, the very first codon is ATG, which is the start. So perhaps the HA tag was inserted but messed up, or maybe the start codon is correct.

Wait, the construct's sequence starts with ATG, which is correct, but does the HA tag come before that? Or is it part of the same reading frame?

Wait,
