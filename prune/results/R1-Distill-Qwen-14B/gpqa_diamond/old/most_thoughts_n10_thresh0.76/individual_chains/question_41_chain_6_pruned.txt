Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What's the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer?

Right, I remember that in different media, the speed of light changes. The formula for the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed in a vacuum. But wait, wait, that's when the medium is stationary relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving. So how does that affect things?

Oh, right, this must involve the Doppler effect or maybe some sort of relativistic addition. Wait, no, Doppler effect is about frequency and wavelength changes when the source or medium is moving. But speed here—maybe it's about how the medium's motion affects the observed speed of the light.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer at speed v. So, the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving. The light is going in the same direction as the glass's motion and toward the observer. So the light is moving, and the medium (glass) is moving in the same direction.

I think I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula here. Because when velocities are involved, especially if they're comparable to the speed of light, we can't just add them normally. However, wait—is the speed of light in the medium close to c? Because n is probably a number like 1.5 for glass, so the speed is like 0.66c. So v is presumably much less than c, but maybe the question expects a non-relativistic approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the speed of the light in the medium. In the rest frame of the glass, the light's speed is c/n. But since the glass is moving, we have to find the speed from the lab frame.

So in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. Let's denote the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's frame) as u = c/n.

But wait, no, u would be the speed of light in the glass's frame. So when the glass is moving at velocity v, the lab frame sees the light's velocity as what?

Wait, no, in the glass's frame, the light is moving at u = c/n in the same direction as the glass's motion. So from the lab frame, the speed would be u + v? But that can't be right because in classical mechanics (non-relativistic), velocities add like that. But light's speed can't exceed c. Hmm, but in this case, u is c/n, which is less than c, so adding v could bring the total over c. But according to relativity, that's impossible.

Wait, but maybe I should use the relativistic velocity addition formula instead. The formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c²)

But wait, wait. In this case, u is the speed of light in the glass's frame. So u = c/n.

Wait, but in the glass's frame, the light is
