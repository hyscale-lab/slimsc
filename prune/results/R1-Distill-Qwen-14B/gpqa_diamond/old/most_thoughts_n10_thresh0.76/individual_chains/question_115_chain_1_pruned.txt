Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when matter and antimatter particles annihilate, they produce photons. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The setup is an electron moving from the left (so, along the horizontal axis) with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are upper-right and lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between these two photons.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and length dilate for the moving object. It's gamma = total energy / rest mass energy. For an electron and a positron, their rest mass is the same, right? Since they're each other's antiparticles. The rest mass energy for an electron is about 0.511 MeV, but I'm not sure if exact numbers are needed here.

The key here is probably conservation of momentum and energy. Because in any collision, total momentum and energy must be conserved. Since the particles are annihilating into photons, which are massless, the total momentum of the photons after the collision must equal the total momentum of the electron and positron before the collision.

So let's think about momentum. The electron is moving to the right (from left), and the positron is moving to the left (from right). So their momenta are in opposite directions. Wait, but wait, the positron is moving from the right, so if the electron is moving left to right, the positron is moving right to left, so their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left. So its velocity is to the right. The positron is moving along the same axis from the right, so its velocity is to the left. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

I should calculate the total momentum of the system before annihilation. Each particle's momentum would be gamma * m_e * v, but since I'm working in natural units where c=1, maybe I can think in terms of gamma and rest mass. Alternatively, since the Lorentz factor is given, I can compute the relativistic momentum.

Wait, the relativistic momentum p is gamma m v. But in terms of gamma, since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and for electrons, m is m_e. Alternatively, another way to express momentum is p = gamma m_e c^2 / c. Wait, not sure. Let's think in terms of units.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the momentum of each particle. Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p.

The electron has a Lorentz factor gamma_e =4. So its momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But since v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e²), maybe I can express momentum in terms of gamma.

Alternatively, the momentum p of a particle is gamma m v, and since gamma = E/(m c²), but perhaps that's complicating.

Wait, another approach: The total relativistic energy is gamma m c². The momentum
