Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this science question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand. Hmm, it's about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells and their developmental fate. The setup involves some genetic constructs and experiments, and the question is why there's no green signal observed under the microscope.

Alright, breaking down the problem. So, the person created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? The ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which I think is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. The receptor has an IRES upstream, which I remember is an internal ribosome entry siteâ€”so that allows for the translation of the second gene without the need for a second ribosome binding site. So, the CBA promoter should drive the transcription of both ligand and receptor, but the IRES should help in the expression of the receptor.

Wait, but wait. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, then the receptor is after that, separated by an IRES. So the structure is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop with loxP cassette -> IRES -> receptor ORF -> eGFP with another stop in a lox2272 cassette. So, when this construct is expressed, the mRNA would have both ligand and receptor coding regions. The IRES would allow the ribosome to translate the receptor without the need for a second initiation, so that's a way to have two proteins expressed from one mRNA.

But then, the antibodies were made against the overexpressed proteins. They tested expression via Western blot. Wait, but the problem says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. So, in vitro. The blot showed signals proportional to actin, which suggests they loaded equal amounts, so the blot is working. So, the proteins were expressed, but when they made a mouse model, homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, and crossed it to SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring didn't show a green signal.

Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. SOX10-Cre would express Cre under the control of SOX10 regulatory elements. So, in neural crest-derived cells, Cre would be active, leading to recombination. The loxP and lox2272 sites are recognition sites for Cre. Now, the vector has two stop cassettes: the ligand has a loxP-stop-loxP between it and mCherry, and the receptor has a lox2272-stop-lox2272 between it and eGFP.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different recognition sites for Cre. Oh right, because loxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is a
