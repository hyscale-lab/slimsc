Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron and a positron colliding and producing two photons. I remember that in such scenarios, conservation laws must apply—like conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, the problem says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis (I'll assume that's the x-axis) from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. The positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate into two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving in the upper-right direction and the other in the lower-right. We need to find the angle between their directions.

Hmm, so Lorentz factor is gamma, which is the factor by which time and length dilate for the moving object. The Lorentz factor is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

But wait, I don't think I need the exact velocities; maybe I can work with the relativistic momentum and energy.

First, let's think about the rest masses. Both the electron and positron have the same rest mass, which is about 0.511 MeV/c². But since they're moving, their relativistic energies will be higher.

Electron's Lorentz factor (gamma_e) is 4. So its energy E_e is gamma_e * m_e c². Similarly, the positron's gamma is 2, so E_p = gamma_p * m_p c². Since m_e = m_p, E_e =4 m_e c², E_p=2 m_e c².

Wait, but when they collide and annihilate, the total energy must be conserved. So the total energy before collision is E_e + E_p = 6 m_e c².

After annihilation, two photons are produced with the same energy each. So each photon has energy 3 m_e c². Because 2 * E_photon = 6 m_e c² → E_photon=3 m_e c².

But wait, photons are massless, so their energy is related to their frequency or wavelength, but also to their momentum. For a photon, E = |p| c, since E² = (pc)² c² (because m=0). So the momentum of each photon is E_photon / c = 3 m_e c² / c = 3 m_e c.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The photon's energy E is equal to the magnitude of its momentum times c: E = p_photon * c. So p_photon = E / (c). So each photon's momentum is (3 m_e c²) / (c) = 3 m_e c.

But wait, the problem says that the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So their directions are symmetric about the x-axis, perhaps? Because the problem states one is upper-right and another lower-right. So their angles with the x-axis might be symmetric in some way.

Wait, but let's think about the momentum vectors. The electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right). So their momenta are in opposite directions along the x-axis. So before collision, the total momentum is (p_e - p_p), since the positron is moving in the opposite direction. Wait, wait, because the electron is moving left to right (positive x), and positron is moving right to left (negative x). So their momenta would be opposite in direction.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the positron is moving from the right, so if the electron is moving from left to right, the positron is moving from right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions. So their momenta are in opposite directions. So their momentum vectors are p_e (to the right) and -p_p (to the left). Or wait, the positron's momentum would be p_p in the left direction, so as a vector, it's negative.

Wait, so the total momentum before collision is p_e (right) minus p_p (left), but
