Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid and has four bridged rings. The molecule is symmetric, so the positions of the bromines are on opposite ends.

The first step is heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C. I think that when vicinal dihalides (two halogens on adjacent carbons) react with strong bases like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, probably dehydrohalogenation. Wait, but wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane has the bromines not adjacent. Oh wait, no, the structure of adamantane has the two bromines on adjacent carbons in the bridged structure? Or are they on carbons that are across from each other? Hmm, because if it's 1,3-dibromo, that probably means the bromines are on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So when KOH is used, especially in a high temperature, I think they'll eliminate to form an alkene. So elimination would produce an alkene, specifically 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,2-diene? Wait, maybe it's more about the positions on the adamantane.

Alternatively, I think that when you have two bromines on adjacent carbons, eliminating them would give a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be an adamantane with a double bond, making it an adamantylene. So the product after KOH is probably 1,3-adamantadiene or 1,2-adamantadiene? Wait, maybe 1,3-adamantadiene is not possible because of the structure. Let me think about the structure of adamantane. Adamantane has four cyclohexane rings fused together. Each bridge has two CH2 groups, so the structure is such that each bridge carbon is connected to two other bridge carbons. So the positions 1 and 3 would be adjacent in a certain way, allowing for elimination.

So the product after KOH is probably an alkene. Let's call this product 1. The NMR data for product 1 is given: 4.79 ppm (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). There's also an IR peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which suggests a carbonyl group (C=O), but wait, elimination should produce an alkene, not a carbonyl. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, KOH and high temperature could lead to elimination, but what if it's a different reaction? Oh wait, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. But the IR has a peak at 1720, which is a carbonyl. That suggests maybe an epoxide or a ketone. Hmm, but where would the carbonyl come from?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but substitution. But with two bromines and excess KOH, perhaps it's a double substitution. Wait, but KOH is a strong base, which typically leads to elimination, not substitution, especially under heat. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe the IR peak is not from a carbonyl. Let me think. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong carbonyl, right. So maybe the product is a ketone. How? If we have 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH, perhaps it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -OH, but that would give 1,3-diol. Oh, but that wouldn't produce a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide. Wait, but epoxides are formed from vicinal dihalides with a base, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane is not a vicinal dihalide. Oh wait, maybe the positions are different. Wait, perhaps the dihalide is 1,2-dibromoadamantane, but the question says 1,3. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I should think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm (2H) is probably a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen. Maybe an ether or an epoxide. But the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Wait, maybe it's a ketone. But then where would the 2H at 4.79 come from? Maybe it's an alcohol. No, because the IR doesn't show O-H stretch. Wait, what about an ester? No, because the product is a solid, probably not an ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. But that doesn't fit the NMR. Wait, maybe it's a carbonyl in an amide, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the product is a cyclopropane? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination. Let me think again. KOH is a strong base, and heating with a dihalide could lead to elimination, making an alkene. But in the NMR, the 4.79 ppm (2H) might be a CH2 group next to an oxygen, like in an epoxide. Because in epoxides, the protons are usually around 3-4 ppm. Wait, that's a bit lower than 4.79, but maybe if it's strained or in a different environment.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 suggests a carbonyl. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone formed via some rearrangement. Wait, another possibility: the initial reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond, but then perhaps another reaction occurs. Wait, maybe the product is a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next steps to see if that helps. Product 1 is then heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used as a catalyst in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But for that, the substrate would need to be an aromatic ring, which adamantane isn't. Alternatively, maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts type reaction on another part of the molecule.

Wait, another thought: Maybe product 1 is a diol, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of elimination to form a carbonyl. But I'm not sure. Or perhaps product 1 is an alkene, which when treated with a Lewis acid like AlCl3 (but here it's isopropoxide) undergoes some addition, like a diels-alder reaction, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is an epoxide. Let's say that 1,3-dibromoadamantane, when treated with KOH, undergoes elimination to form an epoxide. Wait, no, because elimination from vicinal dihalides forms alkenes, but 1,3-dibromide wouldn't form an epoxide via elimination. Oh wait, maybe it's a different kind of reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH causes a ring-opening or some rearrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial product is an elimination product, but then another reaction occurs. Alternatively, maybe the product is a ketone resulting from a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the IR. The IR peak at 1720 is probably a carbonyl, so product 1 is a ketone. So how does 1,3-dibromoadamantane reacting with KOH give a ketone?

Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by a keto-enol tautomerism. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a beta hydrogen leading to elimination and then some rearrangement. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Fittig reaction, but that usually involves coupling two aryl halides, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, this is getting me stuck. Maybe I should think about the next steps. Product 1 is treated with aluminum isopropoxide, which is a Lewis acid. So if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps the next reaction is some kind of acylation, but I don't see the connection. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and product 2 is an opened epoxide.

Wait, but let me think about product 2. Then, product 2 is subjected to ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide. That's ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds. So product 3 would be the result of breaking the double bond into carbonyl groups.

Wait, so if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it. But to have a double bond in product 2, product 1 must have a different structure. Alternatively, let's retrace.

First step: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH → product 1.

Assuming elimination, product 1 is an alkene. Then, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3, which is a Lewis acid. What reactions involve alkenes and Lewis acids? Maybe it's a dihydroxylation, but that's usually with OsO4 or similar. Alternatively, maybe the alkene undergoes a ring-opening, but adamantane is already a rigid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is an alkyne. Wait, no, KOH isn't typically used to make alkynes. Hmm.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a diol, and then Al(OiPr)3 is used for some kind of dehydration to form an alkene. But that would make product 2 an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that into two carbonyl compounds.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR of product 1. 4.79 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like oxygen. For example, an ether (CH2-O) or an epoxide (CH2-O). The 2.41-2.23 (10H) are probably the adamantane CH2 groups, and the 1.94 (2H) could be another CH2 group somewhere else.

If product 1 is an epoxide, then the 4.79 ppm would be the two protons on the oxygen. But then, where would the carbonyl come from? Unless the epoxide is part of a ketone. Wait, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, product 1 could be an alcohol. If there's an -OH group, but the IR doesn't show a broad peak for O-H. Also, in the NMR, the 4.79 (2H) could be an alcohol, but again, the IR doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the initial reaction isn't elimination. Maybe it's a substitution. For example, each Br is replaced by an -OH, making a diol. But then, the IR would show O-H stretches, which are usually around 3300 cm⁻¹. But the IR here is at 1720, which is a carbonyl. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: The IR at 1720 could be a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone. How would that happen from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe via a double elimination with formation of a carbonyl. But I'm not familiar with a specific reaction that does that. Alternatively, perhaps the KOH induces a ring-opening to form a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton adjacent to a Br, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond, but then perhaps some rearrangement leads to a carbonyl. Like a Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of protons in the NMR. Product 1's NMR shows 14 protons (2+10+2). Adamantane has 12 hydrogens normally, but if product 1 has 14, perhaps some new hydrogens are formed, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have 12 hydrogens minus 2 (since two Brs replace two Hs), so 10 hydrogens. But product 1 has 14? That can't be. Wait, wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. The NMR shows 2+10+2=14, but product 1 is derived from 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which has 12 H. Hmm, that suggests perhaps the product has more H, but that's confusing.

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. An epoxide would add two oxygens but not change the number of H. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane has, say, two Brs. Eliminating two HBr molecules would form an alkene, which would have one double bond. But then the product would have two fewer H (since each elimination takes two Hs and forms a double bond, but actually, each elimination removes two H and one Br, so maybe one H loss per Br? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure. Adamantane has four rings, each with CH2 groups. 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two adjacent carbons. Eliminating HBr from each would form a double bond between those two carbons. So the product would be an adamantene (adamantane with a double bond). So product 1 is an adamantadiene? Hmm, but then the IR wouldn't have a carbonyl. So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, maybe the initial reaction isn't elimination but something else. Another possibility: Maybe the KOH causes a coupling reaction. For example, the elimination of two HBr molecules, but perhaps it's a ring-opening to form a larger structure. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone because of some rearrangement. Wait, maybe the initial reaction forms a diol, which then under certain conditions forms a ketone. But under what conditions? I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should accept that I'm stuck on the first step and try to proceed with the next steps, as they might give me clues.

Product 2 is formed by heating product 1 with excess aluminum isopropoxide. If product 1 is an alkene, and product 2 is treated with a Lewis acid, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but that's usually done with OsO4. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroxylation via some other mechanism.

Wait, another thought: If product 1 is an epoxide, then heating with Al(OiPr)3 could cause it to ring-open. But how? Lewis acids can catalyze ring-opening of epoxides with nucleophiles, but I'm not sure what the nucleophile would be here. Alternatively, maybe the epoxide is opened by something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of alkylation. But without knowing, it's hard to say.

Then, product 2 is subjected to ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds. So product 2 must have a double bond. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 has a double bond between carbons A and B, ozonolysis would form two carbonyl groups, perhaps two ketones or aldehydes, depending on the substitution.

So, product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was. Now, the question is about the NMR of product 3, specifically the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen.

Wait, but the most deshielded hydrogen would be the one closest to the carbonyl group. Maybe it's on a carbon adjacent to the carbonyl.

In an ozonolysis product, each carbonyl group would have adjacent hydrogens. For example, in a simple alkene like ethylene, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules, which don't have hydrogens. But in a more complex structure, like if the alkene is part of a larger chain, ozonolysis would give carbonyl compounds with adjacent hydrogens.

So, for product 3, let's imagine that the double bond in product 2 was between two carbons, each attached to two CH2 groups. Then, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl would then be adjacent to CH2 groups.

The most deshielded hydrogen would be the one next to the carbonyl, so a methylene group (CH2) adjacent to a ketone. The splitting for that would depend on neighboring hydrogens.

Wait, for example, if the structure is (CH2)2CO, then the CH2 next to CO would be split by neighboring Hs. If each CH2 has two Hs, and they're next to another CH2 group, the coupling would be a triplet of triplets or something more complex.

Wait, but let's think of the structure. Suppose product 2 is an adamantane with a double bond. Ozonolysis would break that into two ketones. So, product 3 would have two ketone groups. Each ketone is part of a larger structure.

Wait, but since the initial compound is symmetric (adamantane is symmetric), product 3 would also be symmetric. So each ketone would be in a symmetrical position.

Wait, perhaps each end of the double bond in product 2 has a CH2 group. So after ozonolysis, each CH2 becomes a carbonyl group. Wait, no, ozonolysis would break the double bond and form carbonyl groups on each fragment. So if the double bond is between two CH2 groups, ozonolysis would convert each CH2 into a carbonyl group, producing two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Let me think with a specific example. Let's say product 2 is an adamantane with a double bond between two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups. So each CH2 would become a CO group. But CO groups are carbonyls, which don't have H. Hmm, maybe I'm getting something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between two CH groups. For example, if the structure is CH2-CH2, then ozonolysis would give two aldehydes (CHO), which don't have H adjacent. But if it's CH2-CH(CH3), then ozonolysis would give a ketone and an aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the double bond in product 2 is between two carbons each attached to two CH2 groups. So the structure would be CH2-CH2, which upon ozonolysis would form two formaldehyde molecules, which don't have H. But that doesn't make sense because product 3 would be a different compound.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between two carbons each attached to a CH2 and a CH. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is part of a ring in product 2. Ozonolysis would break the ring into a chain with carbonyl groups.

Wait, but going back, product 3's NMR is the key. The most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl, likely as a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. The coupling pattern would depend on the neighboring Hs.

If the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2 group, each H in the first CH2 would couple with the Hs in the neighboring CH2. So each H in the first CH2 would see two Hs in the neighboring group, leading to a triplet. But wait, if each CH2 has two Hs, and they are adjacent to another CH2 with two Hs, then each H in the first CH2 would couple with two Hs, giving a triplet. But also, the other coupling could be with any other neighboring Hs.

Wait, but if the structure is something like R-CO-CH2-CH2-X, then the CH2 next to the CO would have each H coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H in the first CH2 would see the two Hs on the same CH2 and the two Hs on the adjacent CH2? No, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (across the single bond) but not the same CH2.

Wait, the coupling in proton NMR is through bonds, typically J coupling over three bonds (vicinal coupling). So, for a structure like CH2-CH2, each H on the first CH2 would couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another neighboring group, like another CH2, the coupling could be more complex.

Wait, but in product 3, perhaps the structure is such that each CH2 group adjacent to the carbonyl is also next to another CH2 group. So each H on the CH2 adjacent to CO would couple with two Hs from the next CH2, leading to a triplet. But if there's another CH2 further away, maybe it's more complex.

Wait, another possibility: The CH2 next to the carbonyl could be part of a chain like CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's less likely in adamantane derivatives.

Alternatively, if the structure is (CH2)2CO, then each CH2 would have two Hs. The Hs on the CH2 next to CO would each couple with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2, giving a triplet. So the most deshielded H (on the CH2 next to CO) would be a triplet.

But wait, let's think about the actual splitting. Each H on the CH2 next to CO (let's say position A) is next to another CH2 (position B). Each H in A would couple with the two Hs in B. So each H in A would split into a triplet due to coupling with two equivalent Hs in B.

But if position B is also adjacent to another CH2 (position C), then the Hs in B would couple with Hs in C, but that affects the splitting of Hs in B, not A. So for Hs in A, it's only coupled with B's Hs, leading to a triplet.

But wait, if B is a CH2 group with two Hs, and each H in A is coupled to both Hs in B, then each H in A would have two neighboring Hs, giving a triplet.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded H would be in a triplet.

But looking at the options, option A is triplet, option B is triplet of triplets, etc.

Wait, but maybe there's another coupling. Suppose the CH2 next to CO is between two CH2 groups. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CO. Then, each H in the middle CH2 would couple with two Hs on each side. So each H would have four neighboring Hs (two on each adjacent CH2). That would lead to a quintet (five peaks), but wait, that's if each H is coupled with two sets of two Hs. Alternatively, it could be a triplet of triplets, leading to nine peaks, but that's less likely in practice.

Alternatively, if each H in the middle CH2 is coupled with two Hs on one side and two Hs on the other, the splitting would be more complex. But usually, when a proton is coupled with two sets of two equivalent protons, it's a triplet of triplets, leading to 3 x 3 = 9 peaks. However, in practice, if the coupling constants are similar, the peaks might overlap, but the question is about the coupling pattern.

Wait, but in this scenario, the Hs in the middle would be split by both neighboring CH2 groups. So each H would have coupling with two Hs on the left and two on the right. So each H would be a doublet of doublets, but if the coupling constants are the same, perhaps it would be a triplet.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. For a CH2 group in the middle, each H is coupled with two Hs on each adjacent CH2. So each H in the middle would have two coupling partners on each side. So each H would have two J values, leading to a doublet of doublets. But if the two J values are similar, it might appear as a triplet.

Alternatively, the middle CH2 group would have each H coupled with four Hs, but that's not possible because each H can only couple with adjacent Hs. Wait, each H is only coupled with Hs three bonds away, so each H in the middle would couple with two Hs on each adjacent CH2.

So, for each H in the middle CH2:

- Coupled with two Hs on the left (J1)
- Coupled with two Hs on the right (J2)

If J1 and J2 are the same, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets, giving nine peaks. But in practice, this would likely be a septet (7 peaks), but that's not an option here.

Wait, but another possibility: The product 3 structure could have the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl group, and this CH2 is next to another CH2 group. So the structure is CH2-CO-CH2-..., but then perhaps the CH2 next to CO is only next to one CH2 group, leading to a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 group is at the end, so it's only coupled with one adjacent CH2 group. Then each H would see two Hs, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but the most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. So if the structure is (CH2)nCO, then the CH2 adjacent to CO would be the most deshielded. If n=1, then the CH2 next to CO would have each H coupling with the two Hs on the adjacent CH2 (if any). But if it's the end, then perhaps there are no adjacent Hs, but that's not possible.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the initial steps again, maybe I missed something.

If product 1 is an epoxide, then product 2 could be the result of acid-catalyzed ring-opening. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, product 2 is an ester or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The IR of product 1 shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong indication of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone or an ester. The NMR of product 1 has a singlet at 4.79 (2H), which could be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, like in a ketone's acetal or something else.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a diketone. But then, how would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane and KOH? Maybe via elimination of two HBr and formation of two carbonyl groups. But I don't know a specific reaction that would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a single ketone, and the other Br is still present. But then the NMR would show more Br signals, which are usually around 3-4 ppm, but the given NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, maybe product 1 is a product of a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, which forms a ketone, but I don't see how KOH would do that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a Claisen rearrangement, but that's for allyl vinyl ethers.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that product 1 is an epoxide and that the IR peak is from something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about the IR. 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak, likely a carbonyl. So product 1 must have a carbonyl. That suggests that the initial reaction forms a carbonyl group.

So, starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane, which has two Br atoms. How can KOH form a carbonyl? One possibility is that each Br is replaced by an O- group, and then some elimination occurs. Wait, but that would form an oxide, not a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps one Br is replaced by an -OH group, and the other by an O- group, leading to elimination of H2O and formation of a carbonyl. Wait, that's plausible. If two adjacent carbons each lose Br and form an O, perhaps forming a carbonyl.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't adjacent. So if the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination could form a carbonyl. For example, if both Brs are on adjacent carbons, and when KOH removes both, it could form a carbonyl group.

So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane → upon treatment with KOH, two HBr molecules are eliminated, and the two adjacent carbons form a double bond with an oxygen bridge, leading to a ketone.

Wait, that's similar to the formation of a ketone via dehydrohalogenation and oxygen insertion. I'm not sure about the exact mechanism, but perhaps it's a known reaction.

If that's the case, then product 1 would be a ketone with a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the product is a dialkyl ketone. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen, leading to a structure where two oxygen atoms are adjacent, which then lose H2O and form a carbonyl.

Wait, I'm not making much progress on the first step. Let me try to think about the ozonolysis step. Since ozonolysis breaks double bonds into carbonyl groups, product 3 would have carbonyl groups. The NMR of product 3 would show signals from the Hs adjacent to these carbonyls.

The most deshielded H would be the one closest to the carbonyl. Let's say the structure after ozonolysis is something like:

R-CO-R'

Each R and R' would have their own Hs. The Hs adjacent to the CO would be deshielded and show a specific coupling pattern.

If the structure is such that the Hs adjacent to CO are each part of a CH2 group, and that CH2 is next to another CH2, then the coupling would be a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the Hs adjacent to CO are each part of a CH group. But that's less likely because adamantane's structure would have CH2 groups.

Wait, another thought: The initial product 1 is a ketone. Then product 2 is formed by heating with Al(OiPr)3. Maybe product 2 is an enol ether or an enolate. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diol that, when treated with Al(OiPr)3, loses water and forms an alkene. So product 2 would have a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break that into carbonyl groups.

In that scenario, product 3 would have two carbonyl groups. The Hs next to these would have specific coupling patterns.

So, let's say product 2 has a double bond, and upon ozonolysis, it breaks into two carbonyl groups. Each carbonyl is adjacent to a CH2 group.

In product 3, each CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl would have Hs that couple with the Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have two neighboring Hs, leading to a triplet.

Thus, the most deshielded H would be part of a triplet.

Looking at the options, A is triplet, which would be the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is more complex. For example, if each CH2 group is adjacent to two other CH2 groups, each H would have four neighboring Hs (two on each side), leading to a quintet. But that's option D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to visualize the structure.

Assume product 2 has a double bond in a chain: CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Ozonolysis would break the middle double bond into two carbonyl groups, making it CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2.

Wait, but that's not possible because ozonolysis of an internal double bond would give two carbonyls on each fragment. Alternatively, if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2, ozonolysis would produce two aldehydes: OHC-CH2-CH2 and OHC-CH2-CH2. Wait, no, that's not right. Ozonolysis of CH2=CH-CH2-CH2 would actually produce two aldehydes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the ozonolysis product as having two carbonyl groups, each adjacent to a CH2 group. So each CH2 would have two Hs, and each H would be adjacent to another CH2 group.

So the structure might be CH2-CO-CH2-CO-CH2, but that's a bit unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 adjacent to CO is connected to another CH2. So each H in the CH2 next to CO would couple with two Hs from the adjacent CH2, leading to a triplet.

So, in product 3, the most deshielded H would be a triplet.

Therefore, the answer is option A: triplet.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C likely results in elimination of two HBr molecules, forming a carbonyl-containing product. The IR spectrum of the product (1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is characteristic of a carbonyl group. The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests the presence of a CH₂ group adjacent to an electronegative atom (likely oxygen) and other hydrogens from the adamantane framework. This indicates that product 1 is likely a ketone.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Heating product 1 with aluminum isopropoxide could lead to further structural changes, potentially forming a compound (product 2) with a double bond. However, the exact nature of product 2 is not explicitly determined, but it is inferred that it contains a double bond due to the subsequent ozonolysis step.

3. **Ozonolysis**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C followed by dimethyl sulfide cleaves the double bond, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically converts double bonds into carbonyl groups. The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 would be adjacent to a carbonyl group, likely part of a CH₂ group. This CH₂ group would couple with the hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, resulting in a triplet splitting pattern due to the two equivalent hydrogens on the neighboring group.

4. **Coupling Pattern in Product 3**:  
   The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is adjacent to a carbonyl group and part of a CH₂ group. This CH₂ group couples with the two hydrogens on the adjacent CH₂ group, leading to a triplet splitting pattern. No additional coupling constants are significant enough to alter this pattern.

Based on the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.
