Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there's an alien spacecraft traveling at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to know how long the trip to Earth will take from their perspective. The options suggest either they don't make it, or they take around 70-something years.

Wait, I remember that when you're moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, time dilation occurs. From the astronaut's frame of reference, less time would pass compared to an outside observer. Oh right, this is due to special relativity, specifically the Lorentz factor.

So the formula I need is the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the proper time. The proper time (tau) is the time measured in the moving frame—in this case, the spaceship's frame. The equation is tau equals t multiplied by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), right? Or wait, no, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1 over sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So tau is t multiplied by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is 1/gamma.

But wait, wait—I think I might be mixing up the frames here. Let me get this straight. The time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is shorter than the time measured in the Earth's frame. So if the Earth is at rest, the Earth would see the spaceship taking a certain amount of time, but the astronaut would age less.

But the question gives the speed as 0.99999987c. That's really close to the speed of light. Let me calculate the gamma factor first. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So plugging in v = 0.99999987c.

Calculating v squared over c squared: (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let's see, 0.99999987 is very close to 1. So (0.99999987)^2 is approximately 0.99999974. So 1 - that is about 0.00000026. Wait, let me be precise. Let me calculate it step by step.

Wait, (a-b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². Let me think about it differently. 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013. So v = (1 - 1.3e-7)c. So v² = (1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.3e-7)^2 )c². Since (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, v² ≈ (1 - 2.6e-7)c². So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ sqrt(2.6e-7).

What's sqrt(2.6e-7)? Let me compute that. 2.6e-7 is 2.6 * 1e-7. The square root of 1e-7 is 1e-3.5, which is about 3.16e-4. So sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 is approximately 5.08e-4.

So gamma is 1 / 5.08e-4 ≈ 1972.5. Oh wow, that's a big gamma. So from Earth's frame, the time taken would be... well, first, how far away is the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth? Wait, the problem states that they are traveling to Earth, so perhaps we can assume that the distance is about the same as the distance from the LMC to Earth, but I'm not sure if that's needed here.

Wait, wait. Wait a second, maybe I'm overcomplicating things. The question is asking for the time experienced by the astronaut, not the time from Earth's perspective. So perhaps I should compute the proper time.

Proper time tau is the time experienced by the traveler. The time measured in Earth's frame (say, t) would be longer. So tau = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But to compute tau, I need to know the distance to Earth from the LMC and the speed. Oh, right, the distance is the same as the distance the spaceship travels at speed v. So from Earth's frame, the distance is D = v * t. So t = D / v.

But without knowing D, how can I compute t? Oh wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance is 1 parsec or something, but that's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is simply asking about the time experienced by the astronaut, regardless of the actual distance.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. The problem must give enough info to calculate it. Let's see the original question. It says: The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years. So perhaps their lifespan is 150 years, but the astronaut is 22 now, so from their perspective, the trip's duration should be under 128 years, otherwise they'd die.

Wait, but the options are 72, 81,77, or die. So if from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 70-80 years, he would be 22 + 70=92, which is less than 150. So he could make it. So the answer would be one of B, C, D.

Wait, but let me get back to the problem. The problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, but how much does he age during the trip? We need to calculate the proper time tau.

But how do we find tau? Well, tau is equal to the time measured in the spaceship's frame. From the spaceship's frame, the distance to Earth is contracted. So the distance D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), which is D * (1/gamma). So the time experienced is tau = D' / v = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

But we don't know D. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is so that from Earth's frame, the trip would take a certain time, but the astronaut's time is shorter.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking us to just compute the gamma factor and see whether the astronaut's experienced time is under 150 years. Let me think.

Wait, the gamma is about 1972. So from Earth's frame, the time taken would be t = D / v. But again, without D, perhaps the problem is using the fact that if the trip takes T years from Earth's perspective, the astronaut's time is T / gamma. But again, without knowing T, I'm stuck.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me read the question again. It says the astronaut is 22 years old and wants to reach Earth. The question is: how long will it take for the astronaut to reach Earth, from their own perspective.

So, we need to compute the proper time tau for the journey.

But for that, I need to know the distance to Earth as measured in the astronaut's frame, which is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So tau = D' / v = (D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²)) / v.

But without knowing D, I can't compute tau. Hmm. Wait, unless the problem is implying that from Earth's perspective, the distance is the same as the astronaut's, but that's not correct because of length contraction.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that from the astronaut's perspective, the Earth is approaching at speed v, so the time experienced is D' / v, where D' is the contracted distance. But without D, perhaps the problem is considering that the distance is such that the time from Earth's frame is 150 years? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the distance is 1 light-year, but that's not stated.

Wait, maybe the problem is actually trying to get me to calculate how much the astronaut ages, using the gamma factor. Let me think differently.

Wait, another approach: the ship is moving at v = 0.99999987c. The time experienced by the astronaut is tau. So, the time in Earth's frame is t = gamma * tau.

But I don't know t either. Wait, but perhaps the problem is just about the time experienced on the ship, which depends on the distance. Without the distance, I can't compute it numerically. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually a trick question. Because if the speed is 0.99999987c, the gamma factor is so large that the time experienced would be minimal. Wait, no, that's not right. The higher the speed, the more time dilation, so the less tau. Wait, no, the higher the speed, the larger gamma, so the smaller tau compared to t.

Wait, let me compute gamma more accurately. Let me compute v^2 / c^2.

v = 0.99999987c. So v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 c^2 = approx 0.99999974c².

So 1 - (v²/c²) = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let's compute that.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is 10^-7, sqrt(10^-7) is 10^-3.5 = approx 3.16e-4.

So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.08e-4 ≈ 1972 (since 1 / 0.0005 is 2000, so around 1972).

So gamma is approximately 1972.

Now, if the time taken from Earth's frame is t, then the astronaut's time is tau = t / gamma.

But I don't know t. Unless the problem provides that the distance is such that t is, say, 150 years. But the problem states that the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So if the trip takes 150 years in Earth's frame (t=150), then tau = 150 / 1972 ≈ 0.076 years, which is about a month. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think again. The time experienced by the astronaut (tau) is the proper time, so it's the shortest time between two events (departure and arrival). So, from the spaceship's frame, the Earth is moving towards them at speed v. The distance between the spaceship and Earth is contracted by sqrt(1 - v²/c²), so the distance is D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the time the astronaut experiences is D' / v. But again, without D, I can't compute this.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the distance as the same as the astronaut's age? Like, assuming that the distance is such that, from Earth's perspective, the trip takes 22 years or something. No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick and the speed is so high that the time experienced is almost zero, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options don't include anything less than 72 years. So perhaps the problem is considering the time from Earth's frame, but that can't be right because 0.99999987c is so close to c that the time would be D/(0.99999987 c), which for a distance of, say, 150 light-years would be about 150 / 0.99999987 ≈ 150.0000025 years. But again, without the distance, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem statement is implying that the distance is such that from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 70-something years. Since the gamma is 1972, that would mean that from Earth's frame, the time is about 1972 * 70 = around 138,040 years, which is way longer than the alien's 150-year lifespan. That can't be right because the astronaut would die.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me think differently. The problem says the astronaut is 22 and wants to reach Earth. They are traveling at 0.99999987c. How long does it take from their perspective?

Without the distance, perhaps I'm supposed to note that the gamma is so large that the time experienced is much less than the Earth's frame time. But without knowing the Earth's frame time, I can't compute the astronaut's time.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually a trick because the gamma is so large that the time experienced is negligible. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the time experienced is longer than the astronaut's lifespan, so they die before reaching Earth.

Wait, the average lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes longer than that, the astronaut would die. But the options include 'the astronaut will die before reaching Earth' as option A.

Wait, but from the astronaut's perspective, time is shorter. So if from Earth's frame, the trip takes T years, the astronaut would experience T / gamma years.

So if from Earth's frame, the trip takes T years, and T is, say, 150 years, then the astronaut's time is 150 / 1972 ≈ 0.076 years, about a month. So the astronaut would definitely make it.

But wait, that's assuming the Earth is 150 light-years away, but that's a big assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is implying that from Earth's perspective, the trip takes 150 years, but that would make the astronaut only age 0.076 years, which is way less than 22+0.076=22.076, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. The problem says the average lifetime is 150 solar years, but that's the aliens' average lifespan. So if the trip takes more than 150 years from the astronaut's perspective, they die. Otherwise, they live.

So the question is, does the trip take more than 150 years from the astronaut's perspective?

But how can I compute that? Without the distance, I can't. So perhaps the question is using the gamma factor and the time experienced as a function of the speed, not the distance.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the distance is 1 light-year. Then, from Earth's frame, the time is (1 ly)/(0.99999987c) ≈ 1.00000013 years. So from the astronaut's perspective, time is 1.00000013 / 1972 ≈ 5e-7 years, which is like a fraction of a day. But again, that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is such that from Earth's frame, the time is 77 years. Then, tau = 77 / 1972 ≈ 0.039 years, which is about 14 days. That's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the time from Earth's frame and then apply the time dilation factor. But without the Earth's frame time, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is considering that the distance is the same as the astronaut's age plus the time taken. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the time from Earth's frame as the same as the astronaut's time, but that would be incorrect. Because from the Earth's frame, time is longer.

Wait, perhaps the question is more about understanding that at such a high speed, the time experienced is much less, so the astronaut would not die. So if the trip takes, say, 77 years from Earth's frame, the astronaut would experience 77 / gamma ≈ 77 / 1972 ≈ 0.039 years, about 14 days. So the astronaut would not die.

But the options are A) die, B)72, C)81, D)77.

Hmm, unless I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is the other way around. Maybe the distance is such that from the astronaut's frame, the trip takes 77 years, which is option D.

But then, how much time passes on Earth? It would be gamma times that, so 77 * 1972 ≈ 152,164 years. If the aliens live 150 years, then the Earth would have to wait a very long time, but the astronaut arrives in 77 years.

Wait, but the question is only concerned with the astronaut's lifespan. 77 years is much less than 150, so they would live.

So the answer would be D)77 years.

But wait, how did I get that 77? Because the problem states that the astronaut is 22, so 22 + 77 = 99, which is less than 150. So the astronaut would live.

But why would the answer be 77? How is that calculated?

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually using the fact that from Earth's frame, the time is 77 years, but the astronaut's time is 77 / gamma. But that would be a negligible time, which is not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the time from Earth's frame, but that would require knowing the distance. Maybe the problem is considering that the distance is 77 light-years, but that's not given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick and the time experienced is longer than the astronaut's lifespan, so the answer is A.

But given that gamma is so high, the time experienced is much shorter. So the astronaut would live.

Since the options are A) die, B)72, C)81, D)77.

If the trip takes 77 years from the astronaut's frame, they would be 22+77=99, which is under 150. So answer D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the gamma factor inversely. Let me double-check the formulas.

Tau = t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = t / gamma.

So if I have tau = t / gamma.

But without knowing t, how can I find tau?

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the time from Earth's frame is 150 years, the average lifespan. Then tau = 150 / 1972 ≈ 0.076 years, way too short.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is considering the time from Earth's frame as 77 years. Then tau would be 77 / 1972 ≈ 0.039 years, about 14 days. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that in the spaceship's frame, the distance is contracted, and so the time is D' / v, but without D, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the distance from the LMC to Earth is about 160,000 light-years, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the speed to compute the time based on the gamma factor.

Wait, another approach: The problem says the average lifetime is 150 solar years. The astronaut is 22, so has about 128 years left.

At v = 0.99999987c, gamma is 1972, so the time experienced is t_earth / gamma.

If the trip takes t_earth = 150 years, the astronaut's time is 150 / 1972 ≈ 0.076 years, which is about a month. So they'd live.

But none of the options are that low.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the fact that from the astronaut's frame, the distance is contracted. But without the distance, I can't compute the time.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. Maybe the question is about the Earth-bound perspective, but that would require knowing the distance. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the approximation that at such a high speed, the time experienced is negligible, but that doesn't fit the options.

Wait, another thought: when you're moving at 0.99999987c, the Lorentz factor gamma is about 1972, as I computed earlier. So if the trip takes t years in Earth's frame, the astronaut ages t / gamma years.

If the astronaut is 22, and their average lifespan is 150, then:

t_earth = 150 years → t_astronaut = 150 / 1972 ≈ 0.076 years → 27 days. So they'd live.

But the question is, how long does it take the astronaut to reach Earth? So the time from their perspective.

But without knowing the distance, I can't find t_astronaut.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the time from the spaceship's frame is the same as the time from Earth's frame divided by gamma. But without knowing the Earth's frame time, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the time from the spaceship's frame is the same as the time for light to reach Earth, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the time experienced by the astronaut as the proper time, tau.

Proper time is given by:

tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t_earth / gamma.

But again, without t_earth, I can't compute tau.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the speed to compute the time based on the average lifetime.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is that the astronaut will die before reaching Earth because the time taken is longer than their lifespan.

Wait, but that would only be the case if from the astronaut's frame, the trip takes longer than 150 - 22 = 128 years.

But without knowing the trip duration from the astronaut's frame, I can't say.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the speed to compute the time based on the distance, but without the distance, I can't.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to have us compute the time from the Earth's frame, and then compare that to the astronaut's lifespan.

Wait, but the question asks for the time from the astronaut's perspective.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think of possible approaches.

Alternative approach: The spaceship is moving at v = 0.99999987c. The gamma is about 1972.

The astronaut's proper time is tau. So, tau = t_earth / gamma.

But if the distance is D, then from Earth's frame, t_earth = D / v.

So tau = (D / v) / gamma = D / (v * gamma) = D / (c * (v/c) * gamma).

But v/c is 0.99999987.

So tau = D / (c * 0.99999987 * 1972) = D / (c * 1971.999) ≈ D / (c * 1972) ≈ D/(1972 c) years.

Because D is in light-years, D/(c) is in years. So D/(1972 c) is same as D/(1972) years.

Wait, but I don't know D. So maybe the problem is using the fact that from Earth's frame, the trip takes about 77 years. Then tau would be 77 / 1972 ≈ 0.039 years, which is about 14 days. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the time experienced is 77 years, which is option D.

But without knowing D, I can't compute. So perhaps the correct answer is D)77 years.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A) die, because the time from Earth's frame is much longer, but the astronaut's time is short.

Wait, but the options don't include very short times; the shortest is 72 years.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: The problem states that the spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. The gamma factor is 1972. So for every year that passes on Earth, only about 0.0005 years pass on the ship.

So, for instance, if the trip takes 77 years on Earth, the astronaut would experience 77 / 1972 ≈ 0.039 years, which is about 14 days. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the time experienced is 77 years because the gamma is 1972, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the time experienced is 77 years, so the astronaut would be 22 +77=99, which is less than 150, so they live. So the answer is D)77 years.

But how did that number come about? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the spaceship's speed is such that the time experienced is almost the same as the distance divided by c, but that would be for v approaching c.

Wait, but tau is D' / v, where D' is the contracted distance.

D' = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D / gamma.

So tau = (D / gamma) / v = D/(gamma v).

But again, without D, I can't compute.

Wait, perhaps the distance D is such that from Earth's frame, the trip takes t_earth = D / v. And the proper time is tau = t_earth / gamma.

But unless I have either tau or t_earth, I can't proceed.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Given the options, and the fact that the gamma is 1972, the time experienced by the astronaut would be much less than 77 years. So none of the options B, C, D make sense. The only option that makes sense is A) the astronaut will die before reaching Earth, but that would only be if the trip takes longer than 128 years from the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, but from the astronaut's perspective, the trip would take D' / v = D*sqrt(1 - v²/c²)/v.

If D is the distance from the LMC to Earth, which is about 160,000 light-years, then D'=160,000 ly * 5.08e-4 ≈ 81.28 ly.

Then, the time would be 81.28 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 81.28 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.28 years.

So tau ≈ 81 years. Which matches option C)81 years.

Wait, that makes sense. So the steps are:

1. Compute gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1972.

2. The distance to Earth is about 160,000 light-years (I think that's the distance to the LMC), so D = 160,000 ly.

3. From the astronaut's frame, the contracted distance D' = D / gamma ≈ 160,000 / 1972 ≈ 81.28 ly.

4. Time experienced tau = D' / v ≈ 81.28 ly / (0.99999987c) ≈ 81.28 / 0.99999987 ≈ 81.28 years.

So the answer would be approximately 81 years, which is option C.


To determine how long it will take for the astronaut to reach Earth from their perspective, we analyze the situation using special relativity. The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old, and the average lifespan of these aliens is 150 years. The key concept here is time dilation, where the proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut is related to the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t \)) by the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \)):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The speed \( v = 0.99999987c \) is very close to the speed of light. Calculating \( \gamma \):

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2}} \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.99999974}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}}} \approx 1972
\]

Thus, \( \gamma \approx 1972 \).

### Step 2: Proper time (\( \tau \)) experienced by the astronaut
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{t}{\gamma}
\]

Here, \( t \) is the time measured in Earth's frame. However, the problem does not explicitly provide \( t \). To proceed, we assume the distance to Earth is approximately the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is about 160,000 light-years. From Earth's frame, the time for the spacecraft to travel this distance is:

\[
t = \frac{D}{v} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Time experienced by the astronaut (\( \tau \))
Using the relationship \( \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1972} \approx 81 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the astronaut's lifespan
The astronaut is 22 years old and has an average lifespan of 150 years. After traveling for approximately 81 years, the astronaut would be \( 22 + 81 = 103 \) years old, which is well within their expected lifespan.

### Conclusion
The time experienced by the astronaut to reach Earth is approximately 81 years, which matches option **C**.

**Answer: C**
