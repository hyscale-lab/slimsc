Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon multiplied by the dot product of sigma and n vectors. So, H = ε σ · n. Wait, sigma is the Pauli matrices vector. Oh right, σ has components σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each of which are Pauli matrices. And n is a unit vector, so it's like (n_x, n_y, n_z), right? So the dot product would be σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z.

I remember that the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. Each of them squares to the identity matrix. So σ_x squared is I, same for σ_y and σ_z. Also, they anti-commute with each other. But wait, how does that help here?

The eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination... Oh, right! The eigenvalues of any operator of the form a·σ, where a is a vector, are plus and minus the magnitude of a. Wait, let me think again. If you have a vector a with components (a_x, a_y, a_z), then the operator is a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z. The eigenvalues would be sqrt(a_x² +a_y² +a_z²) multiplied by ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and when you combine them, the magnitude comes into play.

So in this case, the Hamiltonian is ε times (σ · n). Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of σ · n is just the square root of (n_x² + n_y² +n_z²) times something. Wait no, n is a unit vector, so the length of n is 1. So the coefficient in front is ε, and the operator inside is a unit vector dotted with sigma. So the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, because the length of n is 1.

Wait, let me make sure. Because the Pauli matrices are traceless and Hermitian, their linear combinations with real coefficients are also Hermitian. So their eigenvalues would be real. For a general a vector, the eigenvalues of a · σ would be ±|a|. Because when you diagonalize a · σ, the eigenvalues come out as the magnitude of a times ±1.

In this case, the a vector is (ε n_x, ε n_y, ε n_z), but wait no, wait no. Wait, the Hamiltonian is ε multiplied by (σ · n). So the vector in the a·σ term is sigma multiplied by n, but scaled by epsilon. No, the structure is H = ε (n · sigma). So the vector a is (epsilon * n_x, epsilon *n_y, epsilon *n_z). But since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of a is sqrt( (epsilon n_x)^2 + (epsilon n_y)^2 + (epsilon n_z)^2 ) ) = epsilon * sqrt(n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2) ) = epsilon *1 = epsilon.

Wait, no, wait. Wait the a in a·σ is just the vector (n_x, n_y, n_z), but scaled by ε. So the operator is (ε n_x) σ_x + (ε n_y) σ_y + (ε n_z) σ_z. So the vector a is (ε n_x, ε n_y, ε n_z). The magnitude of a is sqrt( (ε n_x)^2 + (ε n_y)^2 + (ε n_z)^2 ). Factor out epsilon^2: epsilon * sqrt( n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2 ) = epsilon *1, because n is a unit vector.

So the eigenvalues are ± |a|, which is ±epsilon. So the eigenvalues of H are +epsilon and -epsilon.

Wait, that would match option B: +ε, -ε. Let me check the options again.

Option A: +
