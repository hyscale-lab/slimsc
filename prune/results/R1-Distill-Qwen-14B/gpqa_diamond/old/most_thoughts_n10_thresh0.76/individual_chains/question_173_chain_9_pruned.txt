Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about the uncertainty principle and estimating the minimum uncertainty in energy for an electron. Hmm, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, I remember that's a big deal in quantum mechanics.

The problem states that an electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v = 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm, which is nanometers. Oh wait, nanometers are 10^-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Got it. They’re asking for the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

I think I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and the uncertainty in momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I think we can use the equality case: Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

But wait, how do I find Δp from Δx? Let's see. Momentum p is mass times velocity, so p = mv. But since there's uncertainty, Δp would be related to the uncertainty in velocity, Δv. Or wait, no, in this problem, perhaps we can link Δp with the uncertainty in momentum based on the position uncertainty.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it by considering the uncertainty in momentum is related to the uncertainty in velocity. So, Δp = m * Δv. But wait, I don't have Δv given. Hmm, perhaps I should think about it differently. The problem gives the speed of the electron, but I'm not sure if I need that. Wait, maybe the given speed is to find the momentum, and then use the uncertainty principle?

Wait, no. Let me think. The problem gives the speed, but the uncertainty in position is given, and I need to find the uncertainty in energy. Energy of a particle is given by E = p²/(2m), right? So the energy depends on the momentum squared over twice the mass. So if there's an uncertainty in momentum, there's an uncertainty in energy.

So the first step is to find the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Then, from that, find
