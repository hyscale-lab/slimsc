Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ represents the Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Hmm, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix. When you take the dot product of σ with n, you're basically doing n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. So the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix constructed that way.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. But maybe there's a shortcut here because of the structure of the Pauli matrices.

Wait, another thought: the Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1. For example, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you combine them into a dot product with a unit vector, the magnitude might matter.

Oh! The Pauli matrices are traceless and each has a trace of zero. The eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1 as well because the trace is zero and the determinant would be -1 (since each Pauli matrix has determinant -1, and their linear combinations squared would have the same determinant? Maybe not exactly, but perhaps the magnitude would scale with the coefficients).

Wait, no. Because the Hamiltonian is ε times (σ · n). So the σ · n is a matrix, and when multiplied by ε, it scales the eigenvalues by ε. So what's the eigenvalue of σ · n?

Let me think about the operator σ · n. Since n is a unit vector, the dot product σ · n is a matrix whose eigenvalues should be ±1. Because when you have σ · n, which is a Hermitian matrix (since the Pauli matrices are Hermitian and n is real), it should have real eigenvalues. And the trace is zero because each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the eigenvalues must be 1 and -1 because their sum is zero and they are real.

Wait, wait! No. Wait, the trace of σ · n is n_x Tr(σ_x) + n_y Tr(σ_y) + n_z Tr(σ_z). But each Pauli matrix has trace zero. So the trace of σ · n is zero. Therefore, the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. The possible eigenvalues must be a and -a, where a is some value. What's the magnitude of a?

The determinant of σ · n would be (Tr^2 - Tr(σ · n)^2)/4, but wait, that's if it's a 2x2 matrix. Alternatively, for a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (product of eigenvalues) = (λ1)(λ2) = λ^2 - (Tr/2)^2, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and any linear combination... Wait, no. For σ · n, since n is a unit vector, the operator σ · n is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues ±1. Because the matrix σ · n has the same form as σ_z, just rotated into the direction of n.

Wait, let me think about σ · n as a spin operator. The spin operator in the direction of n would have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2 for spin-1/2 systems. Oh wait! Wait a second, I think I might have mixed up some factors. Because in quantum mechanics, the spin angular momentum is given by S = (ℏ/2) σ. So the operator S · n would have eigenvalues ±ℏ/2.

But wait the Hamiltonian here is H = ε σ · n. So that's equivalent to scaling the spin operator. So the eigenvalues would be ± ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. Wait, what's the eigenvalue of σ · n itself?

Wait, let me think. The Pauli matrices σ have eigenvalues ±1.
