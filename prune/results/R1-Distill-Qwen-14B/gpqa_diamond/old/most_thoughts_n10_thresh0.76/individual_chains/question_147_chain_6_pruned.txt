Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through. The question is about the process where a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles, A+ and A−. The setup is that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A.

Wait, the annihilation equation is p + p̄ → 2A+ + 2A−. So the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. I remember that in annihilation processes, especially in high-energy physics, conservation laws are key—like conservation of energy and momentum.

But the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Oh, that probably means that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So maybe we can approximate that it's moving at non-relativistic speeds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so the system's energy is dominated by the rest mass energies.

Wait, but wait. The proton and antiproton are annihilating. Normally, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce gamma rays or other particles. But here, it's producing two A+ and two A−. So let me think about conservation of energy and momentum.

Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is dominated by the proton. Or wait, the proton is at rest? Because in some setups, like in a lab frame where one particle is at rest. Wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with some small velocity. But the problem doesn't specify, so I might have to make some assumptions.

Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." Hmm. So perhaps the initial system's momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, since the proton is at rest. Or maybe both are moving? But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial total momentum is just that of the antiproton, which is small.

Wait, but annihilation usually happens when the particles collide. So maybe they are moving towards each other, but since the antiproton is moving slowly, its momentum is much less than the proton's. Wait, but protons are massive, so even a slow-moving
