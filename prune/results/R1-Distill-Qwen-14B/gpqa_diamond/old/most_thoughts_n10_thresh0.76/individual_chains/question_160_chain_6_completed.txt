Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light with wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and we can approximate tan(theta) as theta because the angles are small.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed is called a diffraction pattern. The specific pattern depends on the shape of the aperture. For a single slit, the diffraction minima occur at certain angles, and the formula is something like sin(theta) = mλ/(2a), where m is the order of the minima, a is the slit width, and λ is the wavelength.

Wait, but here the aperture is a polygon with N sides, and when N is very large, it's almost like a circle. Because a polygon with infinite sides becomes a circle. Oh, but wait, the apothems are all the same length. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So in a regular polygon, all apothems are equal, which they are here.

So, if the polygon is regular and N approaches infinity, the aperture becomes a circle. But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first minima in the Airy pattern occur at an angle given by sin(theta) = 1.22 λ / (diameter), right? So the diameter would be 2a because the apothem is a, which for a circle would be the radius. So the diameter is 2a.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. For a single slit, the minima are at theta = mλ/(2a) where 'a' is the width. But for a circle, the first minimum is at a larger angle than the single-slit case because the circle has a more complex diffraction pattern.

So the formula for the first minimum in the Airy pattern is theta ≈ 1.22 λ/(pi a), but wait, wait. Let me get the exact formula. Oh, the first minimum for the Airy disk (circular aperture) occurs when the argument of the first zero of the Bessel function J1 is at 3.8317, but approximated, it's about 1.22 λ/(a), but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, the formula is sin(theta) = (1.22 λ)/(d), where d is the diameter of the aperture. So if the apothem 'a' is the radius, then the diameter is 2a. So substituting, sin(theta) = 1.22 λ/(2a).

Wait no, wait. Because the apothem is the radius, so the diameter is 2a. So for the Airy disk, the first minimum is at theta where sin(theta) = 1.22 λ/(2a), because d is 2a. So theta ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a), since for small angles, sin(theta) ≈ theta.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the single-slit formula. For a single slit of width 'a', the minima are at mλ = a sin(theta), so for m=1, sin(theta)= λ/(a) * 1/2? No, wait: for the single slit, the first minimum is m=1, so sin(theta) = λ/(a). Wait, no, wait. No, wait, for the single slit, the formula is a sin(theta) = m lambda, correct. So for m=1, a sin(theta) = lambda => sin(theta) = lambda/(a). So theta is approximately lambda/(a), since for small angles.

Wait, but the circle's first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/(diameter). So for a circle with diameter 2a, it's 1.22 λ/(2a) which is 0.61 lambda / a. So theta is approximately 0.61 lambda/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, wait, in the single-slit case, the first minima occur at m=1, m=2, etc. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be (theta_2 - theta_1) = (2 lambda/(a)) - (lambda/(a)) )= lambda/(a). But wait, that's for single-slit.

But wait, in the case of a circular aperture, the minima are not as straightforward. The Airy disk has the central maximum and then the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/(diameter), and then the next minima are not equally spaced because the zeros of the Bessel functions aren't equally spaced. The first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/d, then the next is at approximately 2.405 lambda/d, which is about, wait, 2.405 is the first zero of J1. Wait, no: J1 has its first zero at about 3.83, but maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, J1(x) has its first zero at x ≈ 3.8317, but wait, wait no: J0(x) first zero is at about 2.4048, J1 at 3.8317, etc. So for the Airy pattern, the minima are determined by the zeros of the Bessel functions. The first minimum is at J1(ka)=0, where ka = (pi/a) sin(theta) = pi (d sin(theta))/lambda, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The problem says, when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The problem asks for the angular distance between the first two minima.

In the Airy disk, the first minimum is at an angle of theta_1 = 1.22 lambda/(diameter). The diameter is 2a, since the apothem is a (which is the radius). So theta_1 = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a.

Wait, but for the second minimum, what is the angle? The first zero of J1 is at x=3.8317, so the next zero is much larger. Wait, no, the first minimum after the central maximum is the first zero of J1, which is at x ≈ 3.831. So the second minimum would be at x=3.831, because the central maximum is between x=0 to x= the first zero. So the first minimum is at x=3.831, and the next minimum is higher. Wait, no, J1 has its zeros at x=3.8317, 7.0156, etc. So the first minimum in the Airy pattern is at x=3.8317. The next minima would be at higher x values. But in terms of theta, each minima is at theta_m where (pi/a) sin(theta) = x_m, where x_m are the zeros of J1.

Wait, but in the far field, the intensity is given by I = I_0 ( J_0 ( (pi/a) sin(theta) ) )^2. The minima occur where J_0 (pi a sin(theta)/lambda ) = 0, right? Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the single-slit case. But wait, the problem states that the shape is a polygon with N sides, and N approaches infinity, so the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk.

Wait, but in the Airy disk, the first minima (the ones just outside the central bright spot) are at theta = 1.22 lambda/(2a) because the diameter is 2a. So theta ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Hmm, but in the Airy disk, the first minimum is at about 1.22 lambda/(2a) (0.61 lambda/a) and the next minima are spaced further apart. The zeros of J_0 (x) occur at x ≈ 2.4048, 5.5201, 8.6537, etc. So the second zero is at about 5.5201. So the second minimum would be at x=5.5201, so theta = (5.5201 * lambda)/(pi a). Wait, because I think the formula is (pi a sin(theta))/lambda = x. So sin(theta) = (x lambda)/(pi a). For small angles, sin(theta) ≈ theta, so theta ≈ x lambda/(pi a).

So for the first minimum, x=2.4048 (the first zero of J0), so theta_1 ≈ 2.4048 * lambda/(pi a) ≈ (2.4048 / 3.1416) lambda/a ≈ 0.766 lambda/a.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting conflicting information. Because I thought the first minimum in the Airy disk was at 1.22 lambda/(diameter), which is 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the Bessel functions. Let me think again. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is given by I = I_0 (J_0 ( (pi/a) sin(theta) ) )^2. The zeros of J_0 are at x=2.4048, 5.5201, etc. So the first minima (excluding the central maximum) occur at (pi/a) sin(theta) = 2.4048, so theta ≈ 2.4048 * a / pi.

Wait, no, because sin(theta) = (x a)/lambda, where x is 2.4048. So for small angles, theta ≈ (2.4048 a)/(lambda pi). So theta is about 0.766 * (lambda/a), because 2.4048/(pi) is approximately 0.766.

Wait, but wait, that's different from the 1.22 number I was thinking earlier. Did I get the Bessel function wrong? Because I thought the first minimum was at 1.22 lambda/(diameter), but perhaps that's for a single slit which uses J1's zeros, not J0.

Wait, for a single slit, the intensity is based on J1. The minima are when J1(k a sin theta) = 0, where k=2pi/lambda. The first zero is at x=3.8317, so a sin theta = (3.8317 lambda)/(pi) → sin(theta) ≈ (3.8317 lambda)/(pi a). So theta ≈ (3.8317/(pi)) (lambda/a) ≈ (1.22) (lambda/a).

Ah, that's where the 1.22 comes from in single-slit diffraction. So the first minimum in single-slit is at 1.22 lambda/(a), and the next at about 2.45 lambda/(a), etc.

But for the circular aperture, the formula is based on J0, so the first minimum is when (pi a sin theta)/lambda = 2.4048 → sin(theta) ≈ 2.4048 * a * lambda^{-1} → theta ≈ 2.4048 (a) / (lambda) * (1/ pi) → 2.4048/(pi) ≈ 0.766, so theta ≈ 0.766 lambda/a. But wait, wait no, because the formula is (pi a sin theta)/lambda = x.

Wait, let me get this straight:

For the circular aperture, the intensity is I = I_0 ( J_0 ( (pi a sin theta)/lambda ) )^2.

The minima occur when J_0 ( (pi a sin theta)/lambda ) = 0.

The zeros of J_0 are at x = 2.4048, 5.5201, 8.6537 etc.

So for the first minimum (after the central maximum), (pi a sin theta)/lambda = 2.4048 → sin theta = (2.4048 lambda)/(pi a).

So theta ≈ (2.4048 lambda)/(pi a) ≈ (0.766) (lambda/a).

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima.

Wait, but the first minima (the first one after the central maximum) occurs at x=2.4048, and the second minima would be at x=5.5201. So the angular positions are theta_1 = 2.4048 * (lambda)/(pi a), theta_2 =5.5201 * (lambda)/(pi a). So the difference is (5.5201 - 2.4048) * lambda/(pi a) ≈ 3.1153 * lambda/(pi a) ≈ 0.992 lambda/a.

Wait, but that's the angular distance between the first and second minima. The question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, but in the Airy pattern, the first minimum is the first one after the central maximum. So the first two minima are at theta_1 and theta_2, which are the first and second zeros. So the angular distance would be theta_2 - theta_1.

So theta_2 - theta_1 = (5.5201 - 2.4048) * (lambda)/(pi a) ≈ 3.1153 * (lambda)/(pi a) ≈ 0.992 * (lambda/a).

But looking at the options, none of them are close to 0.992 lambda/a. The options are A: ~0.610, B:0.5, C:1.22, D:0.506.

But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach. The problem says that the polygon's N is infinitely large. So the shape is a circle. But perhaps the question isn't considering the Airy pattern but a different scenario.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Maybe I'm confusing the term "apothem". For a regular polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. But if the polygon becomes a circle as N approaches infinity, then the apothem 'a' would be the radius of the circle. So the diameter is 2a.

In that case, the formula for the first minima in the Airy pattern is theta = 1.22 lambda/d, where d is the diameter. So theta = 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a.

Wait, but the options have option C as 1.220 lambda/a. So that would be if d is the radius, but that doesn't make sense. Because the diameter is twice the apothem.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to treat it as a single slit. But no, because the shape is a polygon.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. When N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle. So the diffraction pattern is the Airy disk. The first minimum is at 1.22 λ/(diameter) = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. Wait, no, wait. The first two minima would be the first and second minima, which are at 1.22 λ/(d) and 2.45 λ/(d), perhaps.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check. The first minimum is at x=3.8317 in J1. Wait, J1 is for the single-slit, but for the circular aperture, it's J0. So in the circular case, the first minima are at x=2.4048, next at x=5.5201, etc. So the difference in x between first and second minima is 5.5201 - 2.4048 = 3.1153.

So theta_1 = 2.4048 * lambda/(pi a)

theta_2 =5.5201 * lambda/(pi a)

delta_theta = (5.5201 -2.4048) * lambda/(pi a) ≈ 3.1153 * lambda/(pi a) ≈ (3.1153/3.1416) lambda/a ≈ 0.992 * lambda/a.

But none of the options match that. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the Airy pattern but is treating the polygon as a single slit. Because for a single slit, the minima are at theta = m lambda/(a), m=1,2,... The first two minima are at m=1 and m=2. The angular distance is theta_2 - theta_1 = (2 lambda/a) - (lambda/a) = lambda/a.

But that's not one of the options either. But wait, the options have option C as 1.220 λ/a.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the Airy pattern but about a polygon acting as a multi-slit or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in considering the correct approach.

Wait, let's think differently. The problem says all apothems are the same. So when N approaches infinity, the shape becomes a circle. But if the apothem is 'a', then the radius is 'a' because the apothem in a regular polygon is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So, for a polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' is the radius of the inscribed circle.

Wait no, wait. For a regular polygon, the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle, which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius of the circumscribed circle (distance from center to a vertex) is R = a / cos(pi/N).

So as N approaches infinity, cos(pi/N) approaches 1, so R = a. So the radius of the polygon approaches 'a' when N is very large, making it a circle. So the diameter is 2a.

But wait, in the problem statement, the apothems are all of length 'a', so for the polygon, the apothem is 'a', which for the circle would be the radius. So, the radius is 'a', diameter is 2a.

So for the Airy pattern, the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 λ/(2a) ≈ 0.61 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first minimum is at m=1, then the second is at m=2? No, because in the Airy pattern, the minima are not equally spaced in theta. So the first two minima would be the first and the second zeros of J0, which are at 2.4048 and 5.5201. The difference is about 3.1153, which as I calculated earlier gives theta difference of about 0.992 λ/a.

But this isn't matching any of the options. So perhaps the initial assumption that the problem is about the Airy pattern is incorrect. Maybe the problem is treating it as a single-slit scenario, which would give a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps the polygon's apertures create something like a single slit with width 2a, leading to the first minima at lambda/(2a), so the angular separation would be lambda/(2a) for the first minima? No, wait, in the single slit, the first minima is at m=1, so lambda/(a) for the first minima? Wait, no, the formula is a sin(theta)=m lambda. So for m=1, theta = arcsin( lambda/(a) ). For small angles, that's approximately lambda/a. So the first minima at m=1 is lambda/a, and m=2 is 2 lambda/a. The angular separation between them would be lambda/a. But again, none of the options match.

But the options include 1.220 λ/a, which is the first minimum in the Airy pattern if you use the diameter as 2a, so 1.22 λ/(2a) is 0.61 λ/a. But that's just the first minimum.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the distance between the first two minima, but the position of the first minimum. Because I think the only option close to the first minimum in the Airy pattern is option C, which is 1.220 λ/a. But wait, no, because for a first minimum, the formula is θ ≈ 1.22 λ/(diameter) = 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a. So option A is 0.610 λ/a.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first minimum is at 0.61 lambda/a, and the next is at, say, twice that, then the distance would be 0.61 lambda/a. But that's just the difference between m=1 and m=2 in single-slit, but we know that in Airy, the spacing isn't the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question says that the related angles are small, so tan(theta) = theta. So perhaps the approach is to model the polygon as a single slit with width equal to the diameter of the circle, which is 2a. But that would imply the first minimum is at theta = (1.22 lambda)/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima, which would be the same as the first minimum's angle if the next is at 2.4048 * lambda/(pi a), which is about 0.766 * lambda/a. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the polygon creates a multi-slit interference? No, I think that's not the case here. The problem is about diffraction, not interference.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit, leading to minima at theta = m λ/(a), and the first two minima are m=1 and m=2, giving a separation of λ/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem as a circular aperture, and the first two minima are the first and second zeros of J0. The first minima is at theta_1 = 2.4048 * lambda/(pi a), and the second at theta_2 =5.5201 * lambda/(pi a). The difference is theta_2-theta_1 = (5.5201 -2.4048)*lambda/(pi a) =3.1153 * lambda/(pi a) ≈ (approx 3.1153/3.1416) ≈ 0.992 λ/a. But this isn't one of the options. So perhaps the problem isn't considering the second minima. Or perhaps I'm missing a point.

Wait, the problem states that when N is infinitely large, the shape is a circle. But perhaps the formula for the minima is different. Maybe the problem is considering the first minimum as 1.22 lambda/(a), not diameter. Because if the apothem is a, the radius is a, but perhaps the problem is mistakenly using a as the diameter. So if the diameter is a, then the first minimum would be 1.22 lambda/a. So option C is 1.220 lambda/a. But why would the problem use a as the diameter? Because the apothem is a, which is the radius. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the problem as a single-slit case. The first minima occur at theta = m lambda / a, m=1,2,... The angular distance between first two minima would be (2 lambda/a) - (lambda/a) )= lambda/a. But none of the options match.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not about the circular case but a polygon with a certain number of sides. But since N is infinitely large, perhaps it's treated as a circle. So, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the first minimum in the Airy pattern, which is 1.22 lambda/(diameter) = 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima. Wait, perhaps the first two minima are the first and second zeros of J1, but that's for single-slit, not circular. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the single-slit formula, leading to the angular separation being lambda/a, but again, no option matches.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a collection of slits, leading to a scenario similar to multiple slits. But I think that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the polygon acting as a single slit, where the width is the distance between the two opposite sides, which for a regular polygon is 2a * cot(pi/(2N)). As N approaches infinity, cot(pi/(2N)) approaches 2N/(pi), but that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the width of the polygon as N approaches infinity is 2a, so the first minima is at 1.22 lambda/(2a) =0.61 lambda/a.

But the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So if the first minima is at 0.61 lambda/a and the second at 2.4048 * lambda/(pi a) ≈ 0.766 lambda/a, the difference would be 0.156 lambda/a, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit with width equal to the length of one side, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the polygon's apertures are arranged such that each side is a slit, and the overall pattern is similar to a multi-slit. But for a large N, this would approximate a continuous distribution, leading to a sinc function squared pattern, which is the Airy disk.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. Option C is 1.220 lambda/a. I remember that in the single-slit case, the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/a (no, wait, no, the single-slit first minimum is at m lambda/(a) = 1 lambda/a, which is approx 3.1416 lambda/(2a), but no, not exactly).

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, so the first minimum is at 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a, but the distance to the next minima would be 0.61 lambda/a again. So the angular distance between the first two minima would be 0.61 lambda/a. So option A is 0.610 lambda/a.

But earlier, I thought that the first two minima in the Airy pattern are not equally spaced, and their difference is about 0.992 lambda/a. But perhaps the problem is oversimplified and assumes the minima are equally spaced, as in the single-slit case.

Wait, but the problem says 'angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large'. If N is large, the polygon becomes a circle, leading to the Airy pattern. But in the Airy pattern, the first minima is at 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a. The next minima are at higher angles, but their spacing isn't uniform.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', leading to first minima at lambda/(a), but that's not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering the polygon's N, but using the fact that for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at theta = 1.22 lambda/(2a). So the angular distance between the first and second minima, or perhaps the angular distance to the first minimum, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the first diffraction minimum when the polygon becomes a circle, which is at theta = 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a, which is option A. But the question is about the distance between the first two minima. So if the first is at 0.61 and the second at 1.22, the difference would be 0.61. That would make option A the correct answer.

Wait, but wait, in the Airy pattern, the first minima after the central maximum is at 1.22 lambda/(diameter), and the next minima would be at higher multiples, but not exactly double. So perhaps the problem is considering the first two minima as the first and second, which are 1.22 lambda/(d) and 2.45 lambda/(d), etc.

Wait, but if we think of the first minima as m=1, the next minima would be m=2. So for a circular aperture, the formula is theta_m = (x_m lambda) / (pi a), where x_m is the m-th zero of J_0. So for m=1, x_1=2.4048, theta_1=2.4048 * lambda/(pi a) ≈ 0.766 lambda/a. For m=2, x_2=5.5201, theta_2=5.5201 * lambda/(pi a) ≈ 1.758 lambda/a. So the angular distance is theta_2 - theta_1 ≈ 1.758-0.766 ≈ 0.992 lambda/a. But this isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is asking for the first minima, not the first two. But the question clearly states the first two minima. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single-slit, leading to the first minima at lambda/(a), and the second at 2 lambda/(a), so the distance is lambda/a. But that's not an option. The options are A) 0.610, B) 0.5, C) 1.220, D)0.506.

Wait, perhaps the polygon is considered as a rectangular aperture, but that's different from the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first minima as 1.22 lambda/(a), assuming a is the radius, so the diameter is 2a. So the first minima is at 1.22 lambda/(2a) = 0.61 lambda/a, which is option A. But then the distance between first and second minima is another issue.

Wait, perhaps the options are considering the first minima after the central maximum, which is at 0.61 lambda/a, and the next minima would be at higher angles, but perhaps the problem is only asking for the position of the first minima, not the distance between them. But the question is explicit about the distance between the first two minima.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', leading to the first minima at lambda/(a), but the angular distance between the first two minima being lambda/(a), but that's not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the formula for the first dark fringe in a single-slit as 1.22 lambda/(a), where 'a' is the width of the slit. So the first minima is at 1.22 lambda/a. Then the next minima would be at 2.45 lambda/a, so the angular separation is 2.45 -1.22 = 1.23 lambda/a. But that's not an option either.

Wait, but option C is 1.22 lambda/a. So perhaps the question is about the position of the first minima, not the separation between the first two.

But the question says, "angular distance between the first two minima".

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the circular case but considering the polygon as a single slit, leading to minima at theta = m lambda/(a), m=1,2,... So the first two minima are at m=1 and m=2. The separation is (2 lambda/a) - (lambda/a) )= lambda/a. But that's not an option. So perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 2a, making the first minima at lambda/(2a). Then the separation between m=1 and m=2 would be (2 lambda/(2a)) - (lambda/(2a)) )= lambda/(2a). So the separation is 0.5 lambda/a, which is option B.

But why would the polygon's width be 2a? Because the apothem is a. For a regular polygon, the width (distance between opposite sides) is 2a * cot(pi/(2N)). As N approaches infinity, cot(pi/(2N)) ≈ (2N/(pi)) → infinity. But that can't be right because the apothem is fixed at 'a'. So perhaps the width approaches 2a as N increases. So for a polygon with N approaching infinity, the width is 2a.

So, if the slit width is 2a, then the first minima is at theta= (lambda)/(2a), and the next at theta=2 lambda/(2a)= lambda/a. The angular separation is lambda/a - lambda/(2a) = lambda/(2a), which is 0.5 lambda/a, option B.

Ah! That makes sense. So the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit with width 2a, and the first two minima are at m=1 and m=2. The separation is lambda/(2a) which is option B.

Wait, but no, because in the single-slit case, the formula is a sin(theta) = m lambda. So for width a, m=1 → sin(theta) = lambda/a. But in this case, if the width is 2a, then for m=1 → sin(theta) = lambda/(2a), and m=2 → lambda/a. So the separation is lambda/(2a), which is 0.5 lambda/a, option B.

But wait, the problem states that the apothems are all length 'a'. For a polygon, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So for a regular polygon, the width (the distance between two opposite sides) is 2a. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a rectangle with width 2a and height approaching zero, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the polygon becomes a circle with radius 'a', so the diameter is 2a.

So, if the polygon's width is 2a, as N approaches infinity, then the single-slit formula would apply, and the angular separation between the first two minima would be lambda/(2a), which is option B.

So, putting it all together, the answer would be option B: 0.500 lambda/a.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the Airy pattern, the first minimum is at 0.61 lambda/a, and the second at higher angles, but the angular separation isn't 0.5 lambda/a.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', leading to the first minima at lambda/a, and the separation between m=1 and m=2 being lambda/a. But that's not an option.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me recap:

- Apothem is 'a' for the polygon, which becomes a circle with radius 'a' when N is very large.

- For a circular aperture, the first minima in the Airy pattern is at theta ≈ 1.22 λ/(2a) = 0.61 λ/a.

- The second minima is at a higher angle, leading to an angular separation of about 0.992 λ/a, but this isn't an option.

But the options include option C as 1.220 λ/a, which would be the angle if we used the diameter as 'a' instead of 2a. That would be a mistake, perhaps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the polygon as a single slit of width 'a', leading to the first minima at theta = lambda/a. But that would mean the separation between the first two minima is lambda/a, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula for the polygon. The apothem is 'a', so the radius is 'a' (as N approaches infinity). So the diameter is 2a. So in the single-slit case, the width is 2a, leading to the first minima at theta = (lambda)/(2a), and the second at theta= (2 lambda)/(2a) = lambda/a. The separation is (lambda/a - lambda/(2a)) = lambda/(2a) = 0.5 λ/a, which is option B.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option B) 0.500 λ/a.


The problem involves a monochromatic light source shining vertically through an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, where all apothems are of length \(a\). As \(N\) approaches infinity, the aperture becomes circular, and the diffraction pattern is governed by the Airy disk. The task is to determine the angular distance between the first two minima in the far-field diffraction pattern.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Polygon to Circle Transition**:  
   When \(N\) is infinitely large, the polygon becomes a circle. The apothem \(a\) corresponds to the radius of the circle, making the diameter \(2a\).

2. **Diffraction Minima for Circular Aperture (Airy Disk)**:  
   The minima in the Airy disk occur where the Bessel function \(J_0\) has zeros. The first two zeros of \(J_0\) are at \(x_1 = 2.4048\) and \(x_2 = 5.5201\). The angular positions of the minima are given by:  
   \[
   \theta_m = \frac{x_m \lambda}{\pi a}
   \]  
   For the first minimum (\(m=1\)):  
   \[
   \theta_1 = \frac{2.4048 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 0.766 \frac{\lambda}{a}
   \]  
   For the second minimum (\(m=2\)):  
   \[
   \theta_2 = \frac{5.5201 \lambda}{\pi a} \approx 1.758 \frac{\lambda}{a}
   \]  
   The angular distance between the first two minima is:  
   \[
   \Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = 1.758 \frac{\lambda}{a} - 0.766 \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.992 \frac{\lambda}{a}
   \]  
   However, this value does not match any of the provided options.

3. **Alternative Interpretation as Single Slit**:  
   If the polygon is approximated as a single slit with width \(2a\) (the diameter of the circle), the diffraction minima are given by:  
   \[
   a \sin \theta = m \lambda, \quad m = 1, 2, \dots
   \]  
   For the first minimum (\(m=1\)):  
   \[
   \sin \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{2a}, \quad \theta_1 \approx \frac{\lambda}{2a}
   \]  
   For the second minimum (\(m=2\)):  
   \[
   \sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{2a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{\lambda}{a}
   \]  
   The angular distance between the first two minima is:  
   \[
   \Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{a} - \frac{\lambda}{2a} = \frac{\lambda}{2a}
   \]  
   This matches **option B**.

4. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(0.610 \lambda / a\))**: This corresponds to the first minimum in the Airy pattern if the diameter is incorrectly taken as \(a\) instead of \(2a\).  
   - **Option B (\(0.500 \lambda / a\))**: Matches the angular separation between the first two minima when the aperture is treated as a single slit of width \(2a\).  
   - **Option C (\(1.220 \lambda / a\))**: This is the first minimum in the Airy pattern if the diameter is \(a\), which is incorrect.  
   - **Option D (\(0.506 \lambda / a\))**: This does not correspond to any standard diffraction result.

### Conclusion:  
The problem likely assumes the polygon is approximated as a single slit with width \(2a\), leading to the angular distance between the first two minima being \(\frac{\lambda}{2a}\). This corresponds to **option B**.
