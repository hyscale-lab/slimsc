Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically optical isomerism. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? That usually means they have chiral centers. Oh wait, or maybe they have some sort of stereogenic element like a plane or axis? But chiral centers are the main thing I remember.

The question asks which of the four compounds show optical isomerism. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl means two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions. Wait, but does this create a chiral center? Or maybe it's about the possibility of the molecule being asymmetric.

Looking at the structure: Each benzene ring has substituents. The 1,1' bond is a single bond, which allows for rotation. So, in 1,1'-biphenyl, the two rings are connected directly. The substituents are 2,2' and 6,6', so each ring has two substituents. Let me imagine the structure. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'.

Wait, but can the molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the substituents are opposite each other, maybe. Let me think about the positions. Each benzene ring has a nitro group and a carboxylate ester. Wait, 2 and 6 are adjacent on a benzene ring? No, wait, benzene is a hexagon, so positions 2 and 6 are across the ring from each other. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2? Wait, but the substituents are on each ring, so for biphenyl, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester. So the arrangement would be that each ring has a nitro and an ester group opposite each other.

Wait, would that make the molecule symmetric? Because if each ring has the same substituents, maybe the whole molecule is symmetric. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that create a chiral axis or something else
