Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question asks for the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. The options are given in terms of E, where E is pi²ħ²/(2mL²). I remember that for a single particle in such a well, the energy levels are quantized and given by E_n = (n² * E), where n is the principal quantum number. So for each particle, the energy depends on the square of its quantum number.

But wait, these are four identical spin-1/2 particles. Oh right, identical particles obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that no two identical fermions can occupy the same quantum state. So each particle must have a unique set of quantum numbers, considering their spin as well. 

Each particle has spin-1/2, so the possible spin states are spin-up and spin-down. That means each spatial state can hold two particles with opposite spins. So when filling up the energy levels, each energy level (same n) can have a maximum of two particles—one with spin up and one with spin down.

But wait, the system is four particles, so I need to figure out how their quantum numbers are arranged to minimize the total energy (ground state), and then the next possible arrangements for first and second excited states.

Let me think about the ground state first. In the ground state, the particles will occupy the lowest possible energy levels. Since each level can hold two particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) can each hold two particles.

Wait no, wait. Because each n level can hold two particles, so for four particles, the first two levels (n=1 and n=2) will each have two particles. So all four are filled up to n=2. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 (spin up and down) and two in n=2 (spin up and down). 

So the ground state energy would be the sum of the energies of each particle. Each particle in n=1 contributes E*(1²) = E, and each in n=2 contributes E*(2²) =4E. So with two particles in each, the total energy is 2*E + 2*(4E) = 2E +8E =10E. Wait, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm miscalculating. Because each particle in a state contributes their own energy. So if two particles are in n=1, each with energy E, so 2*E. And two in n=2, each with 4E, so 2*4E=8E. The total is 2E +8E=10E. So ground state energy is 10E. But looking at the options, let me check.

Wait the options for the ground state: option A says 30E, B is 4E, C is 4E, D is 10E.
