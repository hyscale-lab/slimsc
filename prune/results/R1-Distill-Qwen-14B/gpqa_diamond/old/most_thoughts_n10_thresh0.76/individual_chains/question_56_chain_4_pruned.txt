Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and dipole transitions, and I'm a bit new to this. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in such transitions, certain selection rules apply. I think for hydrogen, the dipole selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. So the angular momentum quantum number l changes by one unit, and m can change by -1, 0, or +1.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0 (since it's s orbital). It needs to go down to n=1, l=0 again. But since it's a two-step process, it must transition through an intermediate state.

First, let's consider the possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩. The next n can be 2 or 1, but since it's two steps, the first transition is likely from 3 to 2.

Wait, but l is 0 for n=3. So the first transition should change l by ±1. So from l=0, it can go to l=1. So the possible states after first transition would be |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1.

So the first transition is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1, m⟩. The m can be -1,0, or +1.

Then, the second transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Let's see the selection rules again. For the next step, l must change by ±1. So from l=1, it can go to l=0 or l=2. But the target is l=0, so that's allowed.

So the second transition's m must change by 0, ±1. So from m in the |2,1,m⟩ state, the next m can be m±1 or same.

Wait, the target is |1,0,0⟩, which has m=0. So the second transition must have m go from whatever to 0.

So let's think about the possible paths.

First transition: from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1, m1⟩. m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

Second transition: |2,1, m1⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

For the second transition, m1 must change to 0. So m1 can be -1, 0, or +1, but what's allowed?

The selection for m is Δm = 0, ±1. So for each possible m1, can it reach m=0?

If m1 is 0, then Δm=0 is allowed (0→0). If m1 is +1, then Δm can be -1 (so m becomes 0). If m1 is -1, then Δm could be +1 to reach 0. So in all cases, it's possible.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩.

Now, how about the probabilities? The question says the transition occurs via two dipole transitions, and the options give different probabilities.

Wait, I think the number of possible ways the transitions can happen affects the probability. Because each transition's probability depends on the matrix element and the possible m transitions.

Hmm, but maybe I should think about the transition rates. Each dipole transition has certain allowed m changes, and the total probability is the sum of all possible paths.

Wait, but the initial state is |3,0,0⟩ (so m=0, l=0). The first transition goes to |2,1,m⟩. The possible m's are -1, 0, +1. But what are the probabilities for each of these?

I remember that for dipole transitions, the transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element, which depends on the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients or spherical harmonics overlap. But I'm not sure about the exact expressions.

Alternatively, maybe the number of possible m transitions contributes to the total probability. Let me think: each m in the first step can lead to a certain number of m's in the second step.

Let me see, the first transition: from m=0 in n=3, l=0 to m1 in n=2, l=1. The possible m1 are -1, 0, +1. The number of possible ways to get each m1 would depend on the matrix elements, but perhaps for each possible m1, the probability is the same. So each of the three m1 options has equal probability.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe the matrix elements have different magnitudes. Alternatively, perhaps the
