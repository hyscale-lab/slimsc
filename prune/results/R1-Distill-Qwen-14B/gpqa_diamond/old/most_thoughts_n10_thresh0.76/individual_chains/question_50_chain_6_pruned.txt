Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that a colleague has a Feynman diagram with some scribbled terms next to it: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. They're asking how many loops the diagram has. The options are A)6, B)2, C)1, D)3.

Wait, I remember that the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the superficial degree of divergence and the powers of certain constants in the expression. Each loop typically contributes factors like 4π, maybe some other constants, and the energy scales.

Let me recall: the general formula for the superficial degree of divergence (SDD) in a Feynman diagram is D = 4 - L*(d-2), where L is the number of loops and d is the space-time dimension. Wait, no, I think that's another approach. Alternatively, each loop in a Feynman diagram usually contributes a factor of 4π (from integrals in the loop calculations) and some other factors from the propagators and vertices. Also, each loop adds a certain power to the overall expression.

Looking at the given term: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2.

I think alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e^2/(4πε_0) or something like that in natural units. But in terms of scaling, each photon propagator or vertex might give a certain factor. But more importantly, the 1/(4π)^something part is probably related to loop integrals.

Wait, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (4πε)^something, but when regularized, it becomes 1/(16π^2) for each loop in a typical loop integral. Or wait, is it 4π? Let me think. In dimensional regularization, the loop integrals give factors of (4π)^{(d/2 - n)}, but perhaps in other regularizations, like cutoff or Pauli-Villars, the factors might differ.

Wait, a common loop integral I remember is for a one
