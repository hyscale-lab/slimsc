Okay, so I have this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the setup is that there's a star with 1.5 times the Sun's radius. There's a planet (Planet A) with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around it. The transit impact parameter is 0.2, and the orbital period is 3 days. Now, there's a second planet (Planet B) with a radius 2.5 times Earth's. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets have circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm, transit and occultation events. I remember that a transit happens when a planet passes in front of the star from our viewpoint, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet moves behind the star, and we lose the planet's reflected light. For both to happen, the planet's orbital period must be such that both events are observable.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect whether these events occur? I think the key is the orbital distance. The closer a planet is to the star, the shorter its orbital period. So if Planet B is farther out, it will have a longer period than Planet A (which is 3 days). But why is there a maximum period?

Oh, right. For a planet to transit, its orbit must be aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The transit's occurrence depends on the alignment of the orbital plane with our line of sight. But in this problem, both planets share the same orbital plane, so alignment isn't an issue for transits beyond the initial condition.

Wait, but the problem says that Planet B will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So when would occultation happen? Occultation occurs when the planet moves behind the star. So from our perspective, the planet must be in a position where it can go behind the star. That depends on the orbital distance relative to the star's size and the planet's orbital period.

Wait, but how does the orbital period affect whether occultation is possible? Hmm. Maybe I'm mixing up some concepts. Let me think. For a planet to be occulted, it must pass behind the star. But if the planet's orbital period is such that it moves too quickly, perhaps the alignment for transit and occultation would be too rapid. Alternatively, maybe the key is that for both events to occur, the planet must have an orbital period that allows it to return to the same position relative to the star within a certain time frame.

Wait, maybe it's more about the relative sizes of the star and the planets, and the orbital parameters. Let me try to break it down.

First, let me note down the given data:

- Star radius (Rstar) = 1.5 * R_sun
- Planet A radius (R_A) = 1 * R_earth
- Planet B radius (R_B) = 2.5 * R_earth
- Planet A's orbital period (P_A) = 3 days.

We need to find the maximum possible orbital period P_B of Planet B such that it transits and occults.

Wait, but transit and occultation events for Planet B.
