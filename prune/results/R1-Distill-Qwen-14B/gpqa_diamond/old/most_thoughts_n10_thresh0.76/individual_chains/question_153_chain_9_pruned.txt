Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the Michael addition, which I remember involves enolates attacking another carbonyl compound. 

So the problem has three separate reactions labeled A, B, and C, and I need to match each with the correct products from the options given. Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate is reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). From what I recall, NaOEt is a strong base and a good nucleophile. Since it's in EtOH, which is a polar aprotic solvent, but wait, no, EtOH is actually a protic solvent. Oh wait, sodium ethoxide is a strong base, so it will deprotonate the alpha carbon of the malonate to form an enolate. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is (CH3)2C(COOEt)2. When deprotonated, the enolate will form at the central carbon because malonate has two alpha protons (on each of the methyl groups attached to the central carbon). The enolate will attack the beta position of the other carbonyl compound, which is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of that would be CH2=CH-p-tolyl, but with a methyl ester on the carbonyl. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOOEt. Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-COOEt. But in this case, it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOEt? Or wait, maybe the structure is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Hmm, perhaps it's more accurately CH2=CH-p-tolyl with a carbonyl group. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate
