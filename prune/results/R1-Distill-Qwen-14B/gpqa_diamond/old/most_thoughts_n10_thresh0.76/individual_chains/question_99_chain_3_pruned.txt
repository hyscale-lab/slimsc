Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify an unknown organic compound based on its IR and NMR spectra. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR typically indicate O-H stretching, especially for alcohols or carboxylic acids. Since the peak is very broad, that probably points to a carboxylic acid because their O-H stretches are usually broader and around that region. The other strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ is likely a carbonyl group (C=O). Carboxylic acids have a strong C=O peak around 1700, so that fits with the O-H data. So the compound probably has a carboxylic acid group.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the signals correspond to vinyl hydrogens. So, there are no double bonds (since vinyl refers to =CH2 groups), which means the molecule is either fully saturated or has no such groups. So all the structures we're considering shouldn't have any double bonds.

The NMR has several signals. One of them is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex splitting, so the hydrogens in those environments must be coupling with multiple sets of neighboring protons.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
Option B: CH3CH2C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)COOH
Option C: CH3C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)CH2COOH
Option D: CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH

Wait, the compounds are all similar in structure. Let me draw them mentally.

Option A: It seems like the central part is a C connected to two CH2CH3 groups, then a CH2 connected to the COOH. So the structure would be something like:

CH2CH3
   \
C - C
   / 
CH2CH3

But wait, the way it's written, maybe it's a central carbon connected to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH.

Wait, for each option, the main chain might be different. Let me try to parse the structures.

Option D: The formula is CH3CH2C(H)(CH3)C(H)(CH3)COOH. So that would be:

The central part is two substituted CH groups. Let's see: the molecule would have a structure like CH2CH2-C(H)(CH3)-C(H)(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The central chain is two carbons, each attached to a CH3 and another group. So maybe it's CH3CH2-C(CH3)(something)-C(CH3)(something else)-COOH? Wait, perhaps a more accurate way is to break it down.

Let me think
