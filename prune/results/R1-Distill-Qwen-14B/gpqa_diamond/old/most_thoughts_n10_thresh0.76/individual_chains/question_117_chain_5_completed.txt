Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism... I remember that's when a compound can rotate plane-polarized light because it has chiral centers. Oh right, a chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So if a compound has such a center, it can have enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. Those enantiomers would be optical isomers.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which show optical isomerism. The options are combinations of these four. Let me think about each one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyl structures can sometimes have stereoisomerism. The substituents on the benzene rings might create some kind of asymmetry. Wait, the biphenyl has substituents at positions 2 and 6 on each ring. The structure is [1,1'-biphenyl], so the two benzene rings are connected at carbon 1 of each. The substituents are nitro groups at 6 and 6' positions, and carboxylate esters (dimethyl) at 2 and 2'. Do those substituents create any chiral centers? Wait, if the biphenyl has substituents in a way that makes the central structure asymmetric, maybe. Alternatively, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, but I'm not sure. Wait, the positions 2 and 6 are para to each other on each benzene ring. So if the substituents are symmetrically placed, maybe there's no chirality. Alternatively, if the substituents are on opposite sides of the biphenyl, creating a situation where the entire molecule is chiral. Oh, wait, biphenyls with substituents can sometimes exhibit atropisomerism. Atropisomers are a type of stereoisomerism where the rotation around the central bond is restricted. So if the substituents are large enough, they can't rotate freely, leading to different isomers. In this case, the substituents are nitro and ester groups which are big. So the molecule might have atropisomers, which are a form of stereoisomer. But optical isomerism specifically refers to compounds with chiral centers, right? Wait, no, atropisomerism is a type of stereoisomerism but does it lead to optical activity? I think atropisomers can show optical isomerism if the structure is chiral. So this compound might exhibit optical isomerism due to restricted rotation around the biphenyl axis, leading to a chiral structure. So 1 might show optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let me draw the structure. 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the structure OMe-O-CO-CH(CH3)-OH? Wait, wait. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. But as the methyl ester, it would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO- but 2-hydroxy would be the middle carbon. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. So the carbon structure is:

O
|
O=C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)-CH3

Wait, the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to what? Let's see: the carbon is attached to:

- OH group,
- CH3 (from the propanoate),
- COOCH3 group,
- and the other CH3 (from the CH2 group? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate is: the propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but the 2 position is the middle carbon. So structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? No, wait, that's 1-hydroxypropanoate. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. The 2nd carbon is the middle one. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO- as the acid, and the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure would be:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3

Wait, but that's a straight chain. Alternatively, the structure is:

H
|
C-OH
|
CH2-COOCH3

Wait, I think I might be mixing up the structures. Alternatively, maybe the structure is more like:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3 group,
- two CH2 groups? No, wait. Let me make it clear. The molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the central carbon.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-H-COOCH3 ?

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is three carbons. The first is COOCH3, then two more. So the structure is CH2CH(OH)COOCH3? No, wait, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps I should write the structure step by step.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the methyl ester is CH2CH2COOCH3.

2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the molecule would have the structure:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Now, looking at the central carbon (the one with OH). Wait, is that carbon a chiral center? Let's see. The central carbon is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2CH2COOCH3? No, wait, the central carbon is CH2? Let me draw it:

The molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

COOCH3 is the first carbon (carbonyl), then the second carbon is CH2, then the third is CH2(OH).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, propanoate is three carbons, so it's:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (carbonyl group, first carbon)
|
CH2 (second carbon)
|
CH2OH (third carbon)

No, that's 3-hydroxypropanoate. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon.

So the structure is:

COOCH3 (C1)
|
CH(OH) (C2)
|
CH3 (C3)

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be the middle CH2 becomes CH(OH). So:

C1: COOCH3
C2: CH(OH)
C3: CH3

So the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

So the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- CH3,
- OH,
- and the other CH2 (but wait, where is that? Wait, no, I'm getting confused again. Let's think: the molecule is 2-hydroxypropanoate methyl ester. So propanoate is three carbons: CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy means the middle CH2 has an OH. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Ah, so the central carbon (the middle CH2) has:

- two CH2 groups,
- OH,
- and COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

So the middle CH2 is attached to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (left and right),
- and COOCH3.

Wait, that would make four substituents. So the middle carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3 (from the right),
- two CH2 groups (left and right? No, because it's CH2-OH-CH2-COOCH3?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3. So the middle carbon is the CH2. So each of the middle carbon's substituents are:

- one OH,
- two CH2 groups (no, wait, that can't be right because the middle carbon is connected to the CH2(OH) group on the left and the CH2(COOCH3) on the right. So the middle carbon is connected to:

CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3), and two hydrogens.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again. The molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

Carbon 1: COOCH3 (from the ester)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3
Carbon 3: CH2OH (since it's 2-hydroxy, the OH is on Carbon 2?)

Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Maybe the structure is:

COOCH3 is on Carbon 1.

Carbon 2 is CH2, connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3.

Carbon 3 is CH2OH.

So the molecule is:

COOCH3 - CH2 - CH2OH.

In that case, the middle carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (on either side),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's not possible because each carbon can only have four bonds. So Carbon 2 would have:

- one bond to COOCH3,
- two bonds to CH2 groups,
- and one bond to a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the structure would be:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-OH.

So the central carbon (Carbon 2) is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups (but each CH2 is a group, right? So Carbon 2 is connected to:

COOCH3, a CH2 group on the left, a CH2 group on the right, and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that would only be four substituents if the CH2 groups are considered as single substituents. Wait, no, each CH2 group is a substituent. So Carbon 2 is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- CH2-CH2-OH,
- and two hydrogens? No, that doesn't add up.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Let's imagine if the molecule has a chiral center. For that, a carbon must have four different substituents.

So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the middle carbon is CH2(OH), connected to another CH2, which is connected to COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH2(OH)) is attached to:

- OH,
- two CH2 groups (left and right),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no. Let me write it as:

The structure is: 

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (the one in the middle CH2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),
- CH2(COOCH3),
- and two hydrogens.

Wait, that can't be. Each carbon can't have more than four bonds. So the middle carbon has:

Left: CH2(OH),
Right: CH2(COOCH3),
And two H's.

Wait, but that would make four substituents: CH2(OH), CH2(COOCH3), and two H's. But then, are any of the substituents the same? Because if two substituents are the same, like two H's, then the carbon isn't a chiral center.

Ah, that's right. So in this case, the middle carbon has two H's attached. So the substituents are:

- CH2(OH),
- CH2(COOCH3),
- H,
- H.

So two substituents are the same (H and H). Therefore, the carbon can't be a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait. Is there another carbon that could be chiral?

Looking at the COOCH3 group: the carbonyl is connected to OCH3 and the rest. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it can't be a chiral center. The other carbons are the two CH2 groups. The terminal CH2OH has two H's, so not a chiral center.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have any chiral centers, hence no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait another thing: what about the possibility of the ester group creating a chiral center elsewhere?

Wait, the structure has three carbons: the first is CH2(OH), the second is CH2, the third is COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Maybe it's (CH3)CH(OH)COOCH3? No, that's not right because that would be 2-hydroxypropanoate only if it's (CH3)CH(OH)-.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think of the formula. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The formula would be C3H6O3.

Wait, if I draw it as:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (from the ester)
|
CH(OH)CH2-

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

COOCH3 is attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group. So the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH2) is connected to:

- CH2(OH),
- CH2(COOCH3),
- and two H's.

Thus, no chiral center there. Therefore, this compound doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait another thought. What if the structure is:

H
|
C(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

That would make the central carbon C(OH) connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two H's.

Again, two H's, so no chiral center.

So option 2 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)2CO. So two benzene rings attached to a ketone group. The central carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's a carbonyl. Since it's in a ketone, the carbonyl carbon is sp2 hybridized and can't be a chiral center. Moreover, the molecule is symmetric: the two benzene rings are identical and attached to the same carbon. So no chiral centers and no possibility of optical isomerism. So 3 doesn't show optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. It has the structure HO2CCH=CHCO2H. The dimethyl ester would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me.

Wait, fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So in the ester, the substituents on either side of the double bond are ester groups.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is E configuration. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2 (but in a trans configuration)
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no. Let me think again. Fumaric acid is trans-butenedioic acid, so the structure is:

HO2C-CH2-CH2-COOH (no, that's not right). Wait, but wait, no. Wait, butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH? No, but butenedioic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So fumaric acid is the trans isomer, which would have the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the dimethyl ester would be MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the groups across from each other.

Now, looking for possible stereoisomerism. The double bond is between the two carbons. Each of these carbons is connected to two methyl ester groups and a double bond. But wait, each of the double bond carbons is connected to two ester groups and the other double bond carbon.

Wait, in a double bond, each carbon is connected to two substituents and the double bond. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C = C
|
COOCH3

But wait, that can't be right because each double bond carbon would have three substituents—no, wait, each double bond carbon has two substituents. So:

Each of the double bond carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and another COOCH3? That doesn't make sense because then both substituents are the same.

Wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, but in the trans configuration. So when you make the dimethyl ester, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, and the substituents on each double bond carbon are MeO2C and H (from fumaric acid?), but wait, no. Wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So when esterified with methanol, both the -COOH groups become -COOCH3.

Wait, so the structure of dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the substituents on the double bond arranged trans.

So each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group on each end. But wait, that would be:

COOCH3
|
C
|
CH2
|
COOCH3

Wait, no, perhaps each double bond carbon is connected to two COOCH3 groups and a double bond.

Wait, no, each double bond carbon is connected to one COOCH3 group and another substituent. Wait, no, the structure is:

MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So each double bond carbon is connected to a COOCH3 group and another group. Wait, let me think again.

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 (group A) attached to CH2-CH2- (but in a double bond), so:

Structure: (MeO)C=CH-CH(CO2Me)=O?

No, wait, maybe I'm getting it wrong. The correct structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioate. So the dimethyl ester would be:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, but that's for maleate. Wait, no, no—wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH, but fumaric is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH. So dimethyl fumarate is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

So the double bond is between the two middle carbons. Each of those carbons has a COOCH3 group attached.

Wait, but each of those double bond carbons is connected to a COOCH3 group and another substituent. So each has:

- COOCH3,
- the double bond,
- and two substituents (but wait, in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other atoms.

Wait, no, in a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons (or substituents) via double bonds. So each of the double bond carbons in dimethyl fumarate is connected to:

- a COOCH3 group,
- a CH group,
- and the double bond.

Wait, no. Let me think in terms of substituents. Each double bond carbon has:

- one COOCH3 group,
- one H (but maybe not),
- and the other double bond carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key is whether the molecule has a chiral center or some kind of stereogenic element. Let's see.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two COOCH3 groups on either end, but in the trans configuration. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry? Let me think: if both substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, then the molecule might not have a chiral center. Wait, but in this case, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. Hmm, no, because in fumarate, each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group? No, wait, no. Wait, no, if it's dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

CH2-COOCH3
   ||
O=C-OCH3

Wait, no that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, that can't be right. I'm getting stuck, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Dimethyl fumarate has the structure (Z)- or (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans isomer, so (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's maleate. Wait, maleic acid is cis, fumaric is trans. So dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, but that's the structure for dimethyl maleate. Wait, no, I'm getting confused between fumarate and maleate.

Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-COOH (but actually, it's HO2C-CH=CH-COOH? No, no, wait. No, wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH in the cis configuration, and fumaric acid is the trans isomer.

So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the substituents across the double bond. Now, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a CH group.

Wait, each double bond carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- a CH group (which is connected to the other double bond carbon),
- and nothing else? No, each double bond carbon is in a double bond, so each has two substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

But that would make both substituents on each carbon the same, so no stereoisomerism.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure of fumarate is that each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a methyl group or something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me think about the possibility of stereoisomerism. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with two ester groups on opposite sides. So, in the trans configuration, that would create a situation where the molecule is not planar and has a chiral center? Or maybe not.

Wait, but in reality, the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is attached to a COOCH3 group. So the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

Wait, that can't be right because that would imply both substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, making the molecule symmetrical. So that would mean no stereoisomerism.

Wait, but wait, in reality, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to C1
|
C1=C2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3 attached to C2

Wait, no, each C1 and C2 would have two substituents. So C1 is connected to O-CO-OCH3 and the double bond to C2. C2 is connected to O-CO-OCH3 and the double bond to C1.

So each double bond carbon has:

- one COOCH3 group,
- one H (maybe),
- and the double bond.

Wait, so each double bond carbon has:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and two bonds in the double bond.

So each double bond carbon has two substituents: COOCH3 and H, and the double bond.

So in this case, each double bond carbon is connected to COOCH3, H, and the other double bond carbon.

But wait, that would mean each has two substituents, so no, that's not possible. I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon has two different substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

But then, each C is bonded to two COOCH3 groups and the double bond. Which would make each C have two identical substituents (COOCH3), so no possibility for stereoisomerism.

Hmm, that would imply that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereoisomerism. But wait, I recall that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, which are stereoisomers. So dimethyl fumarate must have some kind of stereoisomerism.

Wait, I think I'm mixing things up. Fumaric acid has the trans configuration across the double bond. So in dimethyl fumarate, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure would be:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, but that's for maleate. No, wait, no. Fumarate's structure is:

MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the substituents on opposite sides, leading to E configuration.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons has a COOCH3 group and another substituent that's different. For example, one has COOCH3 and a CH2 group, the other has COOCH3 and another CH2 group. Wait, that might not lead to any chiral centers.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. If the molecule is symmetrical, then it can't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but if the substituents across the double bond are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical. So, in that case, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but what if the substituents are different? Wait, in this case, the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same (COOCH3 and, say, a methyl group). Wait, no, in any case, if the substituents are the same on each end, the molecule would be symmetrical.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possibilities. If a molecule has a double bond with two identical groups on each end, then it's symmetrical and can't have optical isomerism. For example, something like (E)- or (Z)-butene doesn't have optical isomerism because each end is the same. But if the groups are different, then the double bond can give rise to stereoisomerism, such as in the case of 2-pentene, where each end has different substituents.

So in dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group, making the substituents the same on each end. So the molecule would be symmetrical, and hence, not exhibit optical isomerism. But that contradicts my initial thought because I remember that fumarate is a stereoisomer of maleate.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Dimethyl fumarate has two COOCH3 groups on each end of the double bond, but because it's the trans configuration, this leads to a non-symmetrical arrangement around the double bond, creating a chiral center.

Wait, but wait: the double bond itself isn't a chiral center. It's the substituents around it that might create a chiral center elsewhere.

Wait, no, in this case, perhaps the double bond doesn't create a chiral center but allows for geometric isomerism. So the question is whether any of the compounds have optical isomerism due to chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers, but it has geometric isomerism (cis/trans). But geometric isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism, because geometric isomers are not necessarily mirror images. So unless the molecule has a chiral center, it won't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Chiral centers are the main source of optical isomerism. So if a molecule doesn't have a chiral center, it can't exhibit optical isomerism. So dimethyl fumarate, if it doesn't have a chiral center, won't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is option 4 in the choices? Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think about the structure again. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester of fumaric acid. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The ester groups are on either end of a double bond. So the molecule is:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, but that's maleate. Fumarate is the trans version, so it's MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

Wait, the double bond is between the two CH groups. Each CH is connected to a COOCH3 group and a H.

So each double bond carbon has:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and the double bond.

Wait, but that's only three bonds. Wait, each carbon in a double bond has a double bond, so each has two substituents. So each double bond carbon has COOCH3 and H, and the rest is the double bond.

So, each double bond carbon has substituents COOCH3 and H. Thus, each has two substituents, making the molecule symmetric. So, no, that can't be.

Wait, but in reality, the structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, with the substituents on opposite sides. So each double bond carbon has:

On one side, MeO2C and H, and on the other, CO2Me and H. Wait, no, in the trans configuration, the groups are opposite. So each double bond carbon has a MeO2C and a CO2Me group, but arranged trans.

Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have two groups. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should conclude that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But that doesn't make sense because I thought that fumarate is a stereoisomer. Wait, maybe the confusion is between geometric isomerism and optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider each compound:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have atropisomerism if the substituents are large enough. Atropisomers are stereoisomers due to restricted rotation around the central C-C bond. These are a form of stereoisomerism. If the substituents are bulky, the molecule can't rotate, leading to different atropisomers. But do atropisomers exhibit optical isomerism? I think they can if the structure is chiral. So if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule chiral, then yes.

In this case, the substituents are nitro groups and ester groups. These are bulky, so the rotation around the biphenyl bond is restricted. If the substituents on each benzene ring are not symmetrical, the molecule could be chiral. Looking at the positions: 6 and 6' are nitro groups, and 2 and 2' are ester groups. The positions 6 and 2 on each benzene ring are meta to each other. So the arrangement on each ring is a nitro at 6 and an ester at 2. So when connected to the other benzene ring, the substituents are arranged such that the molecule is chiral. Therefore, option 1 could exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. As I determined earlier, no chiral center, so no optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. No chiral centers, so no.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. If it has a chiral center, then yes. But I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between two carbons, each of which has different substituents, leading to a possibility of cis and trans. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group, making them not identical. So perhaps each double bond carbon has two different substituents, leading to a possibility of stereoisomerism. Wait, let me think again.

The structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C(OCH3)-CH=CH-CO2OCH3. So each double bond carbon is connected to:

- one COOCH3 group,
- and one CH group.

Wait, but each CH is connected to the other double bond carbon and perhaps another substituent. Wait, no, that's not possible because the double bond is between the two CH groups. So each CH has:

- one COOCH3 group,
- one double bond to the other CH.

But that would mean each CH has two substituents: COOCH3 and the double bond. No, that doesn't make sense because each CH would have three bonds: one to COOCH3, one to the other CH via double bond, and another bond. Wait, but that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon has two substituents: a COOCH3 and a H. So, each CH is bonded to COOCH3, H, and the double bond. So, each has two substituents.

In that case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Thus, no optical isomerism.

Wait, but then why is option 4 in the choices? Maybe I'm wrong about dimethyl fumarate.

Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center. Wait, if the double bond is between two carbons where each has different substituents, perhaps a chiral center exists elsewhere.

Wait, the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

But that's symmetric. So, no chiral centers. So, no optical isomerism.

So, now, compiling:

1. Show optical isomerism? Yes, due to atropisomerism making it chiral.

2. No.

3. No.

4. No.

Wait, but the options given are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Hmm, according to this reasoning, only 1 shows optical isomerism. But looking back, I might have made a mistake with dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, another approach: which compounds have chiral centers?

1. Biphenyl structure with substituents. If the molecule is chiral, then yes.

2. No.

3. No.

4. Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond, but no chiral centers. So no.

But I'm not confident about 4. Alternatively, perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center. Wait, let me think about the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. The structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me, but that's maleate. Fumarate is the trans form, so the structure is:

MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

Now, looking at each double bond carbon:

Each has a COOCH3 group and a CH group. So, each has:

- COOCH3,
- CH (connected to the other double bond carbon),
- and two H's? No, that can't be because that would make four substituents.

Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon has:

- COOCH3,
- CH2 (connected to the other double bond carbon),
- and a H.

Wait, but that would be three substituents plus the double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that each double bond carbon is connected to two different groups, leading to possible stereoisomerism. For example, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, which are different. So, in the trans configuration, the substituents are opposite, leading to a chiral center.

Wait, but wait. If the molecule is symmetric, then it can't have a chiral center. So if the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same, no chiral center. If they are different, then maybe a chiral center exists elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps there's a chiral center on one of the carbons adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the double bond is between two carbons, each bonded to a COOCH3 and another substituent. So, perhaps the carbons adjacent to the double bond are the ones that are chiral.

Wait, for example, if the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

But that's symmetrical. So, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center elsewhere. Let me think about the structure again. If the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, then each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a H. So each has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each of those carbons would have two identical groups (if the other substituents are same), making them not chiral.

So, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have a chiral center, hence no optical isomerism.

Wait, but that's conflicting with my initial thought. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other sources. Wait, dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer with dimethyl maleate. Fumarate is the trans ester, while maleate is the cis. So, they are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. So, they don't exhibit optical activity, but are geometric isomers.

So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Thus, among the four compounds, only the first one (1) shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have an option where only 1 is correct. Looking again at the options:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Hmm, so according to my analysis, only 1 shows optical isomerism. But none of the options have only 1. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine compound 4. Maybe I was wrong about dimethyl fumarate.

Another approach: think about whether any of the compounds have a chiral center.

1. Biphenyl compound. If the substituents are in a way that creates a chiral center, then yes.

But biphenyls can have atropisomerism, which is a form of stereoisomerism but not optical isomerism unless the molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it's chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

In compound 1, the substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring, and the other substituents are nitro and ester groups. So the arrangement would make the molecule chiral, leading to optical isomerism.

2. No chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

Thus, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option where only 1 is correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the compounds.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with option 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's maleate. No, fumarate is the trans isomer, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH=
|
CH
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. The correct structure is:

MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

Now, each double bond carbon is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- and a CH group.

Wait, but each CH is connected to another CH. So each has:

- COOCH3,
- two CH groups.

No, that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon has:

- COOCH3,
- a CH2 group.

No, I think I'm stuck again. Let me think about whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers.

Wait, the molecule has a central double bond. The substituents on either end are COOCH3 groups. If the substituents are the same on both ends, the molecule is symmetrical. Thus, no chiral centers.

So, in that case, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have an option that includes only 1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: earlier I thought no chiral center, but let me re-examine.

Structure: CH3-C(OH)-H-COOCH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the middle carbon is CH2. So, the substituents are:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Wait, the middle carbon is CH2. So it's connected to:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

So, the substituents are OH, CH2COOCH3, H, H. So two H's, which means it's not a chiral center.

So, no optical isomerism in 2.

Wait, maybe I've made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think about the possibility of a chiral center in dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. The correct structure is:

MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

Now, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a CH group. So the substituents are:

For the first double bond carbon:

- COOCH3,
- CH connected to the other double bond carbon,
- and two H's.

But that can't be because each CH would have three bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond carbon has:

- COOCH3,
- CH2 group,
- and nothing else.

No, that doesn't add up.

I think I'm stuck and need to make a conclusion.

Based on my reasoning, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4.

Another approach: which of the compounds have a possibility of a chiral center?

1. Biphenyl with large substituents → atropisomerism, which can be chiral.

2. No chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

Thus, only 1 has optical isomerism. But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the carbons adjacent to the double bond are chiral centers.

Wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is:

MeO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2Me (dimethyl maleate), which is the cis isomer. Fumarate is the trans isomer, with the double bond.

So, in the trans isomer, each double bond carbon has a COOCH3 group and a H. So each has:

- COOCH3,
- H,
- and the double bond.

Thus, each has two substituents, meaning no chiral centers.

Hmm.

In that case, only compound 1 has optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, perhaps I missed something.

Wait, another possibility: consider if any of the compounds have multiple stereocenters or other types of stereoisomerism that lead to optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in compound 2. Let me re-examine compound 2.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3. So the middle carbon is CH2. The substituents are OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So two H's mean no chiral center.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound that shows optical isomerism is 1.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should look for other possibilities.

Wait, maybe compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think again. If the structure is MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, then each double bond carbon has:

- COOCH3,
- CH (connected to the other double bond carbon).

Each CH has:

- COOCH3,
- and the other CH.

So, substituents are COOCH3 and CH.

Wait, but each double bond carbon would have two substituents: COOCH3 and CH, making them not chiral centers.

Thus, no chiral centers.

So, with that, the only compound showing optical isomerism is 1. But the options don't have this, which suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back at the options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center because of the ester groups.

Wait, perhaps the carbons bearing the ester groups are chiral. For example, the carbon attached to the ester group and the double bond.

Wait, in the structure MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me, the carbons adjacent to the double bond are each attached to a COOCH3 group and the double bond. So each of those carbons is CH, which is connected to:

- COOCH3,
- double bond,
- and a H.

So, each of those carbons has three substituents: COOCH3, H, and the double bond. But that's only three substituents, so each has a fourth substituent, which is another bond. So perhaps each is a CH2 group, leading to four substituents.

Wait, perhaps each of those carbons is a CH2 group, leading to four substituents.

Wait, no, because the double bond is between two carbons, each of which is bonded to two other groups.

I'm getting stuck again. I think I need to conclude based on what I have.

Thus, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't include that, I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the possibility of other isomers.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate does have a chiral center because the substituents on either side of the double bond are different. For example, if one side has COOCH3 and the other has a different substituent, but in this case, both sides are the same.

I think I've spent too much time on this and need to make a decision.

The correct answer is that only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But since none of the options have only 1, perhaps the closest is option A, which includes 1, 2, and 4. But I don't think 2 and 4 show optical isomerism.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again about compound 4.

Dimethyl fumarate: (E)-dimethylbut-2-enedioate.

The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2
|
CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that's not right. It's a trans structure, so the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond. But each substituent on the double bond is COOCH3. So the molecule is symmetrical, leading to no optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound is 1. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does have a chiral center. Let me think: suppose the structure is:

CH2-COOCH3
   ||
    C=C
   ||
CH2-COOCH3

But that's symmetrical, so no.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

Which is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Thus, no optical isomerism in 4.

So, again, only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2.

Wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: perhaps the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. In that case, the carbon with OH is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group.

Wait, no, that would be the structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Wait, the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3 (from the adjacent carbon).

Wait, no, because 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH3 (from the adjacent C).

Wait, no, the structure would be:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So C2 is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH2 group?

No, wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me think again.

The correct structure is:

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (C2) is CH2. So substituents:

- OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- and two H's.

So substituents are H, H, CH2COOCH3, OH. So two H's, which means it's not a chiral center.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that only compound 1 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't include that, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider compound 4. Another approach: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a plane of symmetry, but also a chiral center.

Wait, if the structure is such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral, but another part is chiral, that can't happen. So I think dimethyl fumarate is achiral.

Thus, the conclusion is that only compound 1 shows optical isomerism.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A: 1,2,4.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 4. Let me think differently: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center due to the way the ester groups are arranged.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

COOCH3
    \
     C=C
    /
COOCH3

Which is symmetric, so no chiral center.

Thus, no optical isomerism.

So, I think the correct answer is only compound 1 shows optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 2 does have a chiral center. Let me re-examine.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate's structure: CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

The central carbon (C2) is CH2. Substituents: OH, CH2COOCH3, and two H's. So two H's → not a chiral center.

No optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound is 1.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis of compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl structure has two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The substituents are at positions 6 and 2 on each ring.

So, each benzene ring has a nitro group at position 6 and an ester group at position 2.

If the two benzene rings are connected at position 1, then the substituents at 6 and 2 on each ring might make the molecule chiral.

For example, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. So, when looking from the top, the substituents are arranged asymmetrically, making the molecule chiral.

Thus, compound 1 would have optical isomerism.

So, based on this, the correct compounds that show optical isomerism are:

1. Yes.

2. No.

3. No.

4. No.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 1 is option A (1,2,4) and option D (1 and 2). Since 2 and 4 don't show optical isomerism, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, because 2 and 4 don't. So perhaps the correct answer is that only 1 shows optical isomerism. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering compound 4.

Another thought: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center in the ester groups. Wait, the ester groups are OCH3 attached to carbonyl carbons. The carbonyl carbons are double-bonded, so they can't be chiral centers.

Thus, no.

Conclusion: Only compound 1 shows optical isomerism, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 4 does have a chiral center.

Wait, another approach: look up whether dimethyl fumarate has optical isomerism.

Upon checking (in my mind), I recall that fumarate is a diastereomer of maleate, which are geometric isomers, not optical isomers. Thus, they don't exhibit optical activity. So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

Thus, the only compound is 1.

But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 2.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: perhaps the structure is (R) or (S) configuration.

Wait, if the structure is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3, then the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and another CH group.

Wait, that would make four different substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and CH (from the adjacent carbon).

Thus, it would be a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Ah! That's the mistake I made earlier. I thought the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3, but perhaps it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, the correct IUPAC name for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the OH on the second carbon.

Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

The 2-hydroxy would be the middle carbon, making the structure CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Thus, the central carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- OH,
- and the adjacent CH group (from C1).

Wait, but C1 is CH3, so the substituents are:

- CH3 (from C1),
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- OH,
- and CH (from C1? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Wait, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So, the central carbon (C2) is CH(OH). It is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- OH,
- and another CH (from C1? No, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Thus, the central carbon (C2) is CH(OH), which is connected to:

- CH3 (left),
- COOCH3 (right),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, each carbon in a chain has four bonds. So C2 is attached to:

- CH3 (from C1),
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- OH,
- and another CH group (from C1? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should draw the structure as:

COOCH3 is at the end (C3), then C2 is CH(OH), connected to C1 which is CH3.

Thus, the substituents on C2 are:

- CH3 (from C1),
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- OH,
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, that would make four substituents: CH3, COOCH3, OH, H.

So, all four substituents are different. Thus, the central carbon is a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

Ah! So I made a mistake earlier by thinking the structure was CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3 instead of CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

Thus, compound 2 does have a chiral center and shows optical isomerism.

Therefore, the compounds that show optical isomerism are 1 and 2.

So, the correct option is D) 1 and 2.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each option based on the presence of chiral centers or other forms of chirality, such as atropisomerism.

### **Analysis of Each Compound**

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound is a biphenyl derivative with nitro groups at positions 6 and 6' and ester groups at positions 2 and 2'. The substituents are large and bulky, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry due to the arrangement of the groups on the two benzene rings. This restricted rotation around the central bond leads to atropisomerism, which is a form of stereoisomerism. Since the molecule is chiral, it exhibits optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The central carbon (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH₃, COOCH₃, OH, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the compound exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of enantiomers.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure (Ph)₂C=O, where two benzene rings are attached to a carbonyl group. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and cannot be a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule is symmetrical, as the two benzene rings are identical and arranged symmetrically around the central carbon. Therefore, benzophenone does not exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the trans ester of fumaric acid, with the structure MeO₂C-CH=CH-CO₂Me. The double bond is between two carbons, each of which is bonded to a COOCH₃ group. Since the substituents on both sides of the double bond are identical, the molecule is symmetrical and does not have a chiral center. While it exhibits geometric isomerism (cis/trans), it does not show optical isomerism.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Compound 1**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to atropisomerism.  
- **Compound 2**: Exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center.  
- **Compound 3**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism due to symmetry.  
- **Compound 4**: Does not exhibit optical isomerism as it lacks a chiral center.

The compounds that show optical isomerism are **1 and 2**.

**Answer: D**
