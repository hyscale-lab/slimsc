Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, for a given state. The state is an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The matrix representations of P_x, P_y, and P_z are given, and the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, I remember that the uncertainty principle involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

First, I think I need to compute the expectation value of P_z, which is ⟨ψ|P_z|ψ⟩, and the expectation value of (P_z)^2, ⟨ψ|P_z²|ψ⟩. Then, the uncertainty ΔP_z would be the square root of (⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

The given state ψ is a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me write that down: ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

Wait, the operator P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write that matrix P_z again to make sure:

P_z matrix is:
Row 1: [ ħ, 0, 0 ]
Row 2: [0, 0, 0 ]
Row 3: [0, 0, -ħ ]

So it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ.

So to compute ⟨P_z⟩, I need to multiply ψ† (the conjugate transpose) by P_z and then by ψ. Since ψ is real, the conjugate transpose is just the transpose.

Let me calculate this step by step. Let me represent ψ as a vector [a, b, c], where a = -1/2, b = 1/√2, c = -1/2.

⟨P_z⟩ = a* (P_z a) + b* (P_z b) + c* (P_z c). Wait, no, more accurately, it's the sum of the products of each component of ψ with the corresponding component of P_z ψ.

Wait, no. Because P_z is diagonal, the matrix multiplication is straightforward. So P_z ψ will be a vector where each component is the product of the diagonal element with the corresponding ψ component.

So:

P_z ψ = [ ħ*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), (-ħ)*(-1/2) ]^T.

That simplifies to [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Then, ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† times P_z ψ, which is the dot product of ψ and P_z ψ.

So:

(-1/2)*(-ħ/2) + (1/√2)*0 + (-1/2)*(ħ/2).

Let's compute each term:

First term: (1/2)*(ħ/2) = ħ/4.
Second term: 0.
Third term: (-1/2)*(ħ/2) = -ħ/4.

Adding them together: ħ/4 + 0 - ħ/4 = 0. So ⟨P_z⟩ is zero.

Now I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩. P_z squared is just the square of each diagonal element since it's diagonal. So P_z² would be:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0;
  0, 0, 0;
  0, 0, (−ħ)^2 ]

Which is [ ħ², 0, 0; 0,0,0; 0,0, ħ^2 ].

So P_z squared acting on ψ would be [ ħ²*(-1/2), 0, ħ²*(-1/2) ]^T?

Wait, no. Wait, P_z² is diagonal, so again, each component is multiplied by the diagonal elements. Let's compute P_z² ψ.

P_z² ψ = [ (ħ²)*(-1/2), 0*(1/√2), ( (-ħ)^2 )*(-1/2) ]^T.

Wait, (-ħ)^2 is ħ². So the third component is ħ² * (-1/2) = - ħ²/2.

So P_z² ψ = [ -ħ²/2, 0, -ħ²/2 ]^T.

Then the expectation value ⟨P_z²⟩ is the dot product of ψ and P_z² ψ.

ψ is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]
