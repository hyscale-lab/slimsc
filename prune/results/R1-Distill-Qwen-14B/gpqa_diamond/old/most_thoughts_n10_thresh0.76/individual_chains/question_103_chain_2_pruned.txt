Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options are A, B, C, D, each with a series of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I'll draw the target molecule. The structure is a ketone (ethan-1-one) attached to a benzene ring. The substituents on the ring are a bromine and a nitro group. Specifically, the bromine is in position 3 and the nitro in position 5 relative to the ketone group. Wait, let me visualize the positions. The numbering would be: the ketone is at position 1. So moving around the ring, position 2 is adjacent, position 3 is next, and so on. Wait, actually, in benzene derivatives, the numbering depends on the substituents. So the ketone is at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. So the ring has three substituents: COCH3 (wait, no, ethan-1-one would be a ketone where the ring is attached to the carbonyl group. So the structure is benzene with a carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1, a bromine at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5.

Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (propan-2-one?), maybe I got that wrong. Wait, ethan-1-one would be:

O

CH2-C-O-

Wait, no. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO? No, ethan-1-one would be CH3-CO-CH2? No, wait. Wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-CO-CH2? No, I think I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, ethan-1-one is the same as acetone, right? Wait, no. Wait, acetone is (propan-2-one). Oh wait, no. Wait, 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one would have the structure where
