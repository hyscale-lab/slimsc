Alright, so I've got this question about the H-atom and dipole transitions. Hmm, okay, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work it out.

The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to |1,0,0> via two dipole transitions. The options are different transition routes and their probabilities.

First, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels by emitting or absorbing photons. Dipole transitions are those where the electron moves between states with different quantum numbers, but I think there are specific rules about which transitions are allowed.

Wait, the selection rules for dipole transitions. Oh right, the selection rules are: Δl = ±1, and Δm = 0, ±1. Also, for hydrogen, the n can change by any integer because it's a one-electron atom, but other atoms have different selection rules sometimes.

So the initial state is |3,0,0>. It decays to |1,0,0> in two steps. Let's think about each step.

First transition: from n=3, l=0 (s orbital) to what? Since l can change by ±1, the next l has to be 1. So, from l=0 to l=1. So possible l=1 states are |2,1,m> or |1,1,m> or others, but because we're going down in energy, the first transition would probably go to a lower n, but wait, wait: The initial decay is from 3 to 1 via two steps. So first, from n=3 to n=2, and then from n=2 to n=1.

So first step: n=3 → n=2. And l=0 → l=1 (since Δl=+1). So in the first transition, it goes to a state with l=1. Then, from n=2, l=1, it goes to n=1, l=0 (since again Δl must be -1).

So the first transition is |3,0,0> → |2,1,m>, and the second is |2,1,m> → |1,0,0>.

Now, m can change by 0, ±1 each time. So in the first transition, m goes from 0 to m', which can be -1, 0, or +1. Then in the second transition, m' must go to 0 again because the final state is m=0.

Wait, but let's think about the possible m values. Let me list the possible m for each step.

First transition:

Initial m is 0. After the first transition, m can be -1, 0, or +1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,-1>, |2,1,0>, |2,1,+1>.

Now, the second transition from each of these to |1,0,0>.

In the second step, the initial state is |2,1,m> and the final is |1,0,0>.

Since Δl = -1 (from 1 to 0), which is allowed. Now, for m: the change must be Δm = 0, ±1.

So from m in the intermediate state, it can go to m_final = m ±0, ±1.

But the final state has m=0. So, for each intermediate m, which transitions are possible?

Let me consider each case:

1. Intermediate m is -1:

Second transition m changes from -1 → 0. So Δm=+1. That's allowed because Δm can be +1.

2. Intermediate m is 0:

Then, Δm can be 0, +1, or -1. So to reach m=0, Δm=0. So that's allowed.

3. Intermediate m is +1:

Then, to reach m=0, Δm must be -1. Which is allowed.

So all three intermediate states (m=-1, 0, +1) can transition to the final state |1,0,0>.

So the decay routes could be:

3→2, m=0→m=0 (Δm=0), then 2→1.

Wait no, let me clarify. Each transition is a dipole transition, so each has its own selection rules.

But the problem is about the transition routes and their probabilities. The options give specific routes with specific probabilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0 with probability 1/3.

Option B: 3→2,1,1 → 1,0,0 and probability 1/4.

Option C: 3→2,1,-1 →1,0,0, prob 1/4.

Option D: 3→2,1,0 →1,0,0, prob 2/3.

Wait, but the way the options are written, each option gives a specific pair of transitions. So for example, option A says that the decay goes via 2,1,0 in both steps, and the probability is 1/3.

But according to my earlier analysis, there are three possible intermediate states: m=-1, 0, +1. So each of these would contribute to the probability of the overall decay path.

Wait, but the question says the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So each transition must follow the selection rules, and each has a certain probability. But the overall probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

Wait, but how do the probabilities of each step combine?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the possible allowed transition paths, not the probabilities. But the options also include probabilities, so I must consider that.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Each transition's probability is determined by the square of the matrix element involved, but for selection purposes, only certain transitions are allowed, and the probabilities add up for different possible paths.

Wait, but in this case, are all the possible intermediates contributing to the overall probability? Or is the question about the probability of a specific path?

Hmm, the question says, "the transition route and the corresponding probability". So each option gives a specific route and its probability.

But in reality, the decay from |3,0,0> to |1,0,0> can happen via multiple routes (like through m=-1, 0, +1), so the total probability is the sum of the probabilities of each route.

Wait, but the question states that the decay is via two dipole transitions.
