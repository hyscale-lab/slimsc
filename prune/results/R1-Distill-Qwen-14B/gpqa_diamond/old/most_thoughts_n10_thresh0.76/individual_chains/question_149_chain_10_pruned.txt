Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question in front of me. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Let's read the question carefully.

So, the scenario is that there's a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude compound mostly looks correct except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Wait, so each peak is about half a proton? Or maybe they're splitting each other? But it says to rule out spin-spin coupling, so it's not that. Oh, right, spin-spin coupling would cause splitting, not separate peaks for the same proton.

Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks with same mass. So the mass is the same, but the peaks are separate. Same intensities too. So same mass, same retention time? Or not? Wait, no, LC-MS would separate based on retention time in the LC part. The two peaks have same mass, so same molecular weight.

So what's causing two peaks in LC-MS with same mass? Maybe they're isomers or something. So the options are A to D.

Looking at the options:

A) Contaminated with a precursor. The precursor would have a different mass, right? Because the precursor would be the starting material before a step, maybe a lower molecular weight. But the LC-MS shows same mass as expected. So A might not be the answer.

B) Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in chiral columns they would separate, but the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks. Wait, but if the LC is achiral, it might not separate. But the question doesn't specify. Also, for NMR, in a racemic mixture, the protons would experience the same environment, so their shifts would be similar. But wait, noâ€”actually, in a racemic mixture, the NMR would show a single peak because the two enantiomers are identical in that aspect. Unless the molecule isn't chiral, but the problem says the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So maybe B isn't the answer.

C) Double coupling during an amide bond forming. Wait, double coupling in NMR would cause splitting. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling, so this might not explain
