Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves the addition of a nucleophile to an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let's try to break down each part of the question step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions A, B, and C, each leading to a product. I need to figure out what the reactants and products are for each and then match them with the options given.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). NaOEt is a strong base, so it's probably deprotonating something to form an enolate, which then acts as a nucleophile.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor. Its structure is something like (CH3COO)2CH-. The methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the acceptor. The structure would be CH2=C(p-tolyl)CH2COOCH3, but wait, no, wait. E-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the substituents on opposite sides. So the structure is CH2=CO-p-tolyl, but wait, wait. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, but in this case, it's methyl ester. So the acceptor is CH2=CHCOOCH3, but the substituent (p-tolyl) is on the beta position. Wait wait, wait, the compound is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so the 3-position would be the CH2 group. So maybe the structure is CH2-C(OCH3)=CH-p-tolyl? No, wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(OCH3)-CH2-p-tolyl. Wait, no. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the third carbon? Or wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-CO-p-tolyl? No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=C(COOR)-p-tolyl. Maybe the structure is CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl? No, perhaps I'm getting confused about the numbering. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)COOCH3. Wait, that would be 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate as CH2=C(CH2-p-tolyl)COOCH3. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is CH2=CH-C(OOCH3)-p-tolyl. Hmm, maybe I should think about the structure as the acrylate has the ester group on one end, and the substituent on the other. So in the (E) configuration, the substituents are opposite.

But perhaps
