Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. We need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical approximation.

Wait, so the key points are:
- Initial nucleus: rest mass energy 300 GeV, at rest.
- Splits into two fragments: mass ratio is 2:1 (mass1 = 2*mass2). But their combined rest mass is 0.99*M. Oh wait, M is the initial mass. So sum of rest masses is 0.99*M.

So, first, I should probably find the rest masses of the two fragments.

Let me define the masses. Let the smaller fragment have rest mass m, so the other is 2m. Their sum is 3m = 0.99*M. Thus, m = (0.99*M)/3. Then the masses are m = (0.99*M)/3 and 2m = 0.66*M.

Wait, but M is the initial rest mass. But the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / cÂ², but in calculations, since we're dealing with mass ratios, maybe the actual value of M isn't needed, but perhaps we'll need to consider energy in terms of mass.

But let's think about the energy released in the fission. Since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum after fission must be zero (conservation of momentum). So the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

The energy released comes from the binding energy, but perhaps that's not directly needed here. Wait, but the problem is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, comparing the correct relativistic value to the classical approximation.

Wait, but in reality, the binding energy is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments and possibly other forms like radiation or other particles, but the problem says it splits into two fragments only, so all the
