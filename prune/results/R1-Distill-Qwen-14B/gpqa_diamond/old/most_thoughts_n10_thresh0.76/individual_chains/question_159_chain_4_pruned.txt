Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question says we're observing a quasar across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the near infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak at about 790 nm, and the flux drops significantly below that. Wait, I remember that the Lyman-alpha emission line is around 121 nm, but that's in the ultraviolet. But wait, the peak here is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. Oh, wait—maybe this is the Lyman-alpha line redshifted? Because if the quasar is very far away, the expansion of the universe would stretch the wavelength.

So the observed wavelength is 790 nm. The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121 nm, right? So to find the redshift z, we can use the formula z = observed wavelength / rest wavelength - 1. Let me calculate that. So 790 / 121 is approximately 6.529. Subtract 1 gives z≈5.529. Wait, that's a significant redshift. So the quasar is at z around 5.5.

Now, the question is about the comoving distance. The comoving distance is the distance we use in cosmology to describe how far away an object is, considering the expansion of the universe. The formula for comoving distance is D_c = c * ∫ (from 0 to z) dz' / H(z'), where
