Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the scenario is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. This compound makes it unusable for food. They found the gene responsible for this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants, and now they've sequenced the target gene in all the mutants. The changes are in the first exon area. The question is which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. So, the goal is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough that the compound isn't produced. Since it's about the first exon, maybe the mutation affects the start codon or early exons.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a different change. Let's compare the sequences.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. The start codon is ATG, which is standard.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the beginning: the third codon in the original is TTT (third position), in mutant 1 it's TCT. Wait, let me see the exact sequence. The original is ATG TTC TCG... So, the first codon is ATG (start), then TTC, then TCG etc. In Mutant 1, the second codon is TTC in original is TTC, but in mutant it's TCT? Wait no, let me see the exact change.

Wait, the first part: Intact is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... So the first few codons are:

ATG (1), TTT (2), CTC (3), GCT (4), GGT (5), ACT (6), TCT (7), GTG (8), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA... So the first few codons are:

ATG (1), TTC (2), TAC (3), GCT (4), GGT (5), etc.

Wait, so in the intact gene, the second codon is TTT (which is phenylalanine), the third is CTC (leucine). In Mutant 1, the second is TTC (also phenylalanine), third is TAC (tyrosine). So no start codon change, but an amino acid change in the third position. So a missense mutation. That would change the protein, but maybe not cause a stop. So unless it disrupts the function.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Original: ...CGC TGG TAC T...
Mutant 2: ...GCT GGT ACT...
Wait, the exact change: The third codon in the original is CTC. In Mutant 2, perhaps it's changed. Let me look again.

Wait, the intact gene's sequence is ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT... That's TTC TCG CTT GGT ACT TCT...

In Mutant 2, the sequence is ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACT... So the third codon would be TCG in intact, which is arginine. In Mutant 2, it's AAG (since the sequence is CTAA... No, wait, maybe I should compare the exact nucleotides.

Wait, the original sequence's first part is ATG TTC TCG CTT GGT ACT TCT... So the third codon is T
