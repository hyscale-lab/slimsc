Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particles annihilating and producing photons. Hmm. Let me read the question again and think through it step by step.

So the setup is an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same axis but from the right, with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they annihilate and produce two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors... Lorentz factor gamma is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher gamma means higher velocity. The electron has gamma 4, the positron gamma 2. Since they're moving towards each other, their velocities are in opposite directions.

When they annihilate, they produce two photons. Since the system is isolated, I think the total momentum should be conserved. Also, energy must be conserved. But the problem states that both photons have the same energy. Interesting.

Let me think about the initial momenta. The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis, so their momenta are along that axis. The positron has gamma=2, so its momentum is gamma*m*v. Wait, but since the positron is moving from the right, its velocity is in the opposite direction to the electron. So let me assign directions: let's say the electron is moving in the positive x-direction (left to right), and the positron is moving in the negative x-direction (right to left? Or wait, no, the positron is moving from the right, so if the electron is moving left to right, the positron is moving right to left, which would be negative x-direction.)

Wait, no, wait: electrons and positrons have opposite charges. But in terms of movement, the problem says the positron is moving from the right. So if the electron is moving left to right (along the horizontal axis), the positron is moving right to left. So they're approaching each other.

So the initial momenta are: for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e, in the positive x-direction. For the positron, since it's moving opposite, p_p = gamma_p * m_p * v_p, but in the negative x-direction. Wait, but positron's mass is same as electron's, right? Because a positron is the antimatter counterpart, same mass but opposite charge.

So let me write the momenta. Let me denote m as the rest mass of the electron (since both have same mass). So m_e = m_p = m.

Electron: gamma_e =4. So gamma_e =4.

Positron: gamma_p=2.

So the electron's velocity is v_e = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e²) = c * sqrt(1 - 1/16) = c*sqrt(15/16)= (sqrt(15)/4)c. So v_e is positive x-direction.

The positron's velocity is v_p = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_p²) = c*sqrt(1 -1/4)=c*sqrt(3/4)= (sqrt(3)/2)c. Wait, but since it's moving from the right, its velocity is in the negative x-direction, so v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2 c) ?

Wait, no. Wait, gamma is always positive, but velocity direction depends on movement. So the electron is moving along +x, the positron along -x. So their velocities are v_e and -v_p, where v_p is the magnitude.

So the velocities are:

v_e = (sqrt(15)/4) c (positive)
v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c (but since it's moving to the left, its velocity is negative)

Wait no, wait. The positron is moving from the right towards the left, so its velocity is negative. So the momentum of the positron is gamma_p * m_e * v_p, where v_p is negative.

So the total momentum before collision is p_e (from electron) plus p_p (from positron). Let me compute each:

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e = 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m * sqrt(15) c.

Wait, let me compute that again: 4 * m * (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m * sqrt(15) c.

Wait, no: 4 is gamma_e, v_e is (sqrt(15)/4) c.

So 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) c * m = sqrt(15) m c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m * v_p. v_p is negative.

v_p = (sqrt(3)/2) c, but direction
