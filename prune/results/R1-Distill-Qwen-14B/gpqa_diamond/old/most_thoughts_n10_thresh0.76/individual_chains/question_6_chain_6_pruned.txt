Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, the question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. Let me try to break this down.

The potential is given as V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Wait, that looks a bit complicated. I remember that in two dimensions, polar coordinates are often used, so r and θ make sense here.

I think I should separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Let's see: the first term is (1/2)k r², which is purely radial because it depends only on r. The second term is (3/2)k r² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Oh right, cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/4)k r² + (3/2)k r² (cos2θ)/2. Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Wait, (3/2)k r² cos²θ = (3/2)k r² * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. So the potential becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ. Combining the first two terms, (1/2 + 3/4) = 5/4 k r². So V(r,θ) = (5/4)k r² + (3/4)k r² cos2θ.

Hmm, but wait, is that the right approach? Alternatively, I might have to think about whether the potential can be expressed in terms of angular momentum or something else. Or maybe this potential can be rewritten in a way that allows the problem to be broken into radial and angular parts, leading to a solution in terms of known quantum systems.

Wait, another approach: maybe I can rewrite the potential as V(r,θ) = (k r² / 2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Because 1 + 3 cos²θ = 1 + 3 cos²θ, right. Or maybe I can factor
