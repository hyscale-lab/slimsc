Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the problem says that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of the P_z operator in this state.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²). Right, so I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared.

First, let's get the state vector clear. The state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. I should probably normalize it? Wait, let me check. The sum of the squares of the magnitudes should be 1. Let's see: (-1/2)^2 is 1/4, (1/√2)^2 is 1/2, and another 1/4. So 1/4 + 1/2 +1/4 = (1 + 2 +1)/4 =4/4=1. Oh, it's already normalized. Great, no need to normalize.

Next, I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩. Since P_z is given as a matrix. Let me write it down.

The P_z matrix is:
[ ħ  0    0 ]
[ 0  0    0 ]
[ 0  0  -ħ ]

So, to find ⟨P_z⟩, it's ψ† P_z ψ.

Let me compute that. So ψ is a vector with components a, b, c. So a= -1/2, b =1/√2, c= -1/2.

So ψ† P_z ψ = a*(ħ a) + b*(0*b) + c*(-ħ c ). 

Wait, wait, P_z is diagonal, so the matrix multiplication for ψ† P_z ψ is just the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-1/2) ) * ħ * (-1/2) ) + (1/√2) * 0 * (1/√2) ) + ( (-1/2) ) * (-ħ) * (-1/2) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again: the (i,j) element of P_z is the diagonal elements, so when you multiply P_z by ψ, each component is multiplied by the corresponding diagonal element.

So ψ^dagger is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

So,

⟨P_z⟩ = (-1/2)*ħ*(-1/2) + (1/√2)*0*(1/√2) + (-1/2)*(-ħ)*(-1/2)

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no,
