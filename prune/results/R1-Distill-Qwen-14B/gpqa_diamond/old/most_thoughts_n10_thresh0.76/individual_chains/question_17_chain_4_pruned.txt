Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I remember something about complexes and dissociation. Let me think through this.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is a chelating agent, so it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The pH is ideal, which I guess means the conditions are right for the EDTA to be in its deprotonated form, which is better at binding Ca²+.

They also give the formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex as 5x10^10. Oh wait, formation constants are for the reaction where the complex forms. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, formation constant, Kf, is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA⁴−]). But I've also heard about dissociation constants as the inverse, right? Because sometimes people use Kd, the dissociation constant, which is 1/Kf. But in this case, the problem says K is 5e10, so that's the formation constant.

So the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and I need to find the concentration of free Ca²+ ions in solution. Because the complex dissociates a little, right? So some of the CaEDTA²− will dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA⁴−.

Let me set this up. Let me denote the concentration of the complex as [CaEDTA²−] = 0.02 M. The dissociation would be:

CaEDTA²− ↔ Ca²+ + EDTA⁴−

But the forward reaction for the formation constant is the reverse of this. So the dissociation would have a Kd = 1/Kf. So Kd = 1/(5e10) = 2e-11.

Let me let the concentration of Ca²+ at equilibrium be x. Then, the concentration of EDTA⁴− would also be x, assuming the dissociation is x from the complex. So [Ca²+] = x, [EDTA⁴−] = x, and [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02 - x. But since Kd is so small (2e-11), x will be really small compared to 0.02, so we can approximate [CaEDTA²−] ≈ 0.02.

So the expression for Kd is:

Kd = [Ca²+][EDTA⁴−] / [CaEDTA²−] ≈ (x)(x) / 0.02 = x² / 0.02

Set that equal to Kd, which is 2e-11.

So x² / 0.02 = 2e-11

Multiply both sides by 0.02:

x² = (2e-11) * 0.02

Calculate that: 2e-11 * 0.02 = 4e-13.

Then x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5? Wait, sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5. Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2, because 6.5 *2 is 13.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6; 1e-7 is 1e-7, but
