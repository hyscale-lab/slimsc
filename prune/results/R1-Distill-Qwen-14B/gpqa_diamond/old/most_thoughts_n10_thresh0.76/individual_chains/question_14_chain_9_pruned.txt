Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this ChIP-seq question. Let me think through what I remember about the process. ChIP-seq is used to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. So they crosslink the proteins to DNA, fragment the DNA, use an antibody to pull down the protein of interest along with the DNA attached, then sequence that DNA.

The question says they used PFA-fixed samples with an antibody for IKAROS, a transcription factor in human B cells. Then they sequenced, did standard QC, alignment, and peak-calling, and found peaks. But when they used PFA plus DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. Hmm.

Wait, what's the difference between PFA and PFA+DSG? I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde, which is a common crosslinker. DSG is disuccinimide, another crosslinker. Oh right, sometimes in ChIP experiments, they might use a combination of crosslinkers to get better efficiency. But why would using both make some peaks disappear?

Wait, maybe it's about the crosslinking efficiency. Some regions of the genome might be more accessible to certain crosslinkers. Like, if the chromatin is more open in certain areas, maybe the crosslinkers can get in and crosslink the proteins to DNA. But wait, in this case, the peaks went away when DSG was added. So the initial peaks were found when using only PFA, but when DSG was used along with PFA, those peaks disappeared.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. PFA is a methanol-based crosslinker that primarily crosslinks proteins to DNA and to each other. DSG, on the other hand, is a water-soluble crosslinker that can crosslink proteins to DNA but maybe more efficiently in some regions?

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is with regions that are more prone to shearing. If the chromatin is more open, maybe it fragments more easily. But how does that affect the ChIP peaks?

Wait, another angle: maybe the regions where the peaks were found are regions that are only crosslinked with PFA and not with DSG. But why would that be? Or perhaps the opposite: regions that are crosslinked well with PFA but not as much with DSG? Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the crosslinkers. PFA is a mild crosslinker, maybe it doesn't crosslink all regions equally. D
