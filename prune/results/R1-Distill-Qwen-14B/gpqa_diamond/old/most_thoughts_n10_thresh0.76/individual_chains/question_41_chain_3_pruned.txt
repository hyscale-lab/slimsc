Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. The setup is that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is, what is the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab? And they give some options, A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the speed of light in a medium is given by v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. But wait, that's the speed in the medium when the medium is at rest relative to the observer. But here, the glass is moving, so I'm not sure if that affects the speed of light as observed.

Wait, the speed of light in a medium is typically independent of the motion of the medium itself. Like, when you're in a car moving at a constant speed, the speed of light inside the car (like through air) is still c/n for the medium, not something else. Because according to special relativity, the speed of light is constant in all inertial frames. Oh, but wait, that's for light in a vacuum, right? Because when you're in a medium, things might be different.

Wait, no, when a medium is moving, does that affect how light propagates through it? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. In the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. Now, if the glass is moving, what's the speed in the lab frame?

Wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed should be considered using the velocity addition formula from special relativity? But wait, velocity addition applies when you have different inertial frames. Oh, but the glass is moving, so the coordinates are different. Wait, the light is in the glass, which is moving. So the speed of the light as observed in the lab would be different?

Wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n, right? But the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. So I think I need to apply a Lore
