Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about isomers and tautomerism. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it.

The question has two parts: A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism? The options are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between two adjacent atoms, resulting in different structures (like keto-enol tautomerism in ketones or aldehydes). So, I need to check if each compound can undergo this.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic quinone, right? Quinones are diketones, so they can undergo keto-enol tautomerism. So benzoquinone should exhibit tautomerism. Hmm, but wait, quinones have two ketone groups. Do they have the possibility for enol formation? Yes, because each ketone can tautomerize, but since they're conjugated, maybe it's more about their structure. Wait, but if the molecule has two carbonyl groups, like benzoquinone, maybe they can't tautomerize because the necessary hydrogen isn't available? Or does the conjugation stabilize the keto form, making tautomerism less likely? Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Let me think: the structure is a benzene ring with two ketone groups opposite each other (like 1,4 positions). Each of those is a carbonyl group. For a compound to have tautomerism, the carbonyl group would need an alpha hydrogen. Wait, no. Wait, in a ketone, the carbonyl is attached to two R groups. So for tautomerism (keto-enol), the carbonyl group must be adjacent to a CH (with a hydrogen) group. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Wait, the keto-enol tautomerism requires that the carbonyl group is attached to a CH group, so that the alpha hydrogen can shift.

Wait, no. Let's clarify: Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen atom and a lone pair of electrons shift from one atom to an adjacent atom. For example, in a carbonyl group
