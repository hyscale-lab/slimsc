Okay, so I have this physics problem about the uncertainty principle and estimating the minimum uncertainty in energy for an electron. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the question says the electron is traveling at a speed v of 2e8 m/s along the x-direction. The uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle comes into play here. I remember the principle states that there's a limit to how precisely we can know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The formula for the uncertainty in momentum and position is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant.

But wait, the question is about energy uncertainty. Oh right, energy is related to momentum because of the kinetic energy formula. So maybe I can find the uncertainty in momentum first and then relate that to the kinetic energy.

Let me jot down the known constants and values. Planck's constant h is about 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. So the reduced Planck constant ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

The uncertainty in position Δx is 0.1 nm. Oh wait, nanometers are 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters.

Using the uncertainty principle: Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. So I can
