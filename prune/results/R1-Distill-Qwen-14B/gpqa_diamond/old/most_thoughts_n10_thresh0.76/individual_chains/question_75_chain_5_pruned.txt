Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about transgenic mice and protein expression. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

So, the scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They modified the gene's coding sequence by adding a sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. Then they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary cells. But when they checked, they couldn't overexpress the protein. Now, they’re looking into why.

The question shows the DNA sequence of the plus strand, and the options are possible reasons for the failure. I need to figure out what went wrong.

First, let's think about the setup. They introduced a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus. HA tags are commonly used for protein detection, so maybe the construct should express HA-GADD45G. But the overexpression isn't happening.

Looking at the sequence provided, the question is about possible issues in the construct. Let me think about what could cause the protein not to be expressed.

Option A: The HA sequence has a missense mutation. If the HA tag's DNA has a mutation, that might change the amino acid. But would that prevent the entire protein from being expressed? Maybe not. It could make the tag ineffective for detection but wouldn't stop transcription or translation entirely.

Option B: The ribosome terminated early. For that, there must be a stop codon somewhere in the sequence. Let me check the sequence. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then, I need to look for any in-frame stop codons (TAG, TGA, TAA) before the end of the plus strand.

Wait, let me scan the sequence. Let's break it down into triplets starting after ATG. The sequence after ATG is TAC C ATG... Wait, maybe I should look for any TAG, TGA, or TAA in the coding frame.

Looking at the sequence, I'll go through the DNA in triplets, starting from ATG (position 1-3). Let me write out the first few codons:

ATG (start)
TAC (tyrosine)
CAT (his)
CGA (arg)
TGG (trp)
TCC (ser)
AGA (arg)
... and so on.

Wait, I need to find any stop codons. Let's look for TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me see:

Looking through the sequence, I spot a TGA codon. Let's see where it is. Let me parse the sequence in triplets.

Let me count the letters. Let's see, starting from the beginning:

1-3: ATG
4-6: TAC
7-9: CAT
10-12: CGA
13-15: TGG
16-18: TCC
19-21: AGA
22-24: GCT
25-27: GCC
28-30: AGG
31-33: ACA
34-36: CAG
37-39: GAT
40-42: GCT
43-45: CTG
46-48: GAA
49-51: GAG
52-54: TCC
55-57: GCG
58-60: GCC
61-63: CGG
64-66: GCC
67-69: AGG
70-72: ACC
73-75: TCC
76-78: GGCGC... Wait, maybe a better approach is to look for the stop codon.

Wait, looking at the sequence, towards the middle, I see 'TGA' which is a stop codon. Let me check: the sequence has ...AGGCTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC...

Wait, looking for TGA. Let me see, "ACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC..." Hmm, there's an 'ACGTG' part. Let me look closer.

Wait, maybe in the middle: 'GAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGAC' — the 'TGA' is in 'TGAACGTGGAC'. So the triplet here would be TGA at positions ... GAG TCA GCC AAA GTCTTGAACGTGGAC. So TGA is the 24th codon? Let me count the letters.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that the coding sequence has a TGA. Because in the plus strand, 'TGA' is a stop codon in the coding sequence. So if the construct has a TGA in the middle, that would cause translation to terminate early.

But wait, the construct is designed to include the HA tag, then the GADD45G coding sequence. So if the HA is added at the N-terminus, but a stop codon appears in the coding sequence, that would cause the protein to be truncated, perhaps not expressed much if the stop is in the middle.

So if the DNA sequence has a TGA in the coding frame, the mRNA would have a UGA, which is a stop codon. So the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein. If the stop codon is early, maybe the protein isn't expressed at detectable levels, or maybe not functional.

So if option B is "The ribosome terminated the translation early," which would be caused by a premature stop codon in the construct.

But let me look at the given DNA sequence again. The plus strand's coding sequence starts with ATG, and after that, is the HA tag's sequence, followed by GADD45G. But wait, the HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the first part of the coding sequence is the HA.

Wait, maybe the HA is added via a sequence, but perhaps the construct includes it correctly. But in the DNA sequence provided, I see a TGA in the middle, which could be a stop codon.

So why would the HA tag cause a stop? Perhaps the HA sequence was not correctly added, or perhaps the insertion introduced a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the HA tag's addition caused a frameshift. Because inserting an HA tag, which is a short peptide, would require inserting a few codons. If the insertion wasn't in frame, it could cause a frameshift, leading to a stop codon.

Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence introduced a stop codon in the reading frame. Let me think about the HA tag. HA is a peptide, so perhaps the DNA sequence for the HA was added, and that may have included a stop codon or caused a frameshift.

Wait, looking at the sequence, the first part after ATG is TAC (tyr), CAT (his), CGA (arg), TGG (trp), etc. Let's see if the HA coding sequence starts correctly.

Wait, the HA tag is a specific sequence. The HA tag from influenza is usually a short peptide
