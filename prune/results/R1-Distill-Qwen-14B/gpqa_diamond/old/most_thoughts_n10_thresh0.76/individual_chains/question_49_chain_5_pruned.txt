Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. It's about sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question has three parts, each with a reaction and possible products A, B, and C. The options give different possibilities for each product, so I need to figure out which option correctly assigns A, B, and C.

First, let me look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat → A.

Hmm, I think this involves some kind of Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but wait, Claisen is usually for esters or ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement? Or perhaps it's a different kind of rearrangement. Wait, the starting material is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. Let's draw its structure. So it's (CH3O)2CHNH2. Oh wait, it's 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine. The structure is NH2 attached to a CH2 group, which is connected to two methoxy groups. So like OMe-O-C(CH2NH2)Me? No, wait, wait. The formula is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So ethanamine means CH2NH2. But with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. So it's CH2(NH2)(OMe)2. Or wait, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (HOCH2CH2) but with two OMe groups on the same carbon as the NH2. So the structure is probably (MeO)₂CHCH₂NH2? No, wait. Wait, ethanamine is CH3CH2NH2. But 1,1-dimethoxy would mean two methoxy groups on carbon 1. So it's NH2 attached to a carbon that's also attached to two OMe groups. So it's (OMe)₂CH-NH₂. So that's the starting material.

The other reactant is but-3-en-2-ol. Structure: that's CH₂CH₂(OH)CH₂CH₂? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait. But-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's not possible because but is four carbons. Oh, but-3-en-2-ol is CH₂CH₂(OH)CH₂CH3? Wait, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3. Wait, but that can't be right because the double bond would be between C3 and C4, but but has only four carbons. Oh wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but that would actually be but-1-en-3-ol. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond starts at C3, so positions are 2,3,4. Wait, but but is four carbons: 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-2-ol would have the hydroxyl on C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because the double bond is between 3 and 4, so it's CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2? Wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, that would be but-1-en-3-ol. Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the enol is but-
