Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that's dehydrated to form an anhydride. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products. The major and minor products have the same molecular formula, C13H16O3. The key NMR data points are given, and the question is about identifying which resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product.

Hmm. Let me start by understanding each part.

1. **The Dicarboxylic Acid and Anhydride Formation:**
   The starting material is a cis-diacid. When it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. The structure of the anhydride would depend on the dicarboxylic acid. Since the original alkene is cis, the anhydride formed would have a specific structure. The NMR data given for the anhydride is important here. 

   The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm. High ppm like 7 is typically aromatic protons. But wait, an anhydride from a dicarboxylic acid... Oh, wait, unless it's a cyclic anhydride. Wait, maybe the alkene is between the two carboxylic acid groups. So when it dehydrates, it forms an anhydride with a double bond.

   But wait, the 1H NMR of the anhydride has a single peak at 7 ppm. That suggests that all equivalent protons are in a particular environment. Maybe the anhydride is cyclic, like a five-membered ring. For example, if the starting acid is something like cis-butenedioic acid (like maleic acid), dehydration would form maleic anhydride. The structure of maleic anhydride has two double bonds: one from the original diene and another from the anhydride ring.

   The 13C NMR of the anhydride shows two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. In 13C NMR, carbonyl carbons are usually around 165-220 ppm. So 165 ppm is likely a carbonyl (like the anhydride's ketone groups or the double bond carbons). The 137 ppm is in the range of sp2 carbons, maybe the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl. 

   Wait, maleic anhydride has two carbonyl carbons (the O=C-O-C=O structure). So in 13C NMR, each of those carbonyl carbons would show up around 165 ppm. But wait, in the anhydride, the two carbonyls are equivalent, so maybe they show as a single peak. Hmm, but the question
