Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully. Let me start by recalling what regularization means. From what I remember, regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that pop up in calculations. It's a way to make the mathematical expressions finite and manageable. 

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization. So I need to look at each option and see if regularization is necessary for them.

Option A is Superstring Theory. I remember that string theory is a candidate for quantum gravity, and it's supposed to be a theory of everything. But how does it handle high energies? Oh wait, string theory incorporates higher-dimensional spaces and perhaps handles things like divergences in a different way. Or does it? I'm not entirely sure. I think string theories might not require the same kind of regularization as other quantum field theories because they have a different structure, possibly due to the strings themselves providing a more natural cutoff. Or maybe they still do? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with the gauge group SU(3). I know that QCD does require regularization because when you do perturbative calculations, you get divergent integrals. Regularization methods like lattice QCD or using dimensional regularization are common in QCD. So this option probably requires regularization.

Option C is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-established quantum field theory. In QED, when you calculate loop diagrams, you encounter divergences. So regularization techniques are definitely used here. For example, renormalization is a process that deals with these divergences, and regularization is a part of that. So QED requires regularization.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories are different because they don't involve quantum mechanics. In classical E&M, do you have any divergences that require regularization? Well, in the classical theory, you don't have the same issues with infinities as in the quantum version. QED is quantum, but classical ED is just Maxwell's equations and their classical solutions.

So when you're doing calculations in classical ED, like finding the electric field of a point charge, you get an infinite charge density at the origin. But in classical physics, how is this handled? Oh, wait, in classical theory, these infinities are more conceptual because you don't have the same kind of mathematical issues as in quantum field theory. But do they require regularization? I think not. Regularization is a quantum field theory tool. Since classical ED isn't a quantum theory, it doesn't require regularization. Or maybe they deal with it differently, like assuming the charges are point-like but perhaps considering distributions or other classical methods to avoid the problem. So in this case, classical ED might not require regularization.

So the question is which theory never requires regularization. Looking at the options, the only one that's classical is option D. The other options (A, B, C) are quantum theories, so they would need regularization. Wait, but wait. What about option A, Superstring Theory? Because string theory is a quantum theory,
