Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetics, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on here. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the scenario is about a new ligand-receptor pair discovered in neural crest cells. The researcher wants to understand their developmental fate. The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making a binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices.

Then, the construct is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. I remember bicistronic vectors have two ORFs in one transcript, so they're using internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) or something like that. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I think CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. Upstream of the receptor is the IRES element. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed under the control of IRES, right? Because in bicistronic vectors, the first gene (ligand) is under the main promoter, and the second (receptor) uses an IRES to allow translation from the same transcript.

There's a stop cassette in between the ligand ORF and mCherry using loxP. Similarly, between the receptor and eGFP, there's a stop cassette using lox2272. So the stop signals are in there, which are flanked by lox sites. These stops are probably to prevent the downstream gene from being expressed unless the lox sites are recombined away.

They made antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and tested expression via Western blot. So in the primary astrocyte culture, they transfected the plasmid and saw signals proportional to actin loading. So the proteins were expressed in the cells because the blot showed signals, meaning the expression constructs are working.

Then, they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct on a wild-type background. They crossed it with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre is probably under the SOX10 promoter, meaning it's active in neural crest-derived cells, like in the mouse's neural crest.

After the offspring are born, they look under a confocal microscope for fluorescence. They expected green signals (from eGFP), but didn't see any. The question is why.

So the options are A to D. Let's think each through.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the question is about expression in the same cell? Wait, the construct is in the same vector. If the ligand and receptor are in the same cell, they might be autocrine. But if they're in different cells (paracrine), maybe the eGFP isn't expressed because the ligand isn't activating the receptor in the same cell. But wait, the issue here is that the eGFP isn't showing up in the offspring, which are using SOX10-Cre. Hmm, not sure if A is the right answer.

Option B: the receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. If the construct isn't trafficking properly, then the eGFP wouldn't be on the cell surface. But why wouldn't it be expressed at all? The Western blot showed expression, right? Because when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, the proteins were expressed. So the expression is happening. But in the mouse model, perhaps the eGFP is not present. Wait, but the mouse is homozygous for the construct, so both alleles are the same. When they crossed with SOX10-Cre, which would activate the Cre in neural crest cells. The Cre would recombine the lox sites. Let me think about the vector structure.

The vector is bicistronic, so for each allele, the ligand is first, with a stop cassette, then the receptor with another stop. So each allele would have both ligand and receptor constructs, each with their own stop cassettes.

Wait, when Cre is introduced, it would recombine the loxP sites. The ligand is flanked by loxP-stop-loxP. So Cre would delete the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor is flanked by lox2272-stop-lox2272. So Cre would delete that stop, allowing receptor and eGFP to be expressed. But wait, if the
