Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again and try to break it down.

Alright, so the problem is about a star with some specific characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When the surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Hmm, I remember that starspots are cooler regions on a star's surface, so when a significant portion is spotted, the star's overall brightness and temperature decrease.

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) in the stellar photosphere. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which relates the population of different energy levels in a gas in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The Boltzmann factor is given by:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(kT) )

Where:
- n2 and n1 are the number densities of the two energy levels.
- g2 and g1 are the statistical weights (degeneracy) of the levels.
- E2 and E1 are their respective energies.
- k is Boltzmann's constant.
- T is the temperature.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature is lower. Oh, but wait, the spots themselves are cooler, but the surrounding photosphere is at the original temperature? Or does the overall photosphere temperature change? Hmm, the question states that when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff decreases. So I think the entire photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when there are spots, but I'm not entirely sure. Or perhaps, the presence of spots affects the continuum emission, but the line formation might be influenced differently.

Wait, no. The problem states that when the star doesn't have spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, overall Teff is 5500 K. So in the spotted case, the effective temperature of the entire photosphere is lower. But how does that affect the line formation? Because the line emission depends on the local conditions.

Wait, but the problem says to examine the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels in the photosphere. So, perhaps the effective temperature here refers to the overall photospheric temperature when spots are present. So the photosphere as a whole is cooler, but the spots themselves are even cooler.

Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. When the star has spots covering 40% of its surface, the overall effective temperature of the star (as observed) is 5500 K. This would imply that the average flux from the star is lower because a significant part of the surface is cooler (spots).

But locally, the photosphere in the unspotted regions would still be at 6000 K, while the spotted regions are cooler, say T_spot. But when they say the overall photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K, perhaps they are considering the entire photosphere as being at 5500 K, but that doesn't make much sense because the spots are cooler. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplifying it by assuming that the entire photosphere's effective temperature is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. So the photosphere's average is 5500 K, but the individual regions (unspotted and spotted) have their own temperatures.

Wait, no, because the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. So maybe when the star has spots, the local temperature varies, but the problem is considering the photosphere as a mix of hotter and cooler regions. However, the problem says, "when examining the ratio... in the stellar photosphere." So perhaps the photosphere is at a lower effective temperature when spots are present.

Wait, maybe the problem is assuming that the overall photosphere's average temperature is 5500 K when 40% is spotted. But that doesn't seem physically accurate because the spot regions are cooler, but the rest is at 6000 K. So the average flux is lower, but the photosphere's temperature isn't uniform. Hmm, but the problem says the Teff is 5500 K, so maybe the problem is considering the entire photosphere as having a lower effective temperature, but that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the photosphere as having a lower effective temperature when spots are present, meaning that the regions not covered by spots have a higher temperature? No, that doesn't make sense either because spots are cooler regions.

Wait, I think I should approach this differently. The key point is that the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels depends on the temperature. The ratio n1/n2 (or n2/n1) is given by the Boltzmann equation. So when the temperature changes from T1 (6000 K) to T2 (5500 K), this ratio changes, and the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't.

Wait, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when there are no spots, the ratio is higher. So the question is, by what factor does the ratio change when the star is without spots compared to when it has spots.

Wait, let me clarify. The ratio is n1/n2? Or n2/n1? The question says, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when spotted, the ratio is lower than when it's unspotted. So perhaps without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the problem says: the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in two levels (level 1 and level 2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower. So perhaps the ratio (n1/n2) is lower when the star has spots. So, let's define R = n1/n2. When the star has spots, R decreases.

But wait, let's think about the Boltzmann equation. The equation is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(kT) ). So if E2 > E1, then the exponent is negative, and higher T would make the ratio n2/n1 larger because the exponential term increases.

Wait, so E2 is higher than E1. So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio n2/n1 increases. So if the spotted star has lower T, then the ratio n2/n1 would decrease.

But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So wait, if the ratio is n2/n1, and with spots, T goes down, which would make n2/n1 decrease. So that's what the problem says. So without spots, the ratio is higher than when there are spots.

So the question is, what is the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So the factor is R_unspotted / R_spotted.

R_unspotted is (n2_un/n1_un) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_un) ), where T_un is 6000 K.

R_spotted is (n2_sp/n1_sp) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T_sp) ), where T_sp is 5500 K.

But wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the effective temperature is 5500 K. So the ratio would be calculated using 5500 K.

So the ratio R = n2 / n1. So the ratio when unspotted is R_un = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_un) )

Similarly, R_sp = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T_sp) )

But the problem is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. Wait, the question says, the ratio of "the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2)". So it's n1 / n2, or n2/n1? The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T decreases, the ratio goes down.

Wait, let's think again. The ratio (n1/n2) is equal to [exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ) ] / (g1/g2). Hmm, wait:

n1/n2 = [ (g1/g2) ] * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Wait, let me double-check. Let's say E2 > E1.

At higher T, the exponent (E2 - E1)/(k T) is smaller. So exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ) is smaller, so n1/n2 is smaller.

Wait, higher T: numerator (because E2-E1 is positive) is divided by a larger k T. So the exponent is a smaller positive number, so exp(...) is larger but closer to 1. Wait, not necessarily. Let me think with numbers.

Suppose (E2 - E1) is 10,000 K * k, say. Let's say E2-E1 = 10,000 K * k. Then, for T=6000 K, (E2-E1)/(k T) = 10,000 /6000 ≈ 1.6667.

So exp(1.6667) ≈ 5.29.

If T increases to, say, 7000 K, then (E2-E1)/(k T) = 10,000 /7000 ≈ 1.4286.

exp(1.4286) ≈ 4.18.

So as T increases, the exponent (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp(...) decreases, making n1/n2 decrease. So n1/n2 is inversely proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) ), which increases with T.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of the ratio R = n1/n2.

R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

When T increases, (E2-E1)/(k T) decreases, so exp(...) decreases. So R decreases. So when T is higher, the ratio n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, that's opposite to what I thought earlier. Wait, let me take an example. Let's say E2 is higher than E1. At T=6000, R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k *6000) )

At T=5500, R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2-E1)/(k *5500) )

Because 5500 <6000, the denominator is smaller, so (E2-E1)/(k T) is larger, so exp is larger. So R2 > R1. So when T decreases, R increases.

But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when T is lower (5500 K), the ratio is lower than when it is higher (6000 K). But according to our calculation, R increases when T decreases. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I got the ratio backwards. Maybe the ratio being discussed is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Let me re-examine. The question says, "the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots." So the ratio n1/n2 is decreasing when T decreases.

Wait, when T decreases, n1/n2 increases as per the formula. But in the problem, it's decreasing. So that can't be right. So maybe the ratio being considered is n2/n1.

Wait, yes. Let's think about it. If the ratio n2/n1 decreases when the star has spots, then when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases. Because for n2/n1, higher T would increase the ratio.

So in the unspotted case (T=6000 K), n2/n1 is higher than in the spotted case (T=5500 K). So the factor by which the ratio changes is (n2_un/n1_un) / (n2_sp/n1_sp).

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_un) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T_sp) ) ]

The g2/g1 terms cancel, so we have exp( -ΔE/(k T_un) ) / exp( -ΔE/(k T_sp) ) )

Which is exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T_sp) - 1/(T_un)] )

Let me compute that.

ΔE = h c / λ. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, which is 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 meters.

h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s.

So h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ is 1448e-10 m, so ΔE = hc / λ = (1.9878e-25) / (1.448e-7) ≈ 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but that's in Joules. To get it into eV, because k (Boltzmann) is often used with eV.

1 eV ≈ 1.602e-19 J. So ΔE = 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate that again.

Wait, 1.9878e-25 J·m divided by 1.448e-7 m gives:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approx 1.373e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = approx 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

But wait, the energy levels are in eV, and T is in Kelvin.

Wait, but in the exponent, we have (E2 - E1)/(k T). So we can calculate (ΔE)/(k T).

But wait, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE is 8.57 eV.

So for T_un = 6000 K:

ΔE/(k T_un) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) ≈ 8.57 / (8.617e-5 * 6e3 )

Let's compute 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617e-5 *6000 = 8.617 * 0.6 = approx 5.17 e-4?

Wait, 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617e-5 *6 *1e3 = 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 8.617 *6e3 *1e-5 = 8.617 * 0.06 = 0.517.

So 8.57 / 0.517 ≈ 16.58.

Similarly, for T_sp =5500 K:

ΔE/(k T_sp) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5500 ) = 8.57 / (8.617e-5 *5.5e3 )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *5.5e3 = 8.617 *5.5e3 *1e-5 = 8.617 *0.055 ≈ 0.474.

So 8.57 / 0.474 ≈ 18.09.

So now, the exponent is:

ΔE/(k) [1/T_sp - 1/T_un] = 8.57/(8.617e-5) [ (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) ]

Wait, wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the exponent as [1/(T_sp) - 1/(T_un)] multiplied by ΔE/(k).

So let me compute that.

First, compute (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 -5500)/(5500*6000) ) = 500 / (3.3e7) ) ≈ 1.515e-5.

So 1.515e-5 K^-1.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) = (8.57 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) ≈ 8.57 /8.617e-5 ≈ 99462 K.

So 99462 K * 1.515e-5 K^-1 = 99462 * 1.515e-5 ≈ let's compute that.

99462 * 1.515e-5 = 99462 * 1.515 * 1e-5.

Compute 99462 * 1.515.

Hmm, approximate: 1e5 *1.5 = 1.5e5, but 99462 is ~1e5, so 1e5 * 1.5 is 1.5e5. So 1.5e5 *1e-5 = 1.5.

But more accurately, 99462 *1.515 = let's compute 100,000 *1.515 = 151,500. But since it's 99462, subtract 538 *1.515.

538 *1.515 ≈ 538*(1.5 + 0.015) )= 538*1.5 = 807, 538*0.015=8.07. So total 815.07. So 151,500 -815.07 ≈ 150,684.93.

Then multiply by 1e-5: 150,684.93e-5 = 1.5068493.

So the exponent is approximately 1.507.

So the factor is exp(1.507) ≈ e^1.507. Let's calculate that.

e^1 ≈2.718, e^1.5≈4.4817, e^1.6≈4.953. Let me compute e^1.507.

Compute 1.507 is between 1.5 and 1.51.

Using a calculator (or approximation):

e^1.5 ≈4.4817

e^1.507 ≈ e^(1.5) * e^0.007.

e^0.007 ≈1 +0.007 +0.007^2/2 ≈1.00700245.

So 4.4817 * 1.007 ≈4.4817 *1.007 ≈4.4817 + (4.4817 *0.007) =4.4817+0.03137≈4.513.

So the factor is approximately 4.51. Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

So the ratio when unspotted compared to spotted is ~4.5. So the factor is about 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we use the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \(n_2\) and \(n_1\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_2\) and \(g_1\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E = E_2 - E_1\) is the energy difference, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

### Key Information:
1. **Unspotted Case**: \(T_{\text{un}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\).
2. **Spotted Case**: \(T_{\text{sp}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\).
3. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å}\), so \(\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}\).
4. The ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning the ratio is higher in the unspotted case.

### Step 1: Calculate \(\Delta E\)
Using \(hc = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}\) and \(\lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} = 1.448 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m}\):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Convert to electron volts (\(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{1.373 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(\Delta E / (kT)\)
Boltzmann's constant is \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\). For the two temperatures:

1. **Unspotted Case** (\(T_{\text{un}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\)):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{un}}} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \times 6000} \approx \frac{8.57}{0.517} \approx 16.58.
\]

2. **Spotted Case** (\(T_{\text{sp}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\)):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{sp}}} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5} \times 5500} \approx \frac{8.57}{0.474} \approx 18.09.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the Ratio of Ratios
The ratio of the populations is proportional to:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{un}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{sp}}} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{un}}}\right) \div \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT_{\text{sp}}}\right).
\]

Simplify using the property of exponents:

\[
\frac{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{un}}}{\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)_{\text{sp}}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{sp}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{un}}}\right)\right).
\]

Substitute \(\Delta E = 8.57 \, \text{eV}\), \(k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K}\), \(T_{\text{un}} = 6000 \, \text{K}\), and \(T_{\text{sp}} = 5500 \, \text{K}\):

1. Compute \(\frac{1}{T_{\text{sp}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{un}}}\):

\[
\frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} = \frac{6000 - 5500}{5500 \times 6000} = \frac{500}{33000000} \approx 1.515 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

2. Compute \(\frac{\Delta E}{k}\):

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99462 \, \text{K}.
\]

3. Compute the exponent:

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_{\text{sp}}} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{un}}}\right) = 99462 \times 1.515 \times 10^{-5} \approx 1.507.
\]

4. Compute the final factor:

\[
\exp(1.507) \approx 4.51.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels is approximately 4.5 times higher when the star does not have spots compared to when it does.
