Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spin states and expectation values. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given, and the sigma_y matrix is provided.

Wait, so I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors, right? Like, for an electron, spin-up along z would be (1, 0) and spin-down would be (0, 1). But here, the state is (3i, 4). Hmm, so the first component is 3i, and the second is 4. I guess this is a normalized state vector, but maybe I should check its normalization just in case.

Wait, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product of the state with the operator acting on the ket. So for S_y, the expectation value <S_y> would be the state vector multiplied by sigma_y (the Pauli matrix for y), multiplied by the conjugate transpose of the state vector.

But wait, actually, in quantum mechanics, the expectation value is given by <ψ| O |ψ>, where O is the operator. So in this case, O is S_y. But S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by sigma_y. Because the Pauli matrices are for the spin-1/2 systems, and the actual spin operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

So first, perhaps I should write down the state vector. The state is given as (3i, 4). Let's represent it as a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. Wait, wait a second. Wait, I should double-check the order. Usually, the first component is the spin-up part, and the second is spin-down. But in any case, the math should handle it regardless of the order.

But wait, let's make sure the state is normalized. The norm is the sum of the absolute squares of the components. So |3i|^2 is (3)^2=9, and |4|^2 is 16. So 9 +16 =25. So the norm is sqrt
