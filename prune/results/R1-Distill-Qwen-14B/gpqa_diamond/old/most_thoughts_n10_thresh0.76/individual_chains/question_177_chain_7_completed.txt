Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the question is about comparing the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. I remember that luminosity has to do with how much light a star emits. The problem gives some specific details about the two stars.

First, the radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times larger. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity, and I think mass might not directly factor into that—maybe it's a red herring. Or perhaps it's related to the star's surface temperature somehow?

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a black body's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.898×10^-3 m·K) and T is the temperature in Kelvin. So if both stars have the same λ_max, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature. So T1 = T2.

Wait, so if Star_1 and Star_2 have the same temperature, then why would their luminosities be different? Because the question says that the computed luminosity of Star_1 is greater than Star_2 by a certain factor. So I must have missed something.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴. Oh, right, so L depends on the radius squared and temperature to the fourth power. Since both stars have the same temperature, T, then the luminosity ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T1 = T2, that part is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)².

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, then L1/L2 is (1.5)^2, which is 2.25. So the factor should be approximately 2.25, which is option A. But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes I might mix up the formula.

Wait, but another thought: the problem mentions radial velocities of 0 and 700 km/s. How does that factor into the calculation? Oh, right, because when a star is moving towards or away from us, there's a Doppler shift in the wavelength of the light we receive. But the problem says the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. So maybe the Doppler effect affects the observed temperature? Because if a star is moving towards us (like Star_1 with 0 velocity), its light would be blueshifted, making the observed wavelength shorter. But if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its light would be redshifted, making the observed wavelength longer. But the problem states that their wavelengths at maximum brightness are the same. How does that reconcile?

So let's think about that. The observed wavelengths λ_obs for each star are the same. But for Star_1, moving at 0 km/s, the observed wavelength λ1_obs is equal to λ1 (since there's no Doppler shift). For Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength λ2_obs is longer than λ2 (its rest wavelength). And the problem says λ1_obs = λ2_obs.

So λ1_obs = λ1 = λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c), because when moving away, the wavelength stretches. Wait, the Doppler shift formula for recession velocity is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c), where v is positive for moving away.

So for Star_1: λ1_obs = λ1 (since v1=0).
For Star_2: λ2_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ1_obs = λ1.

But λ is inversely proportional to temperature, so λ1 = b / T1 and λ2 = b / T2. But earlier I assumed T1 = T2 because λ1 = λ2. But wait, no, because λ_obs are the same but the rest wavelengths (λ1 and λ2) would be different since the stars are moving.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the observed λ_max is the same, but their actual λ_max (without Doppler shift) would be different. So T1 and T2 are not the same. So I made a mistake earlier. I thought that λ1 and λ2 are the same, but actually, their observed λ_max are the same, but their actual λ_max (rest frame) would be different.

So how does that affect the calculation? Let me re-examine.

Wien's law says that λ_max = b / T. But λ_max is in the star's rest frame. The observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_max / sqrt( (1 - v1/c)/(1 + v1/c) ) if the star is moving towards us, or λ_obs = λ_max * ( (1 + v2/c)/(1 - v2/c) )^(1/2) if moving away. Or wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact Doppler shift formula. Let me think again.

The relativistic Doppler shift formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c) ) when moving away. Wait no, wait. Actually, when a source is moving away, the observed wavelength increases (redshift). So λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). But that's the non-relativistic approximation. For small velocities, v << c, which is the case here (700 km/s is about 0.7e6 m/s; c is about 3e8 m/s, so v/c is about 0.0023, which is small). So the non-relativistic approximation should suffice.

So for Star_2, moving away at 700 km/s, the observed wavelength λ_obs is λ2*(1 + v2/c). And for Star_1, it's at rest, so λ_obs = λ1.

But the problem states that λ_obs is the same for both stars. So λ1 = λ2*(1 + v2/c).

But λ1 is the rest frame wavelength for Star_1, λ2 is the rest frame wavelength for Star_2. Since λ_max is inversely proportional to temperature, we have:

λ1 = b / T1
λ2 = b / T2

So substituting into the equation λ1 = λ2*(1 + v2/c):

b / T1 = (b / T2) * (1 + v2/c)
Divide both sides by b:

1/T1 = (1/T2) * (1 + v2/c)
Multiply both sides by T1*T2:

T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

So T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c)

We have v2 = 700 km/s. Let's compute (1 + v2/c). Let's calculate v2/c.

v2 = 700,000 m/s
c = 3e8 m/s = 300,000,000 m/s

v2/c = 700,000 / 300,000,000 = 7 / 300 ≈ 0.0023333...

So 1 + v2/c ≈ 1.0023333.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0023333.

But wait, because Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is longer, so the observed temperature would appear lower. But the problem says that their observed maxima are at the same wavelength, which would imply that the observed temperatures are the same. But their intrinsic temperatures are different because of the Doppler shift.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to find T1 and T2 in terms of each other.

From the equation above, T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ T1 * 1.0023333.

So T2 is a bit higher than T1. But wait, because for Star_2, the observed wavelength is longer, so its observed temperature is lower. But wait, no: the observed wavelength is the same as Star_1's rest wavelength. So if Star_1 has λ1 = b/T1, and Star_2's observed λ is λ2_obs = λ2*(1 + v2/c) = λ1.

So λ2 = λ1 / (1 + v2/c) → λ2 = λ1 / (1.0023333) = λ1 * (0.997674).

But since λ = b/T, a smaller λ implies a higher T. So λ2 = 0.997674 * λ1 → T2 = b / λ2 = b/(0.997674 λ1) ≈ (b/λ1) * 1.0023333 → T2 ≈ T1 * 1.0023333.

So T2 is about 0.23% higher than T1.

Wait, no, that's because when you have λ2 = (b / T2), and λ2 is less than λ1 (since λ_obs is same, but λ2 is λ_obs / (1 + v/c) ), which is less than λ1. So T2 = b/lambda2 → since lambda2 < lambda1, T2 > T1.

So Star_2 is hotter than Star_1.

Wait, so T2 = T1 (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.0023333 T1.

So now, let's get back to luminosity.

L = 4π R² sigma T^4.

So L1 = 4π R1² sigma T1^4.

L2 = 4π R2² sigma T2^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1^2 / R2^2) * (T1^4 / T2^4).

We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. So (R1/R2)^2 is 2.25.

T2 is approximately 1.0023333 T1, so T1 / T2 = 1 / 1.0023333 ≈ 0.997674.

So (T1 / T2)^4 ≈ (0.997674)^4.

Let me calculate that. 0.997674^4. Let me compute:

0.997674 ≈ 1 - 0.002326.

(1 - x)^4 ≈ 1 -4x +6x² -4x³ +x^4, for small x.

x=0.002326, so:

≈1 -4*(0.002326) +6*(0.002326)^2 - etc.

Compute each term:

4x = 0.009304.

6x² =6*(0.002326)^2 =6*(5.41e-6)=3.246e-5≈0.00003246.

So 1 - 0.009304 + 0.00003246 ≈0.990728.

So (T1^4)/(T2^4) ≈ 0.990728.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.990728 ≈ 2.228.

Wait, 2.25 * 0.990728 is approximately 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Looking back at the options, option D is ~2.23, which is close. Option A is 2.25, but that's without considering the Doppler effect. So the correct factor is approximately 2.23, which would be option D.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the astronomers computed the luminosity using the black body assumption. So perhaps they accounted for the Doppler shift? Or maybe they didn't, which would affect the luminosity calculation.

Wait, wait. The question states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So for the observer, both stars have the same λ_max, which means that their observed temperatures would be the same? No, because of Doppler shift. For the observer, the observed temperature would be the same because λ_obs is the same. But the intrinsic temperatures are different. So when computing luminosity as a black body, would they use the observed temperature or the intrinsic temperature?

Ah, this is a crucial point. Because the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity as black bodies. So they would calculate L based on the star's actual (intrinsic) temperature and radius, not the observed. But if they assume that the stars' surface temperatures are the same, because the observed λ_max are the same, then they would be incorrect because of the Doppler effect.

Wait, no. If they don't account for the Doppler shift, they would think that T1 = T2. But in reality, T2 is higher than T1.

So let's think about what the astronomers actually do. They observe the λ_max of each star and compute the temperature from Wien's law, assuming no Doppler shift. So the astronomer's computed T for each star would be T1 = b / λ1_obs, and T2 = b / λ2_obs. But λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ. So T1 and T2 would be calculated as equal. But in reality, because of the Doppler shift, Star_2's intrinsic temperature is higher.

So the luminosity calculation would be based on the intrinsic parameters, but if the astronomer didn't correct for Doppler shift, their computed luminosity would be wrong.

Wait, but the problem says, "assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity." So I think they used the observed λ_max to compute T.

So according to the astronomers' calculation, they would have assumed T1 = T2, since λ_obs are same. But in reality, T2 is higher.

Wait, but that can't be. Because the problem statement says that the astronomers calculated the luminosity, using the black body assumption. So perhaps they used the observed T, but considering the Doppler shift. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, let me clarify. Let me think about the steps the astronomers took:

1. They observed both stars and found the λ_max of each. They are the same, so λ1_obs = λ2_obs = λ.

2. Assuming the stars are black bodies, they used Wien's law to compute the temperature. So T1 = b / λ1_obs, T2 = b / λ2_obs. Since λ1_obs = λ2_obs, T1 = T2.

3. Then they used the Stefan-Boltzmann law to compute luminosity: L = 4π R² sigma T^4.

But in reality, Star_2 is moving away, so its observed T is lower than its actual T. So when the astronomers compute T2, they would get a lower value than the actual T2. Because λ_obs is larger than λ2_rest, so T_obs = T2_rest * (1 - v2/c)/(1 + v2/c) ?

Wait, no, perhaps I should compute the observed temperature from the observed wavelength. Let's think again. The observed λ_max is λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v/c). So for Star_2, which is moving away, λ_obs = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). So, from the observed λ_obs, the astronomer would compute T as:

T_obs = b / λ_obs = b / (λ2 * (1 + v2/c)) = T2 / (1 + v2/c).

So T_obs = T2 / (1.0023333). So the astronomer would think T2 is lower than it actually is.

But in reality, since the stars' intrinsic temperatures are different, but the astronomers are using the observed λ to compute T, they would get T1 = T2_obs = T2 / (1.0023333).

Wait, no, because λ_obs for both stars is the same. Let me make it clear.

Star_1's λ_rest is λ1, and it's not moving, so λ_obs1 = λ1. Thus, the astronomer computes T1 = b / λ_obs1 = b / λ1.

Star_2's λ_rest is λ2, and it's moving away, so λ_obs2 = λ2 * (1 + v2/c). But λ_obs2 = λ_obs1 = λ1. So, λ2 = λ1 / (1 + v2/c).

So T2_rest = b / λ2 = b / (λ1/(1 + v2/c)) ) = (b / λ1) * (1 + v2/c) ) = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So the intrinsic T2 is higher than T1.

But the astronomer, using λ_obs for both stars, computes T1 = T_obs1 = b/λ1, and T2_obs = b/λ_obs2 = b/λ1, so T1 = T2_obs. But the actual T2 is higher.

So when the astronomers compute the luminosity, they use L = 4 π R^2 sigma T^4, with T being the observed T. But the actual luminosities depend on the intrinsic T.

Wait, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity using black body radiation, and found L1 is greater than L2 by a certain factor. So the question is, what factor do the astronomers calculate, and what's the actual factor? Wait, the question says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So according to the astronomers' calculations, considering observed temperatures, what would their computed L1/L2 ratio be?

Wait, because for the astronomer, T1 = T2 = T (same observed T), and R1 = 1.5 R2. So their computed L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, which is option A. But wait, that would be the case if the astronomers don't account for the Doppler effect and assume T is same for both.

But the actual luminosity ratio is different because T2 is higher. So the question is about what factor the astronomers computed, or the actual luminosity factor?

Wait, the problem says: "Assuming that the stars radiate as black bodies, they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So the astronomers are using the observed data (including Doppler shifts) and the black body assumption. So they would have computed the temperatures based on the observed wavelengths. So for each star, they compute T using λ_obs.

In that case, since λ_obs is same for both, their computed T1 and T2 would be the same. So in their calculation, L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 → 2.25, which is option A.

But wait, that's not considering the actual luminosity. Because in reality, Star_2 is hotter, so its actual L is higher.

But the question is about what the astronomers computed, given their data. So the correct approach is:

Astronomers observe λ_obs for both stars same.

They use Wien's law to find T1 = T2 = b / λ_obs.

Then compute L for each star using L = 4π R^2 sigma T^4.

So L1 = 4 π (1.5 R2)^2 sigma T^4 → 4 π R2² sigma (1.5)^2 T^4.

L2 = 4 π R2² sigma T^4.

Thus, L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the factor is 2.25.

But wait, that would be option A. But earlier, considering the Doppler effect, the actual L2 would be higher because T2 is higher, but the question is about what the astronomers computed.

But I'm a bit confused. Because the question says that the astronomers computed the luminosity, which is based on their observed data. So based on the observed data, their calculated T is same for both, so L1/L2 is 2.25.

But wait, the problem says that the stars' luminosities are computed as black bodies. So the astronomers would take into account the Doppler effect when calculating the temperature. Or not? Do they correct for it?

This is the crux. If they don't correct for the Doppler shift, they would think that T1 = T2, so L1/L2 = 2.25. But if they do correct, then T2 is higher, so L2 would be higher than what they computed.

Wait, but the question is asking what factor the astronomers computed, not the actual luminosity ratio. So the astronomers used the observed wavelengths to compute T, and then L based on that. So since T1 and T2 (as per their calculation) are same, the L1/L2 is (R1/R2)^2=2.25.

But wait, the problem statement says that the stars' luminosities were computed, assuming they radiate as black bodies. So the astronomers' calculation would have to correct for Doppler shift to find the intrinsic T, otherwise, their computed L wouldn't be correct.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to approach it another way.

Let me compute the actual luminosities and see.

Star_1:

R1 = 1.5 R2.

T1 = b / λ1, where λ1 is the observed λ_max. Because Star_1 isn't moving, λ1 = λ_rest1.

Star_2:

λ_obs2 = λ_rest2 * (1 + v2/c) = λ1.

So λ_rest2 = λ1 / (1 + v2/c) → T2 = b / λ_rest2 = b / ( λ1 / (1 + v2/c) ) ) = (b/λ1) * (1 + v2/c) ) → T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So actual T2 = T1 * (1 + v2/c) ≈ 1.002333 T1.

So actual L1 = 4 π R1^2 sigma T1^4.

Actual L2 =4 π R2^2 sigma T2^4.

So L1/L2 actual = (R1² / R2² ) * (T1^4 / T2^4) ) = (2.25) * (1/( (1.002333)^4 ) ).

Calculating (1.002333)^4:

Let me compute 1.002333^4.

First, compute ln(1.002333) ≈ 0.002329 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x).

So ln(1.002333)^4 ≈ 4 * 0.002329 = 0.009316.

Then exponentiate: e^0.009316 ≈ 1 + 0.009316 + (0.009316^2)/2 + ... → approximately 1.00938.

So 1/(1.00938) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 actual ≈ 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

But the question is about what the astronomers computed. If they didn't account for the Doppler shift, then they would think T2 = T1, and L1/L2 = 2.25. But if they did account for it, they would compute a different ratio.

But the problem says the astronomers computed L based on black body radiators, using the observed wavelengths. So I think they would have to correct for the Doppler shift. Because when you observe a star's spectrum, you have to correct for Doppler shift to get the intrinsic properties.

Wait, but the problem says that in the problem statement, the astronomers found the same wavelengths. So perhaps they didn't correct for Doppler shift, and thus assumed same T for both stars.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the L ratio based on their observed data, without considering the Doppler effect. Because the problem says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of:"

So perhaps the Doppler shift is irrelevant, because when calculating luminosity from observed data, you have to correct for the Doppler shift. So the astronomers would have done that.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each option is.

The options are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23.

If the astronomers didn't correct for Doppler shift and assumed T1=T2, then L1/L2 =2.25 (option A). But if they did correct, and found T2 is higher, then L1/L2 would be 2.228 (option D).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the actual luminosity, which is 2.228, so option D.

But the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming black body. So it depends on whether they accounted for the Doppler shift in their computations.

Wait, let's clarify.

If the astronomers used the observed λ_max to calculate T, they would find T1 = T2, because the observed λ_max are same. Then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. So that's option A.

But if the astronomers know about the Doppler shift and correct for it, then they would compute T2 higher, leading to L1/L2 being less than 2.25.

But the problem states that the stars appear brightest at same λ_max. So the observed λ_max are same, but the actual λ_max (rest frame) are different.

So the astronomers, when calculating the luminosity, would have to correct for Doppler shift to find the correct T.

Wait, but in reality, to compute the luminosity correctly, you need to know the star's intrinsic parameters. So for each star, you would calculate T correctly by accounting for Doppler shift.

So for Star_1, T1 = b / λ1_obs.

For Star_2, T2 = b / (λ2_rest) = b / (λ_obs2 / (1 + v2/c)) ) = (b / λ_obs2) * (1 + v2/c) = T1 * (1 + v2/c).

So when computing luminosity, the astronomers would know to use the corrected T for Star_2.

So their calculation would be:

L1 = 4 π R1² sigma T1^4.

L2 =4 π R2² sigma T2^4 =4 π R2² sigma (T1 (1 + v2/c))^4.

So L1/L2 = ( R1² / R2² ) * ( T1^4 / (T1^4 (1 + v2/c)^4 )) ) = ( R1² / R2² ) * ( 1 / (1 + v2/c)^4 )

We have R1 = 1.5 R2 → R1/R2 = 1.5 → (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

(1 + v2/c) = 1.0023333, so (1 + v2/c)^4 ≈ (1.0023333)^4.

Let me compute 1.0023333^4 accurately.

Using a calculator (if I had one), but since I don't, I'll compute it step by step.

1.0023333^2 = approximately 1.0046666.

Then (1.0046666)^2 = ?

Compute 1.0046666 * 1.0046666.

= (1 + 0.0046666)^2

= 1 + 2*(0.0046666) + (0.0046666)^2

= 1 + 0.0093332 + 0.000021777 ≈ 1.009355.

So (1.002333)^4 ≈ 1.009355.

So 1/(1.009355) ≈ 0.9907.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9907 ≈ 2.228.

Which is approximately 2.23, option D.

So the correct answer would be option D.


To determine the factor by which the luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2, we analyze the problem using the given data and the Stefan-Boltzmann law for luminosity:

### Key Information:
1. **Radius**: \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \).
2. **Mass**: \( M_1 = 1.5 M_2 \) (not directly relevant to luminosity).
3. **Observed Wavelengths**: Both stars appear brightest at the same wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \)).
4. **Radial Velocities**: \( v_1 = 0 \, \text{km/s}, v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \).
5. **Doppler Effect**: Since Star_2 is moving away, its observed wavelength is redshifted, while Star_1's wavelength remains unchanged.

### Step 1: Temperature Relationship
The observed wavelength at which a star appears brightest is related to its surface temperature via Wien's law:
\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \frac{b}{T},
\]
where \( b \) is Wien's displacement constant. For Star_1, \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_1 \), and for Star_2, \( \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} = \lambda_2 \cdot (1 + v_2/c) \). Since \( \lambda_{\text{obs,1}} = \lambda_{\text{obs,2}} \), we have:
\[
\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 \cdot (1 + v_2/c).
\]
Using \( \lambda = b/T \), the relationship between the intrinsic temperatures becomes:
\[
T_1 = T_2 \cdot (1 + v_2/c).
\]
Substituting \( v_2 = 700 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we find:
\[
\frac{v_2}{c} = \frac{700}{300,000} \approx 0.002333, \quad 1 + \frac{v_2}{c} \approx 1.002333.
\]
Thus:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333.
\]

### Step 2: Luminosity Relationship
The luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
\[
L = 4 \pi R^2 \sigma T^4.
\]
The luminosity ratio is:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \frac{R_1^2 T_1^4}{R_2^2 T_2^4}.
\]
Substituting \( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \) and \( T_2 = T_1 \cdot 1.002333 \), we get:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4.
\]
1. **Radius Contribution**: \( \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25 \).
2. **Temperature Contribution**: \( \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \).

To compute \( \left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \), we approximate:
\[
\ln(1.002333) \approx 0.002329, \quad \ln\left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right) \approx -0.002329.
\]
\[
\ln\left(\left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4\right) = 4 \cdot (-0.002329) = -0.009316.
\]
\[
\left(\frac{1}{1.002333}\right)^4 \approx e^{-0.009316} \approx 0.9907.
\]

### Step 3: Final Luminosity Ratio
Combining the contributions:
\[
\frac{L_1}{L_2} = 2.25 \cdot 0.9907 \approx 2.228.
\]

### Conclusion
The luminosity of Star_1 is greater than that of Star_2 by a factor of approximately **2.23**, which corresponds to **Option D**.
