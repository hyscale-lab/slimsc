Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. Alright, the question is about finding the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. 

First, I'll try to unpack the given information. Both stars have masses larger than our Sun, but I'm not sure if that matters directly for the problem. Let's see, the data given involves elemental abundances using the EW method, which I think stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm more focused on the [X/Y] notation, which I remember represents logarithmic abundance ratios.

So, Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. Wait, what's [Si/Fe] mean again? Oh right, it's the logarithm of the ratio of silicon to iron abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(N_X/N_Y) - log10(N_X/N_Y)_Sun. Or wait, another way, N_X/N_Y = 10^([X/Y]) * (N_X/N_Y)_Sun.

Similarly, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 for Star_2. So Mg to Si ratio in Star_2 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. 

Then, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Hmmm, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of the ratio of iron to hydrogen abundance relative to the Sun. So if [Fe/H]_1 is 0, then (Fe/H)_1 is the same as (Fe/H)_Sun. So the iron abundance in Star_1 is solar. 

Same with [Mg/H]_2 being 0, which means Mg/H in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. 

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me parse that properly. The Sun's data is 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7. So, I think that's saying log(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Similarly, log(nMg/nH) is 7 -12 = -5. 

Wait, but wait, I might be getting this wrong. Let me think. The standard way to express abundance is usually 12 + log10(n_X / n_H) = value. So for the Sun, for Fe, it's 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 → log(nFe/nH) =-4.5 → nFe/nH =10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log(nMg/nH)=7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So, for the Sun: nFe = 1e-4.5 * nH. And nMg =1e-5 *nH.

Now, I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms (nSi) in Star_1 and Star_2. So, nSi_1 / nSi_2.

To do this, I think I'll have to find the silicon abundance in each star relative to hydrogen, then compute the ratio.

Let's think about Star_1 first.

For Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 =0, which means Fe/H = Fe/H_sun. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. 

Also, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, so Si/Fe in Star_1 is 10^0.3 times that of the Sun. So, (nSi_1 / nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun / nFe_sun).

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun). Wait, but wait, I'm probably getting confused here. Let me think in terms of ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express all abundances in terms of hydrogen.

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 =0 → (Fe/H)_1 = (Fe/H)_sun → nFe_1 = nFe_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun)

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, log(nFe_1/nH_1) = log(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So, nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun/nH_sun. So, nFe_1 = (nFe_sun/nH_sun) * nH_1.

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3. [Si/Fe]_1 = log(nSi_1/nFe_1) - log(nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3. So, log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) =0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But since nFe_1 = (nFe_sun * nH_1) / nH_sun, let's plug that in.

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (10^0.3 * nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = [ (nFe_sun * nH_1) /nH_sun ) ] * (10^0.3 * nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Simplify this:

nSi_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) * (10^0.3 * nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

nFe_sun cancels out. So:

nSi_1 = nH_1 * (10^0.3) * (nSi_sun ) / nH_sun )

Which can be written as:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nH_sun ?

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think in terms of ratios.

nSi_1 = nSi_sun * (nH_1 / nH_sun) * 10^([Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1) )

Wait, because [X/H]_1 is [X/Y]_1 + [Y/H]_1. Oh wait no, because [X/H]_1 is the abundance of X relative to H, so if I have [X/Y]_1 and [Y/H]_1, then [X/H]_1 = [X/Y]_1 + [Y/H]_1.

Wait, no, [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( (nX/nH) / (nX_sun/nH_sun) ) = log( (nX/nX_sun) * (nH_sun /nH) ) ) = log(nX/nX_sun) - log(nH/nH_sun).

Wait, perhaps it's not that straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I can find [Si/H]_1 for Star_1.

Because [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, and [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1. Because [X/Y] = [X/H] - [Y/H], since [X/Y] = log(X/Y) - log(X/Y_sun) = [X/H]_ - [Y/H]_sun.

Wait, let me think about that. [X/Y]_star = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) ) = log( (nX/nY) * (nY_sun /nX_sun) ) ) = log(nX/nX_sun) - log(nY/nY_sun) ) = [X/H]_star - [Y/H]_star_sun? Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute [Si/H]_1 using the given [Si/Fe] and [Fe/H].

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = [Si/H]_1 - [Fe/H]_1.

So [Si/H]_1 = [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1.

Since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

So for Star_1, the silicon abundance relative to hydrogen is 0.3 dex. Which means:

log(nSi_1 /nH_1) = log(nSi_sun /nH_sun) ) + 0.3.

So, nSi_1/nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So, nSi_1 = nH_1 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/H]_2 is 0 → same as the Sun. So nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun.

And [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. Which is log( (nMg_2/nSi_2) / (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) ) )=0.3.

So, (nMg_2/nSi_2) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

But nMg_2 = nMg_sun * nH_2 /nH_sun.

So substituting:

( (nMg_sun * nH_2 /nH_sun) ) / nSi_2 ) = 10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

Cancel nMg_sun from both sides:

(nH_2 /nH_sun ) / nSi_2 = 10^0.3 * (1 /nSi_sun )

=> nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3 )

So, nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun) / (10^0.3 )

Now, we have expressions for nSi_1 and nSi_2 in terms of their respective hydrogen abundances and the solar values.

But wait, how are nH_1 and nH_2 related to each other? Because in stars, the total number of hydrogen can vary, but unless given any more information about the overall metallicity or other factors, perhaps I can assume that H is normalized per the same number as the Sun, or that the stars have similar H content? Wait, but no, that's not necessarily given. Hmm, perhaps I need to relate the hydrogen abundance between the stars.

Wait, the problem is to find the ratio of silicon atoms in Star 1 and Star 2: nSi_1 / nSi_2.

So substituting the expressions I have:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun ) / (10^0.3 )

Wait, no, let me recheck the expressions.

Wait, for Star_1: nSi_1 = [nH_1 /nH_sun ] * [nSi_sun /nH_sun ] *10^0.3

Wait, no, wait from earlier: nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 ?

Wait, perhaps I should re-express each step.

Wait, for Star_1:

nSi_1 = (nH_1) * (nSi_sun / nH_sun) * 10^0.3

Wait, because:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 / nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 *nH_sun ?

No, I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should approach this using [X/H] values.

Since for Star_1, [Si/H]_1 = 0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2, what is [Si/H]_2?

Because for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 and [Mg/H]_2=0.

So [Mg/Si]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Si/H]_2 = 0.3.

Because [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H].

So 0.3 = 0 - [Si/H]_2 → [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So, [Si/H]_2 = -0.3.

So for Star_2, nSi_2 = nSi_sun *10^(-0.3) * (nH_2 /nH_sun )

Because [X/H] = log(nX/nH) - log(nX_sun/nH_sun) = 0.3 for Star_1, and -0.3 for Star_2.

Now, the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2 would be:

(nSi_1 / nSi_2) = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [ (nH_2 / nH_sun ) * 10^(-0.3) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ) ]

Wait, so let me write it out:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3)

So ratio is:

(nSi_1 /nSi_2) = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3) ) ]

Simplify:

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.3 - (-0.3)) )

= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.6)

But wait, how do I find nH_1 /nH_2? Because the stars have different masses, but I'm not given any information about their overall composition or surface gravities, which would affect the scale of their atmospheres.

Wait, perhaps the stars' overall abundances are such that their [Fe/H] is the same as the Sun for Star_1, and [Mg/H] is same as Sun for Star_2. But I'm not sure if that helps with the H abundance.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.

If I consider that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, that means the abundance of Fe relative to H in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so nMg_2 /nH_2 = nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But I'm trying to find the ratio of nSi in both stars. Since I have [Si/Fe]_1 and [Mg/Si]_2, perhaps I can express [Si/H] for each star and then find the ratio.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express both silicon abundances relative to the Sun.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1 = 0.3 → nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

For Star_2:

[Si/H]_2 = [Mg/H]_2 - [Mg/Si]_2 → [Si/H]_2 =0 -0.3 → -0.3.

So, nSi_2 /nH_2 =10^(-0.3) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

Now, the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) = [10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [10^(-0.3) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] = 10^(0.6) = approx 3.98 ≈4.

But wait, the ratio is (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2) ) = 10^(0.3 +0.3) )=10^0.6.

But the question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2: nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Which would be (nSi_1/nH_1) * (nH_2 /nSi_2) )

Wait no, because:

nSi_1 /nSi_2 = [ (nSi_1/nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2) ) ] * (nH_2 /nH_1 )

But I don't know nH_2/nH_1. So unless there's another way to find that, perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the other data given. Star_1 has [Fe/H]=0, so same Fe abundance as Sun. Star_2 has [Mg/H]=0, same as Sun.

But how does that help me find nH_1 and nH_2?

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of H in the two stars is the same as the ratio of the star's masses, but I don't think that's necessarily the case. Because the number of hydrogen atoms depends on the star's overall composition and structure, not just mass.

Wait, but perhaps for main-sequence stars, the surface gravity and temperature affect the line formation, but the problem statement doesn't provide any info on that, so maybe I can assume that nH_1 =nH_2? Because for the Sun, the number of H in the photosphere is determined by its composition, but without knowing the H content of the stars, perhaps the problem assumes that the H abundance is the same. Wait, but the problem says to assume LTE and using EW method, but I'm not sure if that affects the H abundance.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H abundance ratio cancels out. Let me think again.

Wait, I have:

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun ) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3)

So the ratio is:

(nSi_1 /nSi_2) = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun ) *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3) ) ] 

The (nH_sun) terms cancel, so it becomes (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^(0.6).

But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, can I proceed? Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is designed such that the H abundances are the same in both stars. But is that a valid assumption? No, because we don't have any data about that. So perhaps I'm missing a detail.

Wait, let's think about the solar photospheric values given. Sun's nFe/nH is 1e-4.5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

Wait, but for the problem, the [X/H] values are defined relative to the Sun. So perhaps the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that can't be right because stars can have different metallicities.

Wait, no, because [Fe/H] for Star_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance is same as the Sun. But for H, the [H/H]_Sun is zero, but in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, but [H] could vary.

Wait, perhaps the stars have the same overall H abundance, but I'm not given that. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2 is 1, i.e., the stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms per unit volume. But why would that be the case? Without more information, I can't assume that. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the ratio nH_1/nH_2 is 1. I'll proceed under that assumption, even if it might not be accurate, because I can't find another way.

If nH_1 =nH_2, then the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 is 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98, which is about 4. Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9. So the answer would be option A.

But wait, wait a minute. Let me recheck. Because in the ratio, it's (nH_1 /nH_2 ) *10^0.6. If nH_1 =nH_2, then the ratio is 1 *10^0.6 ~3.98.

So that's option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the [Si/H] values.

Wait, let me go back. For Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. [Mg/H]_2 =0. So [Mg/Si] = [Mg/H] - [Si/H] → 0.3=0 - [Si/H] → [Si/H] is -0.3.

So for Star_2, [Si/H] is -0.3, so nSi_2 /nH_2 =10^(-0.3) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

So, when I take the ratio, nSi_1 /nSi_2 = (nH_1 *10^0.3 *nSi_sun/(nH_sun)^2 ) / (nH_2 *10^(-0.3) *nSi_sun/(nH_sun) )) 

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, let me write the expressions again.

nSi_1 = (nH_1 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^0.3

nSi_2 = (nH_2 /nH_sun) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3)

So, nSi_1 / nSi_2 = [ (nH_1 /nH_sun) *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 /nH_sun ) *10^(-0.3) ) ]

The nH_sun terms cancel.

So, this becomes (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^(0.3 +0.3) )= (nH_1 /nH_2 ) * 10^0.6.

But without knowing the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2, I can't compute the exact value.

Wait, unless the problem assumes that the ratio of H is 1, making nH_1 =nH_2, then the ratio becomes 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

But wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me revisit the definitions.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of silicon atoms per unit hydrogen, but perhaps the stars have the same number of hydrogen atoms, so nH_1 =nH_2. But why would that be the case? Well, perhaps because both stars are main-sequence and have similar masses, but without more data, I can't be certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me see what each star's [Si/H] is and then compute the ratio.

So for Star_1, [Si/H] =0.3 → nSi_1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_1.

For Star_2, [Si/H] =-0.3 → nSi_2 =10^(-0.3) * (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) *nH_2.

So the ratio is (nSi_1 /nSi_2) = (10^0.3 /10^(-0.3 )) * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

Which is 10^0.6 * (nH_1 /nH_2 )

But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the H abundance is the same between the two stars. So, if nH_1 =nH_2, then the ratio is 10^0.6 ≈3.98, which is option A.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't mention anything about the H abundance, so I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the problem takes H as the same, so the ratio would be ~4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is approximately 10^0.6. So that would be the answer.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition.

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex: The ratio of silicon to iron in Star_1 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun.
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex: The iron-to-hydrogen abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex: The ratio of magnesium to silicon in Star_2 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun.
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex: The magnesium-to-hydrogen abundance in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun.

3. **Solar Photospheric Composition**:
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \), so \( n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-4.5} \).
   - \( 12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \) → \( \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \), so \( n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5} \).

### Analysis:
#### Star_1:
- Since [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the iron-to-hydrogen abundance in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- Using [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the silicon-to-iron abundance in Star_1 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
  \]
- Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \), we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]

#### Star_2:
- Since [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the magnesium-to-hydrogen abundance in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun: \( n_{\text{Mg,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}}/n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
- Using [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the magnesium-to-silicon abundance in Star_2 is \( 10^{0.3} \) times that of the Sun:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}.
  \]
- Rearranging, we find:
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Abundances:
The ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}}{\frac{n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}} = \frac{10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}}{10^{-0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,2}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit information about the hydrogen abundances in the two stars. Assuming \( n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{H,2}} \), the ratio simplifies to:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]
Calculating \( 10^{0.6} \):
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \approx 4.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

ANSWER: A
