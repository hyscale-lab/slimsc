Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand the target molecule: 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Its structure should be a phenyl group attached to a ketone. The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. So the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, waitâ€”actually, when substituents are on the benzene ring, their positions are determined relative to the point of attachment. Since the ketone is attached at position 1 (the ethan-1-one part), the substituents would be on the same ring.

So the benzene ring has the ketone (from ethan-1-one) at position 1. Then, the nitro group is at position 5, and the bromine is at position 3. So the substituents are on adjacent positions? Let me visualize this: position 1 has the ketone, position 3 is bromo, position 5 is nitro. Hmm, so that's meta to each other.

Wait, no. If position 1 is the ketone, then positions 3 and 5 would be two positions away from it, which are meta to each other. So the nitro group is at position 5 (which is meta to position 1) and bromine is at position 3 (also meta to position 1). So they are both in the meta positions relative to the ketone.

But wait, benzene is a ring, so 1,3,5 positions are all meta to each other. So, in this case, the benzene has a ketone at 1, nitro at 5, and bromo at 3. So that's a 3-bromo-5-nitro substitution on the benzene ring which is attached to a ketone group (position 1).

So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ketone (position 1), nitro (position 5), bromo (position 3). Wait, but wait, the compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So phenyl group is substituted at positions 3 and 5 with Br and NO2, respectively. So the structure is: the ethanone is attached to the benzene ring, and the benzene has Br at position 3 and NO2 at position 5.

So, to make this, I need to figure out the order of substituents. Since each substitution step can have directing effects, the order matters a lot.

The starting material is benzene. So we're adding substituents to benzene in some order.

I know that nitration is a meta director, bromination is a meta/ortho director, and acetylation (like with CH3COCl) is a meta director. But wait, when you have a ketone group attached to the benzene, it behaves as a meta director because the carbonyl is an
