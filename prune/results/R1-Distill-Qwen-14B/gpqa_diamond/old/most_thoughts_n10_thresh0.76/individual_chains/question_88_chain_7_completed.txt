Okay, so I've got this question here about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but let's try to break this down.

So the setup: They tagged the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and gave them to mice orally. Then they imaged the mice and saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid and some stuck in intestinal mucus. Then they looked at the Peyer's patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability.

Wait, Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. So the GFP-tagged proteins probably got taken up by these patches.

The variable heavy chain genes showing high variability... I remember that when B cells encounter an antigen, they undergo some kind of diversification. But what exactly happens?

Looking at the options:

A) Somatic hypermutation: This is a process where B cells can mutate their variable regions after activation, increasing diversity. It happens in the germinal centers during the immune response. So this could lead to high variability in the variable regions.

B) Complement activation: That's part of the innate immune response, leading to stuff like opsonization or lysis. But I don't think this directly affects the variable regions of antibodies. So probably not this one.

C) Class switching recombination: This changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) but doesn't affect the variable regions. So sequencing variable chain genes wouldn't show much change here.

D) VDJ recombination: That's the process during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, J segments are combined to form the variable region. This creates the initial diversity. But if the cells are already mature and activated, this process wouldn't happen again. Wait, but the question says the cells are proliferating. So maybe it's after the initial VDJ?

So the experiment involved isolating proliferating cells. Somatic hypermutation occurs in germinal centers, where B cells proliferate and mutate. That would cause the variable regions to change, leading to high variability in the gene sequences. 

So the process would be somatic hypermutation. That makes sense because when the rotavirus proteins are taken up by Peyer's patches, the B cells there get activated. They then enter the germinal centers and undergo somatic hypermutation, increasing the diversity of their antibodies to better bind the antigen.

The other options don't fit as well. Complement activation doesn't change the variable regions. Class switching doesn't change the variable part. VDJ is during initial B cell development, which already happened before this experiment.


The experiment involves tagging rotavirus inner capsid proteins with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP fluorescence is observed to be affected by stomach acid and intestinal mucus, but some fluorescence reaches the Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Peyer patches are specialized for antigen sampling and immune responses to enteric pathogens. The isolated proliferating cell population from these patches shows high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences upon sequencing.

Key analysis of the options:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, where B cells diversify their variable regions by mutating their genes. This explains the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes, as somatic hypermutation is a mechanism that increases antibody diversity after antigen activation.

- **B) Complement activation**: This is part of the innate immune response and does not directly affect the variable regions of antibodies. It is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process changes the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) but does not alter the variable regions of the antibody. Therefore, it does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where V, D, and J segments are combined to form the initial diversity of the variable region. However, this process happens during early B cell development and is not relevant to the proliferating cells isolated in this experiment, which are likely mature B cells undergoing further diversification.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain genes is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, a process that occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, allowing B cells to diversify their antigen-binding regions. This aligns with the experimental observations.

Answer: A
