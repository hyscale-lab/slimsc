Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me take a deep breath and start thinking.

Alright, the problem is about an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, so first, I remember that the potential energy in an electrostatic system comes from the interactions between charges. Since the system is isolated, I'm dealing with electrostatic potential energy here. 

Wait, the formula for the potential energy between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant. But when there are multiple charges, I think the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair.

Right, so for N charges, each interacting with every other, the total potential energy U_total would be (1/(2 * 4πε₀)) ) * sum over all pairs (q_i * q_j / r_ij). But wait, in this case, all the charges are identical except for their positions. Let me see.

Wait, no, all the charges are identical. Each has charge 2e. So all q's are the same. So each charge is 2e. So the total potential energy would be the sum of all the pairwise interactions.

But let's think about the setup. We have 13 charges, but one is fixed at point P. The other 12 are at a distance of 2 meters from P. So, the 13th charge is at P, let's call it q13, and the other 12 are q1 to q12, each at 2m from P.

So I need to calculate the potential energy contributed by all the interactions. Let's break it down into different parts.

First, the interaction between the fixed charge (q13) and each of the 12 charges (q1 to q12). Each of these is at a distance of 2 meters. Then, the interactions among the 12 charges themselves, which are all at 2m from P and presumably from each other as well.

Wait, but wait a second. If each of the 12 charges is constrained to stay at 2 meters from P, does that mean they're all at the same distance from P but perhaps arranged in a spherical shell or something? So the distance between any two of the 12 charges (q_i and q_j) would be the same? Not exactly. Because if they're all on a sphere of radius 2m, then the distance between any two charges depends on the angle between them. Oh, but wait, if they're fixed in place, maybe the problem is considering that all the 12 charges are the same distance apart? Or maybe the problem is considering that the distances are all 2 meters, but that's not possible for 12 charges on a sphere. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that all these 12 charges are placed in such a way that they're each 2 meters away from P, but their mutual distances are perhaps much larger, making their mutual interactions negligible? Or maybe the problem is only considering the energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not their mutual interactions. That might be a possibility, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says it's an isolated system. So all interactions contribute. But it's given that 12 charges are constrained at 2m from P. I don't know if their mutual distances are the same. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of those 12 charges is at 2m from P, but their distances from each other are not given, so perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the others, and not between the moving charges themselves. Hmm, that could be possible, but I think the problem expects me to consider all interactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that they are all equally distant from each other, but that's probably not the case. I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me re-read the problem. It says that 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 m from point P. The 13th is fixed at P. So, the 12 are all at 2 meters from P, but their mutual distances are not specified. Hmm. So perhaps the way to model this is to consider that each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge, but their distances from each other are not given. But since they're in a fixed arrangement, their mutual distances are fixed, but since the problem doesn't specify, maybe I should assume that their mutual distances are the same as 2 m, which is probably not correct, but perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the fixed charge and the others, not their mutual interactions. Hmm, but that doesn't sound right because the energy of the system includes all interactions.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the minimum energy. So perhaps the system's configuration can be arranged in a way that the potential energy is minimized. Wait, but all the charges are fixed except for the 12. No, wait, the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but perhaps their mutual distances can vary? Or are they fixed in place as well?

Wait, the problem says that the 12 are constrained to stay at 2m from P, but nothing about their mutual positions. So perhaps the 12 can be arranged in such a way as to minimize the total potential energy. But wait, because charges repel each other. So arranging them as far apart as possible would minimize the repulsive potential energy. Hmm, but maybe in this case, since all the 12 are at the same distance from P, but their mutual distances are variable, but perhaps the problem is ignoring that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the energy among the 12 themselves. Because that's the only thing given.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum energy of this system". So perhaps the system's energy is the sum of the potential energies between the fixed charge and each of the 12, plus the potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges. But since I don't have the distances between the 12 charges, perhaps I need to make an assumption.

Wait, perhaps the 12 charges are all located at a distance of 2 m from P, but at the same point, which would be impossible because they would repel each other, but perhaps the problem is considering that they are all at the same point, which can't be, but perhaps the problem is just considering the potential between the fixed charge and the others, and the mutual interactions are negligible or zero. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual interactions are considered to be at a very large distance, so their potential energies are negligible. But that doesn't make sense because if they're all at 2 m from P, their mutual distances could be as close as 0 (if they are at the same point) or up to 4 m (if they're on opposite sides of P). But without knowing their arrangement, I can't compute their mutual potential energies.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12, and not the interactions between the 12 themselves. Because if that's the case, then the total potential energy U is simply the sum of each of the 12 charges' interactions with the fixed charge.

Let me think: each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from P. So for each of these 12, the potential energy between q13 (at P) and qi (at 2 m) is U_i = k * (q13 * qi) / (2 m). Since all are identical, q13 = qi = 2e. So each U_i is k * (2e * 2e) / (2 m) = k*(4e²)/(2m) = 2k e² / m.

Since there are 12 such charges, the total from these interactions is 12 * 2k e² / (2m) )? Wait, no, wait. Wait, each interaction is between q13 and each of the 12, so 12 terms. Each term is (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m). So per pair, it's k*(4e²)/(2m) = (k*4e²)/(2m) = 2k e²/(m).

Wait, no, wait: 2e * 2e is 4e². Then divided by r, which is 2 m. So each term is k * 4e² / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / m. And since there are 12 such charges, the total would be 12 * (2 k e² / m) = 24 k e² / (m).

But wait, that's just the potential energy between q13 and each of the 12. What about the potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges themselves?

Ah, right. So the total potential energy is the sum of:

1. The potential energy between q13 and each of the 12 charges → 12 terms.

2. The potential energy between each pair of the 12 charges → C(12,2) = 66 terms.

But without knowing the exact distances between each pair of the 12 charges, how can I calculate their contributions? Unless the 12 charges are arranged in a way that all mutual distances are the same, which would be a symmetric arrangement, perhaps on a sphere. But that's a big assumption.

Wait, but the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the system can arrange itself in the configuration that gives the minimal total potential energy. For identical charges, which are all positive (since each is 2e), the potential energy would be minimized when the charges are as far apart as possible. But in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to be at 2 meters from P. So their positions are fixed at 2m from P, but their mutual distances could vary, perhaps allowing the system to minimize the mutual repulsion.

But the problem says "the minimum energy of this system," so perhaps the mutual potential energies are to be considered in their minimal possible arrangement. But without knowing the exact arrangement, this seems tricky.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simplifying things and only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual energies between the 12. Because the problem doesn't mention the mutual distances. That would make the calculation manageable, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, but I think that the energy of the system would include all interactions. So I should find a way to compute all of them.

Wait, but maybe all the 12 charges are located very far apart from each other, so their mutual potential energies are negligible. But that's probably not the case because they're all at 2m from P. So the maximum possible distance between any two would be 4m (diametrically opposite points), but the minimum could be much less.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are all 2m from each other. But that would only be possible if they're on the vertices of a regular icosahedron or something, but that's a stretch.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The problem's options are in the order of 1e-26 J, which is a very small number. So maybe the mutual interactions between the 12 charges are negligible compared to the interactions between each and the fixed charge.

Wait, let's compute the energies. Let's calculate both parts, but perhaps the mutual part is small.

First, compute the energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others.

Each of these 12 charges is at a distance of 2 m from the fixed charge. So for each, the potential energy is:

U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) = k * (4 e²) / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / m

Since there are 12 such charges, the total U1 = 12 * (2 k e² / m) = 24 k e² / m

Now, what about the mutual potential energies between each pair of the 12 charges?

Each pair contributes U_ij = k * (2e) * (2e) / r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charge i and j.

But r_ij depends on their positions. Without knowing the arrangement, it's impossible to calculate exactly. So perhaps the problem expects me to assume that all the mutual distances are much larger than 2m, making their contributions negligible. Or perhaps the problem expects us to ignore them.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are all at the same point. But that would mean r_ij = 0, which would lead to infinite potential energy, which is not practical. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that the mutual potential energy is zero. But that's possible only if they're arranged symmetrically, but I'm not sure if that leads to zero energy.

Wait, another approach: since the 12 charges are constrained at 2 m from P, but their positions can vary as long as they're at that radius. The minimum potential energy configuration would involve them being as far apart as possible, perhaps arranged in a way to minimize the repulsion. But without knowing their arrangement, it's tricky.

Wait, but I'm given four options, all of which are on the order of 1e-26 J except option D, which is 122 J. So the correct answer is probably one of the first three.

Wait, let's compute the first part: the energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others. Then perhaps the mutual part is smaller and can be neglected.

Let me compute U1 = 24 k e² / (2 m) ?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, each is at 2m from P, so r is 2 m. So the formula is U_i = k*(2e)*(2e)/(2m) = k*(4 e²)/(2 m) = (k * 4 e²) / (2 m) ) = (2 k e²) / m )

Wait, no, wait: k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988e9 N·m²/C². e is the elementary charge, 1.602e-19 C.

So let's compute each term.

First, U1 per charge is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) ) = (k *4 e² ) / (2 m) )= (2 k e²) / m.

Wait, no, wait: (2e)*(2e) is 4e². So for each of the 12 charges, it's (k *4e²) / (2 m). So 4e² is (2e)^2.

Wait, no, wait: U = k (q1 q2)/r. So here, q1 = q2 = 2e, and r = 2 m. So each U_i is k*(2e * 2e)/(2 m) = 4 k e² / (2 m) = 2 k e² / m.

Each of the 12 contributes 2 k e² / m, so total U1 = 12 * (2 k e²/m) = 24 k e² / m.

Wait, no. Wait, 12 charges, each contributing 2 k e² / m. So 12*2=24. So U1 = 24 k e² / m.

Now, let's compute that.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e = 1.602e-19 C.

m = 2 meters.

So let's compute 24 * k * e^2 / m.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = approx 2.566e-38 C².

So:

U1 = 24 * (8.988e9) * (2.566e-38) / 2

Wait, 24 divided by 2 is 12.

So U1 = 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988e9 ≈ 9e9

2.566e-38 ≈ 2.566e-38

Multiply 9e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.094e-29 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.3094e-28 *12 = 27.7128e-28 = 2.77128e-27 J.

Wait, that's about 2.77e-27 J.

But looking at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is larger by a factor of about 10. Hmm. So perhaps there's a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the steps.

Each pair between the fixed charge and the 12 others: 12 terms.

Each term is U_i = (k * (2e) * (2e)) / (2 m) = (4 k e²) / (2 m) )= 2 k e² / m.

So each U_i is 2 * k * e² / m.

So 12 * U_i = 24 k e² / (2 m) ?

Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, each U_i is 2 k e² / m. So 12 times that is 24 k e² / m.

Wait, m is 2 meters, so 24 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

Ah, perhaps I missed that division earlier. Let me correct that.

So U1 = 12 * (2 k e² / 2 m) )? Wait, no, no. No, each U_i is 2 k e² / (2) m? Wait, no, wait: each U_i is (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2) m.

Wait, no, no, I think I messed up the m. Let me re-calculate:

Each U_i = k * (2e) * (2e) / (2 m) )= (4 k e²) / (2 m) )= (2 k e²) / m.

So for each of the 12, it's 2 k e² / m.

So U1 = 12 * (2 k e² / m) )= 24 k e² / m.

Wait, no, wait, m is 2 meters. So:

U1 = 24 * k * e² / (2) = 12 k e².

Ah! I see. Earlier, I had mistakenly used 24 k e² / m, but since m is 2, it's 24 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

So let's compute 12 * k * e².

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19 C)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38:

8.988e9 ≈ 9e9.

2.566e-38 ≈ 2.566e-38.

Multiply 9e9 * 2.566e-38 = 23.094e-29 = 2.3094e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.3094e-28 *12 = 27.7128e-28 = 2.77128e-27 J.

So U1 is approximately 2.771e-27 J.

But wait, that's smaller than the options given. The options are in the order of 1e-26 J, except for option D.

Hmm. So perhaps the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges is also significant.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in not including the mutual energies.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system." So perhaps the mutual interactions contribute more. Let's calculate that.

The mutual interactions: each pair of the 12 charges contributes U_ij = k (2e)(2e)/r_ij, where r_ij is the distance between charges i and j.

But without knowing the arrangement, I can't compute this exactly. However, perhaps the problem is assuming that each pair is at a distance of 2 m from each other, which would be the same as their distance from P. But that's not possible unless they're all at the same point, which would make r_ij zero, but that's impossible due to their repulsion.

Alternatively, perhaps the 12 charges form a regular dodecahedron around P, so that each is at 2 m from P and at the same distance from each other. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are very large, making their contributions negligible. But then why are the options so much larger than our U1?

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the U1 term.

Wait, let me recompute U1 correctly.

Each of the 12 charges contributes a potential energy of (k * (2e)^2 ) / (2 m) ) because r is 2 m.

So each term is:

k * (4 e²) / (2 m) = (2 k e²) / m.

So 12 terms: 12 * (2 k e² / m) = 24 k e² / m.

But m is 2 meters, so 24 k e² / 2 = 12 k e².

Ah! So U1 = 12 * k * e².

Now, let's compute this.

k = 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

So 12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Let me compute step by step.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38:

8.988e9 = 8.988 * 1e9.

2.566e-38 = 2.566 * 1e-38.

Multiply the numbers: 8.988 * 2.566 ≈ let's calculate.

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ approximately 2.533.

So total ≈ 20.528 + 2.533 ≈ 23.061.

Exponents: 1e9 * 1e-38 = 1e-29.

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 ≈ 23.061e-29 = 2.3061e-28.

Now multiply by 12:

2.3061e-28 * 12 = 27.6732e-28 = 2.76732e-27 J.

So U1 is approximately 2.767e-27 J.

But this doesn't match any of the options. The options are:

A) 5.645 x 10^-26 → ~5.6e-26 J

B) 2.822 x 10^-26 → ~2.8e-26 J

C) 7.056 x 10^-27 → ~7e-27 J

D) 122.330 → ~122 J.

Hmm. So our U1 is about 2.767e-27 J, which is closest to option C (7e-27) but it's about four times smaller.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, e is 1.602e-19 C, so e squared is (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = approx 2.566e-38. That's correct.

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

Let me compute 8.988 * 2.566 = ?

8 * 2.566 = 20.528.

0.988 * 2.566 ≈ 2.532.

So total is 20.528 + 2.532 = 23.06.

So 23.06 * 1e9 * 1e-38 = 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.306e-28 * 12 = 27.67e-28 = 2.767e-27 J.

So U1 is approximately 2.767e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.5 times larger than our U1.

Wait, maybe I missed the mutual potential energy between the 12 charges.

So let's calculate that.

The mutual potential energy among the 12 charges: each pair contributes U_ij = k*(2e)^2 / r_ij.

But without knowing r_ij, it's impossible to compute exactly. However, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 m from every other charge. But that's not possible unless they're all at the same point, which isn't feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all the same, say, 2 m, but that's not possible for 12 charges on a sphere. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are much larger, but that's not given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and ignoring the mutual energies. But then the computed U1 is about 2.77e-27 J, which is close to option C (7.056e-27), but not exactly matching. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to consider that each pair is counted twice. No, in the potential energy calculation, each pair is only counted once because U_ij = U_ji, so the sum is correct as 12 * (each term).

Wait, but the U1 calculation includes each of the 12 charges once, so it's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute the numbers.

Compute U1 = 12 * (k * (2e)^2)/(2 m).

Wait, no, no. Wait, the distance r is 2 m for each of the 12 charges from the fixed charge. So each term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) = (4 k e²)/(2 m) )= 2 k e²/m.

So 12 terms: 12 * 2 k e²/m = 24 k e²/m.

m is 2, so 24 k e²/(2) )= 12 k e².

So U1 = 12 * k * e².

So 12 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, let me compute e² correctly.

(1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 * 1e-38 = 2.566e-38 C².

So:

12 * 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38.

Compute 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = ?

8.988 * 2.566 ≈ 23.06 (as before). So 23.06e9 * 1e-38 = 23.06e-29.

Multiply by 12: 23.06e-29 *12 = 276.72e-29 = 2.7672e-27 J.

So U1 is about 2.77e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mutual energy is significant.

Wait, let me think: if each of the 12 charges is 2 m from P and also 2 m from every other charge, then each mutual distance r_ij is 2 m. Is that possible? Well, perhaps in a regular icosahedron, you can have points at radius r, but I'm not sure about the distances between them. Alternatively, perhaps they are arranged on a circle, but it's unclear.

Assuming that each pair of the 12 charges is at 2m apart, which is a stretch but let's proceed.

So the mutual potential energy between each pair would be U_ij = k*(2e)^2 / (2 m) )= (4 k e²)/(2 m) )= 2 k e²/m.

There are C(12,2) = 66 pairs.

So mutual energy U2 = 66 * (2 k e²/m) )= 132 k e²/m.

Since m=2 m, U2=132 k e² / 2 = 66 k e².

So adding U1 and U2: U_total = U1 + U2 = 12 k e² + 66 k e² = 78 k e².

Compute 78 * k * e².

78 * 8.988e9 = 7.055e11.

Multiply by e² (2.566e-38):

7.055e11 * 2.566e-38 = 7.055 * 2.566 = approx 18.10.

So 18.10e-27 = 1.81e-26 J.

But this isn't matching any of the options either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are much larger, making their contributions negligible. But in that case, only U1 matters, which is ~2.77e-27 J.

But the options don't have this. Let's look again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for U. Let me think: the potential energy between two point charges is U = (k q1 q2) / r.

In this case, each charge is 2e, so q1*q2 = (2e)^2 = 4e².

So each term is (k *4e²)/r.

So for the 12 charges at 2 m from P, each contributes (k*4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So for 12 charges, U1 = 12 * 2 k e² = 24 k e².

Wait, wait, no, wait. No, the formula is (k q1 q2)/r. So for each of the 12 charges, q1 is 2e, q2 is 2e, r is 2 m.

So each term is (k * (2e)(2e)) / (2 m) )= (4 k e²)/(2 m) )= 2 k e²/m.

So 12 terms would be 24 k e²/m.

But m is 2, so 24 k e²/(2) = 12 k e².

Ah, same as before.

But then mutual energies are 66 * (4 k e²)/(r_ij).

If r_ij is 2 m, then each mutual term is (4 k e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So 66 * 2 k e² = 132 k e².

So U_total = 12 k e² + 132 k e² = 144 k e².

Compute 144 * k * e².

k =8.988e9, e²=2.566e-38.

144 *8.988e9 = 1.295e12.

1.295e12 * 2.566e-38 = (1.295 * 2.566) e-26.

1.295 * 2.566 ≈ 3.32. So 3.32e-26 J.

But the options don't have that either. Hmm.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 2.822e-26, which is close to this.

Wait, 3.32e-26 is close to option B (2.822e-26), but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are not 2m but larger, making their contributions smaller.

Wait, perhaps the mutual energies are negligible compared to U1. But in that case, U1 would be ~2.77e-27 J.

But that's not matching any option except C (7e-27), which is about 2.5 times our U1.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of U1.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (k q^2 ) / (r), but I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere else. Or perhaps the formula for the system's potential energy is (1/2) sum of all pairs. Because in some cases, potential energy is calculated as (1/2) sum of each pair to avoid double-counting, but that would have already been considered in the sum.

Wait, no, the way I calculated U1, for the fixed charge and the 12 others, each pair is counted once. So I don't think there's a missing factor of 1/2.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges is at distance 2m from each other, which would be impossible for 12 particles, but perhaps the problem is making an assumption here.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of U1. Let me try a different approach.

Compute the value step by step:

Compute e squared: e = 1.602e-19 C → e² = (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38 C².

Compute 4e²: 4 * 2.566e-38 = 1.0264e-37 C².

Each term for U1 is (k *4e²) / (2 m) = (8.988e9 N·m²/C² * 1.0264e-37 C²) ) / (2 * 2 m) = ?

Wait, no, wait: no, r is 2 m. So for each term, it's (k*(4e²))/(2 m) = (8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37) / (4) ) → because 2 m is the denominator.

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = ?

8.988e9 ≈ 9e9 → 9e9 *1.0264e-37 =9.2376e-28.

Divide by 4: 9.2376e-28 /4 = 2.3094e-28 J.

Each of the 12 terms: 12 * 2.3094e-28 = 27.7128e-28 = 2.771e-27 J.

So U1 is 2.77e-27 J.

But that's not matching any option.

Wait, looking at the options again: option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.54 times our U1.

Hmm. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the exponents.

Wait, 8.988e9 *1.0264e-37 = ?

8.988e9 * 1.0264e-37 = 8.988 *1.0264 * 1e9 *1e-37 = 9.237 * 1e-28.

Ah, so 9.237e-28.

Divide by 4 → 2.309e-28.

Multiply by 12: 2.309e-28 *12 = 27.708e-28 = 2.7708e-27 J.

Same as before.

Hmm. So given that, perhaps the problem expects only the mutual energy to be considered, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the system's configuration where all 12 charges are at the same point as the fixed charge. But then, the distance between the fixed charge and each of the 12 would be zero, making the potential energy infinite, which is not possible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that all 12 charges are at the same point as P, but that would collapse all charges into one, leading to infinite energy again. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the number of terms. Let me think again.

The fixed charge (q13) interacts with each of the 12 charges. So that's 12 interactions.

The 12 charges interact among themselves. How many interactions are there? It's the number of combinations of 12 taken 2 at a time, which is (12*11)/2 =66 interactions.

So the total number of interactions is 12 +66 =78.

Each interaction contributes U = k*(2e)^2 / r.

For the 12 interactions with the fixed charge, r=2 m.

For the 66 mutual interactions, perhaps r is very large, making their contributions negligible. But without knowing r, I can't say.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual r is 2 m, so each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = (4 k e²)/2 = 2 k e².

So mutual energy is 66 * 2 k e² = 132 k e².

Adding the 12 interactions: 12 * (k*(4e²)/(2)) = 12*(2 k e²) =24 k e².

So total energy would be 24 k e² + 132 k e² =156 k e².

Compute 156 * 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Hmm, 156 *8.988e9 = let's compute 156*8.988.

8.988 * 100 =898.8

8.988 *50=449.4 → 898.8 +449.4=1348.2.

8.988 * 6=53.928 → 1348.2 +53.928=1402.128.

So 1402.128e9 =1.402128e12.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2 = 2.566e-38.

So 1.402128e12 * 2.566e-38 = ?

1.402128e12 * 2.566e-38 = (1.402128 * 2.566) * 1e-26.

Compute 1.402 *2.566 ≈ 3.595.

So approximately 3.595e-26 J.

Hmm, that's close to option B (2.822e-26), but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is only considering the interactions between the moving charges and the fixed charge, not the mutual interactions between the moving charges. In that case, the energy would be about 2.77e-27 J, which isn't an option.

But the options don't have that. Option C is 7.056e-27, which is about 2.54 times larger than our U1.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9 instead of 8.988e9. Let me try that.

Using k=9e9 N·m²/C².

Then U1 = 12 * (9e9 * 4e²) / (2 * 2) → wait, no, no. Let me recompute.

Wait, U1 =12 * [k*(4e²)/(2 m)].

m=2. So each term is [9e9 *4e²]/(4) → 9e9 *4e²=36e9 e² → divided by 4 →9e9 e².

So 12 terms: 12 *9e9 e²=108e9 e².

Wait, but e² is (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 108e9 * 2.566e-38 = 108e9 *2.566e-38 = (108 *2.566) e-29.

108 *2.566 ≈ 278.448 → 278.448e-29 = 2.78448e-27 J.

Still about 2.78e-27 J, similar to before.

Hmm. So perhaps the problem expects only the mutual energy to be considered, but that's not matching any of the options.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy due to the charges' configuration in a way that the mutual potential energy is calculated as if all 12 are at the same point, but that's impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that their centers form a sphere of radius 2m, and thus each pair is at a distance of 4 m (diameter), making the mutual potential energy U_ij = k*(2e)^2/(4) = (4 k e²)/4 = k e².

But that would be if they are all at opposite ends. But that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are all 2 m apart, but that's impossible for 12 charges on a sphere. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the mutual distances are all 2 meters, leading each mutual term to be (k *4e²)/(2) = 2 k e².

So 66 pairs: 66 *2 k e² =132 k e².

Plus the 12 terms: 24 k e².

Total:156 k e².

Compute 156 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

Wait, 156 *8.988e9 = 1.402e12 (as before).

1.402e12 *2.566e-38 =3.595e-26 J.

But option B is 2.822e-26, so it's close but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different formula, such as considering only the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, but perhaps without dividing by 2. Or perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the fixed charge, but the fixed charge's potential energy is being calculated as the sum of contributions from all 12.

Wait, the potential energy of a charge in an electric field is given by U = q * V, where V is the potential at the charge's position due to all other charges.

But for the fixed charge at P, the potential V is due to the 12 charges at 2 m away. Each of the 12 charges contributes V_i = k*(2e)/(2 m) = k e/m.

So the total potential at P is 12 * (k e)/(2 m) )= 6 k e/m.

So the potential energy of the fixed charge is q * V = (2e) * (6 k e/m) )=12 k e²/m.

Wait, that's different from what I calculated before. Hmm.

But wait, the potential energy of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each charge in the potential due to all other charges. So for the fixed charge, its potential energy is (2e) * V, where V is the potential at P due to the 12 charges.

The potential V at P due to one charge at 2m is V_i = k*(2e)/(2 m) )= k e/m.

With 12 such charges, V =12*(k e/m).

So the fixed charge's potential energy is (2e) * V = 2e *12 k e/m =24 k e² / m.

Now, for each of the 12 charges, their potential energy is (2e) * V_i, where V_i is the potential at their position due to all other 11 charges and the fixed charge.

Wait, but this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the total potential energy is calculated as the sum of each charge multiplied by the potential at its position due to all other charges.

But this approach could get complicated, but perhaps it's the correct way.

So, the total potential energy U is the sum over all charges (q_i * V_i), where V_i is the potential at the position of charge i due to all other charges.

So for the fixed charge (q13), V13 is the potential at P due to the 12 charges. Each contributes V_i = k*(2e)/(2 m) = k e/m. So V13 = 12 * (k e/m).

So U13 = q13 * V13 = (2e) * (12 k e/m) )=24 k e²/m.

For each of the 12 charges (q1 to q12), their potential V_i is the sum of the potentials from the fixed charge, the other 11 charges, and the other 12 charges.

Wait, no, for each q_i (one of the 12), V_i is the potential at its position due to q13 and the other 11 charges.

So V_i = (k q13)/r13i + sum_{j ≠i, j≠13} (k qj)/rji.

r13i is the distance from q13 to qi, which is 2 m.

rji is the distance between qj and qi, which varies depending on their positions.

But since all qi are at 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are unknown, it's difficult to compute V_i exactly.

Hmm, perhaps there's a simpler approach. Because all the 12 charges are identical and symmetrically placed, the potential at each qi due to the other 11 charges would be the same, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the 12 charges are arranged such that their mutual distances are very large, making their contributions to each other's potential negligible compared to the contribution from the fixed charge.

So for each qi, V_i ≈ (k * 2e)/(2 m) )= (k e)/m.

So U_i = qi * V_i = (2e) * (k e)/m )= 2 k e²/m.

So for each of the 12 charges, U_i ≈ 2 k e²/m.

So total U from the 12 charges is 12 * 2 k e²/m =24 k e²/m.

Adding the fixed charge's U13=24 k e²/m, the total U would be 48 k e²/m.

Since m=2, this becomes 24 k e².

Compute 24 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Wait, 24 *8.988e9 =2.157e11.

Multiply by (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 2.157e11 *2.566e-38 = (2.157 *2.566) e-27.

2.157 *2.566 ≈5.538.

So U ≈5.538e-27 J.

But that's about 5.54e-27, which is close to option A (5.645e-26) but not exactly. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential of the other 12 charges, leading to a factor I'm not considering.

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently.

Perhaps the correct answer is option B: 2.822e-26 J.

But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula earlier. Let me try another approach.

The potential energy of a system of charges is given by U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) sum_{i<j} (q_i q_j)/(r_ij).

In this problem, the system consists of 13 charges: 1 fixed at P, and 12 at 2 m from P.

So the total potential energy U is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs.

So:

U = (1/2) [ sum_{i=1→12} (fixed charge and qi) + sum_{i<j, i,j=1→12} (qi and qj) ]

So the first sum is 12 terms, each being (k * (2e)^2 )/(2 m) ).

The second sum is 66 terms, each being (k * (2e)^2 )/(r_ij), where r_ij is the distance between qi and qj.

Assuming the mutual distances are 2 m (which is not possible but let's proceed for calculation), each term in the second sum is (4 k e²)/(2) =2 k e².

So U becomes:

U = (1/2) [ 12*(4 k e²/(2 m)) ) + 66*(2 k e²) ) ]

Simplify:

12*(4 k e²/(2 m)) =12*(2 k e²/m) )=24 k e²/m.

66*(2 k e² )=132 k e².

So:

U = (1/2) [24 k e²/m +132 k e² ]

Since m=2,

24 k e²/(2)=12 k e².

So:

U = (1/2)(12 k e² +132 k e² ) = (1/2)(144 k e² )=72 k e².

Compute 72 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

72 *8.988e9 = 6.476e11.

Multiply by e²=2.566e-38:

6.476e11 *2.566e-38 = 6.476*2.566 = approx 16.62 → 16.62e-27 =1.662e-26 J.

But this is 1.66e-26, which is close to option B (2.82e-26), but not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the mutual distances are much larger, making their contributions negligible. So only the first sum contributes.

So U = (1/2) [24 k e²/m ] =12 k e²/m.

Since m=2, U=6 k e².

Compute 6 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

6 *8.988e9=5.393e10.

Multiply by 2.566e-38 →5.393e10 *2.566e-38=5.393 *2.566=13.83 →13.83e-28=1.383e-27 J.

But that's about 1.38e-27 J, which isn't an option.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I might have missed something. The formula for the potential energy of the system is (1/(4πε₀)) sum_{i<j} (q_i q_j / r_ij).

In this case, when summing for all pairs, each pair is counted once. So for the fixed charge (q13) and the 12 charges, there are 12 pairs, each contributing (k * (2e)^2 )/(2 m).

For the mutual pairs among the 12 charges, there are 66 pairs. If their mutual distances are 2 m, each contributes (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) )= (4 k e²)/(2 m) =2 k e²/m.

So the total U is:

U = [12 * (4 k e²/(2 m)) + 66*(4 k e²/(2 m)) ] /2.

Wait, because each term in the sum is (q_i q_j)/r_ij, and the factor 1/(4πε₀) is included in k.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is:

U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) [ sum_{fixed and 12} (4e²)/(2) + sum_{mutual} (4e²)/(2) ) ]

Wait, no, because r is 2 m.

So U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) [ 12*(4e²)/(2) + 66*(4e²)/(2) ) ]

Simplify:

Each term is (4e²)/(2) = 2 e².

So U = (1/(4πε₀)) * (1/2) [12*2 e² + 66*2 e² ].

= (k) * (1/2) [24 e² + 132 e² ].

= k * (1/2) *156 e².

= k *78 e².

Compute 78 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

78 *8.988e9=7.055e11.

Multiply by 2.566e-38 →7.055e11 *2.566e-38= (7.055 *2.566)e-27 → approx 18.10e-27=1.81e-26 J.

But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute only the fixed charge's potential energy, which is 12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2*2 m).

Wait, no, that would be U =12 * (k*(4e²)/(4 m)) )=12 * (k e²/m).

Which is 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2 / 2.

Wait, no, m=2. So:

U =12 * (8.988e9 *4e² )/(4).

=12 * (8.988e9 *4e² )/(4).

=12 * (8.988e9 *e²).

=12 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

= 12 * (8.988e9 *2.566e-38).

=12 *2.309e-28=2.77e-27 J.

Hmm. I'm going in circles here. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option B (2.822e-26), but none of my calculations are landing exactly on that. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor somewhere.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the problem is asking for the potential energy in a different way. Maybe each charge is at a distance of 2 m from P, but arranged in such a way that their mutual distances are much larger, making their mutual potential energies negligible. So the total energy is just the fixed charge's interaction with the 12.

In that case, U =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) )=12*(4 k e²)/(2 m) )=24 k e²/m.

Which with m=2, is 12 k e².

So 12 *8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2.

Compute 8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2=8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.309e-28.

Multiply by 12:2.309e-28*12=2.77e-27 J.

But that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged such that each is at a distance of 2 m from P, but all are at the same point, leading to infinite potential energy. But that's impossible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recompute U1.

U1 =12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) )=12* (4 k e²)/(4 m) )=12*(k e²/m) ).

Wait, that's 12*(8.988e9 * (1.602e-19)^2)/(2).

Wait, (1.602e-19)^2=2.566e-38.

So 8.988e9 *2.566e-38=2.309e-28.

Divide by 2: 1.1545e-28.

Multiply by 12:13.854e-28=1.3854e-27 J.

Hmm, that's about 1.38e-27 J. Not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each of the 12 charges contributes to the potential energy of the fixed charge, and vice versa. But since U is mutual, we should count each pair once.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is only considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and the 12 others, and not the mutual energies. So U=12 * (k*(2e)^2)/(2 m) )=12*(4 k e²)/(4 m) )=12*(k e²/m) ).

With m=2, U=6 k e².

Compute 6 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

6 *8.988e9=5.393e10.

5.393e10 *2.566e-38=1.384e-27 J.

Still not matching any option.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is option B, 2.822e-26 J, but I can't see where I'm making the mistake in the calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different value for Coulomb's constant, like 9e9, which would change the result.

Let me try with k=9e9.

U1=12*(9e9 *4e²)/(4 m).

Wait, m=2, so:

U1=12*(9e9 *4e²)/(4*2) )=12*(9e9 *4e²)/(8) )=12*( (9e9 *4e²) )/8.

Wait, (9*4)/8=36/8=4.5.

So U1=12 *4.5 * (9e9 *e²).

Wait, no, e² is 2.566e-38.

So 4.5 *9e9=40.5e9.

40.5e9 *2.566e-38=1.042e-28.

Multiply by 12:1.042e-28 *12=1.25e-27 J.

Still not matching the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the potential energy between the fixed charge and each of the 12 charges, but multiplied by 2, perhaps due to some symmetry.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the 12 charges are arranged in a way that each is at a distance of 2 m from P, but their mutual distances are all 2 m as well, which would require a very specific arrangement, but let's proceed.

In that case, each mutual term is (k*(2e)^2)/(2) = (4 k e²)/2= 2 k e².

So 66 terms contribute 132 k e².

Fixed charge contributes 12 * (4 k e²)/(2) )=24 k e².

So total U=24 k e² +132 k e² =156 k e².

Compute 156 *8.988e9 *2.566e-38.

156 *8.988e9=1.402e12.

1.402e12 *2.566e-38=3.595e-26 J.

But option B is 2.822e-26, which is close but not exact.

Hmm. Perhaps the problem expects the answer to be option B, 2.822e-26 J.

But I'm not entirely confident. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with option B.


To determine the minimum energy of the system, we calculate the total potential energy due to the interactions between the charges. The system consists of 13 identical charges, each with charge \( q = 2e \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} \). The 13th charge is fixed at point \( P \), and the other 12 charges are constrained to stay at a distance of \( r = 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \). The total potential energy \( U \) of the system is the sum of the potential energies of all pairs of charges.

### Key Contributions to the Potential Energy:
1. **Interactions between the fixed charge and the 12 charges at 2 m:**
   Each of the 12 charges interacts with the fixed charge. The potential energy for each pair is given by:
   \[
   U_i = k \frac{q_1 q_2}{r} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 2 k e^2
   \]
   Since there are 12 such interactions, the total contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{fixed-12}} = 12 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 24 k e^2
   \]

2. **Interactions between the 12 charges themselves:**
   The 12 charges are constrained at \( 2 \, \text{m} \) from \( P \), but their mutual distances are not specified. Assuming the mutual distances are approximately \( 2 \, \text{m} \), the potential energy for each pair of the 12 charges is:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = k \frac{(2e)(2e)}{2} = \frac{4 k e^2}{2} = 2 k e^2
   \]
   There are \( \binom{12}{2} = 66 \) such pairs, so the total contribution is:
   \[
   U_{\text{mutual}} = 66 \cdot 2 k e^2 = 132 k e^2
   \]

3. **Total Potential Energy:**
   The total potential energy is the sum of the contributions from the fixed charge and the mutual interactions:
   \[
   U_{\text{total}} = U_{\text{fixed-12}} + U_{\text{mutual}} = 24 k e^2 + 132 k e^2 = 156 k e^2
   \]

### Numerical Calculation:
Using \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C}^2 \) and \( e^2 = (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \, \text{C}^2 \):
\[
U_{\text{total}} = 156 \cdot (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38})
\]
First, calculate \( 156 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 \):
\[
156 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9 = 1.402 \times 10^{12}
\]
Then multiply by \( 2.566 \times 10^{-38} \):
\[
U_{\text{total}} = (1.402 \times 10^{12}) \cdot (2.566 \times 10^{-38}) = 3.595 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J}
\]

### Comparison with Options:
The calculated total potential energy \( U_{\text{total}} \approx 3.595 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \) is closest to option **B) \( 2.822 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{J} \)**, though slightly higher. This discrepancy may arise from approximations or assumptions about the mutual distances of the 12 charges.
