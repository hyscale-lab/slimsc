Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the electric field outside a conductor with a cavity. Hmm, let me read it again.

The setup is an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor, and the radius of the cavity is r, which is smaller than R. Then, someone puts a small positive charge +q somewhere inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. 

Wait, point P is outside, so its distance from the conductor's center is L. Also, the point P is at a distance l from the cavity's center. And the angle between l and s (the separation between the two centers) is theta. Both l and L are greater than R, which makes sense because P is outside.

I remember that conductors have some interesting properties regarding electric fields. Like, the charges redistribute in a certain way. Oh right, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. Also, any excess charge resides on the surface. But in this case, the conductor is initially uncharged. So the presence of the charge inside the cavity will induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces of the conductor.

Wait, how does that work? So when you place a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, it induces an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor was initially neutral, that inner surface will have a charge of -q. Then, because the conductor as a whole must remain neutral, the outer surface must have a charge of +q. But wait, actually, no. Wait, the conductor is uncharged. So the charge inside the cavity is +q, so the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's wall) must have -q induced. Then, the conductor's total charge was zero, so the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner -q.

So the outer surface has a charge of +q. Now, when considering the electric field outside the conductor, that's due to the charges on the outer surface. Because the conductor is conducting, the outer surface's charge will distribute itself spherically symmetrically, assuming the conductor is isolated and the setup is such that the outer surface remains as a shell.

Wait, but in this case, the
