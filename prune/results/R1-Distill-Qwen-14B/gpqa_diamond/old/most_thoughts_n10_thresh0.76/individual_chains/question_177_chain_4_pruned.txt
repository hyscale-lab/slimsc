Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. So, I remember that luminosity relates to how much light a star emits. The question gives some specific details about the stars' properties, and I need to calculate how much more luminous Star_1 is compared to Star_2.

Let me jot down the given facts:

- Radius of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, R1 = 1.5 * R2.
- Mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So, M1 = 1.5 * M2.
- The wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I think the wavelength of maximum emission is related to temperature. Oh right, Wien's Law! Which says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if both have the same λ_max, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ is the same, then T is the same. So T1 = T2.
- Radial velocities: Star_1 has 0 km/s, Star_2 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is about the speed at which they move towards or away from us. But I'm not sure how that affects luminosity here. The question says the stars radiate as black bodies, so maybe the Doppler effect isn't affecting the intrinsic properties. Because the luminosity calculation would be based on their actual properties, not how we perceive their light due to movement. So I might not need the radial velocities for calculating luminosity. Or maybe it's a red herring? I'll think about that later.

So, the main task is to compute L1/L2, the ratio of luminosities.

I recall the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which says L = 4π R² σ T⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both are black bodies, we can use this formula.

But wait, the question says to assume they are black bodies, so yes, this law applies.

So, let me write the luminosities:

L1 = 4π R1² σ T1⁴
L2 = 4π R2² σ T2⁴

Since T1 = T2, and σ and 4π are constants, the ratio L1/L2 would be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But T1 = T2, so T terms cancel out. So the ratio is (R1 / R2)².

Given R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5.

So the ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the answer would be option A) ~2.25.

Wait, but let me check if I'm missing something. The question gives information about mass and radial velocity. Did I need those?

Mass is given but I didn't use it in the calculation. Why is that? Because the luminosity calculation via blackbody radiation depends on radius and temperature. Unless the question is trying to trick me into considering something else, like how mass affects luminosity through another formula.

Wait another thought: Oh, wait, but maybe the temperatures aren't the same. Because I thought that since their λ_max is the same, T is same. But wait, does the radial velocity affect the observed wavelength? Because if a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted, and moving away is redshifted.

Wait the question says that the observed wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. But if one is moving, perhaps the observed wavelength is different, but the question says the observed λ is same. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, wait. Let's think. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 has radial velocity of 700 km/s. Let me
