Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it carefully first.

The problem describes two mixtures, X and Y. Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. When mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine water. Then, hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%, and it's a constituent of Y and used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated. Importantly, the molecules in X don't have conjugated multiple bonds.

I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm, let's break this down. So, mixture X has two liquids that decolorize bromine water. What causes decolorization of bromine water? That usually happens due to reduction reactions. Compounds with double bonds (like alkenes) can add bromine, causing the solution to decolorize. Alternatively, something like SO2 can also do it, but the problem says the substances are liquids, which makes me think alkenes or maybe some aromatic compounds.

Wait, but wait. So mixture X is two liquids. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation is when a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So, the original substances in X must be capable of both oxidation and reduction when reacted with Pt. Hmm, but since X is a mixture of two liquids, perhaps each has some multiple bonds that can undergo such reactions.

Wait, but X is treated with Pt and heated. Platinum is a catalyst. So perhaps each component in X is undergoing a hydrogenation reaction, but since it's a disproportionation, maybe one component is being hydrogenated in a way that it's both adding hydrogen and perhaps another part is losing it, but that doesn't quite make sense. Or wait, perhaps each component in X is undergoing a different kind of reaction.

Wait, when you have a mixture of two alkenes, and upon hydrogenation (with Pt
