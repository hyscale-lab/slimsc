Okay, so I need to figure out the chemical formula of this unknown compound based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's go through each piece of information step by step.

First, the FTIR data. A very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of either O-H (like in alcohols or carboxylic acids) or N-H (but since the options don't have nitrogen, probably O-H). But wait, a broad peak around 3000 is more typical of an O-H stretch, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But another point, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 peak is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O), like in a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 peak might be another carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, but considering the other peaks, perhaps an ester? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like a ketone with some substituents. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an amide N-H bend, but again, the options don't include nitrogen, so I'll ignore that.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound likely has an alkene group. So the structure probably contains both a carbonyl and a double bond.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z = 45. Hmm, what fragments correspond to 45? Let me think. 45 could be the molecular ion of something like (CH3)2O (which is 45, but that's 45 as m/z 45. Alternatively, maybe a fragment like an acetyl group. Wait, the molecular formula is among the options: C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the molecular weight would be:

C6H12O: (6*12) +12 +16 = 72+12+16=100
C6H10O: 72 +10 +16=
