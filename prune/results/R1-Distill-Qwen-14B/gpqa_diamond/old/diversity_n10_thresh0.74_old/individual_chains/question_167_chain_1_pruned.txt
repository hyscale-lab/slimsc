Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh right, the normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

I remember that non-Gaussianity is a measure of how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are things like coherent states, squeezed states, etc., which have density matrices that are Gaussian distributions in phase space. Non-Gaussian states, like Schrödinger cat states, are superpositions of Gaussian states, leading to non-Gaussian Wigner functions, like those with negative regions.

The relative entropy measure for non-Gaussianity here is given by del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], where rho is the density matrix of the state and tau is that of a reference Gaussian state. Wait, but how do I compute this? I think the formula for relative entropy of entanglement sometimes uses this, but perhaps in this context, it's about comparing the state's entropy to a Gaussian reference.

Wait, but maybe I'm confusing this with quantum mutual information or something else. Let me think again. The relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau), but the problem says it's Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which would be S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. Oh, right, because the relative entropy as given is the difference between the entropy of the state and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

So, to compute non-Gaussianity, which is del_b, I need to compute S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state. But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state here? Because the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we're assuming that the reference is the state that the system would be in if it were Gaussian. But wait, the state given is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. So the reference state should be another state
