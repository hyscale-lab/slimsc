Alright, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see what I can figure out.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting and the integration can give clues about the structure.

So, for the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H. Triplets usually arise from coupling with two neighboring protons. The 0.9 ppm region is typical for methyl groups, especially those attached to carbons adjacent to something electronegative, maybe like an oxygen or another group. Wait, but 0.9 is more likely a CH3 group attached to a CH2, perhaps in an isopropyl group or maybe in a neopentyl structure.

Wait, let me think. The triplet for 6H suggests that it's two sets of equivalent CH3 groups. Like, maybe two CH3 groups each split into a triplet. Alternatively, maybe each CH3 is attached to a CH2 that's connected to another CH2. Hmm.

Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet implies each proton is next to a CH2 group (since n+1 where n=3, so quartet comes from coupling with three equivalent protons). Wait, no, wait. The splitting is determined by the neighboring protons. So a quartet for each proton would mean each is next to a group with three equivalent protons. Wait, but that's not possible. Or perhaps it's a case of a quartet due to coupling with two neighboring groups.

Wait, maybe I should think of a structure that has two sets of equivalent protons. Let me think of diethyl ether. No, wait, diethyl ether's protons would have a triplet for the CH3 and a quartet for the CH2. But wait, for diethyl ether (CH3CH2OCH2CH3), the CH3 would be a triplet because each is adjacent to a CH2 (which is split into a quartet, but the CH3 is a triplet), and the CH2 would be a quartet. But in the problem, Compound A has a triplet and a quartet. Hmm.
