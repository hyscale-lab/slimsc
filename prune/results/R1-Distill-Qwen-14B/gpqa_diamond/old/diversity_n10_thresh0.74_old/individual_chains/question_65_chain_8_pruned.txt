Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves two separate reactions, each producing a product A and B respectively. We need to choose the correct option from the given choices, which are A, B, C, D.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and H+ to give product A.

Second reaction: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is treated with acetyl bromide (and a base, LDA) to give product B.

So, let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A. The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which is the spiro center here. The structure should be something like a spiro ring with a vinyl group attached to the same carbon as the hydroxyl group (since it's 1-vinyl and 1-ol). So, the structure is a spiro ring where one ring is a 3-membered (but wait, wait, wait. No, spiro[3.5]non means the two rings share one carbon. The first ring is a 3-membered? No, wait. Let me think. The spiro notation is [a.b] where a and b are the number of carbons in each ring minus the spiro carbon. So, spiro[3.5]non has two rings: a 4-membered (3+1) and a 6-membered (5+1) ring. So the structure is a nonane (9 carbons) with two rings sharing one carbon. The 1-vinyl group is on the same carbon as the OH group. So the OH is on the spiro carbon, and the vinyl group is attached to that.

Now, the reaction conditions are THF, KH, H+. THF is a solvent. KH is potassium hydride, which is a strong base, often used as a deprotonating agent. But wait, when KH is used with H+ workup, maybe it's a deprotonation followed by protonation. Alternatively, I've heard that in some cases, especially with THF and a strong base like KH, it's used for elimination reactions or for enolate formation. But wait, wait, no, another possibility: when you have an alcohol (like in our case, the spiro alcohol), and you treat it with a strong base like KH, which would deprotonate the acidic hydroxyl group. But wait, alcohols aren't that acidic, but maybe with the adjacent double bond, there could be some conjugation making the OH more acidic. Alternatively, perhaps it's a base-induced elimination.

Wait, the starting material has a double bond (non-5-en), so maybe the reaction is an elimination. Let me think: the structure is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. So the OH is on the same carbon as the vinyl group, and the double bond is at position 5. So when you treat with a strong base like KH, perhaps it abstracts a proton leading to an elimination, forming a larger ring or some kind of annulation.

Wait, another possibility: the base deprotonates the alcohol, making an alkoxide, which is a good leaving group. But wait, the alcohol is on a spiro center; perhaps the OH is deprotonated to O-, but since it's attached to a spiro carbon with adjacent double bonds, maybe it's more about elimination.

Wait, no, another thing: in some cases, when you have an alcohol and a neighboring double bond, treatment with a strong base can lead to a conjugate addition or elimination. But more accurately, perhaps it's a pinacol-like elimination. Alternatively, since the starting material is an allylic alcohol, the base could deprotonate the alpha position, leading to an E2 elimination.

Wait, but the starting material's structure: the spiro alcohol has a double bond. So perhaps the base (KH) deprotonates a beta hydrogen, leading to the formation of a new double bond. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate elimination.

Wait, maybe it's more about the formation of
