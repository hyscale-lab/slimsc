Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about reacting a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate. Hmm, I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and typically add to carbonyl groups, but wait, in this case, the epoxide is involved. Oh right, epoxides can react with nucleophiles too, like in ring-opening reactions.

The question mentions that when saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the alkyl group from the reagent goes to the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring. Also, for disubstituted epoxides, there's inversion of configuration at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks. So I need to figure out where the attack happens and how the configuration changes.

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Let me visualize that structure. Bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane means it's a norbornane structure, right? So it's a bicyclic compound with two rings. The numbering is a bit tricky here. The 7-oxa part means there's an oxygen in the ring, so it's an epoxide. So the structure has two rings: the main ring is a five-membered ring because bicyclo[4.1.0] has bridge lengths of 4, 1, and 0. Wait, no, the bicyclo notation is bicyclo[x.y.z], where x is the largest bridge. So 4.1.0 would have bridges of 4, 1, and 0 carbons. So the structure is like norbornene but with an oxygen in the bridge. Hmm, maybe it's similar to endo-norbornene oxide.

Looking at the substituents: 1,3,4-trimethyl. So positions 1,3,4 each have a methyl group. The configuration is R at 1, R at 3, R at 4, and S at 6. Wait, but 6 is the bridgehead. So the epoxide oxygen is at position 7? Or wait, in the 7-oxabicyclo... so the oxygen is at position 7. So the epoxide is between which two carbons? Let me think. In norbornane, the bridgehead is C5 and C6. Wait, maybe the numbering is different. Alternatively, perhaps the oxygen is in the bridge. So the epoxide is
