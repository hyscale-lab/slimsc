Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I need to find the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. The molecule is currently in its fundamental state, which I think means the lowest energy state, maybe the ground state. So, when a photon is absorbed, it must provide just enough energy to move the molecule to the next higher energy state.

Wait, but what's the next state? For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is typically the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Or wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, for a rigid rotor, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a non-rigid rotor, maybe it's similar but with some modifications. But since the problem mentions the non-rigid rotor model, I should consider that as well.

Wait, but the problem says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. So the energy levels are a combination of both vibrations and rotations. The fundamental state is v=0 and J=0. When the photon is absorbed, the molecule transitions to the next possible state. The next state could be either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1), whichever requires less energy. Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference between the states.

So I need to calculate the energy required for the first possible transition. The possible transitions are either a vibrational transition (v=0 → v=1) or a rotational transition (J=0 → J=1). I need to find which one has a lower energy.

The energy for the vibrational transition is given by the quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator formula: ΔE_vib = (1/2) h ν, but wait no, that's for the zero-point energy. The transition from v=0 to v=1 is just h ν, where ν is the frequency. Because each vibrational quantum level is spaced by hν. So the photon energy should be equal to hν.

Wait, what's the frequency ν? The angular frequency
