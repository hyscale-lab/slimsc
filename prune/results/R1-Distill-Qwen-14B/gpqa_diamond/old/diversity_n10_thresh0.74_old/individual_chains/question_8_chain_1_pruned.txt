Alright, so I've got this genetics problem here about plant disease resistance and gene interactions. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question is about three genes, G1, G2, and G3, which were knocked out in white lupine plants to test their role in anthracnose resistance. The results from the pathogen tests are given for each single mutant and their double mutants.

First, let's understand the basics. If a plant has 100% resistance, that's the control. The lower the percentage, the more susceptible it is. So higher numbers mean more resistance.

The single mutants:
- g1 has 75% resistance. So, it's less resistant than wild-type, but not super susceptible.
- g2 has 0% resistance. That's really bad; the plants are completely susceptible.
- g3 has 50% resistance. So, it's more susceptible than wild-type but not as bad as g2.

Now, the double mutants:
- g1g3: 10% resistance. That's really low, so plants are very susceptible.
- g2g3: 0% resistance. Again, same as g2 single mutant.
- g1g2: 0% resistance. Same as g2 single mutant.

The question says that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, probably one of them is a regulator for the others.

Looking at the data, I think I should look for epistatic relationships. Epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if gene A is epistatic over gene B, that means A acts downstream of B. Because if both are mutated, the phenotype is the same as when A is mutated alone.

Wait, let me think about how epistasis works. If the double mutant g1g2 has the same phenotype as g2, then what does that mean? It suggests that G2 is epistatic to G1. Because when both are non-functional, it's as bad as when only G2 is non-functional. So the presence of a non-functional G2 masks the effect of G1's mutation. So G2 is acting downstream of G1, perhaps.

Wait, no. If G2 is epistatic to G1, then G2 is downstream. Because the phenotype of the double mutant is determined by the downstream gene. For example, if G1 activates G2, then without G2, the pathway is blocked regardless of G1's status.

Looking at the results, when G2 is knocked out (g2), whether G1 is also knocked out doesn't matter. The resistance is 0% in both cases. So in the double mutants g1g2 and g2g3, the resistance is the same as g2. That suggests that G2 is the critical gene, perhaps acting as a transcription factor.

Wait, but g3's single mutant has 50% resistance. So when you have g2g3, it's 0%, which is same as g2. So perhaps G2 is upstream and G3 is downstream or something else.

Wait, maybe G2 is a transcription factor that activates G1 and G3. Let's think:

If G2 is a transcription factor that activates both G1 and G3, then knocking out G2 would prevent both G1 and G3 from being expressed. But in the single mutants, g1 has 75%, g3 has 50%, so perhaps each contributes a different amount to the resistance.

But when both G1 and G3 are knocked out (g1g3), resistance is 10%â€”much lower than either single.

Wait, but let's think about the double mutants:

g1g2: 0% (same as g2)
g2g3: 0% (same as g2)
g1g3: 10% (same as when you have both G1 and G3 non-functional)

So, when G2 is non-functional, any other mutation doesn't change the phenotype. But when G2 is functional, perhaps the other genes can contribute to resistance.

Wait, but in the single mutant g2, the resistance is 0%, so G2 is critical. So maybe G2 is a transcription factor that is required for the expression of other genes involved in resistance.

So, if G2 is a transcription factor, it would be upstream of other genes. Let's think about the single mutants:

- G2 is the most severe knockout, giving 0%. So without G2, the plant can't resist the pathogen at all. That suggests that G2 is essential for the resistance pathway.

Other mutants, like g1 (75% resistance) and g3 (50%) are less severe, indicating that their genes contribute but are not essential on their own.

Now, the
