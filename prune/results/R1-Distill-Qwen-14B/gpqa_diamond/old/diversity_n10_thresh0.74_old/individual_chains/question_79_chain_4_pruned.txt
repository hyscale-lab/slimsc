Okay, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. Let's see what the question says.

The compound X is C11H12O, and it's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what X is from the options.

Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane sounds familiar. Oh right, that's a reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Or wait, isn't it also used in other epoxide formations? Alternatively, maybe it's involved in some kind of ring-opening or other reaction. Hmm. But since the product's NMR shows certain features, I should focus on that.

Looking at the NMR data. The 1H NMR has: Î´ 2.28 (3H, s), another at 2.31 (3H, s). Those are two singlet triplets, so probably two methyl groups attached to something that doesn't split their signals. Maybe they're both attached to carbonyl groups or something else that doesn't cause splitting. Or perhaps they're on adjacent carbons in a symmetrical environment.

Then, there's a 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), and 7.71 (2H, d). These look like aromatic protons. Let me think about the splitting. The 6.75 is a doublet, maybe part of a substituted benzene ring. The 7.08 is a doublet with 2H, so perhaps a pair of adjacent protons in a ring. The 7.68 is another doublet, maybe another substituent. The 7.71 is a doublet with 2H again. Hmm. Could this be a para substitution on a benzene ring? Or maybe a styryl group.

The 13C NMR shows a lot of signals. The 21.3 and 28.4 are both singlets, which might correspond to the two methyl groups I saw in the proton NMR
