Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum, right? So when the star moves towards us, the spectral lines shift blue, and when it moves away, they shift red. The periodic shift tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, so their masses are the same. Each has a planet with Neptune-like mass, so similar masses. Both planets are in circular orbits.

Planet #1 causes a 5 milliangstrom shift. Planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. Wait, but how does the shift relate to the orbital period of the planet?

Wait, I think the Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by something like K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(0.5) * (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) ), but since the orbits are circular, e is 0, so that part simplifies. Also, M_planet is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So K ≈ (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1/( (P/(2π) )^(1/3) ) ) )

Wait, let me think. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) ) )

But since M_planet << M_star, it's approximately:

K ≈ ( (G * P ) / (2π c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_planet / M_star^(2/3) )

Wait, no, that might not be accurate. Let me recall the correct formula. I think the correct formula is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (1) / ( (P/(2π) )^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )

But because e is zero for circular orbits, that term drops out. And M_p is much smaller than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. So,

K ≈ [ (G * M_p ) / M_* ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (P/(2π) )^(1/3) ) )

Which simplifies to K ≈ ( G * M_p / (M_* ) )^(1/3) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3 )
