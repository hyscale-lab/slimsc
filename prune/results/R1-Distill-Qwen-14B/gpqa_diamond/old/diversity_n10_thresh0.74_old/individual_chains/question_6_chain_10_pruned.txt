Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that a quantum mechanical particle of mass m is moving in two dimensions under a potential V(r, θ) which is given as (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. We're supposed to find the energy spectrum, and the options are A, B, C, D.

Hmm, I remember that in two dimensions, particles in certain potentials can be solved using separation of variables, especially if the potential is separable into radial and angular parts. So the first thing I should do is see if this potential can be broken down that way.

Looking at V(r,θ), it's (1/2)kr² plus (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Let me factor out kr². So, V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ]. Wait, can I rewrite this in a way that separates r and θ?

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express this in terms of spherical coordinates or something else. But wait, this is two-dimensional, so perhaps polar coordinates are appropriate. Let me think: in two dimensions, the position is given by r and θ, so the potential depends on r and θ as given.

So the potential is V(r,θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. I can factor out kr²: V(r,θ) = kr² * [1/2 + 3/2 cos²θ]. Let me compute the terms inside the brackets: 1/2 + (3/2)cos²θ. Hmm, 1/2 is 3/6, and 3/2 is 9/6. Wait, maybe combining them:

Wait, [1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ] = (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2. Which is (1 + 3 cos²θ)/2. That might not be the most helpful form. Alternatively, perhaps expressing it using cos(2θ) because that's a common approach in such potentials.

I remember that cos²θ can be written in terms of cos(2θ) using the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos(2θ))/2. Let me apply that substitution.

So, substituting into the potential:
V(r,θ) = kr² [1/2 + (3/2) * (1 + cos(2θ))/2 ]
= kr² [1/2 + (3/2)(1/2 + (cos(2θ))/2)]
Wait, let's compute the terms inside:

First, (3/2) * [ (1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (3/2)*(1/2 + (cos2θ)/2) = 3/4 + (3 cos2θ)/4.

So adding the 1/2:
1/2 + 3/4 = (2/4 + 3/4) = 5/4. And the cos2θ term is (3 cos2θ)/4.

So V(r,θ) becomes kr² [5/4 + (3/4) cos2θ ].

Wait, that simplifies to (kr²/4)(5 + 3 cos2θ). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps another approach.

Wait, the potential is V(r) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Alternatively, perhaps considering that this might be a combination of a harmonic oscillator in r and another in θ.

Wait, the first term (1/2)kr² is like a 2D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. But the second term, (3/2)kr² cos²θ, is a bit more complicated. Wait, because it depends on θ, the potential is not spherically symmetric, so the separation of variables in spherical coordinates might not be straightforward.

Wait, but in two dimensions and polar coordinates, the Schrödinger equation can sometimes be separated into radial and angular parts if the potential allows. Let me write down the time-independent Schrödinger equation for this problem.

The equation is: [ (-ħ²/(2m)) (∇²) ) + V(r,θ) ] ψ(r,θ) = E ψ(r,θ).

In polar coordinates (r, θ), the Laplacian is (1/r)(d/dr)(r dψ/dr) + (1/r²)(d²ψ/dθ²). So the equation becomes:

(-ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r dψ/dr) + (1/r²) d²ψ/dθ² ] + [ (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ ] ψ = E ψ.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor out kr² from the potential. Let me write V(r,θ) = kr² [ 1/2 + (3/2) cos²θ ].

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for a way to separate the variables. Let me try to assume ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ). Let's substitute this into the Schrödinger equation.

So, substituting ψ = R(r) Θ(θ), the equation becomes:

(-ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r R'(r)) Θ(θ) + (1/r²) R(r) Θ''(θ) ] + [ (1/2) kr² + (3/2) kr² cos²θ ] R(r) Θ(θ) = E R(r) Θ(θ).

Divide both sides by R(r) Θ(θ) to get:

(-ħ²/(2m)) [ (1/r) d/dr (r R'(r)) / R(r) + (1/r²) Θ''(θ
