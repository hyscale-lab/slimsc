Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of spectroscopy. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2. The data provided includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. Let's break down each part.

First, the IR data. The strong to medium bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches because amides or amines typically show peaks around there. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So maybe an amide or ester?

Looking at the options again:

A) 3-ethoxybenzamide
B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide
C) 4-aminophenyl propionate
D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate

Hmm. Let's think about each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would be a benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. Structure-wise, that's a benzene ring with NHCO attached at position 1 and OCH2CH3 at position 3. The IR should show a strong amide peak, maybe at around 1650 cm-1, but wait, their IR is at 1720. Amides typically have lower carbonyl frequencies than esters because of resonance. So maybe this isn't right, unless it's an amide with some electron-withdrawing groups. Or perhaps I'm mixing up amide and ester carbonyl peaks.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the formamide would have a structure where the amide is RCONH2, but wait, formamide is HCONHR', no. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. But N-substituted formamide would be something like Ar-OCH2CH3 attached to the NH. So the carbonyl would be around 1700 cm-1, which matches the IR. Also, formamide has two N-H stretches, which are usually around 3300-3500. So the IR peaks fit. But let's see the NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That sounds like a propionylamine attached to a benzene ring. So the structure would be benzene with NH2 at position 4 and a propionyl group (like CH2CH2COOH?) Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached, but since it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, it's likely CH2CH2COO-NH-C6H4-4. Wait, actually, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe it's like CH2CH2CO-O- attached to the benzene and an amino group on the ring. Wait, the formula is C9H11NO2. Let me count: benzene (6 C), ethyl group (from propionate?), maybe an O and N. Not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps it's O=COCH2CH2CH3 attached to the benzene and an amino group. Wait, perhaps I should come back to this after looking at the NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure would be benzoate (PhCOO-) with an ethyl ester and an amino group at position 4 on the benzene. So the structure is O=C-OCH2CH3 attached to the benzene ring, which also has an NH2 group in the para position. So the carbonyl would be from the ester, which typically appears around 1720 cm-1. The IR has a strong band there, so this fits. Also, the amino group would show N-H stretches, so that matches the IR peaks. So this is a possible candidate.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, probably from an ethyl ester.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet, 2H. Could be adjacent to an electronegative group. Maybe the OCH2 from an ethoxy group. But in an ester, the OCH2 would usually be a quartet because it's adjacent to the CH2CH3. Wait, no, in ethyl groups, the CH2 next to O is a quartet. Wait, the 1.20 ppm is a triplet, which is the CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be at around 4.1-4.3 as a quartet. But the NMR shows 4.0 (bs, 2H). Hmm, broad singlet? Maybe it's not an ethyl group but something else. Alternatively
