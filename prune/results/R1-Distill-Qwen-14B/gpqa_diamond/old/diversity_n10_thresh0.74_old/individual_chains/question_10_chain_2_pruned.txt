Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which exoplanet has the highest density among the options given. Hmm, let's see. The question lists four options, a to d, each describing a planet with certain mass and density characteristics.

Wait, density is mass divided by volume, right? So I think each option gives different mass and sometimes radius or density. I need to calculate the density for each to compare.

Starting with option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³ because Earth is a rocky planet, and that's the average. So option a's density is 5.5.

Option b says a planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, but they already give the density here. So that's straightforward. Its density is 5.5 as well. Wait, that's the same as a? Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Because if a planet has twice Earth's mass but same density, what's its radius? Well, density is mass/volume, so if mass doubles and density is same, the volume must double. Volume scales with the cube of radius, so if volume doubles, radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. So like, about 1.26 times. But since they're giving the density directly, I don't need to calculate anything else. So option b has 5.5.

Option c: A planet with same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive. So same composition implies same density? Because density is determined by what it's made of. If Earth's density is 5.5, then this planet would have the same density, 5.5. So option c's density is 5.5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, if a planet has same composition, it's density is same as Earth's. So same as Earth. So same as a and b and c. Hmmm, but wait, option d is the same composition as Earth but half the mass. So same density of 5.5.

Wait, so all options a, b, c, d have the same density? No, that can't be right because the question is asking which has the highest. So I must be misunderstanding.

Wait, let me read the options again carefully.

Option a: Earth mass and radius. So density is 5.5.

Option b: 2 Earth masses, density 5.5. So same as Earth.

Option c: same composition
