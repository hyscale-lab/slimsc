Okay, so I have this question about crystallography. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through it. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. The given data is the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees each.

Wait, I remember that in crystallography, the interplanar distance is calculated using the formula involving the reciprocal of the plane indices. Oh right, the formula is d = a / sqrt(l² + m² + n² - 2lm cos α - 2ln cos β - 2mn cos γ). Or wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I think it might be d = a / sqrt( (l^2 + m^2 + n^2) - 2(lm cos α + ln cos β + mn cos γ) ) ). 

Wait, no, wait. The general formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2hk \cos\gamma + 2hl \cos\beta + 2kl \cos\alpha } }

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Or maybe it's d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) ) } }

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: in a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees, but here it's a rhombohedral system, which has all angles equal, but not necessarily 90 degrees. So the formula must account for the angles.

Wait, another thought: in a rhombohedral system, since all the angles are equal, maybe the formula simplifies. Also, the Miller indices are (111), so h=1, k=1, l=1.

So substituting h, k, l as 1,1,1.

Let me write the formula again. The general formula for interplanar spacing is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{(h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)}} 

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, another source says the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\alpha + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\gamma) } }

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting memories. I think I should get this right.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the general interplanar distance formula in a crystal lattice. The formula is derived from the structure of the lattice vectors. So the metric tensor is involved here.

In a rhombohedral lattice, all the lattice parameters a, b, c are equal (since it's rhombohedral, which is a special case of hexagonal?), wait no. Wait, rhombohedral is part of the cubic system but with a distortion such that all edges are equal but the angles are not 90 degrees. Oh wait, no. Actually, in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, and all angles are equal. But sometimes, when a rhombohedral lattice is treated, it's considered as a special case, sometimes called the trigonal crystal system.

So, for a rhombohedral system with a = b = c = a0, and angles α = β = γ = θ, the formula for interplanar distance simplifies.

The general formula for d_{hkl} in a rhombohedral system is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta } }

Wait, no, maybe it's:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk + hl + kl) \cos\theta } }

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think of the case when θ is 90 degrees. Then cosθ is zero, and the formula reduces to d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), which is correct for a cubic system. So that must be the case.

But wait, when angles are 90 degrees, the formula is indeed d = a / sqrt(h² +k² + l²). So in that case, the formula is correct.

So in our problem, the angles α, β, γ are all 30 degrees. So cosθ is cos(30°) which is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait another thing: in the general formula, the angles are between which vectors? Because in a crystal lattice, the vectors are a, b, c, and the angles are between a and b, a and c, and b and c. So in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c, but the angles between a and b is α, a and c is β, and between b and c is γ. So all three angles are 30 degrees.

So the general formula for d_{hkl} is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 - 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

Wait, but substituting, since α=β=γ=30°, and h=k=l=1.

So let's plug that in.

So the denominator becomes:

1² + 1² + 1² - 2 [ (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) + (1)(1) cos(30) ]

Which is 3 - 2 [ 3 * cos(30) ].

Wait, because each term is 1*1*cos(angle), and all angles are 30°, so each term is cos(30).

So 3 - 2*(3 * cos30) = 3 - 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3 - 3*sqrt(3).

So sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so 3*sqrt(3)=5.196.

So 3 -5.196= -2.196. Oh wait, that's negative. That can't be right because you can't have a negative number under the square root. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Because when I use angles, perhaps the formula is adding the cross terms. Let me check.

Another approach: maybe the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) } }

Wait, no, that can't be right because cos α would be positive for acute angles. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) } }

Wait, but in this case, with all angles 30°, and h=k=l=1:

Denominator = 3 - 2 [ (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 + (1)(1) cos30 ]

Which is 3 - 2*(3* (sqrt(3)/2)) ) 

= 3 - 2*( (3 * 0.8660) )

= 3 - 2*(2.598)

= 3 - 5.196 = -2.196.

Wait, this is negative, which can't be. So this suggests that the formula I'm using is incorrect. Because a negative under the square root is impossible.

Hmm, so I must have the formula wrong. Maybe the correct formula has a minus sign in front of each cosine term. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But wait, if all angles are 30°, and h=k=l=1:

So, 3 - 2 [ (1)(1)cos30 + (1)(1)cos30 + (1)(1)cos30 ]

Which is 3 - 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)).

Wait, 3*(sqrt(3)/2) is about 3*(0.866) = 2.598.

Multiply by 2: 5.196.

So 3 -5.196 = -2.196. Hmm, same problem.

Wait, this can't be. So maybe I got the formula wrong. Perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

Wait, let's try that.

So denominator would be 3 + 2*(3*(sqrt(3)/2)) ) = 3 + 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

Then sqrt(8.196)= approximately 2.863.

Then d = a / 2.863, where a is 10 Angstrom.

So 10 / 2.863 ≈ 3.494 Angstrom. But wait, that's way off the options given.

Wait, but the options are in the 8-10 range. So this can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is the reciprocal of what I'm thinking. Or perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance formula for a rhombohedral system simplifies because a = b = c, and all angles are the same.

So for a rhombohedral system, the formula for interplanar distance for (hkl) plane is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ } }

Where θ is the angle between the lattice vectors, which is 30° in this case.

Wait, but wait, because in a rhombohedral system, the angles between vectors are all equal (θ). So the formula may have a different form.

Let me think about the structure factor or the metric tensor. The metric tensor in a rhombohedral system would be:

[ a²          a² cosθ     a² cosθ
  a² cosθ   a²          a² cosθ
  a² cosθ   a² cosθ    a²        ]

So the reciprocal of the metric tensor is involved in the calculation of interplanar distances.

Wait, the interplanar distance formula can be derived from the reciprocal lattice. So the formula for d^2 is given by:

d^2 = (h² + k² + l²) a² / ( [ (h² +k² +l²) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ] )

Wait, that doesn't look right. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2( hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ) )

Wait, but for rhombohedral, all angles are same, so:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2( hk + hl + kl ) cosθ )

In this case, h=k=l=1.

So denominator is 3 - 2( 1 + 1 +1 ) cosθ = 3 - 6 cosθ.

cosθ = cos30 = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So denominator becomes 3 -6*(0.866) = 3 -5.196= -2.196.

Again, negative. So that's impossible. So that can't be right.

Wait, that must mean I have the formula wrong. So perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2( hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ ) )

In that case, with h=k=l=1,

Denominator = 3 + 2(3 * cos30) = 3 + 6*(0.866) ≈ 3 +5.196=8.196.

Then sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

So d= a /2.863 = 10 /2.863 ≈3.494 Angstrom. But none of the options are near that.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing the interatomic distance with the lattice parameter. Oh wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. Wait, what's the interatomic distance in a crystal? 

Wait, in a crystal, the interatomic distance refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along a particular direction. For example, in a cubic system, the interatomic distance along the cube edge is 'a', along the diagonal is a√2, etc.

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, if the interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom, which direction is that? Because in a rhombohedral lattice, the unit vectors a, b, c are all of length 'a0' (the lattice parameter), but the interatomic distance along the edges is a0. So perhaps in this problem, the a0 is 10 Angstrom.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the interatomic distance along the edges is a0, so a0=10 Angstrom.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the distance between nearest neighbors, which in rhombohedral could be along one of the vectors. So if a0 is the lattice parameter, then yes, the interatomic distance is a0.

So proceeding under the assumption that a0 is 10 Angstrom.

But back to the problem. The formula we're trying to use is giving us either a negative denominator or a d that's too small. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should use the general formula for interplanar spacing:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 (1/a^2) ) + (k^2 (1/b^2) ) + (l^2 (1/c^2) ) - 2 hk (cosγ)/ (a b) - 2 hl (cos β)/(a c) - 2 kl (cos α)/(b c) ) } }

But in a rhombohedral system, a = b = c = a0, so this simplifies.

So substituting a = b = c = a0, and α=β=γ=θ,

The expression becomes:

d = 1 / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)/a0^2 - 2 (hk cosθ + hl cosθ + kl cosθ)/(a0^2) )

Factor out 1/a0^2:

d = 1 / sqrt( [ h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ ] / a0^2 )

Which simplifies to:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² - 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, so same as before. So for (111), h=k=l=1.

So denominator: 3 - 2(3) cosθ.

Wait, 3 - 6 cosθ. For θ=30°, cosθ=√3/2≈0.866.

So 3 -6*(0.866)=3-5.196= -2.196. Negative again. Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, so the denominator is negative. That's impossible because you can't have negative under the square root. So there must be a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a0 / sqrt( h² +k² +l² + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Because if we have a positive denominator, that's possible.

So let's try that. So with h=k=l=1,

Denominator = 3 + 2*(3)*cosθ = 3 +6 cosθ.

cosθ=√3/2≈0.866.

So denominator =3 +6*(0.866)= 3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)= approx 2.863.

Then d= a0 / 2.863.

a0 is 10 Angstrom. So d≈10/2.863≈3.494 Angstrom.

But the options are all in the 8-10 range. So that's way off.

Hmm. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Alternative idea: perhaps the interplanar distance formula for rhombohedral is written differently. Maybe in terms of the unit cell parameters.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the structure of the rhombohedral unit cell. Each atom is at the corners of a rhombohedron, and perhaps the (111) plane is a certain distance apart.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the structure vectors and compute the plane's normal vector.

Wait, the Miller indices (111) plane. The normal vector to this plane has components (1,1,1). The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of this vector in reciprocal space, scaled by a0.

Wait, but I'm not confident about that approach.

Alternative plan: perhaps I should use the formula from a textbook.

Wait, I recall the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is given by:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ } }

Wait, but wait, when θ is 90°, cosθ=0, so d becomes a / sqrt( h² +k² +l² ), which is correct for cubic. So perhaps that's the right formula.

So with h=k=l=1, and θ=30°, let's compute:

Denominator = 3 + 2*(3) * cos30 = 3 +6*(sqrt(3)/2)= 3 +3*sqrt(3) ≈3 +5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=~2.863.

So d=10 /2.863≈3.494 A. Still not matching any of the options.

Wait, but the options are much larger, like around 9 A. So perhaps I'm using the wrong 'a' value.

Wait, the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps I'm confusing 'a' with the interatomic distance. Wait, in a rhombohedral lattice, the interatomic distance (distance between nearest neighbors) is 'a' along each axis. So if the interatomic distance is 10, then a=10.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral lattice, nearest neighbors are along the edges, so yes, a is the interatomic distance.

So why am I getting such a small d? Because (111) planes are not the closest spaced planes.

Wait, perhaps it's the opposite: the (111) plane's interplanar distance is larger than the interatomic distance.

Wait, but according to my formula, it's smaller. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but the options are wrong, or I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a0 / sqrt( ... ), but I have the reciprocal.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the interplanar distance formula is given by reciprocal of (h² +k² +l² + ... ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use another approach: the volume of the unit cell.

Wait, in a rhombohedral system, the volume V is a³ * sqrt(1 - cos²α - cos²β - cos²γ + 2 cos α cos beta cos gamma )

Wait, but all angles are 30 degrees. So let's compute that.

V = a³ * sqrt(1 - (3*(cos30)^2) + 2*(cos30)^3 )

cos30=√3/2≈0.8660.

So cos30^2= (3/4)=0.75.

So 3*(0.75)=2.25.

2*( (0.8660)^3 )≈ 2*(0.6495)=1.299.

So inside the square root: 1 -2.25 +1.299=1-2.25= -1.25 +1.299=0.049.

So sqrt(0.049)=≈0.222.

So V= a^3 * 0.222.

But a is 10, so V=1000 *0.222≈222 A^3.

But not sure if this helps.

Alternative approach: think of the plane (111). The interplanar distance is the distance between two adjacent planes perpendicular to (111). So perhaps using vector methods to find the normal vector and calculate the distance.

In a rhombohedral system with vectors a, b, c, each of length a0=10, and angles 30° between each pair.

The unit vectors along a, b, c are:

Let me denote vectors as a, b, c with magnitude a0, and angles between them 30°.

The reciprocal basis vectors are used for the reciprocal lattice, and the planes are defined in reciprocal space.

But perhaps a better way is to compute the normal vector to the (111) plane and find its magnitude.

The (111) plane has a normal vector (1,1,1) in reciprocal space. The reciprocal space vectors are given by the metric tensor inverse.

The reciprocal vectors are:

b1 = (1/a^2)( a + b cos gamma + c cos beta )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the reciprocal lattice vectors.

But this seems getting complicated. Maybe I can find the interplanar distance using the formula involving the dot product of the vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for d in a rhombohedral system as:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, earlier I tried that, and it gave a d of ~3.494, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, looking at the options, the closest is 9.08 Angstrom, which is option A. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

But with the same issue of negative denominator unless the cosines are negative.

Wait, but cos30 is positive. So perhaps that is not the case.

Wait, unless the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Wait, but with all angles 30°, this becomes 3 -6*(0.866)= 3 -5.196= -2.196. Impossible.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think of another approach.

In a cubic system, the interplanar distance for (111) is a/sqrt(3) ≈ 0.577a. For a=10, that's about 5.77 Angstrom.

But in a rhombohedral system, the planes are further apart due to the angles. So the interplanar distance should be larger than the cubic case, which aligns with the options given (around 9 Angstrom).

So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the denominator is sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Wait, with cosθ being positive, that would give a smaller denominator, but in our case, it turned negative. So no.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the angles between the vectors as 180-30=150 degrees. Because in some literature, the angles between lattice vectors are sometimes given as the supplementary angle.

Wait, because in a crystal, the angle between two vectors a and b is the angle between their directions. But in a rhombohedral structure, perhaps the acute angle is given, but the formula uses the obtuse angle.

Wait, but if the angle is 30°, the supplementary angle is 150°, and cos(150)= -√3/2≈-0.866.

So let's try that. If the angles in the formula are 150°, then cosθ is negative.

So denominator with h=k=l=1:

3 - 2*(3)*cos(150) =3 -6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

So sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d= a /2.863=10/2.863≈3.494 Angstrom. Again, same result as before.

But that's not matching the options.

Wait, but perhaps the formula uses the angle between the vectors as 60 degrees. Wait, no, the question says all angles are 30 degrees.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Maybe the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk cos α + hl cos beta + kl cos gamma) )

Which would have denominator 3 + 3*2*0.866 ≈ 3+5.196=8.196.

Again, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Let me think: interplanar distance is defined as the distance between two adjacent planes. Perhaps the formula for the reciprocal space is different.

Alternatively, perhaps a different approach: The interplanar distance can be found using the dot product of the lattice vectors with the plane's normal vector.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = (a) / ( sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) ) )

Which is the same as earlier, leading to d≈3.494.

But again, not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reciprocal of this. Since the formula gives a small d, but the options are much larger.

Wait, 1/3.494≈0.286. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the given interatomic distance is not the lattice parameter. Maybe the interatomic distance is the distance between two neighboring atoms along the (111) direction, which is longer than the lattice parameter.

Wait, that complicates things. Because the interatomic distance along (111) would be a√3. So if the interatomic distance along that direction is 10 Angstrom, then a=10/√3≈5.7735 Angstrom.

But the question says the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps this is the distance along (111) direction.

Wait, that would change the lattice parameter.

So, if the interatomic distance along (111) is 10 Angstrom, then:

The (111) direction vector is (1,1,1), so the distance is |(1,1,1)| * a, where |v| is the magnitude of the vector (1,1,1) in real space.

The magnitude of (1,1,1) is sqrt(1 +1 +1 + 2*(ab cosγ + ac cos beta + bc cos alpha) )

Wait, but in real space, the vectors a, b, c have angles between them of 30 degrees each.

So the magnitude squared of (a + b + c) is a² + b² + c² + 2ab cos gamma + 2ac cos beta + 2 bc cos alpha.

But since a = b = c = a0, and gamma=beta=alpha=30°.

So magnitude squared is 3a0² + 2a0² [ 3 cos30 ] = 3a0² +6a0² (0.866) = 3a0² +5.196 a0²=8.196 a0².

So the magnitude is a0 * sqrt(8.196)=a0 * 2.863.

If the interatomic distance along (111) is 10 Angstrom, then  a0 * 2.863 =10 → a0≈3.494 Angstrom.

But wait, the question states that the interatomic distance is 10 Angstrom. So perhaps that's along the (111) direction, implying a0=3.494.

But I'm not sure that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance refers to the lattice parameter a0. So a0=10 Angstrom.

But then using the formula, the interplanar distance for (111) is about 3.494, which is not among the options.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula I've been using is incorrect, and the correct formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

But with the denominator as 3 -6 cos30 ≈ negative, which is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 + l^2) - 2( hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ ) )

But in this case, with α=β=γ=30°, denominator becomes 3 - 6*(√3/2) =3 -3√3≈3-5.196= -2.196→ impossible.

So perhaps the formula is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 180-30=150°, which would make cosθ negative.

So trying theta=150°, then cosθ= -√3/2≈-0.866.

Denominator: 3 - 2*(3*( -0.866 ))=3 + 5.196=8.196.

So d= a / sqrt(8.196)=10/2.863≈3.494. Again, same result.

But options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different for rhombohedral systems, and perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h² +k² +l²) + 2 (hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But this gives d=3.494.

Wait, perhaps in the formula, it's the absolute value.

Wait, if the interplanar distance is calculated as:

d = a / | sqrt( ... ) |.

But when the expression inside is negative, we take the negative, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try taking the magnitude of the denominator.

Wait, if the denominator is sqrt( -2.196 )= imaginary, which is impossible. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for interplanar distance in a hexagonal system, which is similar to rhombohedral.

Wait, in a hexagonal system, the interplanar distance for (hkl) is given by:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + hk +k^2) + l^2 (1 - 3 cos^2θ) )

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which gives d=3.494. But that's not matching any options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula I'm using applies to a simple cubic system, but for rhombohedral, the formula is different. Oh wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk cosα + hl cosβ + kl cosγ) )

But with the angles being 30°, but the formula requires the angles between the reciprocal vectors.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think of the possible answers. The options are:

A) 9.08
B) 8.95
C)9.54
D)10.05

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute using the formula and get one of these.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which gives 10 / sqrt(8.196) ≈10/2.863≈3.494.

But that's not matching. So perhaps I'm using the wrong formula entirely.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the interplanar distance 'd' is given by:

d = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - 2(hk \cos\alpha + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\gamma) } }

But wait, 1/d squared is (h²+k²+l²) - 2(...), which would make d = 1 / sqrt(...).

Wait, no, that can't be. Because in the cubic case, d= a / sqrt(h² +k² +l²). So perhaps the correct formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - 2(hk cos α + hl cos β + kl cos γ) )

But in our case, that gives a negative denominator.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of this. So 1/d = sqrt( ... ) → d= 1/sqrt(...), but that would require the denominator to be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ } }

Which gives d=3.494, but this doesn't match.

Wait, if a=10, and the formula is d= a * sqrt( ... ), perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2... )

Wait, no, that would make d even larger.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another thought: the interplanar distance for (111) in a cubic system with a=10 is a/sqrt(3)=5.77 A. Looking at the options, option D is 10.05, which is higher than 10.

But in a rhombohedral system with angles less than 90°, the interplanar distance should be larger than the cubic case because the planes are more spread out.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2( hk + hl + kl ) cosθ )

But with cosθ being 30 degrees.

Wait, but that gives denominator 3 -6*(0.866)= -2.196, which can't be.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2( hk + hl + kl ) (1 - cosθ) )

Wait, trying that:

3 + 2*(3)*(1-0.866) = 3 +6*(0.134)=3 +0.804=3.804.

sqrt(3.804)=1.95.

d=10/1.95≈5.129. Still not matching.

Hmm.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, considering the formula I thought earlier, which gives d≈3.494, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (h² +k² +l²) - 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ.

Wait, with h=k=l=1,

=3 - 2*(3)*0.866=3-5.196= -2.196. Nope.

Another approach: perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2*(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which is 3 +6*(0.866)=8.196.

d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.494.

But the options are 9-10, so perhaps I'm missing a factor of 3.

Wait, perhaps the formula actually uses (h² +k² +l²) multiplied by something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula and the correct formula requires a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance can be found using the following approach:

The reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = (1/a^2)( a + ... )

But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps another way: the unit vectors for a rhombohedral system can be written in terms of the basis vectors.

The reciprocal basis vectors are:

b1 = (a)(1,0,0) / (a^2 ( ... )) → not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the Miller indices in terms of the real space vectors.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance for (111) is given by:

d = (a) / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which gives 3.494, but the options are higher. So perhaps the formula is d = a * sqrt( ... ), which would make d=10 * sqrt(8.196) → which is way too big.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using vectors.

Let me define vectors a, b, c with magnitude 10 and angles of 30° between each pair.

The (111) plane has normal vector n = a + b + c.

The magnitude of n is |n| = sqrt( |a|² + |b|² + |c|² + 2ab cosγ + 2ac cos beta + 2 bc cos alpha )

Since a = b = c =10, and angles between them 30°, this becomes:

|n| = sqrt( 100 +100 +100 + 2*(100 cos30) + 2*(100 cos30) + 2*(100 cos30) )

= sqrt( 300 + 600 * (0.866) )

= sqrt( 300 + 519.6 )

= sqrt(819.6)= approx 28.63.

So the magnitude of the normal vector is 28.63.

The interplanar distance 'd' is given by 1/|n| * a0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector multiplied by a0.

Wait, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by 1/|n|, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no. The interplanar distance is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector.

Wait, the reciprocal lattice vectors are given by:

b1 = ( (2pi) / a ) ( ... )

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the interplanar distance d is given by:

d = |n|^{-1} * 2pi / ( ... )

Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / |n|, where |n| is the magnitude of the normal vector.

Wait, |n|=28.63, so d=10 /28.63≈0.349 A. Which is even smaller. Not matching options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reciprocal of |n|, so 1/28.63≈0.0349 A. Not matching.

Hmm.

Wait, given that I'm not making progress, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a formula that gives one of the options.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is likely option C, 9.54 A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the denominator as (h² +k² +l² + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) and take the reciprocal.

Wait, but I tried that and it didn't match.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system is:

1/d^2 = (h^2 +k^2 +l^2)/a^2 + 2 (hk + hl + kl) (cosθ)/a^2.

Wait, that would give:

1/d^2 = (3 + 6 cosθ ) / a^2.

So 1/d^2 = (3 + 6*(0.866)) / 100.

Which is (3 +5.196)/100 =8.196/100=0.08196.

So d^2=1/0.08196≈12.203 → d≈3.494.

Again, same result.

I'm stuck. Perhaps I should consider that the correct answer is option A, 9.08 A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But with cosθ= -0.866 (if theta=150°), then:

Denominator=3 - 6*(-0.866)=3+5.196=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.494.

So same result.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a negative sign, but when the denominator becomes negative, we take the absolute value.

But that would lead to d=10/sqrt(2.196)=10/1.48≈6.756. Still not matching.

Wait, an alternative calculation: perhaps I should compute the reciprocal of 3.494, which is 0.286. No, that's not relevant.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt(3)≈17.32, but that's higher than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is:

d = a * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would give 10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863≈28.63, which is much higher than the options.

No.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option A:9.08 A.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 10 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), but that gives 10 * sqrt( -2.196 ), which is impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps I've been using the wrong formula all along, and the correct formula for d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which gives d=3.494, but the options don't include that.

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the angles are 60°, but the question says 30°, which would change the outcome.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I'm using is correct, but the question's options are wrong.

Given all this, I think the correct formula leads to option A) 9.08 A. But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C) 9.54 A.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let's re-calculate the denominator when using the formula:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

h=k=l=1.

So 3 + 2*(3)* (sqrt(3)/2 )=3 +3*sqrt(3)=3+5.196=8.196.

sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863=3.494.

But if I take the reciprocal, 1/3.494≈0.286, which is not an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is d = a / (sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )) )

But that would require the denominator to be positive.

Wait, 3 -6*cos(30)=3-5.196=-2.196. But that's negative. So perhaps it's impossible, meaning that the (111) plane doesn't exist in this lattice? That can't be right.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't reach an answer matching the options. Perhaps the correct approach is to calculate it using the formula d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ), which gives d≈3.494, but none of the options match. Hence, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is:

d = a / sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

But with the angles being 180-30=150°, which makes cosθ= -0.866.

So denominator becomes:

3 -6*(-0.866) =3 +5.196=8.196.

So d=10/sqrt(8.196)=3.494.

Still same result.

I'm stuck. I think the correct answer is option A)9.08 A, but I can't find a way to get this through the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)9.54 A.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it using the correct formula and see which option it matches.

Let me compute sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) = sqrt(3 + 6*(0.866))=sqrt(8.196)=2.863.

d=10/2.863≈3.494.

Hmm, no match.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 / ( sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) - 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ ) )

But that gives a negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

d = a0 * sqrt( (h^2 +k^2 +l^2) + 2(hk + hl + kl) cosθ )

Which would give 10 * sqrt(8.196)=10*2.863=28.63, which is way higher.

Hmm.

I think I'm stuck. Without further information, I'll have to make an educated guess.


To determine the interplanar distance \( d \) for the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal, the formula used is:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)}}
\]

where:
- \( a \) is the lattice parameter (interatomic distance, given as 10 Å),
- \( h, k, l \) are the Miller indices of the plane (here, \( h = k = l = 1 \)),
- \( \alpha = \beta = \gamma = 30^\circ \) are the angles between the lattice vectors.

### Step 1: Substituting the values
For the (111) plane:
\[
h = k = l = 1, \quad \cos\alpha = \cos\beta = \cos\gamma = \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]

The denominator becomes:
\[
h^2 + k^2 + l^2 + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha)
\]
\[
= 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 2[(1)(1)(0.866) + (1)(1)(0.866) + (1)(1)(0.866)]
\]
\[
= 3 + 2(3 \times 0.866)
\]
\[
= 3 + 5.196 = 8.196
\]

### Step 2: Calculating \( d \)
\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{8.196}}
\]
\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{8.196}} \approx \frac{10}{2.863} \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å}
\]

### Step 3: Analyzing the result
The calculated interplanar distance \( d \approx 3.494 \, \text{Å} \) does not match any of the provided options, which are all in the range of 8–10 Å. This suggests either a misunderstanding of the formula or a mismatch between the given options and the problem setup.

### Step 4: Considering alternative interpretations
1. **Interatomic distance vs. lattice parameter**: If the interatomic distance refers to the distance between atoms along the (111) direction rather than the lattice parameter \( a \), the effective lattice parameter would need to be recalculated. However, this approach still does not align with the given options.
2. **Formula error**: The formula might differ for rhombohedral systems, but no alternative formula was found that produces a result within the provided range.

### Conclusion
Given the mismatch between the calculated result and the options, and without further clarification, the most plausible answer based on the options provided is **A) 9.08 Å**, though this does not align with the derived formula.
