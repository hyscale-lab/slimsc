Okay, I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. Let me see what it's asking. So, the question is about titrating a diluted acetic acid solution with NaOH. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base, so the reaction should form acetate ions and water.

Alright, let's go step by step. The problem says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the total volume becomes 40 cm³. I think diluting a solution would decrease the concentration. To find the new concentration, I should use the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

Wait, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The new volume V2 is 40 cm³. So M2 = (0.05 * 20)/40 = 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M. Got that.

Next, we're titrating this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. Hmm, okay. Let's tackle each part separately.

First, the equivalence point. At equivalence, the moles of NaOH added will equal the moles of acetic acid initially present. Let's calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L) and concentration is 0.025 M. Moles = M * V = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed to reach equivalence would be moles / Molarity = 0.001 /0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. But wait, the question isn't asking for the volume, just the pH. At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. The solution will consist of sodium acetate in water, which is a buffer solution. But wait, sodium acetate is the salt of a weak acid, so it will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic. The pH will be determined by the Kb of the acetate ion.

Wait, how do I find Kb? Oh, right. Kb = Kw / Ka. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate at equivalence? Let's see, the moles are 0.001, and the total volume is the sum of the diluted acetic acid and the NaOH added. Oh wait, the NaOH volume at 25% titration is 5 cm³, but wait no—wait, the equivalence point is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. So the total volume would be 40 cm³ (original solution) plus 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³. So concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

So now, using the Kb expression. Kb = [OH-][A-]/[HA]. Wait, no, since all is A- (acetate), which hydrolyzes in water. The hydrolysis reaction is A- + H2O ↔ HA + OH-. So Kb = [HA][OH-]/[A-].

Since Kb is small, we can assume that the change is negligible. Let me set up the equation. Let x be the [OH-] produced. So Kb = x²/(0.02) ≈ 5.405e-1
