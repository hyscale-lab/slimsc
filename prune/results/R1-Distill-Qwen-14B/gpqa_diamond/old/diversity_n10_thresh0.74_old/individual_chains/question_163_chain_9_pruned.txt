Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this. Also, we have to determine the pH of the resulting solution. There are four options provided, labeled A to D.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, which is a base. When it's dissolved in an acid, a neutralization reaction should occur. The acid will donate H+ ions, which will react with the hydroxide ions from Fe(OH)3.

So the first thing I need to do is write the chemical equation for this reaction. Let's see, Fe(OH)3 is reacting with a monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it provides one H+ per molecule. Let's assume the acid is HCl, which is a strong acid commonly used in such problems.

The reaction should be something like:
Fe(OH)3 + HCl → FeCl3 + H2O

Wait, but let me balance that. Fe(OH)3 has three OH- groups. So to completely neutralize it, each OH- needs an H+. Since HCl gives one H+ per molecule, I'll need three HCl molecules to react with each Fe(OH)3 molecule.

So the balanced equation is:
Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

That makes sense. Now, I need to find out how much HCl is required to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3.

First, I'll calculate the number of moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Let's compute that.

Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- group is 17 g/mol (since O is 16 and H is 1). So for Fe(OH)3, it's 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me check that calculation: 0.1 divided by approximately 107 is around 0.0009346, so around 9.35e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl, the required moles of HCl are 3 * 0.000935 = approximately 0.002805 moles.

Wait, but wait, the acid is monobasic, so each HCl gives one H+. So the mole ratio is indeed 3:1, Fe(OH)3 to HCl.

Now, the HCl solution is 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter. So to find the volume needed, I can use the formula:

Volume (L) = moles / Molarity.

So Volume = 0.002805 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02805 liters. Since 1 liter is 1000 cm³, that's 28.05 cm³.

Wait, that's one of the options. Looking at the options:

Option C says 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

Option B is 30.09 cm³ and pH 2.69.

Hmm. So according to this, the volume is about 28.05 cm³, which matches option C. But wait, that's only the first part. The second part is the pH of the resulting solution.

Wait, what's the concentration of H+ ions in the solution after the reaction?

After the reaction, we have FeCl3 in solution. FeCl3 is a salt of a strong acid (HCl) and a weak base (Fe(OH)3). So when FeCl3 dissolves in water, it hydrolyzes to produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

So the pH depends on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions.

The solution after mixing will have a certain concentration of Fe^3+ ions. Let me think about that.

The initial solution is 100 cm³, and we added 28.05 cm³ of H
