Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, let's read it carefully.

So, the problem says we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200Â°C without air. Then, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes.

Tube 1 is filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. The weight increased by 3.60g. Tube 2 has Ca(OH)2 solution, but its weight didn't change. Tube 3 has red-hot copper, and it gained 0.80g, forming CuO. Finally, only 2.24 liters of gas C remained at standard temperature and pressure.

We need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

Wait, okay, let's break this down. The setup involves decomposition of the salts upon heating, producing gases. The gases then react with different substances in the tubes.

First, when the salts are heated, they decompose. Since the mixture passes through Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong drying agent, I think it's for absorbing moisture. Wait, no, Mg(ClO4)2 is used to absorb water vapor. Oh, right! Mg(ClO4)2 is a desiccant, so it absorbs water, leading to weight gain. So, the gas that reacts with Mg(ClO4)2 is probably water vapor, H2O. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is anhydrous; when it absorbs water, it gains mass.

So, the weight gain in tube 1 (3.60g) must be water. The formula for water is H2O, molar mass 18 g/mol. So, moles of H2O = 3.60g / 18g/mol = 0.2 mol.

Wait, but another possibility is that maybe the gas is not water. Could it be something else? Or maybe not. Because Mg(ClO4)2 is used for absorbing H2O. So yes, the gas is H2O.

Next, the second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. The weight didn't change. So, if any gas were CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water, causing
