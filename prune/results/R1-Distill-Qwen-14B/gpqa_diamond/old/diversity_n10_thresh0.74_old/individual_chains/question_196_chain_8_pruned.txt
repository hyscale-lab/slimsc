Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that harmonic oscillators are systems that experience a restoring force proportional to their displacement, like a mass on a spring. But this one is relativistic, so I guess relativity plays a role here, probably in the form of the relativistic mass or something like that.

The problem states: a 1-dimensional oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A, obeying Hooke's law F = -kx. We're supposed to find the maximum speed v_max. The options are given as A to D.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator can be found using energy conservation. The potential energy at maximum displacement (amplitude A) is (1/2)kA². This is converted into kinetic energy at the equilibrium point, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA². Solving that gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But wait, that's the non-relativistic case. The question is relativistic, so I can't use that directly.

In relativity, when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, the mass increases due to relativistic effects. The relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv²; relativistic effects must be considered.

So for the relativistic oscillator, the total energy should include relativistic kinetic energy. Let me think about this. The potential energy in a spring is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is different. Or wait, in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc², so the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but when the mass is oscillating, at the equilibrium point (x=0), all the energy is kinetic, and at maximum displacement (x=A), all is potential. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which equals the kinetic energy at x=0, which is the relativistic kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Wait a second. Let me clarify. The potential energy in a spring is (1/2)kx², regardless of relativity. So when the oscillator is at x = A,
