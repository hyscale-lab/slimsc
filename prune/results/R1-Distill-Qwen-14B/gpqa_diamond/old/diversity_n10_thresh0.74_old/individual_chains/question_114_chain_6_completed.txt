Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to break it down. The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two consecutive reactions. Hmm, I remember from my studies that reagents play a big role in determining the type of reaction that occurs.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN in the presence of reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So it's a ketone. When a ketone reacts with NaCN, I think it's a nucleophilic addition. But wait, usually ketones react with cyanide under certain conditions. I remember that in the presence of a strong acid, like H3O+ or H2SO4, the cyanide ion can attack the carbonyl group. So maybe A is an acid?

Let me think about the product. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be NC-C(CH3)2-OH. Wait, no, wait. The starting material is butan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. So when NaCN adds, the mechanism would be adding HCN to the carbonyl, right? So the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw it. Butan-2-one is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is a four-carbon chain where the ketone is on C2. So structure is CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-2-one is CH3-CO-CH2-CH3. So when NaCN adds, the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon, and then H+ comes from somewhere. So in acid conditions, the mechanism is probably acid-catalyzed.

So the first step would be the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then, CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to a tetrahedral intermediate. Then, the leaving group (water) departs, and the oxygen gets a proton. Wait, but in the product, we have an alcohol and a nitrile group. So I think the product is formed via addition of HCN, which then loses water to form the nitrile.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN-) under acidic conditions, it undergoes addition to form a cyanohydrin. A cyanohydrin is an alcohol adjacent to a nitrile group. So in this case, the product is a cyanohydrin. So the reagent A should be an acid catalyst, like H3O+ or H2SO4.

So for the first reaction, A is an acid, like H3O+ or perhaps H2SO4. Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+ or NaHSO3. Wait, NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite, which is a weaker acid. I think H3O+ is a stronger acid, so more likely the catalyst here.

Moving on to the second reaction. The starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, and it's reacting with reagent B (in the presence of H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, how do you convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid? I remember that one common method is hydrolysis. But the conditions matter. For nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid, it's typically done under strong acidic conditions with heat, or perhaps using a strong acid and water.

Alternatively, another method is using a strong oxidizing agent. Oh wait, but in this case, the reagent is B, and it's in H2O. So it's a hydrolysis reaction.

Wait, but the nitrile is at the beta position (since it's a butanenitrile, which is four carbons with the nitrile on the fourth carbon, or maybe I'm getting that wrong). Wait, the structure is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. So the nitrile is on the fourth carbon (butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN?), but wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think, butane has four carbons: 1, 2, 3, 4. The nitrile is on carbon 4, and the hydroxy group is on carbon 2, which is also attached to a (4-benzylphenyl) group.

So the structure is:

Ph-CH2- attached to the carbon at position 2, which also has an OH group, and the chain continues to the CN on position 4.

Wait, perhaps it's:

The molecule is CH2-C(OH)-CH2-CN, but with the middle carbon (position 2) having a phenyl group attached. Hmm. Alternatively, it's (PhCH2)C(OH)CH2CN, but I might be getting the structure wrong. But perhaps the exact structure isn't crucial for this part; maybe I should focus on the reaction.

So the reaction involves converting the nitrile group into a carboxylic acid. Nitrile hydrolysis can be done under acidic or basic conditions. For carboxylic acid formation, acidic hydrolysis is used. Alternatively, using strong oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions can oxidize nitriles to carboxylic acids.

Wait, but the reagent here is B, and in the presence of H2O. So perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction with acid as the catalyst.

Looking at the product, it's 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile (CN) has become COOH. So the reaction is nitrile → carboxylic acid.

So which reagent would do that? Well, if it's hydrolysis, a strong acid like HCl would be used. Because when you hydrolyze nitriles to carboxylic acids, you typically use H2O and HCl as the catalyst. Or maybe H3O+ (which is the same as HCl in a way, but perhaps in a different form).

Wait, but the options are given for B. The options are A) B=HCl, B) B=CH3COOH, C) B=HCl, D) B=CH3COOH.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

Option A: A=H3O+, B=HCl

Option B: A=H3O+, B=CH3COOH

Option C: A=NaHSO3, B=HCl

Option D: A=NaHSO3, B=CH3COOH

So in the second reaction, reagent B is either HCl or CH3COOH, and it's in H2O. So the second reaction is the nitrile group turning into a COOH group.

Which reagent would cause that? I think nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid is typically done with strong acid (like HCl) and heat. Alternatively, using a strong oxidizing agent like KMnO4 under acidic conditions can do it. But in this case, the reagent is B in H2O, so probably it's a hydrolysis under acidic conditions.

So B would be HCl. Wait, but the options have B as HCl in option A, and in option C, B is HCl as well. Hmm.

Wait, but for the second reaction, does the reagent need to be aqueous acid? Because the starting material is a nitrile, and the product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the second reaction uses HCl as the acid catalyst in water.

So putting it together: first reaction uses H3O+ (so A is H3O+), second reaction uses HCl (so B is HCl). Looking at the options, option A says A=H3O+, B=HCl. That would fit.

Wait, but another possibility is that the second reaction uses a different acid. Let me think. Alternatively, in the second reaction, could it be using CH3COOH as the acid?

Wait, nitrile hydrolysis to acid can be done under acidic conditions, but if it's CH3COOH, which is a weak acid, maybe it's not strong enough. In the presence of a weaker acid, perhaps it might not go all the way to the carboxylic acid but stop at the amide or something. So probably, a strong acid like HCl is needed for complete hydrolysis to the carboxylic acid.

So for the second reaction, B would be HCl.

So looking at the options, option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which matches. So option A would be the correct choice.

Wait, but I should double-check the first reaction. What if A is something else? The first reaction is butan-2-one plus NaCN and A gives the cyanohydrin. So the reagent A is the acid catalyst. So H3O+ is a strong acid, but some sources say that NaHSO3 can also be used as a catalyst. Wait, sodium bisulfite is HSO3^- Na+. So HSO3^- is a weaker acid than H3O+.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about that. So in the first reaction, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN. Without an acid catalyst, would the reaction proceed? I don't think so. So you need an acid to protonate the carbonyl.

So the possible choices for A are either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a stronger acid. NaHSO3, which is HSO3^- as the conjugate acid, would have a pKa around 1.8 (for HSO3^-; since H2SO3 has pKa1 around 1.8 and pKa2 around 7.2). Wait, wait, the pKa of HSO3^- is around 1.8, so it's a weak acid compared to H3O+, which is about pH 0 (pKa around -1.7). So H3O+ is a stronger acid.

So for the first reaction, using H3O+ as the catalyst would be more effective in protonating the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for CN^- attack. So in that case, option A would have A as H3O+, which is correct.

Thus, the correct option should be A: A=H3O+, B=HCl.


The first reaction involves the conversion of butan-2-one (a ketone) and NaCN in the presence of reagent A to form 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. This is a nucleophilic addition reaction where the cyanide ion (CN⁻) attacks the carbonyl carbon of the ketone. For this reaction to proceed efficiently, an acid catalyst is required to protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making the carbonyl carbon more electrophilic. Among the options, H₃O⁺ is a strong acid and is well-suited for this role, whereas NaHSO₃ (a weaker acid) is less effective. Therefore, A = H₃O⁺ is the correct choice for the first reaction.

The second reaction involves the conversion of 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. This is a hydrolysis reaction where the nitrile group (CN) is converted into a carboxylic acid (COOH). This type of transformation typically requires strong acidic conditions, such as those provided by HCl, to ensure complete hydrolysis of the nitrile group. While CH₃COOH (acetic acid) is a weak acid, it is insufficient for this reaction, as it cannot provide the necessary acidic strength to drive the reaction to completion. Thus, B = HCl is the correct choice for the second reaction.

Combining these considerations, the correct option is A: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl.

Answer: A
