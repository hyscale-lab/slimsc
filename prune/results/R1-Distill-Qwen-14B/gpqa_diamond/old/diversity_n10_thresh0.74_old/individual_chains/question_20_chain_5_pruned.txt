Okay, so I have this physics question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which four assumptions jointly imply the impulse approximation. The options are four statements, and we need to pick the correct combination. The options are A to D, each selecting three of the four statements.

So, the impulse approximation assumes that nucleons behave like free particles. That makes me think of the concept where each nucleon is treated independently, not considering their interactions much beyond a single collision or something.

Looking at the options:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. Oh right, in the impulse approximation, the interaction is considered to act on each nucleon individually. So this statement (1) must be part of the assumptions.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, what does that mean? Transparency might imply that other nucleons don't affect the interaction, so the interaction is only with one nucleon, and the rest don't influence it. So the nucleus doesn't stop or scatter the interaction much beyond the single nucleon. That sounds like assumption 2 is part of it.

3. The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, if quarks are non-relativistic, that would mean they're moving at speeds much less than light. But wait, in the nucleus, nucleons are made up of quarks. If the quarks are non-relativistic, does that affect the approximation? I'm a bit unsure. The impulse approximation is more about the nucleon's behavior as a whole rather than the internal structure. So maybe this point isn't directly part of the impulse approximation assumptions. Or perhaps it's about treating the nucleon as a point particle, so that its internal quarks don't contribute much to the interaction beyond the point interaction. Not sure yet.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, right, the binding forces are the nuclear forces holding the nucleons together. If the approximation ignores these binding forces, then each nucleon is treated as free. So statement 4 is definitely part of the assumptions.

So the impulse approximation assumes that each nucleon interacts as if it's free, meaning no binding forces (statement 4). Also, the interaction is only with individual nucleons (statement 1), and the nucleus doesn't affect the interaction beyond that (statement 2). 

Now, what about statement 3? The quarks being non-relativistic. I think that's more about the dynamics within the nucleon. The impulse approximation is about the nucleon's response to an interaction, not so much about the internal quark structure. So maybe statement 3 isn't one of the assumptions for the impulse approximation. Or perhaps statement 3 is related to another approximation, like the non-relativistic treatment of the nucleon itself, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the question refers to the "impulse" approximation. From what I remember, the impulse approximation is used in, say, electron scattering experiments. The idea is that the electron interacts with individual nucleons, and the rest of the nucleus doesn't affect the process much because the interaction is so brief (like a short impulse). So it's a sudden approximation, where the other nucleons don't have time to respond, so the nucleus remains transparent except for the one nucleon hit.

So statement 2, the nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon, would support this. So statements 1, 2, and 4 are part of the impulse approximation. What about statement 3?

If statement 3 says the quarks are non-relativistic, that might relate to how the nucleon itself behaves during the interaction. If the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps the nucleon's internal structure doesn't change much during the interaction. So the nucleon can be treated as a point particle, which supports the idea of free nucleons. So maybe statement 3 is also part of the assumptions.

Wait, but in the impulse approximation, we model the interaction as a short, strong force that imparts a momentum change to
