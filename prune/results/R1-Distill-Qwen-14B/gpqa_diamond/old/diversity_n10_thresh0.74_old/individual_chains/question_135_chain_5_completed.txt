Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The given Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (y) (υ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I misread that. Oh, right, the interaction term is probably something like L = -λ * f * ψ_f^dagger (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y), but the exact form might not matter too much for the decay channels. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Hmm, okay. So the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. The allowed decays would depend on the mass of X compared to the mass of the fermions involved. Since it's a boson, it can couple to any fermion pair as long as the energy conditions are met.

Wait, what's the mass of X? 6 GeV. So any fermion pair whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV can be produced. Let me think about the masses of the known fermions.

Fermions include quarks and leptons. Quarks come in different flavors with varying masses, but when considering decay products, we look at their rest masses because the X is at rest when it decays.

But wait, quarks can't be produced in isolation because of confinement. So the boson X would decay into quark-antiquark pairs only if those quarks can form bound states, like mesons, but in this case, the decay would be into quark-antiquark pairs as final states. But wait, in high-energy physics, when considering decay modes, for a boson to decay into a fermion pair, the fermions don't necessarily have to form bound states. So the decay X → q q-bar is possible if the energy allows, even if those quarks can't be isolated as free particles.

Wait, but the question is about kinematically allowed decays, so maybe it's just about the mass. So the key is whether the mass of the fermion pair is less than the mass of X.

So let's list the possible fermions. The known fermions are:

Leptons:
- Electron (e⁻), mass ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ⁻), ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ⁻), ~1.777 GeV
- Neutrinos are negligible, but since X is a boson with a mass of 6 GeV, maybe it can't decay into neutrinos because they have negligible mass, but wait, neutrinos have tiny masses, so maybe X can't decay into them if their masses are too small. But perhaps the problem assumes they don't contribute.

Quarks:
- Up (u), ~2.2 MeV (0.0022 GeV)
- Down (d), ~4.7 MeV (0.0047 GeV)
- Strange (s), ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV)
- Charm (c), ~1.25 GeV
- Bottom (b), ~4.7 GeV
- Top (t), ~173 GeV

Wait, but the X is 6 GeV, which is less than the top quark mass, so it can't decay into t t-bar. Also, the bottom quark is about ~5 GeV, so 2*m_b is about 9.4 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b-bar pairs because 2*m_b ~9.4 GeV is larger than X's mass of 6 GeV. So why is option A even having b b-bar? Because in reality, the mass of a b quark is about 4.7 GeV, so 2*m_b is about 9.4 GeV. So 6 GeV is less than 9.4 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. So any option that includes b b-bar can be excluded.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check the masses again. The problem states the mass of X is 6 GeV. So for X to decay into a pair, the sum of the two fermions' masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me think about each fermion:

Electron: ~0.0005 GeV. So 2*m_e is negligible. So X can decay into e+ e-.

Same for muon: mu is ~0.105 GeV, so 2*mu is ~0.21 GeV, which is way less than 6 GeV. So X → μ+ μ- is allowed.

Tau: ~1.777 GeV. 2*m_tau is about 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X → tau+ tau- is allowed.

What about the quarks?

u quark: ~2.2 MeV. So 2*m_u is ~4.4 MeV, way below 6 GeV. So X can decay into u u-bar.

d quark: ~4.7 MeV. 2*m_d ~9.4 MeV. So X can decay into d d-bar.

s quark: ~95 MeV (0.095 GeV). 2*m_s is ~0.19 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X → s s-bar.

c quark: ~1.25 GeV. 2*m_c = ~2.5 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X → c c-bar.

b quark: ~4.7 GeV. 2*m_b is ~9.4 GeV. X is only 6 GeV, so can't decay into b b-bar.

t quark is way too heavy (173 GeV), so no.

So possible fermion pairs are:

e+ e-,
mu+ mu-,
tau+ tau-,
u u-bar,
d d-bar,
s s-bar,
c c-bar.

Wait, what about the other quarks? Are there any others? The up, down, strange, charm, bottom, top. We've covered all except top, which is too heavy. So wait, which options include which of these?

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b-bar, which is not allowed. So A is incorrect.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, e+ e-, and mu+ mu-.

Wait, let me check option B: "X→ c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻"

That's all the allowed ones except for the b quark because 2*m_b is too big. So why isn't this the correct option?

Wait, but what about the bottom quark? Since 2*m_b is 9.4 GeV, which is more than X's mass of 6 GeV, so X can't decay into b b-bar. So any option including b b-bar is wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A includes b b-bar and others. So it's wrong.

Option B doesn't include b b-bar, but includes c c-bar, which is allowed.

Option C includes c, s, u, d, t, tau, mu, e. But wait, t is too heavy, so including t is wrong. So C is incorrect.

Option D includes b b-bar, which is incorrect.

So the correct decay channels are the ones in option B except for the fact that option B doesn't include tau? Wait no, option B includes tau, mu, e, and the quarks up, down, strange, charm.

Wait, but option B doesn't have top, which isn't relevant, and doesn't have bottom which is not allowed. So looking at the options:

Option B is X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ⁺τ⁻, μ⁺μ⁻, e⁺e⁻.

That's all the possible ones except for the b quark.

So the correct answer should be option B.

Wait, but why is option D listed? Option D includes b b-bar, which isn't allowed. So options A and D can be ruled out.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decay modes of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The decays are governed by the interaction term in the Lagrangian, which allows \( X \) to couple to fermion-antifermion pairs. The key consideration is whether the total mass of the fermion pair is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), ensuring energy conservation.

### Analysis of Fermion Masses:
1. **Leptons**:
   - Electron (\( e^- \)): \( m_e \approx 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed: \( X \to e^+ e^- \).
   - Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( m_\mu \approx 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed: \( X \to \mu^+ \mu^- \).
   - Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( m_\tau \approx 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.554 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed: \( X \to \tau^+ \tau^- \).

2. **Quarks**:
   - Up (\( u \)): \( m_u \approx 2.2 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_u \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed: \( X \to u \bar{u} \).
   - Down (\( d \)): \( m_d \approx 4.7 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_d \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed: \( X \to d \bar{d} \).
   - Strange (\( s \)): \( m_s \approx 95 \, \text{MeV} \), \( 2m_s \ll 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed: \( X \to s \bar{s} \).
   - Charm (\( c \)): \( m_c \approx 1.25 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.5 \, \text{GeV} \). Allowed: \( X \to c \bar{c} \).
   - Bottom (\( b \)): \( m_b \approx 4.7 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 9.4 \, \text{GeV} \). Forbidden: \( X \to b \bar{b} \) (since \( 2m_b > 6 \, \text{GeV} \)).
   - Top (\( t \)): \( m_t \approx 173 \, \text{GeV} \). Forbidden: \( X \to t \bar{t} \) (mass of \( X \) is much smaller than \( m_t \)).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Lists \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( X \to t \bar{t} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( X \to b \bar{b} \), which is forbidden. Incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The kinematically allowed decays of \( X \) are \( X \to c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), as listed in **Option B**.
