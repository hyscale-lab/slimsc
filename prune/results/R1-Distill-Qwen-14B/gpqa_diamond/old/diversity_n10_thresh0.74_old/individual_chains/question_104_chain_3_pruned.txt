Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity (RV) method detects planets by measuring the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity causes the star to wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the star's motion towards or away from us.

The question says that two stars with the same mass each have a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected the first planet causing a 5 milliangstrom shift, and the second caused a 7 milliangstrom shift. We need to find how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, so the RV method depends on the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit. The velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. I think K is related to the mass of the planet and the star's mass, as well as the orbital period and the size of the orbit.

The formula I vaguely remember is K = (v) = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) )^(1/1) ) * something. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the star's velocity. The star's velocity semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )) ) ?

Alternatively, since M_p is much smaller than M_star (Neptune is much smaller than the Sun), M_p/M_star is negligible. So the formula simplifies. Let me think: the formula for K is K ≈ (v) = ( (G * M_p) / (M_star) )^(1/3) ) * (2π / (P * c)) )^(1/3) ) * something? Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the variables.

Wait, I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) * (1 / c )? No, maybe not. Let me get this right. The radial velocity semi-amplitude formula is K = (v) = [ (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (2π) / P )^(1/3) ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) ) ) * (1 / (c)) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should recall that the RV method is based on the Doppler effect. The shift in wavelength λ (in this case, milliangstroms) is related to the velocity of the star. The relation is λ shift proportional to velocity. So a larger shift means higher velocity.

The shift is given by the formula: λ_shift = (v / c) * λ0, where λ0 is the rest wavelength, v is the velocity, and c is the speed of light. So, the velocity K is proportional to the shift. So, K1 = (5 milliangstrom) * c / λ0, and K2 = (7 milliangstrom) * c / λ0. Since λ0 is the same for both measurements, the ratio K2/K1 = 7/5 = 1.4.

Wait, but the RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K. So K is proportional to the shift in wavelength. So K2 = (7/5) K1.

Now, the formula for K is K = ( (G * P ) / (2π) )^(-1/3) * (M_p sin i
