Okay, let's tackle this astronomy problem. Hmm, it's about stars and their spectra, right? So, the question involves the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. I remember that when stars have spots, their overall effective temperature changes, which in turn affects the ionization states of elements in their atmosphere.

Wait, the star's Teff drops when spots cover 40% of its surface. So without spots, Teff is 6000 K, and with spots, it's 5500 K. But wait, how does this affect the photosphere? Oh right, the photosphere is the visible part, so when spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere goes down. But I'm not sure how the spots themselves affect the temperature. Are the spots cooler and thus when they cover part of the surface, the overall emission is lower?

But the question is about the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels. I remember that in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms between energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio of populations (n1/n2) depends on the energy difference between the levels and the temperature.

The Boltzmann equation says that n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2-E1)/(k*T) ). So the ratio n1/n2 is inversely proportional to that.

But wait, E is the energy of each level. The transition between the two levels corresponds to a wavelength of 1448 Å. So we can find the energy difference using the photon energy equation E = hc/λ.

Let me compute E2-E1. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448e-10 meters.

So E = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10). Let's calculate that:

6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 1448e-10 m gives 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J per photon.

Wait, but to convert that into eV, since often in such problems, energy levels are expressed in electron volts. Oh right, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E in eV is 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that seems a bit high. Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1448e-10 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = Let's do the exponents: 1e-25 / 1e-7 is 1e-18. 1.9878 / 1.448 ≈ 1.372. So 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.56 eV. Wait, that's a big energy difference. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the wavelength unit. Wait, 1448 Å is 144.8 nm, right? Because 1 Å is 0.1 nm. So 1448 Å is 144.8 nm. That's in the UV range. Oh, okay, so that's a high energy photon, so energy difference is about 8.56 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Titanium has various energy levels, but this might be a transition in the UV. Anyway, moving on.

The ratio n1/n2 is proportional to exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). Wait, let me get the Boltzmann factor right.

n2 = (g2/g1) * n1 * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

But the question is about the ratio n1/n2 when the star has spots versus when it doesn't. So the ratio without spots would be higher or lower than when it has spots, depending on the temperature.

Wait, when the star has spots (Teff=5500K), the temperature is lower than when it doesn't (6000K). So with lower T, the exponent becomes more positive, because E is positive. So exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) is larger when T is lower because the denominator is smaller, making the exponent more negative. Wait, no: with lower T, the exponent -ΔE/(k T) becomes a larger negative number, so the exponential becomes smaller. Wait, let's think.

Wait, E2 is higher than E1 because the photon is emitted when an electron drops from E2 to E1. So E2 > E1, ΔE = E2 - E1 ≈ 8.56 eV.

So the exponent is -ΔE/(k T). Since ΔE is positive, this exponent is negative.

At T=6000 K, what is the exponent? Let's compute (ΔE) / (k T).

k is the Boltzmann constant, 8.617e-5 eV/K. So:

ΔE = 8.56 eV

T1 = 6000 K: (8.56) / (8.617e-5 * 6000) ≈ 8.56 / (0.517) ≈ 16.55

Similarly, for T2=5500 K: 8.56 / (8.617e-5 * 5500) ≈ 8.56 / 0.473 ≈ 18.10

Wait, but wait, these exponents are huge. So exp(-16.55) is practically zero, but wait, why are the exponents so large?

Wait, that can't be right. Because with such a large exponent, the ratio n2/n1 would be almost zero, implying that almost all Ti atoms are in the lower level. But when the temperature is lower, the exponent becomes larger, so the ratio (n2/n1) would be even smaller, meaning even more atoms in the lower level. So the ratio n1/n2 would be higher when the temperature is lower.

Wait, but wait, the ratio n1/n2 is (n1)/(n2) = 1/(n2/n1) = 1/[ (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) ]

So when temperature decreases, the exponent term increases (since T is in denominator). So the denominator increases, making the overall ratio (n1/n2) decrease.

Wait, wait, maybe I got this wrong. Let me think again. Let's define the ratio R = n1/n2.

From Boltzmann:

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So R = n1/n2 = 1/( (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So R is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So when T increases, the exponent increases, so R increases. When T decreases, R decreases.

Wait, but wait, in our case, when the star has spots, T is lower (5500 K). So R (n1/n2) decreases when T decreases, because the exponent ΔE/(k T) is larger when T is higher.

Wait, but the question says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Let me read the question again.

"In the stellar photosphere, when examining the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) is lower. So when T is lower, R is lower. That aligns with what I found earlier: R is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)), so lower T → lower R.

So in the problem, without spots (T=6000 K), R is higher. With spots (5500 K), R is lower.

The question is asking by what factor the ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. So factor = R_without_spots / R_with_spots.

Because R is proportional to exp( ΔE/(k T) ), the factor would be exp(ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) )

So factor = exp[ (ΔE/(k))(1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ]

Wait, wait, is that correct? Let me see.

Because R ∝ exp(ΔE/(k T)), so R_without / R_with = exp(ΔE/(k T1)) / exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) 

Wait, no, more accurately, because:

R1 = exp( ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k T1) ) / exp( ΔE/(k T2) ) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Since T1=6000 K and T2=5500 K, 1/T1 = 1/6000 ≈ 0.00016667, 1/T2≈ 0.00018182.

So (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.00018182 - 0.00016667) = 0.00001515.

Wait, because T2 is 5500, which is lower than T1=6000. So 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So 1/T1 - 1/T2 is negative. Oh, but I think I had the order wrong.

Wait, R_without is when T is higher (6000), and R_with is when T is lower (5500). So the factor is R_without / R_with = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ), but since 1/T1 < 1/T2, the exponent is negative. So the factor is less than 1. But wait, earlier analysis says that R decreases when T decreases, so R_without is larger than R_with, so the ratio is >1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exponents correctly.

Let me write the factor as:

Factor = exp( (ΔE/(k)) ( (1/T1) - (1/T2) ) )

Given that T1=6000, T2=5500. So 1/T1 ≈0.000166667, 1/T2≈0.000181818.

So (1/T1 - 1/T2) = (0.000166667 - 0.000181818 ) = -0.000015151.

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) * (-0.000015151 )

But ΔE is 8.56 eV, k is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So (8.56) / (8.617e-5) ≈ 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99320.

So multiply by the -0.000015151:

99320 * (-0.000015151) ≈ -99320 * 0.000015151 ≈ Let's compute:

0.000015151 is approximately 1.5151e-5.

So 99320 * 1.5151e-5 ≈ 99320 * 0.000015151 ≈ Let's compute:

99320 * 0.000015 = 99320 * 1.5e-5 = 99320 * 0.000015 = 1.49 (approx). So about 1.49, but since it's negative, -1.49.

So the exponent is approximately -1.49.

So the factor is exp( -1.49 ) ≈ e^(-1.49) ≈ Let's calculate e^1.49. e^1 is 2.718, e^1.4 is about 4.055, e^1.49 is about 4.455. So e^(-1.49) ≈ 1/4.455 ≈ 0.224.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the factor is 0.224, that would mean R_without is 0.224 times R_with, which would imply R decreases when T decreases, which aligns with the problem statement. But the question asks what is the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. So without spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor should be (R_without)/(R_with) = approximately 4.45, which would be 1/0.224 ≈4.45.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the sign in the exponent. Let me re-express:

Factor = exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is (ΔE/k) * ( (1/6000) - (1/5500) )

Which is positive or negative?

Because 1/6000 < 1/5500, so 1/6000 - 1/5500 is negative.

ΔE is positive, k is positive. So the entire exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is less than 1.

Wait, but that would make the factor R_without/R_with equal to exp(negative) which is less than 1. But that would mean R_without < R_with, which contradicts the earlier conclusion that when T decreases, R decreases. Wait, in the problem, when T decreases (from 6000 to 5500), R decreases, so R_without is higher than R_with. So the ratio R_without/R_with should be greater than 1.

Hmm, maybe I made an error in setting up the exponents.

Wait, perhaps the factor is exp( (ΔE/k)( (1/T2) - (1/T1) ) ), because when T decreases, the exponent would be positive, leading to a higher factor.

Wait, let's think again. The ratio R is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So R1 = exp(ΔE/(k T1)).

R2 = exp(ΔE/(k T2)).

So R1/R2 = exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, but as T1 > T2, 1/T1 < 1/T2, so (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative.

So R1/R2 = exp( negative ) < 1.

Which implies that R1 < R2? But that's not possible, because when T is higher (T1=6000), R should be higher.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the definition of R. Let me recheck:

n1 is the number in level 1, n2 in level 2.

R = n1/n2. 

From Boltzmann: n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So R = n1/n2 = 1/( (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) ) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) )

Ah, so R is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T)). So when T increases, R increases.

So R1 (at T=6000) is higher than R2 (at T=5500).

So R1/R2 = [exp(ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(ΔE/(k T2))] ] = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

So compute this exponent.

But wait, T1=6000, T2=5500.

So 1/T1 = 1/6000 = 0.000166667 K^-1.

1/T2=1/5500≈ 0.000181818 K^-1.

So 1/T1 -1/T2 = -0.000015151 K^-1.

So (ΔE/(k)) (1/T1 -1/T2) ) = (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (-0.000015151) K^-1.

Compute (8.56 ) / (8.617e-5 ) = approximately 8.56 / 0.00008617 ≈ 99320.

Multiply by (-0.000015151) → 99320 * (-0.000015151) ≈ -1.507.

So the exponent is approximately -1.507.

Thus, R1/R2 = exp( -1.507 ) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but that would suggest that R1 is 0.221 times R2. So R_without is 0.221 times R_with. But that's impossible because R_without should be higher when T is higher.

Ah! I see my mistake. I think I messed up the calculation of (1/T1 - 1/T2). Let me recount.

Wait, 1/6000 is 0.000166667, and 1/5500 is approximately 0.000181818. So 1/T1 is less than 1/T2. So (1/T1 - 1/T2) is negative, which makes the exponent negative. So exp(negative) is less than 1. That would mean R1 < R2, which contradicts the earlier conclusion. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should have used (1/T2 - 1/T1) in the exponent.

Wait, let's think again.

The ratio R1/R2 is exp(ΔE/(k T1) - ΔE/(k T2) ) = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is the same as before.

But in our case, T1=6000 (no spots), T2=5500 (spots). So 1/T1 is less than 1/T2, so 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative. So the exponent is negative, hence R1/R2 < 1.

But in reality, R should be higher when T is higher. So where's the mistake?

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is E1 - E2, not E2 - E1. Because if the transition is from E2 to E1, then E2 > E1, so E2-E1 is positive.

Wait, the Boltzmann equation is for the ratio n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

So in the expression for R = n1/n2, it's exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

Thus, R is proportional to exp( (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So when T increases, R increases.

Thus, R1 (T=6000) is higher than R2 (T=5500).

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Wait, no, because R1 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T1) )

R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( (E2-E1)/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is the same as before. So that gives R1/R2 = exp( (8.56 eV) / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Wait, let's compute (1/T1 - 1/T2) again.

1/T1 = 1/6000 = 0.000166667

1/T2 = 1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818

So 1/T1 -1/T2 = -0.000015151

So the exponent is (8.56 / 8.617e-5 ) * (-0.000015151 )

Compute (8.56 / 8.617e-5 ) = 8.56 / 0.00008617 = approximately 99320.

Multiply by (-0.000015151) → 99320 * (-0.000015151) ≈ -1.507.

So exp(-1.507) ≈ 0.221.

So R1/R2 = 0.221, which would imply that R1 is about 22% of R2. But that can't be, since when T is higher, R should be higher. So R1 should be larger than R2, so the ratio R1/R2 should be greater than 1, not less than 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way I'm setting up the ratio. Let me re-express everything.

Let me define R as R = n1/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Where ΔE = E2 - E1.

When T is higher, exp(ΔE/(k T)) is larger, so R is higher.

So when T increases, R increases.

Thus, R at 6000 K (R1) is higher than R at 5500 K (R2).

So R1 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k *6000) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k *5500) )

The ratio R1/R2 is exp[ ΔE/(k) (1/6000 -1/5500) ) ]

Wait, but 1/6000 < 1/5500, so the term in the exponent is negative. So R1/R2 is exp( negative ), which is less than 1, meaning R1 < R2. That's impossible because higher T should give higher R.

Wait, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the formula is correct. So perhaps my calculation of the exponent is wrong.

Wait, let me compute (1/6000 - 1/5500) = (5500 - 6000) / (6000 * 5500) = (-500) / (33,000,000) ) = -5e2 / 3.3e7 = -1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (8.56 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (-1.515e-5 K)

So 8.56 /8.617e-5 = 99320 (as before). Multiply by (-1.515e-5):

99320 * (-1.515e-5) = approx -1.507.

So exp(-1.507) is about 0.221.

But that would imply R1=0.221 R2.

Which would mean that when T is higher, the ratio R is lower, which contradicts the theory.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ΔE. Let me double-check.

ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

Wait, hc = 12400 eV·Å (since 1240 eV·nm = 12400 eV·Å). So wavelength λ=1448 Å.

So ΔE = 12400 eV·Å / 1448 Å ≈ 8.56 eV. Correct.

So that part is correct.

Wait, but what if the transition is from E1 to E2, which would be a lower energy transition? No, because in that case, E2 would be lower than E1, which wouldn't make sense for an emitted photon.

Wait, perhaps I have the energy difference backwards. Maybe the energy difference is E1 - E2.

No, because when an electron drops from E2 to E1, the photon emitted has energy E2 - E1. So E2>E1, ΔE is positive.

Therefore, the earlier calculation holds.

So with this, the factor would be 0.221, but that can't be right because the ratio should be higher when T is higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I should have used the reciprocal.

Wait, the ratio R is n1/n2. So when the star has no spots (higher T), R is larger, so R1 is bigger than R2.

Thus, R1/R2 should be greater than 1.

But according to calculations, it's about 0.221, which is less than 1. So that can't be right.

Hmm, I'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me try another approach.

Let me compute the exponents for each T.

At T1 = 6000 K:

ΔE/(k T1) = 8.56 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K * 6000 K) = 8.56 / (0.517) ≈16.55.

So exp(16.55) is a huge number. But wait, no, because that's exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, wait, no, wait. No, no, no. Wait, that can't be right. Because 8.56 eV is a very large energy for a photon. For example, 1 eV is about 1.6e-19 J. So 8 eV is 1.3e-18 J. But the thermal energy at 6000 K is k*T, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K = 0.517 eV. So 8.56 eV is about 16 times larger than k*T.

So the exponent ΔE/(k T) is about 16.55.

So exp(16.55) is a huge number, about e^16 ≈ 8.7e7, but since it's 16.55, even larger.

Wait, but when we compute R1/R2, which is exp( (ΔE/k)(1/T1 - 1/T2) ), which is exp( (8.56 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Wait, but (1/6000 -1/5500) is negative, so the exponent is negative, so exp(negative) is small.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition of R.

Wait, R is n1/n2. So R is proportional to exp(ΔE/(k T) ), as per the Boltzmann equation.

So let's compute R1 and R2.

R1 = exp(ΔE/(k * T1) )

R2 = exp(ΔE/(k * T2) )

So R1 = exp(8.56/(8.617e-5 *6000) )

Wait, 8.617e-5 eV/K *6000 K = 0.51702 eV.

So 8.56 eV / 0.51702 eV ≈ 16.546.

So R1 = exp(16.546) ≈ ?

But 16.546 is a very large exponent. Let's compute:

e^16 is about 8.88e7. e^16.546 is about e^16 * e^0.546. e^0.546 ≈ 1.727. So e^16.546 ≈ 8.88e7 *1.727 ≈ approx 1.53e8.

Similarly, R2 = exp(8.56/(8.617e-5 *5500) )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

So 8.56/0.4739 ≈ 18.078.

So R2 = exp(18.078) ≈ e^18 ≈ 6.56e7, e^18.078 is higher. Let's compute e^18: about 6.56e7, e^18.078 is e^(18) * e^0.078 ≈6.56e7 * 1.081 ≈7.08e7.

So R1 is about 1.53e8, R2 is about 7.08e7.

So R1/R2 ≈ 1.53e8 /7.08e7 ≈ 2.16.

Hmm, that's about 2.16. But looking at the options, the closest is option D) ~2.9, or option C) ~4.5.

Wait, but in our calculation, it's about 2.16. Not matching any options exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents.

Let me recompute R1 and R2 more accurately.

Compute R1:

T1=6000 K.

ΔE=8.56 eV.

k=8.617e-5 eV/K.

ΔE/(k T) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000 )

8.617e-5 *6000 = 0.51702 eV.

So 8.56 / 0.51702 = 16.546.

So R1 = exp(16.546) ≈ ?

Let me compute e^16.546.

We know that ln(1e7) is about 16.118 (since e^16.118 ≈1e7). Because e^10 is about 22026, e^15 ≈3.269e6, e^16≈8.886e6, e^17≈2.415e7.

Wait, e^16.546 is between e^16 and e^17.

Compute 16.546 -16=0.546.

e^0.546 ≈1.727.

So e^16.546 = e^16 * e^0.546 ≈ 8.886e6 * 1.727 ≈ 15.31e6 ≈1.53e7.

Wait, but earlier I thought e^16 is 8.88e6, so e^16.546 would be higher than that.

Wait, no: e^16.546 is e^(16 + 0.546) = e^16 * e^0.546.

e^16 is approximately 8.886e6.

e^0.546 is about 1.727.

So e^16.546 = 8.886e6 * 1.727 ≈ 15.3e6 ≈1.53e7.

R2:

T2=5500 K.

ΔE/(k T2) = 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *5500) =8.56/(0.4739)≈18.078.

e^18.078 = ?

We know that e^18 is approximately 6.56e7.

Compute 18.078 = 18 + 0.078.

e^0.078 = approx 1.081.

So e^18.078 ≈6.56e7 * 1.081 ≈7.08e7.

So R1 =1.53e7, R2=7.08e7.

So R1/R2 =1.53e7 /7.08e7 ≈0.216.

Wait, that's the same as before. So R1 is 0.216 R2.

But that would mean that when T is higher, R is lower, which contradicts the theory.

I must have made a mistake in setting up the ratio.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Wait, no, the question says ratio of n1 to n2.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the transition is from E1 to E2, which would imply E1 > E2. But that can't be because the photon emitted is at 1448 Å, which is a high energy (short wavelength), so E2 must be higher than E1.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the ratio n2/n1, but the problem states n1/n2.

Wait, let me re-read the problem.

"the ratio of the number of neutral atoms of Ti in two energetic levels (level 1 and level 2), astronomers have observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots."

So without spots, the ratio is higher. So R = n1/n2 is higher when T is higher (6000 K) than when T is lower (5500 K).

So when T decreases, R decreases.

So the factor is R_without/R_with = (R1)/(R2) = ?

But according to our earlier calculations, R1 is 0.216 R2. That would mean R1 < R2, which contradicts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the exponents. Because 8.56 eV is a very high energy, and at 6000 K, the thermal energy is only ~0.517 eV. So the exponent (8.56 / 0.517 ) is about 16.55.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp(16.55) ≈ 8e7 ?

But wait, if the energy is that high, the number of atoms in the upper level would be negligible. So n2 would be very small compared to n1, making R very large. So R = n1/n2 would be huge.

Wait, but wait, when T decreases, the exponent becomes even larger (since denominator becomes smaller), so n2 would be even smaller, making R even larger. But the problem says that R decreases when the star has spots, which is when T is lower.

This is contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about ionization, not excitation. Because with lower T, more ionization occurs. Wait, no, higher T leads to more ionization.

Wait, but if the star's T decreases, the ionization fraction decreases, so more neutral atoms would be present. So for neutral Ti, when T is lower, perhaps more atoms are in the lower energy levels, but wait, the energy levels considered are within the neutral atom, so ionization is about losing electrons, but the question is about excitation between energy levels within the same ion.

Hmm, perhaps I need to approach this differently. Let's think about the Saha equation. No, the problem states that the photosphere is in LTE, so the Saha equation applies for ionization, but for excitation between energy levels, it's the Boltzmann equation.

Wait, another approach: the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So when T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so R increases.

So when T is higher (no spots, T=6000 K), R is larger than when T is lower (spots, 5500 K).

So the factor is R_without_spots / R_with_spots = [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T1)) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T2)) ] = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

As before.

So the factor is exp( (8.56 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) ) * (1/6000 - 1/5500 )

Which is exp( 99320 * ( -0.000015151 ) ) ≈ exp( -1.507 ) ≈ 0.221.

Wait, but that would imply that R_without is 0.221 times R_with, which is ~22% of R_with. That can't be right because when T increases, R increases.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I should compute (1/T2 - 1/T1) instead.

Wait, because R_without is at T1=6000, R_with at T2=5500.

The factor is R1/R2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

But since 1/T2 >1/T1, 1/T1 -1/T2 is negative, so the exponent is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should take the absolute value, but no—no, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong sign in the exponent.

Wait, no. The Boltzmann factor is exp( -(E2-E1)/(k T) ) for n2/n1.

So, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Thus, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So R = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, R increases.

So for R1 (T1) and R2 (T2):

R1 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) exp( ΔE/(k T2) )

Thus, R1/R2 = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )

Which is the same as before.

So the factor is exp( (8.56 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) * (1/6000 - 1/5500) )

Which is exp( 99320 * (-0.000015151) ) = exp( -1.507 )

Which is ~0.221.

But this would imply R1 is 0.221 R2, which is impossible because T1 > T2, R should be higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the energy is given per photon, but the energy levels are per atom. Hmm, no, I think that's correctly handled.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the inverse of the ratio. Let me compute R_with / R_without.

But the question asks for the factor by which the ratio changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. That is, R1/R2.

But according to the calculation, this is ~0.221, which is less than one. So R1 is 22% of R2. That would mean when the star has no spots, the ratio is lower than when it does. But the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, meaning R_with < R1.

Wait, no. The problem says, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So R_with is less than R1.

So, according to the problem, R1 > R_with.

But according to our calculation, R1/R_with = 0.221 <1, meaning R1 < R_with. Which contradicts.

So I must have made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is E1 - E2, not E2 - E1.

Let me re-express.

If the transition is from E1 to E2, then E2 > E1, the photon emitted has energy E2-E1=ΔE.

If the transition is from E2 to E1, the photon has energy E2-E1=ΔE.

So the calculation remains the same.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is actually n2/n1, not n1/n2.

Because the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

If the ratio is n2/n1, when T increases, the ratio would increase because higher T favors the upper level.

So if the ratio is n2/n1, then when T increases, n2/n1 increases.

So without spots (T=6000), n2/n1 is higher than with spots (T=5500).

Thus, the factor would be (n2/n1)_without / (n2/n1)_with.

Which is [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

= exp( ( -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ) )

= exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is exp( (8.56)/(8.617e-5) * (1/5500 - 1/6000) )

Compute (1/5500 -1/6000) = (6000-5500)/(5500 *6000) ) = 500/(33,000,000) )= 1/(66,000) ≈1.515e-5.

So exponent is (8.56 /8.617e-5 ) *1.515e-5 = (99320) *1.515e-5 ≈1.507.

So the factor is exp(1.507) ≈4.5.

So 4.5 would be the factor. So the ratio of (n2/n1) without spots compared to with spots is about 4.5.

But wait, the question is about the ratio n1/n2. So if the ratio n2/n1 is 4.5 times higher without spots, then the ratio n1/n2 is 1/4.5 times as high. So the factor would be 1/4.5 ≈0.222.

But according to the problem statement, the ratio n1/n2 decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, n1/n2 is higher than when it has spots. So if n2/n1 is 4.5 times higher without spots, then n1/n2 is lower without spots? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no. If n2/n1 is 4.5 times higher when without spots, then n1/n2 is 1/4.5 times (lower) when without spots.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 decreases. So when without spots, n1/n2 is higher.

So if n2/n1 increases (more n2), then n1/n2 decreases. Which aligns with the problem statement. So that makes sense.

But the question asks for the factor by which the ratio n1/n2 changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots.

So the factor would be (n1/n2)_without / (n1/n2)_with.

Which would be [ (n2/n1)_with ] / [ (n2/n1)_without ].

Because (n1/n2) = 1/(n2/n1).

So if (n2/n1)_without =4.5 * (n2/n1)_with, then (n1/n2)_without = 1/(4.5) * (n1/n2)_with.

So the factor (n1/n2)_without / (n1/n2)_with = 1/4.5 ≈0.222.

But the problem says that the ratio decreases when the star has spots, so (n1/n2)_without is higher than (n1/n2)_with.

So the factor is greater than 1. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the factor is (n1/n2)_without / (n1/n2)_with = (R1)/(R2) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T1 -1/T2) )

Which is exp( -1.507 ) ≈0.221.

So R1 =0.221 * R2. So when without spots, R is 0.221 times R_with.

Which would mean R_without is lower than R_with, but the problem states that R decreases when the star has spots, which would imply R_without is higher than R_with.

I'm getting more confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I have the energy difference backwards. Let me exchange E1 and E2.

Suppose that the transition is from E1 to E2, which would have lower energy (longer wavelength), but the given wavelength is 1448 Å, which is UV, high energy.

Wait, no, that's not possible. The calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when the star's overall photospheric temperature decreases, the effective temperature is lower, but the spots are cooler, so the overall photosphere emits less. But the question is about the ratio in the photosphere. So the photosphere's temperature is lower, so the Boltzmann factor changes as we discussed.

But perhaps the actual effect is that when the star has spots, the average temperature is lower, leading to more population in the lower energy levels, which would mean higher R (n1/n2). But the problem says R decreases when the star has spots, so this can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about the effect of temperature on the ratio.

If the energy difference is large (like 8.56 eV), which is much larger than k*T, then the upper level (level 2) is barely populated. So most atoms are in level 1. So n2 is small, R =n1/n2 is large.

If temperature increases, the exponent increases (but the denominator in the exponent is T, so for higher T, the exponent is smaller), but wait, no: ΔE/(k T) increases when T decreases.

Wait, for ΔE=8.56 eV, T=6000 K: ΔE/(kT) = 8.56/(0.517) ≈16.55.

At T=5500 K, ΔE/(k T) =8.56/(0.4739) ≈18.08.

So at higher T, the exponent is smaller. Wait, no: 16.55 is less than 18.08. So when T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases.

Ah! So when T increases, the exponent becomes smaller.

Because for a given ΔE, when T increases, the term ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases.

Wait, no, no. Wait, at T=6000 K, the exponent is 16.55, leading to a very large R.

At T=5500 K, the exponent is 18.08, leading to an even larger R.

Wait, that can't be right because 18>16, so exp(18) is bigger than exp(16).

So R increases as T decreases.

Wait, but that would mean that when the star has spots (lower T), R is higher.

But the problem says that when the star has spots, R decreases.

This is contradictory.

I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me re-express.

R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) decreases. So R decreases as T increases.

Wait, that's different. So higher T leads to lower R.

Thus, without spots (T=6000 K), R is lower than when the star has spots (T=5500 K).

But the problem says that when the star has spots, R decreases. So when without spots, R is higher than when the star has spots. So this contradicts.

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to summarize:

The problem states that when the star has spots, R (n1/n2) decreases.

So R_with = R_spot < R_without.

Thus, R_without / R_with >1.

But according to the calculation, R_without is 0.221 R_with, which implies R_without < R_with, which contradicts.

So perhaps the mistake is that the energy difference should be negative.

Wait, perhaps I should take ΔE = E1 - E2, which would be negative.

If ΔE is negative, then ΔE/(k T) is negative, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) would be exp(-|ΔE|/(k T)).

So R would be (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)).

But if ΔE is negative, then the exponent is negative, so R is (g1/g2) multiplied by a small number.

Thus, when T increases, |ΔE/(k T)| decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so R increases.

So with that, perhaps the correct approach is:

ΔE = E1 - E2 = -8.56 eV.

Then R = (g1/g2) exp( -8.56/(k T) )

At higher T, the exponent is less negative, so R is larger.

So when T increases, R increases.

Thus, R_without (T=6000) is larger than R_with (T=5500).

So the factor is R_without/R_with = exp( ( -8.56/(k T1) ) ) / exp( -8.56/(k T2) ) ) = exp( 8.56/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is exp( (8.56 eV)/(8.617e-5 eV/K) * (1/6000 -1/5500 ) )

Wait, no. Wait, 1/T2 is 1/5500.

So 1/T2 - 1/T1 = (1/5500 -1/6000) = 500/(5500*6000) )= 500/(33e6) )= 1/(66e3) )= 1.515e-5.

So the exponent is (8.56 /8.617e-5 ) * 1.515e-5 ≈99320 *1.515e-5≈ 1.507.

So exp(1.507) ≈4.5.

Thus, R_without/R_with =4.5.

Which would be option C) ~4.5.

Ah, this makes sense. So the correct factor is approximately 4.5 times.

So the ratio R increases when the star does not have spots compared to when it does. Thus, the factor is 4.5.


To determine the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) changes when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, we analyze the problem using the Boltzmann equation in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE):

\[
\frac{n_2}{n_1} = \frac{g_2}{g_1} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

where \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \) are the populations of levels 1 and 2, \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are their statistical weights, \( \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

The ratio of interest is \( R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \), which is the inverse of \( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \):

\[
R = \frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

From the problem, the energy difference corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the photon energy relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1448 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) in eV/K is \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \). The effective temperatures are \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \) (no spots) and \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \) (spots).

The ratio \( R \) depends on temperature as:

\[
R \propto \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right)
\]

The factor by which \( R \) changes is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{R_{\text{without}}}{R_{\text{with}}} = \frac{\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT_1}\right)}{\exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{kT_2}\right)} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)\right)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.00016667 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{5500} \approx 0.00018182 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.00016667 - 0.00018182 = -0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

\[
\frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.56}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99320 \, \text{K}
\]

\[
\text{Exponent} = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right) = 99320 \times (-0.00001515) \approx -1.507
\]

\[
\text{Factor} = \exp(-1.507) \approx 0.221
\]

This result implies that \( R_{\text{without}} \) is approximately \( 0.221 \) times \( R_{\text{with}} \), meaning \( R \) decreases when the star has spots. However, the problem states that \( R \) decreases when the star has spots, which aligns with this result. The factor by which \( R \) changes is approximately \( 4.5 \), as this is the reciprocal of \( 0.221 \).

Thus, the factor by which the ratio changes is:
