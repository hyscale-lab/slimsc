Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it carefully. Hmm, two electrons in p orbitals, and we're considering their orbital angular momentum. The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, what do these numbers mean? Oh right, I remember that the first two numbers are the individual orbital angular momentum quantum numbers for each electron, l1 and l2. So both electrons are in p orbitals (since l=1 for p).

The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l and m. So here, l is 2 and m is -1. The question is about measuring the Lz components of each electron (L1z and L2z) and finding the probability that both have eigenvalues of -ħ.

Wait, each electron's angular momentum in the z-direction is L1z and L2z. For an electron in an p orbital, l=1, so the possible m values are -1, 0, +1. But here, the coupled state has l=2, m=-1. Oh, right, the total angular momentum is the sum of the individual angular momenta.

So the state is |1,1,2,-1>. I'm supposed to find the probability that when I measure L1z and L2z, both give -ħ. So I need to find the amplitude of the state where each electron has m1 = -1 and m2 = -1, because L1z |m= -1> = -ħ |m=-1>. So if both are in m=-1, then their measurements would be -ħ each.

Wait, but the state given is a coupled state. How do I expand that in terms of the individual states? I think I need to find the expansion of |l1,l2,l,m> into the product of |m1> and |m2> states. Because the coupled state is a combination of all possible m1 and m2 that add up to m.

So the coupled state |1,1,2,-1> must be a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. But the individual states are each with their own m values.

Wait, the state |l1, l2, l, m> is the eigenstate of the total angular momentum operators L² and Lz. Lz is L1z + L2z. So m = m1 + m2.

In this case, m is -1, so m1 + m2 = -1. But the problem asks for the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. So m1 = -1, m2 = -1. Then m_total = -2. But wait, in our case, the total m is -1, which is not equal to -2. So that combination is not allowed. Because the sum has to be -1. Hmm, so the sum of m1 and m2 must be -1.

Wait, but if I have m1=-1 and m2=-1, their sum is -2. But the total m in the state is -1. So that state wouldn't be present in the expansion. Because the expansion only includes terms where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the coefficient for the |m1=-1, m2=-1> state in the |1,1,2,-1> coupled state must be zero. So when you express |1,1,2,-1> as a sum over m1, m2 with coefficients, the term where m1=-1 and m2=-1 would have a coefficient of zero.

So the probability of both m1 and m2 being -1 is zero. So the probability is zero.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another approach: The coupled state is a combination of all possible (m1, m2) pairs where m1 + m2 = total m, which is -1 here.

So for each m1, m2 can be (-1 - m1), and that's the only possibility. So the possible states in the expansion are:

m1 = -1 → m2=0

m1=0 → m2=-1

m1=1 → m2=-2 → but wait, m2 can't be -2 because l2=1, so m2 can only be -1,0,1. So m2=-2 is not allowed. So the allowed m1 and m2 pairs are (-1,0), (0,-1). There's no term where both m1 and m2 are -1 because that would sum to -2.

Therefore, in the expansion of the coupled state |1,1,2,-1>, the only terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So when you take the inner product of the coupled state with |m1=-1, m2=-1>, it's zero. So the probability is zero.

So the answer should be D) 0.


To determine the joint probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$, we analyze the given coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1>$. Here, $l_1 = 1$ and $l_2 = 1$ represent the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers of the two electrons, while $l = 2$ and $m = -1$ are the total angular momentum quantum numbers of the system.

The total angular momentum operator $\mathbf{L}_z = L_{1z} + L_{2z}$ implies that the total $m$ value is the sum of the individual $m_1$ and $m_2$ values: $m = m_1 + m_2$. For the given state, $m = -1$, so $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. The problem asks for the probability of both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, which corresponds to $L_{1z} = -\hbar$ and $L_{2z} = -\hbar$.

However, if $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, their sum would be $m_1 + m_2 = -2$, which does not match the total $m = -1$ of the coupled state. This means that the term $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle$ is not part of the expansion of the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1\rangle$. Therefore, the coefficient of $|m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle$ in the coupled state is zero.

Since the coefficient is zero, the probability of measuring both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ is also zero.
