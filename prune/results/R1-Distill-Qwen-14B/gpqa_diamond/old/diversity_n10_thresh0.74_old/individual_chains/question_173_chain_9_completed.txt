Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that an electron is traveling at a speed v = 2e8 m/s along the x-direction, and the uncertainty in its position (Δx) is 0.1 nm. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. The options are A to D, all in the order of 10^-something joules.

Wait, I remember that the uncertainty principle relates the uncertainty in position (Δx) and momentum (Δp). The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh right, and since we're looking for minimum uncertainty, I guess we can take the equality case, so Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx).

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, because the minimum uncertainty is when the product equals ħ/2. So using that, we can find Δp, and then relate that to the uncertainty in energy.

Now, how does momentum relate to energy? Well, for a non-relativistic particle, the kinetic energy E = p²/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron. So if we have an uncertainty in momentum Δp, the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be something like E = (Δp)²/(2m). Or wait, is it more precise? Because the energy uncertainty comes from the uncertainty in momentum. Hmm.

Alternatively, the uncertainty in energy could be related to the change in kinetic energy when the momentum is uncertain. So perhaps I should calculate the kinetic energy using the momentum and then use that as the uncertainty.

Wait, maybe I should approach this in steps. First, find Δp, then find the corresponding kinetic energy, which would give me ΔE.

Let me get the constants straight. The mass of an electron m is about 9.11e-31 kg. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s, so ħ is h/(2π), which is approximately 1.055e-34 J·s.

Given Δx = 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters, or 1e-10 meters.

So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx) = (1.055e-34) / (2 * 1e-10) = (1.055e-34)/(2e-10) = approx 5.275e-25 kg·m/s.

Wait, wait, let me compute that again. 1.055e-34 divided by (2 * 1e-10) is 1.055e-34 / 2e-10 = 5.275e-25 kg m/s.

Now, the kinetic energy E is p²/(2m). So E = (Δp)^2 / (2m). Plugging in the numbers:

(5.275e-25)^2 = (5.275)^2 = about 27.8, so 27.8e-50. Divided by (2 * 9.11e-31) which is 18.22e-31.

So E = 27.8e-50 / 18.22e-31. Let me compute that.

27.8 / 18.22 is about 1.525, and 1e-50 / 1e-31 is 1e-19. So E ≈ 1.525e-19 J.

Wait, but the question is about the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. So this would be approximately 1.5e-19 J. Looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J, and B is ~1e-17. Hmm, 1.5e-19 is closer to 1e-19.

But wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the calculation. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, let me recalculate Δp more accurately. ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s (using more precise value). So Δp = ħ/(2Δx) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2 * 1e-10) = (1.0545718e-34)/(2e-10) = 5.272859e-25 kg m/s.

So Δp squared is (5.272859e-25)^2.

5.272859 squared is approximately 27.8 (since 5^2=25, 0.27^2=0.07, but exact? 5.272859^2 = let me compute: 5 *5 is 25, 2 *5 *0.272859=2.72859, and 0.272859^2≈0.0744. So 25 + 2.72859 +0.0744 ≈27.803. So 27.803e-50.

Wait, no, the exponent is (e-25)^2 is e-50.

Then E = (27.803e-50) / (2 * 9.10938356e-31).

2 *9.10938356e-31 is 1.8218767e-30.

So E = 27.803e-50 / 1.8218767e-30.

Let me compute 27.803 / 1.8218767 ≈ 15.25.

So 15.25e-20? Wait, wait, exponents: 1e-50 divided by 1e-30 is 1e-20, so 15.25e-20 = 1.525e-19 J.

So ΔE ≈ 1.5e-19 J, which is in the order of 1e-19 J. So option C is ~1e-19 J, and that's the closest.

Wait, but why is the energy in the order of 1e-19 J? Let me think about the electron's actual energy. An electron moving at 2e8 m/s is non-relativistic? Let me check. The speed of light is 3e8 m/s, so 2e8 is about 2/3 the speed of light. Hmm, so maybe relativistic effects are not negligible, but the question probably assumes non-relativistic because it's about the uncertainty principle.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic energy formula, but that's more complicated. But given the problem's options, it's probably intended to use the non-relativistic approach.

Wait a second, another point: the uncertainty principle gives the minimum uncertainty in momentum, which I used as Δp. But then, since the energy depends on p squared, the uncertainty in energy would be roughly (Δp)^2/(2m), which is what I did.

So the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be approximately 1.5e-19 J, which is closest to option C, which is ~1e-19 J. So the answer is option C.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron, we use the uncertainty principle and the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy. The uncertainty principle states:

\[
\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

For minimum uncertainty, we take the equality:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
\]

Given:
- \(\Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m}\),
- \(\hbar = 1.055 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\),

we calculate:

\[
\Delta p = \frac{1.055 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.275 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}.
\]

The kinetic energy of a non-relativistic particle is given by:

\[
E = \frac{p^2}{2m},
\]

where \(m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg}\). Substituting \(\Delta p\) into the formula for \(E\):

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m} = \frac{(5.275 \times 10^{-25})^2}{2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31}}.
\]

First, calculate \((\Delta p)^2\):

\[
(\Delta p)^2 = (5.275 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 27.8 \times 10^{-50}.
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
2m = 2 \times 9.11 \times 10^{-31} = 1.822 \times 10^{-30}.
\]

Now divide:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{27.8 \times 10^{-50}}{1.822 \times 10^{-30}} = 1.525 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

This value is approximately \(1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\), which is closest to option C, \(~10^{-19} \, \text{J}\). Therefore, the minimum uncertainty in energy is best represented by option C.
