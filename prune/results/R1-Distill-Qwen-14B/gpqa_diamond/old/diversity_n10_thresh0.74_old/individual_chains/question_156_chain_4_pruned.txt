Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says a chemist does two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both reactions involve treating with mCPBA followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: one standard (achiral) and one chiral. I need to determine how many peaks each would show.

Hmm. I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially in epoxidation of alkenes. So the first thing that comes to mind is that these reactions are epoxidations.

Wait, but what about the stereochemistry? Oh right, mCPBA is a peracid and adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The addition is stereospecific. For alkenes, the reaction typically leads to the formation of an epoxide where the oxygen adds to the same face, but wait, no, wait. Epoxidation with peracids goes through a cyclic transition state where the oxygen adds across the double bond in a way that the stereochemistry is retained. So the geometry (E or Z) of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, but I think that mCPBA epoxidizes the double bond, and the reaction is stereospecific. So for each starting alkene, (E) and (Z), the epoxide formed will have a certain stereochemistry.

Wait, let me think. The double bond in (E)-oct-4-ene is trans, and (Z) is cis. When mCPBA adds to the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The reaction is a peracid addition, which is a concerted process. So the configuration of the double bond will influence the configuration of the epoxide.

Wait, no, after epoxidation, the epoxide's stereochemistry depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For example, if the alkene is trans (E), the epoxide will have the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides? Or same? Maybe not, because the addition is across the double bond, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should think about it like this: when a peracid adds to a double bond, the epoxide forms with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because in the transition state, the peracid's oxygen attacks the same face of the double bond, so the two new bonds form on opposite sides? Or same?

I think I'm getting confused. Let me recall: when an alkene reacts with a peracid, the epoxide formation leads to a trans configuration. No, wait. No, the epoxide has the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene because the peracid adds across the double bond in a way that the two new bonds form on opposite faces? Or same?

Wait, maybe it's better to think of examples. Take cyclohexene: when reacted with mCPBA, it forms cis-dihydroxylation, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds an epoxide, not dihydroxylation. Oh, right, dihydroxylation is with something like OsO4, which gives a vicinal diol with syn addition. Epoxidation with mCPBA gives an epoxide where the oxygen bridges the two carbons, and the configuration depends on the alkene's geometry.

Wait, so if the starting alkene is (E), then the epoxide will have a certain stereochemistry. Let me think: for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite. When the epoxide forms, the oxygen will bridge the two carbons,
