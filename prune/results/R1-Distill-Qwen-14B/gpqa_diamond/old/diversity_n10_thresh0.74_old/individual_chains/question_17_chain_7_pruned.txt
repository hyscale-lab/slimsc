Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. And the K for that complex is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting the EDTA. Temperature is 25°C, but I think that's just to remind us it's standard conditions, so maybe the K is given at that temperature.

Wait, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The K here must be the formation constant, which tells us how stable the complex is. So the higher the K, the more the complex forms.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because the Ca-EDTA is a complex, it dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4- ions. But the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, so initially, I might think that the concentration of EDTA and Ca²+ would be 0.02 M each. But wait, that's only true if the complex doesn't dissociate at all, which obviously it does, but with a very high K, the complex is very stable. So the dissociation is minimal, meaning that the free calcium ion concentration is very low.

So, the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²- , with the formation constant K = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Given that, we can model the situation. Let's let the concentration of the complex be 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of free Ca²+ ions that dissociate from the complex. Then, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x, because each complex releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, no, wait. The initial concentrations: the complex is 0.02 M. So when it dissociates, each mole gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA^4-. So if the complex dissociates by x, then [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x. But wait, that's only if the EDTA is coming solely from the dissociation of the complex. But wait, in reality, EDTA might already be in solution. But the problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex, implying that the EDTA and calcium are coming from that complex. So I think the initial EDTA is zero, but wait, no, the solution is 0.02 M of the complex, so the total EDTA in solution is the same as the complex concentration.

Wait, no. No, the EDTA is part of the complex. So the total EDTA in solution is the sum of the complex and the free EDTA. Wait, but let me think again.

The problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration is 0.02 M of CaEDTA²-.

So when it dissociates, the concentration of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be x each, and the concentration of the
