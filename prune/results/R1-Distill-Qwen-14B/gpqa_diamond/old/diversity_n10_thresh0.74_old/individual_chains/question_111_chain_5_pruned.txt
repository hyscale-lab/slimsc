Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here with two reactions, and I need to figure out the major products. Let's take it step by step.

The first reaction is between 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. The second reaction is 1-nitropropane reacting with KOH, (E)-but-2-enenitrile, and water. I'm a bit rusty on some of these mechanisms, but let's break them down.

Starting with the first reaction. The starting material is a ketone: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. That structure has a cyclohexane ring with substituents. The carbonyl is at position 1, so the numbering is 1-one. So the ring has substituents at positions 2, 6, and also because it's 2-ethyl, that's a branch there.

t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base. In such conditions, I think about elimination or perhaps some kind of conjugate addition, but wait, ethyl acrylate is an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. Oh, maybe it's a Michael addition? Or perhaps it's a conjugate addition to the ketone.

Wait, the starting ketone is cyclic, and the carbonyl is at position 1. So, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen or some kind of aldol addition. But ethyl acrylate is an enolate acceptor, I think. Alternatively, the base might deprotonate the ketone to form an enolate, which then attacks the ethyl acrylate.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a conjugate addition (Michael addition) where the enolate attacks the alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So the ketone forms an enolate, which then adds to the acrylate.

Let me think about the structure. The ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So, it's a six-membered ring with substituents at 2 (ethyl and methyl?), wait no. Let me draw this mentally. The numbering for cyclohexanone is
