Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. The setup is for a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis, and the field has a small m (orbital magnetic quantum number) with B=1 Tesla. They're asking about the order of magnitude between the expectation value of the Hamiltonian (which I think relates to the paramagnetic coupling) and the energy difference Delta E, which comes from a wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers.

Hmm. I remember that 0.4861 micrometers is the wavelength for the Balmer-alpha transition in hydrogen, which is the transition from n=2 to n=1, emitting a photon in the visible spectrum. So the energy Delta E here is the energy difference between the n=2 and n=1 levels of hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Balmer series is transitions to n=2. So Balmer-alpha is from n=3 to n=2, but wait, maybe I'm getting that mixed up. Or maybe I should just calculate the energy using the wavelength given.

Right, let's calculate Delta E first. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc / lambda. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and lambda is the wavelength. But wait, what units are we using? Let me make sure everything is in appropriate units.

Planck's constant h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s. The speed of light c is approximately 2.99792458e8 m/s. The wavelength lambda is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

So plugging in the values:

E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) 

Let me compute that. Let's see, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = about 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then dividing by 0.4861e-6 m gives 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 ≈ 4.087e-19 J.

Wait, but wait a second, I might have made a miscalculation. Let me do it more carefully.

Actually, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9
