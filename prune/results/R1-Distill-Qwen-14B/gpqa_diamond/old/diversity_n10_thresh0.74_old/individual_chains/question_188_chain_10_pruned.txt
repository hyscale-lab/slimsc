Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through. The question is about calculating the interplanar distance for a rhombohedral crystal's (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance, d, in crystals is related to the lattice parameters and the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals... Right, a rhombohedral system is a type of hexagonal crystal system, but wait no, wait. No, actually, rhombohedral is one of the seven crystal systems. Oh right, it's a special case where all the edges are equal, but the angles between them are not necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. So it's a primitive rhombohedral lattice, I think.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 Angstrom. Wait, interatomic distance in a rhombohedral system... Wait, in a cubic system, the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter a, because each atom is at the corner. But in rhombohedral, the lattice parameter is a, and the interatomic distance might be different? Or wait, wait. Maybe in a primitive rhombohedral structure, the atoms are at the corners of a cube but with a rhombohedral arrangement. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the interatomic distance is the same as the lattice parameter
