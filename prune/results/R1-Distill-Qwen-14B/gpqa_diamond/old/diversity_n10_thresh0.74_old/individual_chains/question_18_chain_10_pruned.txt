Okay, so I've got this problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass matters here. The problem gives some abundance ratios using the EW method. I remember that [X/Y] notation in astronomy represents the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of elements X and Y relative to the Sun. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X/n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

The given data points are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. So, Star_1 has a higher abundance of Si relative to Fe compared to the Sun.
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex. Star_2 has a higher Mg relative to Si than the Sun.
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex. So, Star_1's Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Star_2's Mg abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun.

The photospheric composition of the Sun is given as:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. Therefore, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.
- Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log10(nMg/nH)=7. So log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5. Then nMg/nH=1e-5.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up some notations here. The notation 12 + log(nX/nH) equals a certain value. So, nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) because 7.5 -12 is -4.5. Right.

Wait, another way: The solar values are given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 =-4.5. So nFe/nH =10^-4.5 ≈3.16e-5. Similarly, nMg/nH=10^(-5) =1e-5 for the Sun.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, the ratio n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Hmm. So I need to find n_Si1 and n_Si2 in each star, then take the ratio.

Let me think about each star separately.

Starting with Star_1.

Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So, Fe/H is same as Sun. H in the photosphere is the same as H in the Sun? Or is H varying? Wait, in stellar atmospheres, H is often assumed to be the dominant element, but perhaps in the problem,
