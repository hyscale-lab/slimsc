Okay, let's try to tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I've got to find the eigenvector of a certain operator for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. Wait, this has to do with spin, right? Because the operator P looks like the Pauli matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So the operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is given by a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down.

P_x is (ħ/2) times [[0, 1], [1, 0]].
P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]].

The operator in question is vector P, so the operator along direction n (in x-z plane) would be the sum of each component multiplied by their respective direction cosines. Since n lies in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented by angles where the y-component is zero. Let's say the direction makes an angle θ with the z-axis, so the direction cosines would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Or wait, actually, direction in x-z plane can be represented by an angle φ from the x-axis. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the axes. Let me think again.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the spin operator along an arbitrary direction is S = (Sx * nx + Sy * ny + Sz * nz), where n is a unit vector. Similarly, our operator P is a spin-1/2 operator, so it's a vector operator with components Px, Py, Pz.

So the operator along direction n is P·n, which would be (n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, no, wait. The direction is arbitrary in x-z plane, so n can be represented as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ). Wait, no, that's spherical coordinates. Wait, perhaps I should parameterize the direction n in the x-z plane. Let's say n is in the x-z plane,
