Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about operators and uncertainties. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on quantum mechanics, but let's see what I can remember.

Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. The uncertainty is ΔP_z, which I know relates to the variance of the operator in the given state.

First, I need to recall how uncertainty is calculated. Oh right, the formula for the uncertainty of an operator Q in a state |ψ⟩ is the square root of the expectation of Q squared minus the square of the expectation of Q. So ΔQ = sqrt(⟨Q²⟩ - ⟨Q⟩²).

In this case, Q is P_z. So I need to compute ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ in the given state.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me write that out:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; (1/sqrt(2)); -1/2 ]

Wait, but the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. That might make some things easier because acting P_z on |ψ⟩ would just scale each component by the corresponding eigenvalue.

Looking at the P_z matrix:
P_z has first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), third row (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues of P_z are ħ, 0, and -ħ, corresponding to the diagonal matrix.

So the basis states are |e1⟩ = [1; 0; 0], |e2⟩ = [0;1;0], |e3⟩ = [0;0;1], but wait, no, because in the standard basis, the position of the 1's would correspond to the eigenvalues. So |e1⟩ has eigenvalue ħ, |e3⟩ has eigenvalue -ħ, and |e2⟩ has eigenvalue 0.

Wait, the given state is |ψ⟩ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ].

So, in the basis of P_z's eigenstates, which are |e1⟩, |e2⟩, |e3⟩.

So the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates. Because each basis vector is an eigenstate of P_z, when we compute expectation values, it should be straightforward.

Wait, but the state isn't normalized yet, is it? Let me check.

The norm squared is (-1/2)^2 + (1/sqrt(2))^2 + (-1/2)^2. That's (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = 1/4 + 2/4 + 1/4 = 4/4 = 1. Oh, okay, so it's
