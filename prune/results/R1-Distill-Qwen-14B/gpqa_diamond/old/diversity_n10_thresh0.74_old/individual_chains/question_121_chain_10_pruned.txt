Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about reacting a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, specifically Me2CuLi. I remember that organocuprates are strong nucleophiles and are used in nucleophilic ring-opening reactions of epoxides. 

The starting material is (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize this structure. A bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane system means there are two rings: a four-membered ring and a one-membered bridge? Wait, no, maybe it's a fused ring system. The numbering is a bit tricky. Let me try to sketch it.

I think bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane would have a structure where there are two rings: a five-membered ring (from the 4 and 1 parts) fused to another. Wait, perhaps it's a norbornane-like structure? Norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, so this must be a different bicyclic system. Let's see, the substituents are at carbons 1,3,4, and 6 (the 7-oxa means an oxygen at position 7, which is part of the epoxide ring).

So the structure is a bicyclic molecule with an epoxide ring. The substituents are all R configurations except 6S. Hmm, but the exact structure might be a bit hard to visualize without the actual drawing. Maybe I can think of it as a bridged bicyclic epoxide with substituents at 1,3,4, and 6.

The reaction is with Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile. Organocuprates typically open epoxides in a ring-opening reaction. I remember that in such reactions, the nucleophile attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Also, when the epoxide is disubstituted, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile attacks.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the alkyl group is introduced at the less hindered carbon. So the nucleophile (Me-) will add to the less hindered carbon, and the other oxygen will open with the leaving group, but in this case, the epoxide oxygen would become an alcohol after the ring opens.

Wait, no, in the ring-opening, the oxygen would end up with a negative charge, which then gets protonated. So the mechanism is that the
