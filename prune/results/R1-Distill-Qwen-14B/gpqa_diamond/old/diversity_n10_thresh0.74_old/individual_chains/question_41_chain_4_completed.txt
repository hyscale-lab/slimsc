Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that a light beam is moving through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the laboratory. The question is asking for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1, so I can use that.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the speed of light in different media, the index of refraction comes into play. The speed of light in a medium is v_medium = c/n. But wait, that's in the rest frame of the medium. But here the medium itself is moving, so I think I need to consider relativistic effects because the medium's motion might affect the observed speed of light.

Wait, no. I'm confusing things. The speed of light in a medium is always less than c when it's not a vacuum, but when the medium is moving, how does that affect the speed as measured by someone in the lab?

Oh wait, but in the lab frame, the glass is moving. So the light's speed in the glass is v = c/n, but then the glass is moving towards the observer. So do I need to apply a velocity addition formula here?

Wait, velocity addition in relativity is for objects moving at significant fractions of c. But in this case, the problem gives the speed of light as 1 (so c=1) and the glass is moving at v. So if v is much smaller than c, maybe I can approximate using non-relativistic velocity addition. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to just consider the speed of light in the medium without considering the movement of the medium because light speed in a medium is already adjusted by the index of refraction.

Wait, but the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. So the glass is moving, so the light's speed in the lab frame would be the speed of light in the glass plus the speed of the glass? But wait, that's only valid if the speeds are low (non-relativistic), using Galilean addition. But in relativity, it's different.

Wait, but if the glass is moving at velocity v, the light's velocity in the lab frame would be different. Let me think. Normally, when you have a medium moving at velocity v, and light is moving at u in the medium's frame, then the lab frame would see it as u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c²). But wait, u is the speed of light in the medium, which is c/n. So u = 1/n, since c=1.

So substituting, u' = (1/n + v) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

Wait, but wait a second. Because the direction is important here. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the medium's rest frame, the light is moving at u = c/n (which is 1/n) in the same direction as the glass's motion.

So when you switch to the lab frame, where the medium is moving at velocity v towards the observer, you need to add velocities relativistically. So using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Since c=1, this becomes u' = (u + v)/(1 + u v )

But wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the medium's velocity. So in the medium's frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n. So plugging in:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

But wait, the question is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab. Hmm, wait, no. The question is phrased: "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory?"

Wait, that's a bit ambiguous. The speed of light in the glass, which is 1/n, is in the glass's rest frame. But the lab is moving relative to the glass. So the observed speed in the lab frame would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the speed of the light as measured in the lab, which would involve the glass's motion.

So applying the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Given that u is the speed of light in the glass in the medium's frame, which is 1/n, and v is the speed of the medium relative to the lab. But wait, the direction matters. If the medium (glass) is moving towards the observer in the lab, and the light is moving in the same direction as the medium, then in the medium's frame, the light is moving at u = 1/n in the direction of the medium's motion.

So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n)*v )

But wait, let me think again. Wait, if the medium is moving towards the observer, then from the lab's perspective, the light might be moving towards the observer faster because the medium is bringing the light towards the observer.

Wait, but if the light is already moving in the same direction as the medium's movement, then the light's speed in the lab frame would be higher than the medium's speed. Because the light, which is moving with the medium, plus the medium's velocity. But in relativity, we can't just add velocities linearly.

So using the formula:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v)

Since c=1, and u is 1/n.

So substituting:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

But looking at the options, I don't see this exact expression.

Wait the options are:

A) (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Wait, if I take the expression I have and multiply numerator and denominator by n, I get:

Numerator: (1 +n v )

Denominator: (n + v )

So u' = (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Which is option A.

Alternatively, did I make a mistake in the direction? Let me think again.

Wait, the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion towards the observer. So in the medium's frame, light is moving at u = 1/n, and the medium's frame is moving at speed v towards the observer. So when you switch to the lab frame, which is moving at -v relative to the medium (since the medium is moving at v towards the lab).

Wait, no, perhaps I should think of the medium moving at velocity v in the lab frame, and the light moving at u in the medium's frame. So to find u' in the lab frame, we use the velocity addition.

Wait, when the medium is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving at u in the same direction, then in the lab frame, it's u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v )

So yes, u is 1/n, so:

u' = (1/n + v )/(1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n:

(1 + n v)/(n + v )

Which is option A.

So the correct answer is A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we start by noting that the speed of light in a medium is given by \( v_{\text{medium}} = \frac{c}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction. Since \( c = 1 \), the speed of light in the glass is \( \frac{1}{n} \) in the rest frame of the glass.

However, the glass itself is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer. To find the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory, we must account for the relative motion of the medium and the light. This requires using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( u \) is the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass's rest frame, which is \( \frac{1}{n} \).
- \( v \) is the speed of the glass relative to the laboratory.
- \( c = 1 \), so \( \frac{u v}{c^2} = u v \).

Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) into the formula:

\[
u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{1}{n} v}
\]

To simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \):

\[
u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The other options do not align with the relativistic velocity addition formula or the given conditions.

**Answer: A**
