Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a given potential. The potential is V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Hmm, okay.

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, sometimes you can separate the potential into radial and angular parts. Let me think. Oh right, in polar coordinates, the potential can be expressed in terms of r and θ. So here, V(r,θ) looks like it's a sum of two terms: one depends only on r, and the other depends on r and θ.

The first term is (1/2) k r². That looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in the radial direction. And the second term is (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Hmm, so maybe this can be rewritten in terms of angular components. Oh, because cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Let me think: cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the second term becomes (3/2) k r² * (1 + cos2θ)/2. Oh wait, that's (3k r² /4) (1 + cos2θ).

Wait, but wait, maybe I should think about how the potential affects the Hamiltonian. The Hamiltonian is H = (p²)/(2m) + V(r,θ). So the potential is V(r) + another term that depends on θ. Wait, but perhaps I can factor this into something.

Alternatively, maybe the potential can be written as a sum of terms in terms of angular momentum. Because cos(θ) relates to the x component in polar coordinates, but since we have cos²θ, maybe it's better to think in terms of components of angular momentum or other angular operators.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the potential can be expressed as V(r) = (1/2) k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Because (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r^2 cos²θ equals (1/2)k r^2 (1 + 3 cos²θ). So that's V(r) = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Hmm.

But then, the potential depends on θ as well as r. How does that affect the Hamiltonian? Well,
