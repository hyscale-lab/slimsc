Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. So, I think the key here is to determine what the starting materials A and B must be for each reaction.

Wait, no, actually, the way the question is phrased is a bit different. It says that when A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it gives (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. And when B is treated with BH3 and H+, it gives (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So, A and B are each being converted into a specific stereoisomer of the same product.

Hmm, I remember that BH3 and LiBH4 are both reducing agents, but they might have different mechanisms. I think BH3 is typically used for the reduction of carbonyl groups, but wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent. Oh wait, no, BH3 is a milder reagent, right? Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce esters and amides, while BH3 is used for the reduction of ketones to produce alcohols without going further. Or is that another reagent?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, BH3 is used in the hydroboration-oxidation reaction, which is a way to reduce alkenes to alcohols with anti-Markovnikov addition. But in this case, the problem is about reducing carbonyl groups. Oh wait, no, in the given reactions, the products are ketones. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they're reducing a carbonyl, the product would be an alcohol. But the product here is a tetrahydro pyranone, which looks like a cyclic ketone.
