Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a series of reactions leading to a final product, and then determining the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in that product. 

Let me start by reading the problem carefully. 

The first reaction involves combining 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1.

Hmm, okay. So I think this is a Diels-Alder reaction. Because the diene and dienophile are reacting. Let's look at the starting materials. 

7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene is the diene. It's a bicyclic compound, so it's a norbornene derivative. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group on position 7. 

The other reagent is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. Wait, that's a cyclohexadiene with two substituents at positions 5 and 6. Each substituent is a dibromomethyl group. So each is CH2Br2? Or maybe each is CH2Br attached another Br? Wait, the structure is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl), so each substituent is a methyl group with two bromines. So each is CH2Br2? Wait: dibromomethyl would be CH2Br2. So the cyclohexadiene has two CH2Br2 groups at positions 5 and 6.

But wait, when I think about the Diels-Alder reaction, I need a diene and a dienophile. The dienophile is usually something electron-deficient. The diene here is the norbornene compound. So the dienophile must be the cyclohexa-1,3-diene with the substituents. But wait, the cyclohexadiene is conjugated, so it's a conjugated diene, which can act as a diene. Or maybe it's acting as a dienophile? Hmm.

Wait, sodium iodide is present
