Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate into two particles each of charge + and -. Interesting.

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass of A is given as 300 MeV. We need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, but wait. First, I should probably recall what I know about annihilation processes. When particles annihilate, their rest mass energy is converted into other forms of energy, like kinetic energy or maybe creating other particles. Since the initial particles are a proton and antiproton, their rest masses are involved.

Wait, protons have a rest mass of about 938 MeV/c² each, right? So the proton and antiproton together have about 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV of rest energy. But the products are four particles, each of mass 300 MeV. So each A has 300 MeV. So total rest energy for the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. Wait, that's less than 1876. So wait, that can't be right. Because in annihilation, the energy should be conserved. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's not that the entire mass is converted. Because the initial particles are moving. The antiproton is moving slowly, but the proton is probably at rest? Or are they both moving? The question says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the proton is at rest. Hmm, but that's an assumption, but perhaps it's a valid one.

Wait, but in particle physics, when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they typically produce other particles. The key here is conservation of energy and momentum. So let's model this.

Let me think. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let's say the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with some velocity. Since it's moving slowly, perhaps its
