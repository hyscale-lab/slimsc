Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again carefully.

The question says that an unknown compound was prepared, and they used FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry to characterize it. The FTIR shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. That's a big clue. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H groups because they're hydrogen bonds. So, maybe the compound has a hydroxyl group or something similar.

Then there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, those are in the range of carbonyl groups. The 1700 might be a ketone or an aldehyde, but wait, maybe more likely an ester or a carboxylic acid? Wait, but a carboxylic acid would have a broad O-H peak as well, but maybe that's what's happening here. The 1650 peak could be another carbonyl group or maybe an aromatic ring with conjugation, like in an aromatic ester or something. Or perhaps it's an amide? No, not likely because the options don't have N in the formula.

The 1H NMR shows peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl H's are the ones on a double bond, like CH₂=CH. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe an alkene or part of a ring. Wait, but if it's a carbonyl, maybe it's an ester with a double bond elsewhere.

The mass spectrum has a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, let's think about what fragments could give that. 45 is a common mass for a (CH₃CO) group, like from an acetyl fragment. Alternatively, maybe it's from a ketone or ester breaking off.

Now, the options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Let me think about their degrees of unsaturation to see what's possible.

Degrees of unsaturation formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no X or N here.

For each option:

A) C6H12O2: C=6
