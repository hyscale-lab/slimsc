Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of 0.5 |↑⟩ plus sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. The task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx. And the options are given as A to D.

Hmm, I remember that expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute this for the given operator, which is a combination of σz and σx.

First, let me recall what the Pauli matrices look like. The σz matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], and σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Oh wait, right, and each of these matrices has eigenstates |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩, σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. For σx, I think its eigenstates are different because σx is the spin in the x-direction. But in this problem, the states are given as eigenstates of σz, so |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are along z.

Wait, so the given state is a linear combination of these. The state ψ is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me double-check the normalization. The coefficients squared should add up to 1. So (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4)=0.75. Sum is 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So that's good, it's normalized.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is ⟨10σz +5σx⟩. I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩ because expectation values are linear.

So I need to find ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately.

Let's start with σz. Since the state is a linear combination of σz eigenstates, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward. The expectation value is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

The state ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2=0.25, and of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So 10⟨σz⟩ = 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. How do I compute that? I recall that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, which are the standard basis vectors, σx flips the spin.

Wait, but the expectation value of σx in a state that's a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ can be found using the formula: ⟨σx⟩ = 2 * Re[⟨↑|ψ⟩⟨ψ|↓⟩] or something like that. Alternatively, using matrix representation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨σx⟩ using the state ψ.

The operator σx has matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, ψ is a
