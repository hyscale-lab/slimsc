Alright, so I have this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, pseudospheres are related to hyperbolic geometry, right? I remember that in general relativity, a pseudosphere can be described by a specific type of metric, but I'm not exactly sure how that ties into the area calculation.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, let me parse that. So the line element depends on x and y, and the denominator is 4 minus the sum of x squared and y squared. That denominator looks similar to the equation of a circle. Oh, right, 4 = x² + y² is a circle of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the metric seems to have a singularity when x² + y² approaches 4 because the denominator would approach zero, making ds² blow up. Interesting.

Now, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2. Pseudospheres in 2D are like surfaces of constant negative curvature. The standard metric for a pseudosphere (or hyperbolic space) in 2D is usually written in terms of Poincaré coordinates or something similar. But this metric might be in a different coordinate system.

Wait, what's the area of a pseudosphere in 2D? I think the area for a hyperbolic plane can be a bit tricky. But for finite cases, like a pseudosphere of radius r, maybe it's analogous to the area of a sphere. For a sphere of radius r in 3D,
