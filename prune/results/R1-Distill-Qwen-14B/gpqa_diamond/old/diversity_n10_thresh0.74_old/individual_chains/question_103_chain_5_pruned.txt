Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. The question is about the synthesis of 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options involve several reaction steps, and I need to figure out the correct sequence.

First, let me try to understand the target molecule. The name is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, that's a ketone where the carbonyl group is attached to the benzene ring. The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine at the 3-position and a nitro group at the 5-position. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so numbering the substituents... Let me visualize it. If the carbonyl is at position 1 (assuming the ketone is directly attached), then the substituents are at positions 3 and 5. So, the ring looks like it has the ketone at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5. Alternatively, maybe the positions are meta to each other? Let me think: the ketone is on the benzene ring, so it's a phenyl ketone. For substitution patterns, the substituents (bromo and nitro) are at the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone. So, that's a 1,3,5 substitution pattern? Wait, benzene is symmetric, so maybe the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, no, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 in the benzene ring, so the ketone is at position 1. So that would make the bromo group at position 3 and nitro at position 5, making them meta to each other relative to the ketone.

Now, the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene, what reactions can introduce these substituents?

I remember that nitration, bromination, acetylation (like using CH3COCl with AlCl3 as catalyst) are common steps. Also, sometimes you need to introduce a directing group.

Wait, the target has a ketone group (ethan-1-one) attached to the benzene. How is that introduced? Acetylation, perhaps. Using like an acetyl chloride with AlCl3
