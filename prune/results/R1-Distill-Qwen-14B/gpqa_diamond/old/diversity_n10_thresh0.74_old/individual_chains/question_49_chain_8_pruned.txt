Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the migration of a sigma bond along with a pi bond, which is a type of pericyclic reaction. These reactions are usually thermodynamically controlled, meaning they form the more stable product. 

The problem has three separate reactions, each requiring me to determine the product. I need to match each product (A, B, C) with the options given.

Let me tackle each part one by one.

First, reaction A: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol in the presence of H+ and heat. Hmm, I think this is related to the Claisen or Cope rearrangement, but wait, the starting material might be different. Let me think. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine... Oh, wait, that's N,N-dimethoxyethylamine. When heated, it might undergo some rearrangement. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of the Huisgen cycloaddition? No, that's for alkynes.

Wait, another thought: the presence of H+ suggests an acid-catalyzed reaction. So, perhaps it's forming an iminium ion or some sort of conjugate acid. Then, considering the structure, but-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. Oh wait, wait a second. I remember that when a dienamine is formed, it can undergo a sigmatropic shift. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Claisen-like rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine can be written as (CH3O)2NCH2CH3. Hmm, but when it reacts with but-3-en-2-ol (which is CH2CH2CHOHCH2?), wait no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2CH2-OH-CH2? Wait, correction: but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, but but has four
