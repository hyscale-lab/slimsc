Okay, so I have this NMR problem in front of me. Let me try to think it through step by step. Hmm, the question is about identifying two aromatic compounds in a mixture based on their NMR spectra.

The molecular formula is C10H14. Wait, that's a total of 10 carbons and 14 hydrogens. Both compounds are aromatic, so they must each have a benzene ring. Let me check the formula again. Benzene is C6H6. So each compound has four substituents on the benzene ring because 6 carbons in benzene plus four substituents (each methyl is one carbon) would make 10. Oh wait, wait. Alternatively, if some substituents are ethyl groups, that would add more carbons. Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let's see: benzene is 6 carbons. So the substituents would be 4 carbons. So each compound must have four substituents on the benzene ring that account for the remaining 4 carbons. 

Each substituent is a methyl group (each is a CH3). Because four substituents would add 4 carbons. So each compound is a tetramethylbenzene. Because C6H6 plus four methyl groups would be C10H14. Because each methyl adds a CH2: wait, no. Wait, no, each methyl is CH3. So benzene (C6H6) plus four methyl groups (each -CH3) would give C
