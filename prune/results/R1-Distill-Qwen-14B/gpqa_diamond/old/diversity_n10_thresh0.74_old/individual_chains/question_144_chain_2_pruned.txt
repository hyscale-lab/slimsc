Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a meson resonance and its mean decay distance. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're usually made up of a quark and an antiquark. But I'm not totally sure about the specifics here.

The question gives me some parameters: the production energy E_X is 8 GeV, the mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 10^-15 or 10^-16 meters, so it's a very small distance.

Wait, mean decay distance... I think that has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Because a particle can't travel far if it decays quickly, right? So the formula for the mean decay distance, I think, is c multiplied by the lifetime (τ) multiplied by the velocity (βc), where β is v/c.

But wait, lifetime τ is related to the particle's width Γ through the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The uncertainty principle says that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. So the lifetime τ is approximately ħ divided by the width Γ. Or wait, is it ħ divided by (Γ/2) because the width is the uncertainty in energy? Let me think. The natural line width is Γ, so the uncertainty in energy ΔE is Γ/2. Therefore, the uncertainty in time Δt, which is the lifetime τ, should be ħ / (ΔE) = ħ * 2 / Γ. Or maybe it's ħ divided by Γ directly? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime τ is the inverse of the total decay width Γ divided by ħ. Wait, no, I think the relation is τ = ħ / Γ. Because when Γ is the decay width, which is the total rate, then Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Yeah, that sounds right.

But wait, I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The decay width Γ is related to the particle's lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. So that's the formula I'll go with.

But wait, there's another thing. The production energy E_X is 8 GeV, and the mass is 1.2 GeV. So the particle is produced with energy higher than its rest mass. So it's moving, right? So its velocity is significant.

I think I need to calculate the velocity of the meson. Because the mean decay distance is the product of the speed, the lifetime, and the speed of light. Wait, no, the speed is a fraction of c, so I think the formula is β c τ, where β is v/c. So the mean decay length L = β c τ.

So putting it together, L = β c (ħ / Γ).

But wait, I also need to find β, the velocity of the meson. Since the meson is produced with energy E_X =8
