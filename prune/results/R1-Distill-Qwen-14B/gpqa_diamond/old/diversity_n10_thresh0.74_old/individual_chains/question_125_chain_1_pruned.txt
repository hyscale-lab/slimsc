Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says we have a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². That's a harmonic oscillator potential, right? And the question is about the energy of the third excited state and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions exist for that energy eigenvalue.

Hmm. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the energy levels of a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator are quantized. The energy depends on the quantum numbers n_x, n_y, and n_z for each direction. But wait, in three dimensions, the potential is symmetric, so perhaps it's better to think in terms of the radial parts, using the quantum numbers related to the angular momentum and the principal quantum number.

Wait, no. Wait, the 3D harmonic oscillator can be considered as three independent 1D oscillators in each of the x, y, and z directions. So the total energy would be the sum of the energies in each direction. The energy for each 1D oscillator is (n + 1/2) ħω, where n is the quantum number for that direction (n=0,1,2,...). So the total energy would be (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω.

Alternatively, I think the energy levels can also be expressed in terms of the total number of quanta, often denoted by N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So the energy would be (N + 3/2) ħω.

Right, I remember that. So the ground state is when N=0, which gives energy (3/2) ħω. The first excited state would be N=1, energy (
