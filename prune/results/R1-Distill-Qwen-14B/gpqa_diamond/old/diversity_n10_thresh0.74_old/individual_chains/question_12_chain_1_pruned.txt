Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Hmm, let's see. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Oh wait, Pi(+) is at rest, right? So the pion is not moving initially, which probably means that the products will have some kinetic energy based on the masses involved.

I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum of the products must be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But wait, neutrinos are super light, almost massless, right? I think the mass of a neutrino is considered negligible compared to the muon's mass. So maybe in this case, the neutrino's momentum is essentially the same as the muon's, but opposite in direction.

Wait, but how does that help me find the kinetic energy? I guess I should use conservation of energy. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass of the pion because it's at rest. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the rest energies of the muon and neutrino plus their kinetic energies. Oh right, because energy is conserved.

So let me jot down the known values. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutr
