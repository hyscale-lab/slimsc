Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh wait, I remember that this is a harmonic oscillator potential, right? Because Hooke's law is F = -kx, and the potential is (1/2)kx², so yeah, this is like a 3D version of that. So the system is a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm. Let's break it down. First, I think I need to find the energy levels. For a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are given by the formula E = ħω (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). Alternatively, sometimes the energy is written in terms of the total quantum number n, which is the sum of the three, but I think the individual quantum numbers are more useful here.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, another way to look at it is that in 3D, the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So the energy is E = ħω (n + 3/2), where n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Or wait, wait another way: sometimes the formula is given as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the principal quantum number, which is the sum of the three directions. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So the energy levels are quantized, and each state is determined by the triplet (n_x, n_y, n_z), each of which can be 0, 1, 2, etc. The energy depends on the sum of these three.

Now, what's the ground state? The ground state would be the lowest energy state, which is when all n_x, n_y, n_z are 0. So n = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. Then E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

The first excited state would be the next energy level. The next possible n after 0 is 1. So n=1. For n=1, the energy is (1 + 3/2) ħω = (5/2) ħω. How many ways can we get n=1? Well, the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So three possible states, but the question is about the number of eigenfunctions with the same energy. Wait, each state with the same n will have the same energy because E depends only on n. So each n corresponds to a particular energy level.

Wait, but each energy level is non-degenerate? No, no. Wait no, for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the degeneracy increases with higher n. Let me think about this. For each n, the number of states (the degeneracy) is (n + 1)(n + 2)/2, or maybe another formula. Wait, no, I think it's the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers. So the number of possible triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = n.

Which is a combinatorial problem. The formula for the number of non-negative integer solutions to a + b + c = n is (n + 2 choose 2), which is (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for each n, the degeneracy is (n+1)(n+2)/2. Wait, let me confirm: for n=0, it's (0+1)(0+2)/2)= (1*2)/2=1, which matches (0,0,0). For n=1, (2*3)/2=3, which we saw as 3 states. For n=2, (3*4)/2=6. So the degeneracy is that.

Now, the problem is about the third excited state. Wait, wait, the ground state is the first state (n=0). The first excited state is n=1, the second excited is n=2, the third excited is n=3. So n=3.

So the energy for n=3 would be E = (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So the first part of the answer is (9/2) ħω, which looks like options A and C.

Now, the second part is the number of eigenfunctions (i.e., the degeneracy) for the same energy. So for n=3, the degeneracy is (3+1)(3+2)/2 = (4)(5)/2 = 20/2=10. So there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy level.

Looking at the options: option A says (9/2) ħω, 10. Option C says (9/2) ħω, 3. So the correct degeneracy is 10, which points to option A.

Wait, wait, but wait. I thought the third excited state is n=3, but let me make sure. The ground state is n=0 (0th state), first excited is n=1, second is n=2, third is n=3. Yes, that's correct.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the degeneracy is 10. So the correct answer should be option A.

Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω and 10, which matches exactly.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ moving in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy levels for such a system are given by $E = \hbar \omega (n_x + n_y + n_z + \frac{3}{2})$, where $n_x, n_y, n_z$ are non-negative integers. The total quantum number is $n = n_x + n_y + n_z$, and the energy can also be expressed as $E = \hbar \omega (n + \frac{3}{2})$.

The degeneracy of each energy level, i.e., the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy, is determined by the number of ways to write $n$ as the sum of three non-negative integers $(n_x, n_y, n_z)$. This is given by the combinatorial formula $\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$.

The question asks for the energy and degeneracy of the third excited state. The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$, the first excited state to $n = 1$, the second excited state to $n = 2$, and the third excited state to $n = 3$. For $n = 3$, the energy is:

\[
E = \hbar \omega \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

The degeneracy for $n = 3$ is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3+1)(3+2)}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 5}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$, and there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to this energy level.

From the given options:
- Option A: $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$ is correct.
- Option C: $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 3$ is incorrect because the degeneracy is 10, not 3.

Answer: A
