Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about selecting the correct reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, with some reagent A, producing 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is between 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (in the presence of H2O), giving 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

Hmm, I remember that in organic reactions, nitriles can be formed from ketones via nucleophilic substitution. Let me think about the first reaction. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. NaCN is sodium cyanide, a good nucleophile. So, I think this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, but ketones typically undergo addition reactions. So NaCN would add to the carbonyl group. But wait, the product is a nitrile. Oh right, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, it forms a cyanohydrin. So the product would have an alcohol (from the cyanide's O-) and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon as the ketone's carbonyl. So butan-2-one becomes 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. That makes sense.

So the reaction is a ketone reacting with NaCN in some conditions to form a cyanohydrin. What reagent A is needed here? I think the usual conditions for forming cyanohydrin involve an acid catalyst. Because the ketone has to be activated. So H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better electrophile. So reagent A should be an acid, maybe H3O+.

Looking at the options, options A and B have A as H3O+, while C and D have NaHSO3. So maybe A is either A or B.

Now the second reaction: the starting material is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile. The product is the same molecule but with the nitrile (-CN) group oxidized to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). So the reagent B must be an oxidizing agent that can convert a nitrile to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but how is a nitrile oxidized to a carboxylic acid? I remember that nitriles can be oxidized under strong acidic conditions. For example, using HCl (HCl acting as an acid and a proton source) under reflux. Alternatively, another strong acid like H2SO4 might be used, but in the options, B is either HCl or CH3COOH (acetic acid). 

Wait, but the second reagent is called B and it's in the presence of H2O. So the reaction is hydrolysis of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid. Wait, but to go from nitrile to carboxylic acid, is it hydrolysis? I think so. Typically, nitriles are hydrolyzed under acidic or basic conditions. But in the presence of H2O and an acid, perhaps it's a hydrolysis followed by oxidation.

Wait, no. Wait, nitrile hydrolysis under acidic conditions gives an amide, right? Or is it that under certain conditions, it goes all the way to the carboxylic acid? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is first hydrolyzed to an amide, then further oxidized, but in this case, the product is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the conditions involve both hydrolysis and oxidation.

Alternatively, maybe the nitrile is converted to an acyl chloride first, but that's probably not the case here.

Wait, another thought: when a nitrile is
