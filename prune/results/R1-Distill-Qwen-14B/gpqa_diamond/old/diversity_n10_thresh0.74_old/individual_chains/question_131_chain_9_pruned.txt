Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

The question starts with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. Then it's dehydrated to form an anhydride. I remember that dehydrating a dicarboxylic acid typically forms an anhydride, which would have two carbonyl groups. The anhydride's NMR spectra are given. The 1H NMR shows a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR has two peaks around 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Hmm, wait, what do those correspond to?

In 13C NMR, the 165 ppm region is usually a carbonyl, like a ketone or an ester. Oh, but anhydrides have two carbonyl groups. Wait, but the 13C has two peaks. So maybe each carbonyl is a different environment. Wait, or maybe one is an anhydride O and the other is a carbonyl of something else. Hmm.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Aromatic protons are around there. So maybe the anhydride is cyclic? Or perhaps it's an acyclic anhydride with benzene rings or something. Wait, but if it's from a cis-alkene dehydrating, that would form a cyclic anhydride if the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons. So maybe it's a cyclic anhydride like succinic anhydride but substituted. But in that case, the 1H NMR would show some protons. Wait, but the 1H NMR here has a single peak at 7 ppm. So maybe it's a benzene ring. Oh! Because if the original acid had a cis-alkene, maybe it's part of a ring, perhaps a cyclopropane or something else. Wait, no, wait, the diacid with cis-alkene would form a cyclic anhyd
