Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about planets transiting and occulting each other, and figuring out the maximum orbital period for a second planet.

Alright, let's break down what's given. There's a primary planet with Earth's radius, orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The primary planet's orbital period is 3 days, and the transit impact parameter is 0.2. Then there's a second planet with a radius of 2.5 Earth radii. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have so that both transit and occultation events occur.

Wait, transit and occultation... Right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, which would cause a slight increase in brightness because we lose the planet's light. For both events to happen, the planets must be aligned in such a way that they can eclipse each other. So, they must be in the same orbital plane and their orbital periods must be such that their orbital motions cause these events to occur.

I remember that for such events to happen, the orbital period of the second planet must be longer than the primary's. Because if it's shorter, the secondary would orbit faster and might not line up correctly for both events. Or wait, maybe the other way around? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the secondary's orbital period needs to be longer. Because if it's shorter, it's moving faster, so maybe it would pass in front but not necessarily be eclipsed by the primary.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The primary has a 3-day period. The second planet's period is what we're trying to find. For both transits and occultations to occur, the planets must be in a configuration where they can both pass in front and behind each other relative to the star.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused here. So maybe I should model this with orbital mechanics. Both planets are in the same orbital plane, so their orbits are coplanar. For the secondary planet to transit the star, its orbital distance must be such that when it's between us and the star, it blocks some light. Similarly, for occultation, when the primary is between us and the secondary, the secondary's light is blocked, so from our perspective
