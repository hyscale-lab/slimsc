Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again carefully.

So, the chemist found a white solid. The information given includes mass spectrometry, IR, and 1H NMR data. I need to use these to identify the structure from the options A to D.

Let me start by looking at each piece of data one by one.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm. I remember that in mass spec, the molecular ion peak (M) is the highest point. The peak at 158 is two units higher. Two possibilities come to mind: either it's a chlorine isotope or maybe deuterium, but more likely a chlorine because the options have chloro compounds.

Wait, chlorine has an atomic weight of about 35.5. So, the molecular weight is 156. If the molecule has a chlorine atom, the molecular formula would include Cl. Let's see, what's 156 minus the Cl (35.5) approximately? That would be around 120.5 g/mol for the rest. Let me think what that could be.

Wait, the molecular ion is M+ at 156, but also a peak at 158. Oh, wait, the molecular ion can sometimes split into fragments, but another possibility is the presence of isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a common isotope, Cl-35 and Cl-37. If the molecule has one Cl atom, the molecular ion (M) can be
