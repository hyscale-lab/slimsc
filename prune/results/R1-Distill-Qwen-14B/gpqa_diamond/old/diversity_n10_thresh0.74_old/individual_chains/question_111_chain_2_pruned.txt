Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question has two reactions, A and B, and I need to pick the major products from the options given. Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so maybe it's involved in some kind of elimination or maybe a ring-opening reaction. Wait, the starting material is a ketone, cyclohexanone derivative. Oh, right, when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile, especially in the presence of a base, it could undergo a nucleophilic attack. But ethyl acrylate is an ester with an acrylate group. Acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, which is a good Michael acceptor. So I think this might be a Michael addition here.

Wait, Michael addition is when a nucleophile adds to the beta position of an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So the ketone would act as the nucleophile? Wait, no, wait. The acrylate is the Michael acceptor, and the cyclohexanone is the nucleophile? Or is it the other way around? No, wait, the cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. No, the cyclohexanone is the Michael donor, I think. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In Michael addition, the nucleophile (the donor) attacks the beta position of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl (the acceptor). So ethyl acrylate is the acceptor here. So the cyclohexanone's enolate would attack the acrylate.

Wait, but the cyclohexanone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. The cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups? Wait, no: 2-ethyl,
