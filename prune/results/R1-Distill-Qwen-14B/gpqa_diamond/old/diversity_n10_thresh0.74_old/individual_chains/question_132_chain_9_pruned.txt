Alright, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down. Okay, the question is about a mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR spectrum has two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each a singlet, and in a 1:1 ratio. Then there are three signals at 2.2 ppm, all singlets, in a 2:1:1 ratio. I need to figure out which two compounds are present from the given options.

Hmm, first, the molecular formula C10H14. For aromatic compounds, the degree of unsaturation can help. The formula is C10H14. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no halogens or nitrogen, it's (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=8/2=4. So four degreesâ€”probably a benzene ring (3 double bonds or one ring and two double bonds) plus maybe a double bond or something else. But for aromatic compounds, benzene will account for three degrees, so the fourth could be a double bond or a ring. Wait, no, benzene is a ring, so maybe four degrees would mean either two benzene rings (unlikely, since that's a lot), or one benzene and one double bond somewhere else. But wait, more accurately, benzene has three double bonds, so the degree is 4 (3 from the ring and one from each double bond?), no, wait: each ring and each double bond counts as one degree. So benzene (a six-membered ring with three double bonds) counts as 4 degrees? No, wait, no. Each ring is one degree, each double bond is another. So benzene has one ring and three double bonds, but that's four degrees. Wait, no: Each ring counts as one, each double bond as one. Benzene has one ring and three double bonds, so 4 degrees. Oh, but wait, the formula for degree of unsaturation is (each ring or double bond is one). So if a molecule has a benzene ring (which has three double bonds and one ring), that's 4 degrees, right. So for C10H14, the four degrees would fit. So each compound is a mono-aromatic compound, perhaps with some substituents.

Wait, the compounds given are all tetramethylbenzenes or diethylbenzenes. Let's look at the options:

Options are:
A) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
B) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
C) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene
D) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene

Wait, let me think about each structure.

1,2,4,
