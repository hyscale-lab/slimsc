Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this decay probability problem. Hmm. Let me think. The question is about radioactive decay, right? So, the setup is that we have an atom which has a certain decay probability. The problem says that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, I guess that means that after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed.

Wait, but the way it's phrased, "decay probability of this atom is 32% within 100 minutes"—I think that refers to the probability that the atom decays within that time period. So, after 100 minutes, 32% of the atoms would have decayed on average. That makes sense with the concept of half-life, but wait, 32% isn't a typical half-life number. Oh, wait, 32% is about a third of the atoms decaying. So maybe the decay constant is such that after 100 minutes, 32% have decayed.

Now, the twist is that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. So, we're at 50 minutes, and we're supposed to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, the next 150 minutes from right now, which is 50 minutes into the monitoring. Or is it the total time from the start? Let me double-check the question.

Wait, the question says, "so far, 50 minutes have passed and the atom has not decayed. What is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes?" Oh, so the next 150 minutes after the current time—so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the 50 minutes have already passed, and the 150 minutes are the remaining time we're considering. So the total time becomes 200 minutes, but the key point is that the decay is a memoryless process.

Oh right! Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, which means the probability of decay in a future period doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, the
