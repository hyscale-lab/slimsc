Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit puzzled, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

Okay, the first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN, with a reagent A, to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. And I have to choose the correct pair of reagents A and B from the options given.

Hmm. Let's break down each reaction.

Starting with the first reaction: Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? And when it reacts with NaCN and reagent A, it forms 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, what's that structure? Let me think. Butan-2-one has a carbonyl group on the second carbon. The product is a nitrile with a hydroxyl group on the same carbon as the nitrile and a methyl group. So the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or maybe (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? Wait, no, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So the structure would be CH2(CN)(OH)CH2CH3? Or wait, wait. Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but with substituents.

Wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. So butane is four carbons. The nitrile is on the first carbon (since it's butane-nitrile, nitrile is at the end), the hydroxyl and methyl are on the second carbon. So structure would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, butane has four carbons. Let me count:

Butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methyl. So the nitrile is at position 1, the second carbon has both OH and CH3 groups. So the structure is CH2-C(OH)(CH
