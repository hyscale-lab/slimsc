Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully. 

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. But wait, I might also be mixing it up with the use of LiAlH4 for reductions. Let me make sure: Clemmensen reduction uses H2O in the presence of a catalyst, but wait, no, I think it's actually red phosphorus and HI as the reducing agents. Right, so the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones to alkanes, or maybe aldehydes to alkanes as well. So if Compound X has a carbonyl group, like a ketone or an aldehyde, after this reaction, it would become a methylene or methyl group, respectively.

Now, let's look at the spectral data given for Compound X.

The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹. That broad region usually suggests O-H stretching, so maybe there's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Another peak is at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. The 1610 and 1450 peaks might be from aromatic C=C stretching. So, putting that together, maybe there's an aromatic ring with a carbonyl group attached. Since there's a broad peak around 3400, perhaps it's a carboxylic acid (which has an O-H stretch) or an alcohol. But wait, a carboxylic acid would have a very broad peak, perhaps around 2500–3300 cm⁻¹, which matches the 3400–2500 range given here. Also, the 1720 cm⁻¹ is a strong peak for a carbonyl, which fits with a carboxylic acid (since they have around 1700 cm⁻¹). Alternatively, it could be an ester or ketone, but the broad peak suggests an O-H.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10 ppm is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be around 10-12 ppm, but it's usually a broad peak, which fits with this. Wait, but the integration is 1H. So if it's a carboxylic acid, that would be the -OH proton. But wait, another thought: the aromatic protons are at 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H), which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, so it's likely a para-substituted benzene, like para-substituted with a group that's de-shielding the ring.

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm
