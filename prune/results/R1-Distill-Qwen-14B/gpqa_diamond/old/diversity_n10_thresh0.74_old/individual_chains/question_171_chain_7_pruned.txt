Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let's see. The question involves six different substances undergoing substitution with excess bromine, and we need to arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A to D, each giving a different order.

Wait, electrophilic substitution on aromatic rings. Right, the positions where the substituents direct the incoming electrophile depend on whether the substituents are activating or deactivating, and whether they are ortho/para directors or meta directors.

So each of these substituents is attached to a benzene ring. Let me list them out:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's toluene. The methyl group is an activating group because it's an alkyl group, which donates electrons through the sigma bonds. Activating groups make the ring more reactive. Since methyl is an ortho/para director, the electrophile will attack at the ortho, meta, or para positions relative to it. Wait, no, wait: methyl is an activating group, so the ring is more reactive. And being an alkyl group, it's an ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products would be the para and ortho isomers. Since the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed" — so perhaps each of these reactions gives a single product? Or maybe it's a meta thing? Wait, no, no, wait. Electrophilic substitution on benzene derivatives can give multiple products if there are multiple positions where substitution is possible, but if the substituent is such that only one position is favored, like para, then that's the major product. But wait, the question says arrange them based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So some of them will form mainly para, some mainly meta, some maybe equal, but for each, we need to find the para fraction.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction. So for each substance, when bromine is added, what is the ratio of para isomer to others? Or maybe for each, the para is the major product or not.

Wait, no, each of the six substances undergoes substitution. The key is to determine, for each substituent, the directing effect and whether the para position is a major product.

So let's go through each substituent:

1) С6H5-CH3: Toluene. Methyl is activating, ortho/para director. So when bromine adds, the major products are ortho and para. But in electrophilic substitution, the major product is usually para. Because for toluene, the para isomer is more stable due to better resonance, and the ortho is less favored because of steric hindrance. So in toluene, monobromination gives a mixture, but the para isomer is major. So the para fraction is high.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's ethyl benzoate. The group is COOEt. The carbonyl group is deactivating because the electron-withdrawing effect. Wait, the ester group is a meta director. Because the carbonyl is deactivating, so it's a meta director. So when bromine adds, the major product is the meta-substituted isomer. So the para isomer would be minor. So the weight fraction of para would be low.

Wait, but wait, wait. Wait, the substituent is -COOEt. That's an ester group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's deactivating. Thus, it would be a meta director. So the incoming bromine would add in the meta position relative to the ester group. So the para isomer would not form much. So the para fraction would be low for this.

3) C6H5-Cl: That's chlorobenzene. Chlorine is a substituent that is deactivating (because of the electronegativity, it's an EWG) but it is an ortho/para director. Wait, but wait. Chlorine is a unique case: it's an EWG, but because of its -I effect, it's deactivating. However, due to resonance, it can donate electrons (though not as strong as activating groups). Wait, no, chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Because when the ring is attacked, the chlorine's lone pairs can resonate into the ring, helping stabilize the transition state. So when Cl is attached to benzene, it directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions. But since it's deactivating, the ring is less reactive than benzene. So bromination of chlorobenzene would produce mainly para and ortho isomers, but since Cl is a deactivating group, the reactivity is lower. But the question is about the para fraction relative to others, not the overall reactivity. So in chlorobenzene, the para is a major product. So the weight fraction of para is high.

4) C6H5-NO2: That's nitrobenzene. The nitro group is a strong deactivating group. It's a meta director. Because the nitro group is a strong EWG, it directs the incoming electrophile to the meta position. So when nitrobenzene undergoes bromination, the major product is the meta isomer. So the para fraction is low.

5) C6H5-C2H5: That's ethylbenzene. The ethyl group is an activating group (alkyl), so it donates electrons. It is an ortho/para director. So when it undergoes bromination, the major products are ortho and para. Again, steric factors may make para more favorable than ortho. So the para fraction is significant.

6) C6H5-COOH: That's benzoic acid. The substituent is -COOH, which is a strong deactivating group (due to the carboxylic acid group being an EWG). It's a meta director. So when bromine adds, the incoming group would attach in the meta position relative to the COOH group. So the para isomer would be minor. So the para fraction is low.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. So for each substituent, we determine whether the para isomer is a major product when bromine is added.

1) Toluene (CH3): para is major. So high para fraction.

2) COOEt (ester): meta is major. So low para.

3) Cl: para is major. High para.

4) NO2: meta, so low para.

5) C2H5 (ethyl): para is major, high.

6) COOH: meta, low para.

Wait, but wait, what about the relative activating strengths? For example, some substituents may have stronger activating effects, which might affect the product ratios more. But the question is about the para fraction, not the overall reactivity. So for each substituent, do para and ortho products form in significant amounts, or is it mainly meta?

Let me list each substituent and their behavior:

1. CH3: activating, ortho/para. So para is major.

2. COOEt: deactivating, meta. para is minor.

3. Cl: deactivating, ortho/para. Para is
