Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere of radius R. Right, so divergence and vector fields... I remember from my notes that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a given point.

The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So, in spherical coordinates, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction. That means the vector field f(r) is radial, right? So in spherical coordinates, the components would be F_r = 1/r², and F_θ and F_φ are zero.

I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R. So, the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV within that sphere. Wait, I remember from the divergence theorem that the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary. So, ∫∫ (∇ · f) dV = ∫∫ f · dA over the sphere of radius R.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, no, the divergence theorem says that the integral of the divergence over the volume is equal to the flux through the surface. So, yes, that's right. So, the volume integral can be found by calculating the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

But wait, alternatively, I could compute the divergence in spherical coordinates and then integrate it. Maybe that's easier.

So, what's the divergence of a radial vector field? Let's recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. The divergence of a vector field F = (F_r, F_θ, F_φ) is given by:

∇ · F = (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(F_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) dF_φ/dφ )

But in our case, F_θ and F_φ are zero. So the divergence simplifies to just the radial part.

So, ∇ · F = (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr.

Given F_r = 1/r², let's plug that in.

So,

∇ · F = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Inside the derivative, r² * 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇ · F = 0 everywhere except at r=0.

Wait, but at r=0, the field might have a singularity. Because if r approaches zero, f(r) would blow up, but the divergence is zero elsewhere. So, the divergence is zero everywhere except perhaps at the origin.

But wait, the volume we're considering is a sphere of radius R. So, when R is not zero, the divergence inside the sphere (excluding the origin) is zero. So, does that mean the integral is zero?

Wait, but let me think again. The divergence is zero, so the integral would be zero? But wait, what about if the divergence is zero except at the origin, which is a point of measure zero. So the integral over the volume would still be zero, right? Because the divergence is zero almost everywhere in the volume.

But wait, hold on. What if the field isn't smooth at the origin? Like, maybe the field is such that the divergence isn't defined there, but overall, the integral over the entire volume would be zero except at a point, which doesn't contribute.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think about the divergence theorem again. The divergence theorem applies to vector fields that are continuously differentiable inside and on the boundary of the volume. So in this case, f(r) is 1/r², which is a radial vector field. But at r=0, the field isn't defined because 1/r² would be infinite. So, maybe the divergence isn't zero everywhere except the origin. Hmm, but when I computed ∇·F, I found it's zero except at r=0. So, is the integral of ∇·f over the volume equal to the flux through the surface?

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface is
