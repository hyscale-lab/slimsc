Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The compound X is C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. The product's NMR data is given. I need to identify the starting compound X from the options A to D.

Wait, what's 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane? Oh right, that's a base, probably used in some elimination or ring-opening reaction. But wait, in this case, since compound X is reacting with it, maybe it's an epoxide ring opening? Or perhaps another kind of reaction.

Looking at the options, they all seem to be epoxides. The options are A to D, each with a structure involving an oxirane ring (which is an epoxide). So maybe compound X is an epoxide, and when it reacts with this base, something happens—like ring-opening. Or perhaps the reaction is an acid-base reaction, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a ring-opening of an epoxide. But wait, the product's NMR is given, and we need to find X, which is the starting material.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a rearrangement. Oh wait, wait. 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a bulky base, sometimes used in the Sharpless epoxidation, but wait that's for epoxidizing alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, but the product is from X reacting with this base. So perhaps X is an epoxide, and the base is causing a ring-opening. Or maybe X is a diene, and the base is causing some rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a simple elimination. Let me think. But the product's NMR is given, so perhaps I can figure out what the product is, and then backtrack to find X.

Looking at the product's NMR:

1H NMR: δ 2.28 (3H, s), 2.31 (3H, s), 6.75 (1H, d), 7.
