Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. Hmm, I remember that optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, which usually implies the presence of chiral centers. But wait, there are other factors too, like if there's a plane of symmetry or if the molecule is meso.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)-CH2-CH2? Wait, no, but wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, no. 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to the first carbon of a butene. So structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, making it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, but then the double bond is at 1-ene. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Actually, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first
