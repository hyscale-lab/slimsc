Okay, so I have this problem about two planets orbiting a star and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... I remember that depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh right, the formula is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5. Wait, but wait, the star's temperature is given, so maybe I can relate the star's luminosity from that.

Wait, the star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and Teff 6300 K. The Sun's Teff is about 5778 K, so this star is a bit hotter. But the problem says to use the effective temperature, so maybe I don't need the star's mass and radius for the temperature calculation? Or do I? Hmm.

The planets have masses of 7 and 5 Earth masses, but I don't think mass affects equilibrium temperature directly. It's about the size (radius) for albedo and the distance for the flux. But wait, the distance is determined by the RV method, right? Because the RV method gives the mass and the period, but the transit method gives the radius and period. Oh, but wait, the RV gives the mass function which depends on the inclination, but assuming circular orbits and that the transits are observed, the inclination is around 90 degrees, so the RV measurements should give the true masses. But I'm not sure if I need that for the temperature ratio.

Wait, the question is about equilibrium temperatures, so I need the distance of each planet from the star. Because equilibrium temperature depends on the distance. But how do I find the distance? Oh, wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the velocity, K. Then using K, we can find the planet's mass and the distance. Because the RV semi-amplitude K is given by (v) = ( (G * (M_star + M_planet) ) / ( (P/(2π))^2 * (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) )) )^(1/3) ), but M_planet is much smaller than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

Wait, I think the RV semi-amplitude formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * ( 1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star)^(2/3) ) ) / (P * (1 day in seconds)) ) )^(1/3) — no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, I remember the formula for radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( ( (M_*)^2 + M_p M_* )^(1/3) ) ) ) * (sin i) / ( (1 + M_p / M_*)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) / (2π G)^(1/3) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the relation between K and the planet's orbital period and distance. Alternatively, another approach is to think that the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The maximum velocity occurs when the planet is at a certain point in its orbit, and K is given by K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )

But since both planets are detected via RV, and assuming e=0 (circular orbits), and the same star, and sin i is 1 because the transit method implies i≈90 degrees, so we can ignore the sin i term as it's 1. Also, M_p << M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so the denominator terms become (M_* )^(2/3). So K ≈ (2π G / P)^(1/3) * (M_p) / (M_*^(2/3)).

Wait, but for each planet, we have their K values given. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å in the [OI] line at 6300 Å. Similarly, Planet2 causes up to 0.04 Å shift. Doppler shift Δλ/λ = v/c. So v = c * (Δλ/λ). The speed of light c is about 3e5 km/s. So the velocity of the star due to the planet is v = c * (Δλ / λ)
