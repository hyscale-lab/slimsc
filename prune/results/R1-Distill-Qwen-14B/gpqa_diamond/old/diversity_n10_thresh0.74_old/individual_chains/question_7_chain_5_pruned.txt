Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about high-energy gamma rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's all around us. The question is asking about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, so I think this has something to do with the probability of a gamma-ray interacting with a CMB photon. The process is gamma-gamma annihilation into e+ e-. I remember that for high-energy particles, their mean free path is important. If the mean free path is small compared to the size of the universe, then they would annihilate quickly, limiting their lifetime.

The mean free path λ is the average distance a particle travels before interacting. So, if λ is much smaller than the universe's size, the particles can't travel far. But I'm not exactly sure how to calculate it. Maybe I need to find the energy where the interaction rate is so high that the gamma-rays don't last long.

I think the cross-section for this process matters. The cross-section σ depends on the energy of the gamma and the CMB photons. The cross-section for pair production (γγ → e+ e-) peaks at certain energies. Oh right, the cross-section is proportional to 1/(s) where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, or is it more complicated?

Wait, maybe I should recall the formula for the cross-section. I think for two photons colliding, the cross-section has a certain dependence. The general formula for the cross-section σ is given by:

σ ≈ (8π/3) * (α² / (s²)) * (something else?), where α is the fine-structure constant. Or wait, maybe the cross-section for pair production peaks when the center-of-mass energy is just above 2m_e c², which is about 1 MeV. But since the CMB photons are low energy, the high-energy gamma-rays would have their energy much higher. So their center-of-mass energy would be higher than that, which is the threshold.

Wait, but the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- isn't exactly that simple. Let me think again. The cross-section actually depends on the product of the two photon energies. Or is it more about the invariant s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since for CMB photons, E ≈ pc because they're low energy (non-relativistic in the lab frame?), but wait, no, photons are always massless so E = pc. So for two photons colliding, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since E1 = p1 c, etc., this becomes s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 (because p1 and p2 are vectors, but in opposite directions perhaps? Or same? Hmm, wait, in the lab frame, the CMB photons are all around, so the gamma could be moving in any direction. But perhaps for the average case, we can consider a CMB photon with energy E_cmb = 1e-3 eV and the gamma-ray with energy E_gamma.

Wait, let's think about the cross-section for this reaction. I remember the cross-section for pair production by two photons is given by:

σ(E1, E2) ≈ (8π/3) * (α^2 / (4E1 E2)) * (1/( (E1 + E2)^2/( (2m_e c^2)^2 )) )^{something} )

Wait, maybe the cross-section goes as 1/(E1 E2) times some function. Alternatively, perhaps for high-energy photons, the cross-section is roughly σ ≈ (α^2/(4 E1 E2)) * ...?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should instead think about the interaction probability. The probability that a gamma-ray interacts with a CMB photon is given by the cross-section multiplied by the number density of the target photons.

So the interaction probability per
