Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But wait, what's a density matrix exactly? Oh right, it's a positive semi-definite matrix that gives the probabilities of the system's states when measured.

The question gives me a specific density matrix: ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are given as r coordinates, so I'm guessing this is about the Bloch sphere representation.

Wait, what's the Bloch sphere? Oh, right! For a single qubit, any state can be represented as a point on the surface of a unit sphere. Pure states are on the surface, and mixed states inside. The density matrix for a pure state would have a trace of 1 and a trace squared of 1 as well. But for a mixed state, the trace is 1, and the trace squared (Tr(ρ²)) would be less than 1.

So the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute Tr(ρ²). Let's see, ρ squared would be [(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2]^2. Expanding that, each term would be |0⟩⟨0| * |0⟩⟨0|, which is |0⟩⟨0|, same for |1⟩⟨1|. The cross terms would be |0⟩⟨1| and |1⟩⟨0|, but when squared, maybe? Wait, no, when you multiply matrices, it's [ (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2 ] multiplied by itself. So each term would be |0⟩⟨0| * |0⟩⟨0| which is |0⟩⟨0|, plus |0⟩⟨0| * |1⟩⟨1| which is zero (since ⟨0|1⟩=0), and similarly the other terms. So ρ² would be (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/4. Then Tr(ρ²) is (1/4)(1 +1) = 1/2. Since this is less than 1, ρ is a mixed state.

So this state is a completely mixed state for a qubit. I remember that the completely mixed state for a single qubit is represented by the identity matrix divided by 2. Because the identity matrix is diagonal with 1s, so (I/2) would have 1/2 on the diagonal. Wait, let me compute. The identity matrix is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|) is exactly the given ρ. So yes, this is the maximally mixed state.

Now, the Bloch sphere representation. For a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector. The density matrix is (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector. So the completely mixed state would have r=0 because (I + 0)/2 is I/2, which is our ρ. So the point in the Bloch sphere would be at the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0), so that's the right answer. The other options don't make sense because a non-zero vector would correspond to a pure state or a different mixed state.

Wait, let me think again. The Bloch vector for a mixed state is given by the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. For the maximally mixed state, all the expectation values would be zero because it's completely unpolarized. So the vector is at the center, which is (0,0,0). Yep, that's correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a completely mixed state for a single qubit. To confirm this, we compute the trace of \(\rho^2\), which is a measure of the purity of the state. Expanding \(\rho^2\), we find:

\[
\rho^2 = \frac{1}{4} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right),
\]

and taking the trace gives:

\[
\text{Tr}(\rho^2) = \frac{1}{4} (1 + 1) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Since \(\text{Tr}(\rho^2) < 1\), the state is indeed mixed. Furthermore, this is the maximally mixed state for a single qubit, which corresponds to the completely depolarized state.

In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can be expressed as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is the Bloch vector. For the maximally mixed state, the Bloch vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is zero because there is no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere. Thus, the geometrical position of this state in the qubit space is at the origin of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the coordinates \((0, 0, 0)\).

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.  
**B) \(r = (0, 0, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a different mixed state.  
**C) \(r = (0, 0, 0):** Correct, as this corresponds to the maximally mixed state.  
**D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** Incorrect, as this corresponds to a pure state.

Answer: C
