Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question says that toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4 to get product 2. Finally, product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide to form product 3. We need to find the molecular symmetry group of product 3, with the options given.

First, I'll recall what each step does.

Step 1: Toluene with nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). I remember that nitration is a common reaction. Toluene has a methyl group attached to benzene. Nitration typically occurs at the meta position when the substituent is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Wait, no, toluene's methyl is activating and ortho/para directing. So, nitration of toluene should give nitrotoluene, specifically para-nitrotoluene as the major product, right? Because the methyl group directs the nitro group to para position more than meta.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, nitration of toluene gives a mixture, but the major product is para-nitrotoluene. Because the methyl group is activating (since it's an electron-donating group), it directs incoming electrophiles to the ortho and para positions. But since the para position is less sterically hindered than ortho, the para product is more favored. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Step 2: Product 1 (para-nitrotoluene) is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially under acidic conditions. For nitrotoluene derivatives, oxidation can lead to different products. Wait, para-nitrotoluene has a methyl group attached to the benzene ring with a nitro group in the para position.

I think when you oxidize a nitrotoluene, the methyl group (CH3) attached to the benzene can be oxidized. The oxidation of toluene derivatives typically converts the methyl group into a carboxylic acid group if fully oxidized. So, for para-nitrotoluene, the methyl group becomes a COOH group. So
