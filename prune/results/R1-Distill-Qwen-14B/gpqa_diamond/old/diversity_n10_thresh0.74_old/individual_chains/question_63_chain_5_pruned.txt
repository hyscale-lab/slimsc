Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand. The question is about a diatomic molecule modeled by the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what the question is asking. The molecule is in the fundamental state, which I believe is the lowest energy state. It can either rotate or vibrate, and in this case, since it's a rotation-vibration model, both are considered. But the problem is about transitioning to the next state with the lowest energy. Wait, usually in such models, the states are quantized, and the transitions are either vibrational or rotational.

Wait, the fundamental state is the ground state for both rotation and vibration. So, if the molecule is in the ground state, the next possible state would involve either a vibrational or rotational transition. But the question says the photon is absorbed, which would lead the molecule to a higher energy state.

In molecular spectroscopy, when a molecule absorbs a photon, it can either undergo a vibrational transition, a rotational transition, or both. But in this case, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the photon must cause the transition to the state with the smallest possible energy increment.

I think that the lowest energy transition would be a rotational transition because vibrational transitions require more energy. So, maybe the photon is causing a change in the rotational state, not the vibrational. Alternatively, perhaps it's a combination, but wait, the fundamental state is the lowest, so the next state could be the next vibrational state or the next rotational state.

Wait, but the problem mentions the "next state with the lowest possible energy." So which transition gives the lower energy photon: a vibrational or a rotational transition? Let me think about the energies involved.

The vibrational energy levels are given by the formula E_v = (v + 1/2)ħω, where v is the vibrational quantum number (v=0 is the ground state). The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where J is the rotational quantum number (J=0 is the ground state).
