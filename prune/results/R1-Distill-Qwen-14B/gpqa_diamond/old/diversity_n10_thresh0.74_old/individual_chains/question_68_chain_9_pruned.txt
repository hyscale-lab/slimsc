Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment in a magnetic field. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is equal to gamma multiplied by Sz. So mu = γ S_z. The magnetic field is initially pointing in the +Z direction. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So, we're looking for the frequency with which <mu_z> oscillates.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's magnetic moment would align with this field because that's the lowest energy state. So the spin would be up in the Z direction, right? But then the field is turned off, and suddenly a new field in Y is turned on. So now, the magnetic field is along Y, same strength as before.

I remember that when the magnetic field changes direction, the Hamiltonian of the system changes, which affects the energy levels and the time evolution of the system. The magnetic moment will precess around the new magnetic field direction. But how does that affect the z-component?

The magnetic moment is mu = γ S_z. Wait, no, wait a second. Oh wait, actually, the magnetic moment is given by mu = γ S, where S is the spin operator. But wait, the question specifies mu = γ S_z. Hmm
