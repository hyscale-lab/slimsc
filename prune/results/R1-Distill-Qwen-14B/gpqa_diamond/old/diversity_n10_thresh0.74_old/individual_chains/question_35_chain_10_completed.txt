Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A of a muon. The operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix and is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay and determine which of the given statements is correct.

First, let me recall that the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a particle like a muon (which is a lepton, so spin-1/2) would have eigenvalues related to its spin. The possible eigenvalues for the components of angular momentum usually are ± ħ/2. But wait, the question here uses 'a' as the eigenvalue in the equation Ay(φ) = a φ. So I'll need to find what those a's are.

Wait, the operator Ay is given as c times S. Let me write down what S looks like. S is a 2x2 matrix:

S = [ [0, -i],
       [i, 0] ]

And c is h/(4π). So Ay = c * S.

But wait, what's the unit here? Planck's constant h has units of J·s, but sometimes angular momentum is expressed in terms of ħ, which is h/(2π). So ħ = h/(2π), meaning h = 2π ħ.

Hmm. So substituting h into c, we have c = (2π ħ) / (4π) )= (2π ħ)/(4π) = ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2.

Wait, no, let me compute that again. c is h/(4π), and since ħ = h/(2π), substituting h = 2π ħ gives c = (2π ħ) / (4π) ) = (2π/4π) * ħ = (1/2) ħ. So yes, c is ħ/2.

So Ay = (ħ/2) * S.

Wait, but what is S? Let me compute the matrix S. S is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

So when multiplied by ħ/2, Ay becomes:

Ay = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Which gives:

Ay = [ [0, -i * ħ/2 ],
        [i * ħ/2, 0 ] ]

I think I can write this as:

Ay = (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Now, to find the eigenvalues of Ay, I'll need to solve the characteristic equation: det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

So the matrix (Ay - a I) is:

[ [ -a, -i ħ/2 ],
  [ i ħ/2, -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - ( (-i ħ/2)(i ħ/2) )

Calculating the determinant:

= a² - [ (-i)(i) (ħ²)/(4) ) ]

But (-i)(i) is (-i²) = -(-1) = 1.

So determinant = a² - ( (1) * ħ² /4 ) = a² - (ħ²/4) = 0.

So, a² = ħ² /4 → a = ± ħ/2.

Wait, but wait a second. The options given don't have h/2, but let's see. Let me think—what's ħ in terms of h? ħ is h/(2π), so ħ/2 is h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π) * (1/2) *2? Wait, let me compute:

Wait, ħ = h/(2π). So ħ/2 = (h/(2π)) / 2 = h/(4π). Oh wait, that's exactly the value of c. Because c is h/(4π). Hmm.

Wait, so the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2, which equals ± h/(4π). So the possible eigenvalues are +h/(4π) and -h/(4π). But looking at the options, let's see.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2π h, which I don't think, because our eigenvalues are real. Wait, no, because Ay is a Hermitian operator? Wait, S is a Hermitian matrix? Let me check.

Wait, S is [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]. The conjugate transpose of S would be [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ] which is not the same as S. Wait, wait, to be Hermitian, S must equal its conjugate transpose. Let me compute S†:

S† would have elements (S†)_{1,1} = 0, (S†)_{1,2} = i, (S†)_{2,1} = -i, (S†)_{2,2}=0. Which is not the same as S. So S is not Hermitian, which would imply that Ay is not Hermitian either if c is real. But wait, angular momentum operators are Hermitian, so maybe I've made a mistake here.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the spin matrices Sx, Sy, Sz are Hermitian, but perhaps in this problem, S is not one of them. Wait, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, which are Hermitian. σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the same as S here. So S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is Hermitian. Because σy is Hermitian. So S is Hermitian. Because when you take the conjugate transpose of S, you get [ [0, i], [-i, 0] ], which is equal to S because i becomes -i, but wait, no, wait:

Wait, σy is (0, -i; i, 0). The conjugate transpose of σy would be (0, i; -i, 0). But σy is Hermitian because σy† = σy? Wait, let's compute. For σy, (σy)_{2,1} is i. So (σy†)_{1,2} would be i, and (σy)_{1,2} is -i. So (σy)† = [[0, i], [-i, 0]] which is not equal to σy. Wait, then σy is not Hermitian? That can't be right, because all Pauli matrices are Hermitian.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the matrix representation. Wait, the Pauli Y matrix σy is indeed Hermitian because σy† = σy. So when I take the conjugate transpose, if σy is:

Row 1: 0, -i

Row 2: i, 0

Then the conjugate transpose would be:

Row 1: 0, i

Row 2: -i, 0

Which is the same as the original matrix if I swap the off-diagonal elements and change their signs as appropriate. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I have the signs wrong. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I was taught that σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is correct. Let me compute σy†:

The (1,2) element is -i. The conjugate of that is i. So the (2,1) element of σy† is i. So σy† is [[0, i],[ -i, 0]].

Wait, that's not the same as σy, which is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So σy is not equal to its conjugate transpose. That can't be right because σy is Hermitian. Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix. Let me check another source. Oh wait, the correct Pauli Y matrix is indeed:

σy = [ [0, -i],
        [i,  0] ]

And its conjugate transpose would be:

[ [0, i],
  [-i, 0] ]

Which is not the same as σy. So that would suggest σy is not Hermitian, which contradicts what I know. So perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix. Wait, no, perhaps I have the order wrong. Let me think again. Maybe I should have the (1,2) element as i and (2,1) as -i. Let me see.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the matrix S is not Hermitian. Because in the problem statement, S is given as the matrix with first row (0, -i) and second row (i, 0). So S is not Hermitian. Because S† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is different from S.

But that's a problem because the angular momentum operator is Hermitian. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Wait, but the problem states that Ay = c * S, and S is given as that matrix. So perhaps the matrix S is not Hermitian, which would make Ay not Hermitian, which can't be right because observables must have Hermitian operators. Hmm, maybe I should proceed regardless.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix S's form. Because if S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]], then perhaps it's actually the Pauli Y matrix multiplied by -i. Because if I consider that, then ( -i σy ) would be [[0, 1], [-1, 0]].

Wait, perhaps I should think about the eigenvalues regardless of that. Let me proceed.

So the eigenvalues a are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see:

Option B says the imaginary parts are ±1/2 and real parts ±1. That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are purely real.

Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ± h/(4π). But that can't be right because the eigenvalues are real. So option A suggests that a has both real and imaginary parts, which doesn't make sense because the operator might be Hermitian, leading to real eigenvalues.

Wait, but wait, earlier I was confused because I thought S is Hermitian, but now I'm not so sure. Let me double-check whether Ay is Hermitian.

Ay is c * S, and c is a real scalar (h/(4π), which is real). So if S is Hermitian, then Ay would be Hermitian. But earlier, I thought S isn't Hermitian. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me compute S† again. S is:

0   -i

i    0

The conjugate transpose S† would be:

0    i

-i    0

So S† is:

Row 1: 0, i

Row 2: -i, 0

Which is not equal to S. So S is not Hermitian, which would imply that Ay is not Hermitian, which is a problem because the angular momentum component should be Hermitian.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the matrix S. Maybe the matrix S is actually [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which would make it Hermitian. Let me check if that's the case. Because if S were Hermitian, then S† = S.

Wait, the given S is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So if I take S†:

The (1,2) element is -i, which becomes i in S†. So S†'s (1,2) is i, and (2,1) is -i.

So S† would be [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is not equal to S. So S is not Hermitian. Therefore, Ay isn't Hermitian, which is a problem because observables (like angular momentum components) must have Hermitian operators. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the matrix S is actually [[0, i], [-i, 0]], which is Hermitian. But the problem says the first row is (0, -i), so I think the given S is correct as per the problem statement.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed with the calculation.

The eigenvalues are a = ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4π).

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Im(a) is ± 2πh, Re(a) is ± h/(4π). No, because a is real, so Im(a) is zero. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Im(a) is ±1/2, Re(a) is ±1. No, because a is real, and the real parts are ± h/(4π), not ±1.

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the eigenvalues. Because when I computed the determinant, I got a² = (ħ²/4), so a = ± ħ/2. But c is h/(4π), and ħ = h/(2π), so ħ/2 = (h/(2π)) / 2 = h/(4π). So a = ± h/(4π). So the real parts are ± h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero.

So the eigenvalues are real, and their real parts are ± h/(4π), and the imaginary parts are zero. So looking at the options, none of them seem to directly match this. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: Im(a) are ±2πh, Re(a) ± h/(4π). No, because Im(a) would be zero, not ±2πh. So A is wrong.

Option B: Im(a) ±1/2, Re(a) ±1. No, because a is ± h/(4π), which is a real number. So B is also incorrect.

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Hmm. Since A is the angular momentum operator, A² would be the square of the vector operator. The eigenfunctions of the components (like Ay) are not eigenfunctions of other components (like Az) unless they are simultaneous eigenfunctions, which requires specific conditions. However, they are eigenfunctions of A². So option C could be correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given. Hmm. The eigenfunctions are the basis vectors (like the eigenvectors) for the matrix representation of Ay. So D would be correct.

Wait, but let's think about option C. If Ay and A² share the same eigenfunctions, which they might. Because A² is scalar in spin space for spin-½ particles (since A² = (ħ/2)^2 I, for spin-½ particles). So the eigenfunctions of A² are any vectors, but the eigenfunctions of Ay are specific. So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A². Because A² is a multiple of the identity, so any vector is an eigenfunction with eigenvalue (ħ/2)^2.

But for Az, the eigenfunctions are different. So option C says that phi can be an eigenfunction of A², but not of Az. That makes sense because Ay and Az don't share eigenfunctions in general.

So if option C is correct, then the statement is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenfunctions form a basis for the vector space. So D is correct as well.

Wait, but looking back, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So yes, because for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors form a basis (assuming they are not degenerate, which they are in this case).

Wait, but in this case, the eigenvalues are ± a0, so the eigenvectors are orthogonal and would form an orthonormal basis. So option D is correct.

Hmm, but looking back, in the problem statement, which of the options is correct.

Wait, the question is about the statements made during the calculation.

So, for each option, which is correct.

Option C: eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. Since A² is a scalar, any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So if phi is an eigenfunction of Ay, then it's automatically an eigenfunction of A². So yes, that's correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis for the space the matrix acts on.

So both options C and D could be correct, but let me read the options again.

Wait, the options are given as possible statements made during the calculation. So I need to see which one is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps only one option is correct.

Wait, but let's think about the options again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are also eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

As I thought earlier, since A² is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, any vector is an eigenfunction of A². So yes, phi is also an eigenfunction of A². And since Ay and Az don't commute, their eigenfunctions are different. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Well, the matrix is 2x2, so its eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

Hmm, but the question is which statement is correct during the calculation.

Wait, the question says, which statement below will you consider to be correct?

Looking at the options, let's evaluate each.

Option A: The eigenvalues' imaginary parts are ±2πh etc. No, because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, because a is ± h/(4π), which is a real number.

Option C: Correct, as discussed.

Option D: Correct, as the eigenvectors form a basis.

So both options C and D are correct. But looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the problem allows only one correct option. Let me re-examine.

Wait, the matrix Ay is 2x2 and has two eigenvalues (each with multiplicity one, I think). So the eigenvectors are orthogonal and can form a basis. So D is correct.

But let's go back. The question is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Option D says: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Hmm. The matrix operator is 2x2, and the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) are the basis vectors for the space. So D is correct.

So perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, only one can be selected.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. But option C could also be correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check my earlier reasoning.

Wait, for option C, the eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A². Since A² is (S·S) scaled by c². Wait, no, wait, A is c times S. So A^2 is c² S^2.

Wait, for spin-½ particles, S^2 is ( (ħ/2)^2 ) times the identity matrix. So A^2 is (c²) * ( (ħ/2)^2 I ) ? Let me compute that.

Wait, c is h/(4π) = ħ/(2). So c² is (ħ²)/(4).

So A^2 = (ħ²/4) * S^2.

What's S^2? Since S is the Pauli matrix sigma_y, S squared would be I, the identity matrix. Because sigma matrices satisfy sigma_i^2 = I for each i.

So S^2 = I.

Thus, A^2 = (ħ²/4) I.

Therefore, any vector is an eigenfunction of A^2 with eigenvalue (ħ²/4).

So phi, an eigenfunction of Ay, is also an eigenfunction of A^2. So option C is correct.

So both C and D are correct statements? But the options are given as four separate possibilities, and the question is which is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the problem statement, the options are to choose the correct one during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps only D is correct. Because the eigenfunctions are the basis functions, which is the case. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps C is correct because it correctly states a relationship between Ay and A².

But the options are presented as four options, and only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute eigenvectors to see option D.

The eigenvectors of Ay are the eigenvectors of the matrix Ay. So for a 2x2 matrix, you have two eigenvectors (possibly complex), which can form a basis. So option D states that the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the operator. So D is correct.

Thus, options C and D are both correct statements.

But looking at the options, option C says the functions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az. Which is correct because A² is a scalar, so any function is an eigenfunction. So C is correct.

Hmm, but the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

Looking back, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the calculation process. Which statement is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A) The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real.

B) Im parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No.

C) The eigenvectors can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. Correct.

D) The eigenvectors are the basis functions of Ay. Correct.

Hmm. So which of these options are correct.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering D.

Wait, the statement in D is: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix operator is represented in the standard basis, which for 2x2 matrices is the basis of standard basis vectors. So the eigenfunctions (eigenvectors) form a basis for the operator's space. So D is correct.

Thus, both C and D are correct? But the options are likely to have only one correct. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the statement in D is incorrect. Because the basis functions are the standard basis vectors, not necessarily the eigenvectors. Wait, no, the eigenvectors can form a basis, but they might not be the standard basis. So option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Which I think is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

So I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps considering the options, option D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me think about the problem again. So the eigenvalues are ±h/(4π), and the eigenvectors are orthogonal. So the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, so D is correct.

So the statements that are correct during the calculation would be option D.

But now, looking back at the problem, the options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another approach is to compute the eigenvectors and see if they align with the standard basis.

So, for a= h/(4π), the eigenvector equation is Ay φ = a φ.

The matrix Ay is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

So, for a = h/(4π), the equation is:

[ [0, -i h/(4π) ] [x]   = [ h/(4π) x ]
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] [y]     [ h/(4π) y ] ]

Which gives the system:

0 * x - i h/(4π) y = a x → -i (h/(4π)) y = (h/(4π)) x → -i y = x

i (h/(4π)) x + 0 * y = (h/(4π)) y → i x = y

So, from the first equation: x = -i y.

Substituting into the second equation: i (-i y) = y → (i)(-i) y = y → (1) y = y → which holds.

So, the eigenvectors for a = h/(4π) are of the form y [ -i y, y ]^T, which is y [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly, for a = -h/(4π), the eigenvectors would be [ i, 1 ]^T, perhaps.

Wait, no, let me check.

For a = -h/(4π), the equations would be:

- h/(4π) x - i h/(4π) y = 0 → -x -i y = 0 → x = -i y.

i h/(4π) x + (- h/(4π)) y = 0 → i x - y = 0 → substituting x = -i y → i (-i y) - y = 0 → (1)y - y = 0 → 0=0.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [ -i y, y ]^T. So, the eigenvectors are proportional to [ -i, 1 ]^T for a = h/(4π), and for a = -h/(4π), perhaps proportional to [ i, 1 ]^T.

So, the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ]^T and [ i, 1 ]^T, which are orthogonal.

These vectors form a basis for the vector space, so D is correct.

So both options C and D are correct. But the problem is a multiple-choice, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, option C is correct because the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A².

Wait, but which option is correct.

The question is:

Which statement will you consider to be correct during the calculation?

So, perhaps statement C is correct.

But why.

Well, during the calculation, when you find the eigenfunctions, you realize that they are eigenfunctions of A² (since A² is a multiple of identity and thus any vector is an eigenfunction), but they are not eigenfunctions of Az, since Az is another component and doesn't share eigenvectors with Ay.

So statement C is correct.

Thus, the correct answer is D or C.

Wait, but according to the options, option D is that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the matrix is 2x2, its eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

Hmm. This is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look at the number of options and the structure of the problem.

Looking at the options, option D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. Since the eigenvectors form a basis, which is correct, so D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct statement is option D.

Wait, but the problem is about which statement is correct during the calculation.

Well, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm not entirely certain. I think I've spent enough time thinking through this, and perhaps I should make a decision.

I think the correct answer is option D.


The problem involves determining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y \), which is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \).
   - Substituting \( A_y = c \cdot S \), the matrix \( A_y \) becomes:
     \[
     A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 
     0 & -i \\ 
     i & 0 
     \end{bmatrix}.
     \]
   - The eigenvalues are determined to be \( a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), which are real numbers. The imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are zero.

2. **Option A:**
   - This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \) and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are purely real, not complex.

3. **Option B:**
   - This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).

4. **Option C:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) is a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for a spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particle, meaning any vector is an eigenfunction of \( A^2 \). However, the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \) due to the commutation relations between \( A_y \) and \( A_z \).

5. **Option D:**
   - This option states that the eigenfunctions \( \phi \) of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors of \( A_y \) form an orthonormal basis for the 2-dimensional vector space on which \( A_y \) acts.

### Conclusion:
Both options C and D are correct statements. However, since the question asks for the statement considered correct during the calculation, the most relevant choice is **D**, as it directly relates to the basis of the matrix operator \( A_y \).

ANSWER: D
