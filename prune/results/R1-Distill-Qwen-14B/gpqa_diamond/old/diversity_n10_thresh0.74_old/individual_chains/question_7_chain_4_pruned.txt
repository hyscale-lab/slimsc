Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about gamma-ray annihilation. Hmm, I remember that gamma-rays can interact with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. The question is about finding the energy at which the lifetime of gamma-rays is limited by this annihilation process. 

I think the process in question is gamma + gamma → e+ + e-. Right, so this is a pair production via two photons. The CMB photons are low energy, around 1e-3 eV each. So the average photon energy is given, which might be important for calculating the cross-section or the interaction rate.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I remember something about the optical depth or the mean free path. The lifetime of the gamma-ray would be determined by how often it interacts—so if the interaction rate is high, the gamma can't travel far before annihilating, thus its lifetime is limited.

The mean lifetime τ is related to the interaction probability. The mean free path λ is the inverse of the interaction rate (nσv), where n is the number density of the target photons, σ is the cross-section, and v is the relative velocity. So τ would be λ multiplied by some factor, maybe involving the speed of light or something. Or perhaps τ is just λ times the velocity, or something like that. Hmm, not entirely sure, but let's think.

The interaction rate Γ is the cross-section multiplied by the target density and velocity. The lifetime τ is 1/Γ. So τ = 1/(n σ v). But wait, for photon interactions, since both photons are moving, but in the case of high-energy gamma-rays interacting with CMB photons, which are low energy, perhaps the approximation is that the CMB photons are stationary from the gamma's frame? Or maybe not. Not sure, but perhaps the cross-section formula will account for the relative energies.

The cross-section for two-photon annihilation into electron-positron pairs is given by some formula. I think it's proportional to σ ~ (α^2 / (s)) * something, where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Oh wait, the cross-section for γγ → e+ e- is given by the formula σ = (8 π α^2)/(s) when s is much larger than m_e^2, where m_e is the electron mass. Oh, right, because at high energies, the electron mass becomes negligible compared to the photon energies, so the cross-section simplifies.

So s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. For two photons, s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since photons are massless, their energy equals their momentum times c, so E = pc. So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 = 0? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait no, because for two colliding photons, the square of their four-momentum is s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since E1 = p1 c, E2 = p2 c, and if the photons are moving in opposite directions (which they are in the case of the CMB, which is isotropic), then p1 and p2 are opposite in direction. Let me think. Let's say photon 1 has
