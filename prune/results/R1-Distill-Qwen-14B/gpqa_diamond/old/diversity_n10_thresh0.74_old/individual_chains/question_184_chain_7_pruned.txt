Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound using benzene as the starting material. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to understand the structure of the target. Benzene ring with substituents: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. The positions are 1, 2, and 3. Wait, numbering: the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 1. Wait, wait. Let me draw it mentally. If it's 2-(tert-butyl), that's position 2. 1-ethoxy is position 1, and 3-nitro is position 3. So, the substituents are at positions 1, 2, and 3 on the benzene ring, each in adjacent positions. So, the substituents are meta to each other? Or is that not possible because with three substituents, their positions would be adjacent in a 1,2,3 arrangement.

Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 1, 2, 3 are adjacent, making them a meta arrangement? No, wait, if you have substituents on 1,2,3, that would be adjacent, meaning each substituent is next to the other. So, maybe it's a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene.

Now, the synthesis steps. I need to figure out the order of reactions that would add these groups in the correct positions. Since each substituent is in a specific position, the order of addition matters because each step will determine where the next group goes, based on directing effects.

Benzene is the starting material. So, the first substitution will add the first group. Let's think about each substituent and their directing effects.

The substituents in the target are:

1. Ethoxy (OCH2CH3): This is an activating group and an ortho/para director.

2. tert-Butyl: This is a bulky alkyl group, which is a deactivating (due to being electron-donating via induction but bulky) and an ortho/para director.

Wait, no. Wait, alkyl groups are activating (since they donate electrons through sigma bonds)
