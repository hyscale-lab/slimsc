Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, right, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in a crystal lattice, which is important in things like X-ray diffraction.

Alright, the given data is: interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. So the crystal is rhombohedral, which means all edges are equal, and all angles are the same. I remember that in a rhombohedral structure, a = b = c, and alpha = beta = gamma. So that's helpful because maybe the formulas are simpler here.

I need to find the interplanar distance d for the (111) plane. I remember that the formula for interplanar distance in a crystal is given by the Bragg's law-related formula. Wait, no, Bragg's law is for diffraction, but the formula for d is based on the unit cell parameters.

Wait, the general formula for interplanar distance is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) * (cos^2(alpha)/ (1 - cos^2(alpha))) ) ), but wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh, wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. For a cubic crystal, the formula is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But for non-cubic systems, especially rhombohedral, the formula must include the angles.

Oh right, the general formula for d is:

d_{hkl} = \frac{a}{\sqrt{ (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk \cos\gamma + hl \cos\beta + kl \cos\alpha) } }

But wait, in a rhombohedral system, all angles are equal, so alpha, beta, gamma are the same. So for a rhombohedral structure, the formula simplifies a bit.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. In a rhombohedral system
