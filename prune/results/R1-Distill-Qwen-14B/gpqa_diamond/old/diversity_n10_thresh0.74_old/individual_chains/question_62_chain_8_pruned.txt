Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to synthesis pathways, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a series of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

First, let me try to understand the structure of the target. The name is a bit complicated. Breaking it down: cyclohexanecarbaldehyde means a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, the substituent is at position 1, which is the cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that part is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group, which in turn is attached to the cyclohexane ring at the same carbon as the formyl group.

Wait, so the structure would look something like this: the cyclohexane ring has a CHO group and a -CH2-OH-cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon. So, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH).

Hmm, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, I need to get to that target. Let me think about the possible reactions.

I remember that ethynyl groups can undergo various additions. Also, cyclohexane rings can undergo hydrogenation, oxidation, reductions, etc.

Looking at the target molecule, there's a formyl group, which suggests an aldehyde. Also, there's a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible steps involved. Let's list what needs to happen:

1. The ethynyl group (C≡CH) needs to be modified. One common reaction for alkynes is hydroboration, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe a hydration reaction?

Wait, another approach: The ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a ketone. Because when you have an alkyne, under certain conditions, it can be converted into a ketone via hydration. For example, using mercury(II) sulfate and sulfuric acid (H2SO4, HgSO4)
