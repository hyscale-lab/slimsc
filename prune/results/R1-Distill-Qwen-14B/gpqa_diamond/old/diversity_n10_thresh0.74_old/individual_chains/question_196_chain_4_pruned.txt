Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so I need to think about how relativity affects the system.

The question asks for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A to D, each with different formulas. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a classical oscillator, the maximum speed would be v = sqrt(kA²/m), right? That's option C. But wait, since this is relativistic, I can't use the classical formula directly. I need to consider relativistic effects.

Relativistic effects come into play when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the energy equations must include relativistic terms. The total energy in relativity is given by E = gamma mc², where gamma is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In a harmonic oscillator, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. In the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², assuming the maximum displacement is A. Wait, but in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't (1/2)mv²; it's gamma mc² - mc². So the total energy at maximum displacement (x=A) would be the sum of the potential energy and the rest energy.

Wait, no. Let me think.
