Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember from my astronomy class that the Lyman alpha line is important here. Let me think through this.

So the question says that these clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstroms. Wait, that's like in the ultraviolet range, right? Because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is UV. But wait, the question is about detecting them with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh, right, because the atmosphere absorbs a lot of UV light, so ground-based telescopes can't see that wavelength directly. So the quasar's Lyman alpha emission must be redshifted into the optical range for us to observe it.

Wait, but wait. The clouds themselves are absorbing at Lyman alpha. So the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen in the clouds absorbs at 1216 Angstroms. But when the quasar's light reaches us, if the cloud is at a high redshift, that absorption line would be shifted into optical wavelengths. So we can detect it if the redshift is such that the absorbed wavelength comes into the visible range.

I think the key here is to find the minimum redshift where the Lyman alpha absorption line (1216 Angstroms) is shifted into the range observable by optical telescopes. But wait, what's the visible range? I think the visible spectrum starts around 400 nm (violet) up to about 700 nm (red). So we need the redshifted wavelength to be at least 400 nm or longer, so that it's in the visible range.

So the formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. Or wait, sometimes it's written as observed wavelength = rest * (1 + z). So if the rest wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, and the observed wavelength needs to be at least 400 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms (since 1 nm is 10 Angstroms). Wait, 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms? Wait, no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. Oh wait, that's right because 1 nm = 10 Angstroms. So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the UV.

So we want to find the smallest z such that 1216*(1+z) >= 4000 Angstroms. Wait, wait, 4000 Angstroms is 400 nm, which is the start of the visible spectrum (violet). So if the observed wavelength is longer, it moves into optical.

Let me set up the equation:

obs_wavelength = rest_wavelength * (1 + z)
We need obs_wavelength >= 4000 Angstroms (400 nm)
So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)
Solving for z:

(1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ ?

Let me compute that. 1216 multiplied by 3 is 3648, which is about 3.6 thousand. 4000-3648 is 352. So 3 times 1.2, but wait, 1216 * 3.29 is about 4000? Let's compute 1216 * 3.29.

Wait, 1216 *3 = 3648. 1216 *0.29 is approximately 1216 *0.3 = 364.8, so 3648 + 364.8 = 4012.8. So 3.29 would give around 4012.8, which is just over 4000. So (1+z) is approximately 3.29, so z is about 2.29.

Wait, so z ≈ 2.29. So the minimal redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is a bit higher, but our calculation is 2.29. Option D is 1.9, which is lower than that. Wait, but wait, the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So the minimal z is when the observed wavelength is just 4000 Angstroms. So any higher observed wavelength (i.e., higher z) would still be in the optical. So the minimal z is around 2.29. So the lower limit is z=2.29, so objects with z higher than that can be detected. Wait, but the question is phrased as the lower limit on the redshift such that they can be detected. So perhaps I got it backwards.

Wait, no. The cloud is at redshift z. The quasar's light is passing through the cloud, which imprints an absorption line at 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms. For that line to be in the optical, 1216*(1+z) must be less than about 7000 Angstroms (since optical goes up to ~700 nm or 7000 Angstroms). Wait, no, the quasar's emission is at 1216, but the absorption would be at the same rest wavelength. Wait, no, no. Wait, the quasar emits light, and the hydrogen in the cloud absorbs at the rest wavelength (1216 Angstroms). So the quasar's light that's not absorbed reaches us, but the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z) because the cloud is at redshift z. So the quasar's light is redshifted, but the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z).

Wait, perhaps I should think of it in terms of when the Lyman alpha line is redshifted into the visible range. So the minimal z is when the Lyman alpha line is just entering the visible (400 nm or 4000 Angstroms). So then, as before, z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.29) -1 = 2.29.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the redshift has to be at least approximately 2.29 for the absorption line to be in the visible. So the lower limit is z ≈ 2.29. Looking at the options, the closest is C) 2.4, which is a bit higher. But the question asks for the lower limit, so any z higher than that would suffice. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29. So the options given are A:3, B:1.2, C:2.4, D:1.9.

Wait, but wait another thing. Wait, the quasar's emission is at a higher redshift than the cloud. Because the cloud is in front of the quasar, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Wait, no—no, the cloud is in the line of sight, so the cloud is at a lower redshift than the quasar. Because the quasar is behind the cloud, so when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the cloud is at a lower redshift. Wait, that's a point. So the cloud's redshift is such that it's lower than the quasar's. So when we observe the quasar, the Lyman alpha absorption line from the cloud is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). The quasar itself is at a higher redshift than the cloud.

But perhaps the question is asking the minimal redshift for the cloud such that the Lyman alpha line is in the optical. So when z_cloud is high enough, the line is in the optical. So our calculation is correct.

So the minimal z is about 2.29. So the options are C) 2.4, which is a bit higher than 2.29, but D is 1.9, which is lower, so wouldn't be sufficient. So the lower limit is approximately 2.29, so the minimal z is just above 2.29. So among the options, the closest is C: 2.4. But wait, why isn't there a lower option around 2.2 or 2.3?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Compute 4000 / 1216 = ?

1216 * 3 = 3648.

4000 - 3648 = 352.

352 / 1216 = 0.289 approx.

So 3 + 0.289 = 3.289. So 1+z = 3.289 → z = 2.289.

Approximately 2.29.

So possible options, the closest is C) 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is just above 2.29, so the minimal z is 2.29. But the options don't have 2.29. So perhaps the next higher option is 2.4, which would be the minimal, but maybe the question expects the answer to be 2.4 as the lower limit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumptions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud, but the quasar itself is at a higher redshift. So the Lyman alpha line of the quasar is redshifted into optical. Wait no, the quasar emits the Lyman alpha line, but if the quasar is at a high redshift, then its own Lyman alpha emission would be redshifted into optical. But the question says that the clouds absorb the quasar's light at Lyman alpha. So the absorption line is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So if the cloud's redshift is high enough, that line enters the optical.

So if the cloud's z is such that 1216*(1+z) is in the optical (>=4000 Angstroms), then we can see the absorption line. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1+z) = 4000 → z≈2.29.

So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. But the options don't have that. The options are 1.9, 2.4, etc. So perhaps the answer is 2.4 as the minimal. Because with z_cloud=2.4, the observed wavelength is 1216 * 3.4 ≈ 4134 Angstroms (413.4 nm), which is violet, visible. So yes, that's within optical. If the cloud were at z=2.29, 1216*3.29≈4000, which is exactly violet. So the lower limit is z=2.29, so any higher z is possible. So the minimal z is 2.29. But the options have 2.4 as the closest higher option. So the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift, so the cloud's z must be at least 2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29. So the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is C) 2.4.

Wait, but let me check. What if the observed wavelength must be less than 7000 Angstroms (the end of optical, which is red)? No, because the absorption line's position depends on z. Wait, perhaps the question has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms. To be observed in the optical (say, 4000 to 7000 Angstroms), then 4000 <= 1216*(1+z) <=7000.

So solving for z:

4000 <=1216*(1+z) → 1+z >=4000/1216≈3.29 → z>=2.29.

So the minimal z is 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, so any object with z >=2.29 can be detected. So the question is asking for the lower limit, so the minimal z is 2.29. Looking at options, the nearest is 2.4 (option C) or 1.9 (option D). But 1.9 is lower than 2.29, which would not be sufficient. So the correct answer must be option C)2.4, as it's the first option above 2.29.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the rest wavelength. Wait, the Lyman alpha line is emitted by the hydrogen in the cloud. The quasar's light passes through the cloud, and the cloud's hydrogen absorbs at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame. So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1+z_cloud). So the minimal z_cloud is 2.29.

So the answer is option C)2.4.

Wait, but another way: perhaps I should use the formula for when the Lyman alpha line is in the observed optical. Let's think about the quasar's emission line. If the quasar's Lyman alpha emission is at 1216 Angstroms, but when observed, it's at 1216*(1+z_quasar). But in this case, it's the absorption line that's in question, not the emission. So the cloud is at z_cloud, and the absorption occurs at 1216*(1+z_cloud).

But perhaps I should think about the quasar's emission line. If the quasar is at a higher redshift, then its Lyman alpha emission would be redshifted into the optical. Wait, but the question says the absorption is at Lyman alpha wavelength, which is 1216 Angstroms. So that's from the cloud, not the quasar. So the cloud's z affects the absorption line.

I think the calculation is correct. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is that. Since the options don't have 2.29, the next higher option is C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption line at 1216 Angstroms can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to calculate the minimum redshift \( z \) required for the absorption line to shift into the visible spectrum (4000–7000 Angstroms). 

The relationship between the observed wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \)), the rest wavelength (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} \)), and the redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

For the Lyman alpha line (\( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) to be observed in the visible spectrum, we set \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \geq 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (the start of the visible range). Solving for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

Substituting \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \) and \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \):

\[
z = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the minimum redshift required is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value greater than 2.29 is \( z = 2.4 \). Lower values, such as \( z = 1.9 \), would result in the absorption line remaining in the ultraviolet, which cannot be detected by optical ground-based telescopes.

Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift for the neutral hydrogen clouds to be detected is \( z = 2.4 \).
