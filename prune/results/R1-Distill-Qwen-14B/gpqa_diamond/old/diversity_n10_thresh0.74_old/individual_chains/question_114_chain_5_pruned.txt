Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction starts with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to select the correct reagents from the given options.

Hmm. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. When a ketone reacts with something like cyanide, it's probably an addition reaction. But wait, what kind of conditions are needed for that? Oh right, in the presence of an acid catalyst, maybe?

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN, which is a source of CN- ions. But if it's just a simple addition, I think the cyanide would attack the carbonyl carbon. But wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the product structure. The formula would be (CH3)C(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, I think it's actually (CH3)2C(OH)CH2CN? No, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it adds CN-, the product would have the CN attached to the same carbon as the ketone's carbonyl. So the product after adding CN would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN? Or maybe it's (CH3)2C(CN)OH? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the reaction is butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write down the structures.

Butan-2-one: (CH3)2CO.

Adding CN- would probably add to the carbonyl, so the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, because the carbonyl O becomes OH after the addition. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbut
