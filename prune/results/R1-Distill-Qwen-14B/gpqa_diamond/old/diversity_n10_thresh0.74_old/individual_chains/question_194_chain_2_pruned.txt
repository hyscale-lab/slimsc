Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where E is the energy of each state. Each spin can be either +1 or -1, right?

Wait, the spins are S1, S2, S3, each ±1. So the total number of possible states is 2^3 =8. Oh, but wait, no, each spin is independent, so yeah, 8 states in total.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. So I need to compute E for each of the 8 possible states and then calculate the sum of exp(-βE) for each state.

But maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8. Because some states will have the same energy. So maybe group them by the value of S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Let me think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Each S_i S_j term is either +1 or -1. Because each S_i is ±1, so their product is ±1.

Wait, no, actually, when two spins are the same, their product is +1. If different, -1. So each term S_i S_j is ±1.

So the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can vary. Let me consider all possibilities.

Let me denote the sum as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

So each term is ±1, so H can be 3 (all +1), 1, -1, or -3.

Wait, is that possible? Let me see. Let's think about all possible combinations.

Wait, suppose all three spins are the same. Like all +1 or all -1.

If S1=S2=S3=+1:
Each product term is +1. So H=3.

Similarly, if all are -1, then each product is (+1), so H=3 again.

Wait, because (-1)(-1)=1, so same as when all are +1
