Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to break this down.

Alright, the problem says that the ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, wait. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s, right? Because in inertial frames, the relative velocity is the same but opposite.

But the question is about how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, time is different in different frames because of time dilation, right? Because if I'm in the ejecta's frame, time might pass differently compared to the Galaxy's frame.

So in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame during that same interval? Because the distance the ejecta travels depends on the Galaxy's frame's time.

Wait, I remember that the time experienced in one frame is related to the other via the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). But what's v here? The relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, v is 60,000 km/s. Let's convert that to meters per second for easier calculations. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 * 1e3 m/s = 6e7 m/s. Wait, but the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So 6e7 is 0.2 times c, because 3e8 divided by 6e7 is 5. So v is 0.2c? Wait, 6e7 is 60 million m/s, and c is 3e8, so yes, 0.2c.

So v is 0.2c. The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me calculate that. v² is (0.2c)^2 = 0.04 c². So 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. Square root of 0.96 is about sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.98. Wait, more accurately, let me compute sqrt(0.96). Hmm, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is approximately 1.0203. So gamma is roughly 1.0203.

Wait, but wait. The time in the Galaxy's frame would be longer than the ejecta's frame because from the ejecta's perspective, the Galaxy is moving towards it, and the time it takes for the event to happen would be longer. So in the Galaxy's frame, the time t would be gamma multiplied by the ejecta's frame time t'.

So t = gamma * t' ≈ 1.0203 * 50 s ≈ 51.015 seconds.

But wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The time t' is the proper time in the ejecta's frame. So the Galaxy's frame will see the time as longer. So the distance the ejecta travels is velocity multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. Because the Galaxy sees the ejecta moving at v (60,000 km/s) for a longer duration.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. No, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v (60,000 km/s) towards the center. So the distance it travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by the time t in the Galaxy's frame. And t is gamma multiplied by t'.

So the distance d is v * t = v * gamma * t'.

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers.

v = 60,000 km/s.

t' = 50 s.

gamma ≈ 1.0203.

So t = gamma * t' ≈ 1.0203 * 50 = 51.015 s.

Then d = 60,000 km/s * 51.015 s.

Wait, calculating that: 60,000 * 51.015 = Let's compute 60,000 *50=3,000,000, and 60,000*1.015=60,900. So total is 3,060,900 km.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. That's close. But wait, I approximated gamma as 1.0203. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v = 0.2c, so v^2 = 0.04 c². c is 3e8 m/s, but when computing the actual gamma, perhaps I should calculate it precisely.

v = 6e7 m/s. Let's compute v²/c²: (6e7)^2 / (3e8)^2 = (3.6e15)/(9e16) = 0.4e-1 = 0.04.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96. sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9797959. So 1 / 0.9797959 ≈ 1.020305.

So gamma is about 1.020305.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.020305 * 50 ≈ 51.01525 seconds.

Then d = v * t = 6e7 m/s * 51.01525 s.

Wait, wait. Wait, 6e7 m/s is 60,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s * 51.01525 s = 60,000 *51.01525.

Let me compute 60000 *51 = 3,060,000.

Then 60000 *0.01525 = 915.

So total is 3,060,000 + 915 = 3,060,915 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) 3,060,000 km. But wait, the options might be using a more precise calculation or perhaps I made a mistake in considering the frame.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me approach this differently. Maybe I should consider the time dilation correctly. Another approach: If in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass, how much time passes in the Galaxy's frame?

In the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So the time experienced in the Galaxy's frame would be longer due to time dilation.

Wait, but wait. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (departure and arrival) happen at the same place. So in which frame is the proper time? Hmm.

Wait, the events are: the front of the ejecta (or whatever) leaves the supernova and then arrives at the point 50 seconds later in the ejecta frame. Wait, no, perhaps I should think of it as the time between two events at the same place in the ejecta frame. So the proper time is the ejecta's frame time t', which is 50 s.

So the time in the Galaxy's frame is t = gamma * t' = 1.020305 * 50 ≈ 51.01525 s.

So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is v multiplied by t. So v is 60,000 km/s, t is 51.01525 s.

So d = 60,000 *51.01525 = 3,060,915 km.

Looking at the options, D is 3,060,000 km. Which is very close. So I think the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into not considering relativity and just using v*t, but that would give 60,000 *50 =3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that's not considering time dilation.

But the question says both are inertial frames, so relativity effects apply. So the correct answer must account for gamma.

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up which frame is which. Let me think again. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving away at 60,000 km/s. So when the ejecta's clock shows 50 seconds, how much time has passed in the Galaxy's frame?

Alternatively, perhaps using length contraction. Wait, no, the distance is the same. Hmm.

Wait another approach: the proper length here is the distance between the supernova and the center of the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. Wait, but the problem doesn't give that. Oh, wait, no, the problem is asking how much distance the ejecta has moved in the Galaxy's frame during the time that 50 seconds have passed in the ejecta's frame.

So the distance is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. And the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer because of time dilation.

So yeah, I think the calculation is correct, leading to approximately 3,060,915 km, which is closest to option D: 3,060,000 km.


To solve the problem, we analyze the relative motion and time dilation between the ejecta and the Galaxy. The ejecta and the Galaxy are inertial frames, and the relative velocity between them is \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.2c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. The goal is to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Time Dilation**:  
   In special relativity, time dilation is governed by the Lorentz factor:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0203
   \]  
   The time in the Galaxy's frame is related to the time in the ejecta's frame by:  
   \[
   t = \gamma \cdot t'
   \]  
   Substituting \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   t = 1.0203 \cdot 50 \approx 51.015 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled**:  
   In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at a constant velocity \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \). The distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame is:  
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]  
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.015 \, \text{s} \):  
   \[
   d = 60,000 \cdot 51.015 \approx 3,060,915 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated distance \( d \approx 3,060,915 \, \text{km} \) is closest to option D, \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). Other options are either too low or too high.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).
