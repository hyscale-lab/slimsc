Okay, so I have this question about gene mutations and their effects on a protein, I think. Let's see what the problem is. 

So the scenario is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible for making this compound, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the compound. The idea is that if the gene is mutated, the compound won't be synthesized, making the barley usable for food.

The question gives the intact gene sequence and four mutant sequences. I need to figure out which mutation is likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. Probably, the mutation disrupts the gene's function, maybe by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences, I should compare each mutant with the intact gene. Let me write down the sequences:

Intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Hmm, compared to the intact gene, the first part seems to have a change. Let me look at the nucleotides. The intact gene has 'TTT' in the beginning, while Mutant 1 has 'TTCT'—wait, no, wait. Let's see: the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’ 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to line them up. Let me see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA
Wait, actually, maybe I should look for where the mutations are.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact differences. Let me compare each position:

The first part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG... 

Wait, I think the first few nucleotides are different. Let's see:

Intact starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAA...

So, the first part: the intact has TTTCTC, but Mutant 1 has TCTACG.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the sequences step by step.

Looking at the first part:

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTC TAC G
