Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, let me try to think through it. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their density doesn't change with distance. So, they're spread out evenly in all directions.

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. Parallax is a measure of distance, right? I remember that the parallax angle (in parsecs) is inversely proportional to the distance of a star. So, if a star is at distance d parsecs, its parallax p is 1/d. That means lower parallax means farther away.

Now, the problem is asking about the number of stars per unit change in parallax. I think this relates to how many stars you would observe in a thin shell of space that's a certain change in parallax. Let me visualize this. Imagine you have a small change in parallax, dp. Each star that has a parallax between p and p + dp would lie on a spherical shell with a radius corresponding to p and p + dp.

Wait, but wait. Parallax p is 1/d, so if p changes by dp, then the radius changes by dr. Let me think about the relationship. So, p = 1/d → dp = -1/d² dd. Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to get into calculus here. Maybe I can approach it more simply.

If stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. So, the number of stars in a certain volume increases with the volume. The volume of a spherical shell at radius d with thickness dd is approximately 4πd² dd. So, the number of stars in this shell would be the number density (n) multiplied by the volume, which is n * 4πd² dd.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit change in parallax (dp). So, I need to express this in terms of p. Since p = 1/d, then dp = -1/d² dd → dd = -d² dp. But the negative sign just indicates the direction, so I can ignore it for magnitude. So, dd = (1/p²) dp.

Substituting back into the volume expression, the volume is 4πd² dd. But d = 1/p, so d² is (1/p²). And dd is (1/p²) dp. So,

Volume = 4π * (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ) = 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number of stars in a shell with parallax between p and p+dp is n * Volume, which is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp.

Wait, but wait. The number per unit parallax would be (number of stars) / (dp). So, (n *4π (1/p^4) dp) ) / dp = 4πn (1/p^4). So the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option A is ~1/plx^4, which would be the case. But let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go through it again.

Parallax p = 1/d → d = 1/p.

The volume of a thin shell at radius d is 4πd² dd. Since dd is the change in radius, and d = 1/p, then dd = (d/dp) (1/p) ) dp. The derivative of 1/p with respect to p is -1/p². So, dd = (-1/p²) dp. But the negative just indicates that as p increases, d decreases. So, the magnitude is (1/p²) dp.

So, the volume is 4πd² dd = 4π*(1/p)^2 * (1/p² dp) ) → 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number of stars in that shell is n * 4π (1/p^4) dp. So the number per unit parallax (dp) is 4π n (1/p^4). So the number per unit parallax is proportional to 1/p^4. Which would mean the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with 1/plx^4.

Wait, but wait. The question is phrased as the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, if you have a small range dp, the number of stars in that range is proportional to (1/p^4) * dp. So per unit dp, that's (1/p^4). So the number decreases as 1/p^4.

That would suggest the correct answer is A) ~1/plx^4.

But wait, another approach: think about the number density. Since number density n is constant, the number in a volume is n * volume. The volume at distance d with thickness dd is 4π d² dd. So, the number of stars in that thin shell is n * 4π d² dd. But d = 1/p, so d² = 1/p², and dd = (1/p²) dp. So substituting, it's n *4π (1/p²) * (1/p² dp) ) = n 4π (1/p^4) dp.

So, the number per unit parallax (dp) is n 4 π (1/p^4). So, the number per unit range of parallax is inversely proportional to p^4.

So, the correct answer is option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning their number density is constant. Parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = 1/d \). For a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dd \), the volume is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). The number of stars in this shell is proportional to the product of the number density \( n \) and the volume, giving \( n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \).

To express this in terms of \( p \), we use \( d = 1/p \) and \( dd = (1/p^2) dp \). Substituting these into the volume expression, the number of stars in the shell becomes:

\[
n \cdot 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4} dp.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax (dp) is then:

\[
\frac{\text{Number of stars}}{dp} = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{p^4}.
\]

This shows that the number of stars per unit range of parallax is proportional to \( 1/p^4 \). Therefore, as \( p \) increases, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases with the fourth power of \( p \).

The correct answer is **A) ~1/plx^4**.
