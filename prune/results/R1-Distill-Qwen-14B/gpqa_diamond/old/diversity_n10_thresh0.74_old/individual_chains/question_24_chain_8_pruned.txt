Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question involves some reactions and mixtures. Let's read the problem again carefully.

So, we have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids. This mixture decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water can happen through addition reactions, like with alkenes or maybe some other unsaturated compounds. So, the mixture X probably contains compounds with double bonds or triple bonds that can react with Br2.

When mixture X is treated with platinum (Pt) when heated, it undergoes a reaction to form another equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids. This Y mixture doesn't decolorize bromine water. Oh, wait, but wait — the problem says it's a result of disproportionation. Disproportionation means a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So, perhaps a compound in X is undergoing disproportionation when it's treated with Pt.

Then, when both X and Y undergo hydrogenation in the presence of Pt under severe conditions, they give only one substance, hydrocarbon Z. Z is a constituent of Y and is a solvent. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Hydrogenation usually adds hydrogen across double bonds or triple bonds, turning unsaturated compounds into saturated ones.

Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, meaning it's fully saturated — no more double or triple bonds to hydrogenate. So Z must be an alkane, I think.

Let me think about the data given. The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular formula of Z. Let's say Z has a formula CnH2n+2 (since it's an alkane). The percentage by mass of hydrogen is (2n+2)/(12n + 2) * 100 = 14.28%.

Let me compute that.

Let me set up the equation:

( (2n + 2) / (12n + 2) ) * 100 = 14.28

Divide both sides by 100:

(2n + 2)/(12n + 2) = 0.1428

Multiply both sides by (12n + 2):

2n + 2 = 0.1428*(12n + 2)

Let me compute 0.1428 * 12n: 0.1428 *12 is approximately 1.7136n, and 0.1428*2 is about 0.2856.

So 2n + 2 ≈ 1.7136n + 0.2856

Subtract 1.7136n from both sides: 0.2864n + 2 ≈ 0.2856

Wait, wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 2n+2 = 0.1428*(12n +2). Let me compute 0.1428 * 12 = 1.7136, and 0.1428 *2 is 0.2856.

So,

2n + 2 = 1.7136n + 0.2856

Subtract 1.7136n from both sides:

2n -1.7136n +2 =0.2856

Which is 0.2864n +2 =0.2856

Wait, that can't be right because 0.2864n is positive, and 2 is positive, but the right side is 0.2856, which is much smaller than 2.

Wait, maybe I messed up the setup.

Wait, perhaps I should rearrange it:

2n +2 = 0.1428*(12n +2)

Multiply both sides by 10000 to eliminate decimals:

20000n +20000 =1428*(12n +2)

Calculate 1428*12n: 1428 *12 is 17136n. 1428*2 is 2856.

So,

20000n +20000 =17136n +2856

Subtract 17136n and 2856 from both sides:

20000n -17136n = 2856 - 20000

(2864n) = -17144

Wait, that gives a negative n, which can't be right. So
