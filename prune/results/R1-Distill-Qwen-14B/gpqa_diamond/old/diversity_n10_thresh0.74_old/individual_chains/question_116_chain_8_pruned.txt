Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down the information given and see if I can piece everything together.

The first part talks about Compound A, which has a proton NMR with two signals. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and the other is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the number of protons each signal represents can give clues about the structure. Also, the splitting patterns (like triplet and quartet) are due to neighboring protons.

So, 6H as a triplet at 0.9 ppm. That region (around 0.9) is typically where methyl groups (CH3) attached to something else, like maybe a CH2 group, would show up. A triplet suggests that each of these 6H is next to a CH2 group, which has two neighboring H's. So maybe it's two sets of CH2CH3 groups? Wait, but 6H would be three CH2CH3 groups because each has 2 H on the CH2. Or perhaps it's a single CH2 with two CH3 groups attached? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the structure is something where each CH3 is attached to a CH2, but that CH2 is next to another CH2, hence the triplet.

The other signal is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. A quartet (which is a quartet) would mean each of those Hs is next to a CH2 group (so each H has two neighboring Hs from another CH2). So maybe those are two CH2 groups, each adjacent to another CH2. Like perhaps a -CH2-CH2- structure. The 4H could be two CH2 groups. So putting this together, maybe Compound A is something like diethyl ether, but wait, diethyl ether's structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. The protons on the CH2 next to the oxygen would be split differently, but let me think about the NMR.

Wait, in diethyl ether, the CH2CH3 groups are split into a quartet each because of coupling with the adjacent CH2. Let me recall: diethyl ether's NMR. The CH2CH3 protons would be a quartet because each
