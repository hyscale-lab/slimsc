Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. Then, at shorter wavelengths (less than 790 nm), the flux drops a lot. I remember that quasars, being active galactic nuclei, emit a lot of radiation, sometimes with emission lines. But wait, what's the significance of the flux dropping below 790 nm?

Oh, right! The Lyman-alpha emission line is a prominent feature in quasars. The Lyman-alpha line is emitted when electrons in hydrogen atoms drop from the second energy level to the first. Its rest wavelength is about 121.6 nm. But if the flux drops at wavelengths below 790 nm, that suggests that the quasar's emission is being absorbed or not reaching us in those shorter wavelengths. Why would that happen?

Ah, intergalactic medium absorption! The intergalactic medium (IGM) at high redshifts can absorb certain wavelengths due to the so-called 'Gunn-Peterson trough'. If the quasar's emitted light includes the Lyman-alpha line, which is at 121.6 nm, but we observe it at a longer wavelength because of redshift, that indicates the quasar is at a high redshift. So the observed wavelength would be (1 + z) times the rest wavelength. But wait, if the quasar's Lyman-alpha line is observed in the near-infrared, that's much longer than the UV. So the redshift z must be significant.

Let me calculate. The observed wavelength is 790 nm. The rest wavelength is 121.6 nm. So 790 = 121.6*(1+z). Let me solve for z. 

790 / 121.6 ≈ 6.496. So 1+z ≈ 6.496 → z ≈ 5.496. So the redshift z is about 5.5. That's a high redshift object. 

Wait, but how does this relate to the comoving distance
