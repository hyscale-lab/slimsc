Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and quasars. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through hydrogen, it can get absorbed at specific wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is a prominent one. The wavelength given is about 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range, right?

The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift for these objects to be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Wait, optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet because the atmosphere absorbs it, so for the absorption to be in the optical range, the wavelength must have been redshifted into the visible spectrum.

So, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 0.1216 micrometers. Optical telescopes usually work in wavelengths from about 0.4 to 1 micrometer. So the redshifted wavelength needs to be in this range. 

The formula for redshift is z = (observed wavelength - rest wavelength) / rest wavelength. Let me write that down: z = (λ_obs - λ_rest) / λ_rest.

We want the observed wavelength to be at the lower end of optical, say 0.4 micrometers, which is 4000 Angstroms. Wait, no, that's too high. Wait, 0.4 micrometers is 40
