Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. I remember that stability constants (β) tell us how stable a complex is. Higher β means the complex is more stable.

The question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. From what I recall, the blue one is probably the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato form. Wait, no, wait. Or is it the tetrathiocyanato? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think. Oh wait, the complexes are [Co(SCN)]^n+ where n varies. So, the first complex is [CoSCN]^2+, β1=9. The second is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β2=40. Third is [Co(SCN)_3]^-, β3=63. Fourth is [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, β4=16. Hmm, so which is the blue one? I think the blue color is associated with the tetrathiocyanato complex, which is the fourth one, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−, because I remember that the color changes with the number of SCN- ligands attached. So the problem is asking about the percentage of Co(SCN)_2^2+ or maybe another? Wait, no. The question specifies "blue dithiocyanato," which I think refers to the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex because dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ligands. Or wait, maybe not. Let me double-check. Dithiocyanato would imply two SCN- groups attached. So the blue complex is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ with β2=40? Or is it another one? No, wait, I think the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is more intensely colored, maybe blue. Hmm, I might be getting this mixed up.

Wait, the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato." Dithiocyanato is two SCN groups, so the complex would be [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Wait, but I thought the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is the deep blue one. Oh, wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− as the blue one, and that's the dithiocyanato? No, that doesn't make sense. Dithiocyanato would be di, two. Oh wait, maybe the question is about the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex, which is the dithiocyanato, and the color is blue. But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, maybe the [Co(SCN)_3]^- is another color, perhaps.

Wait, perhaps the answer doesn't depend on knowing the exact color, but rather on the calculation. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex among all cobalt species. So I think I should proceed with the calculation regardless of the color, maybe the color part is a distractor.

So, the question is: given Co(II) ions and SCN-, with [Co] = 1e-2 M and [SCN-] = 0.1 M. The stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. We need to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which I think is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+.

Wait, but in terms of the overall charge, [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ would have Co^2+ plus two SCN^- (each -1 charge). So 2+ plus 2*(-1) = 0, no, wait, that can't be. Wait, Co^2+ is +2. Each SCN^- is -1. So [Co(SCN)_2]^0? No, wait, wait. No, wait, Co^2+ plus two SCN^- would be: +2 + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex would be neutral. Hmm, but the formula would be [Co(SCN)_2], right? But that doesn't have a charge. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ but that would imply Co is in +4 oxidation state, which isn't the case. Because the question says Co(II) ions. So maybe the formula is [Co(SCN)_2]^0? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{3−n}, since Co^2+ and each SCN is -1. So for n=1: [CoSCN]^+, charge is 2+ -1 = +1. For n=2: 2+ -2= 0. So [Co(SCN)_2] is neutral. For n=3: 2+ -3= -1. For n=4: 2+ -4= -2. So the complexes have charges +1, 0, -1, -2.

But regardless, I think the key is to calculate the fraction of each complex and sum to 100%, then find the percentage of the desired complex.

So, the general approach is to calculate the distribution of each complex, then sum them all and find the percentage for the desired one.

The formula for the fraction of each complex in solution is given by the stability constant and the concentrations of the ions.

The general formula for the fraction f_n of the complex with n SCN- groups is:

f_n = (β_n * [Co] * [SCN]^n ) / ( Σ (β_k [Co] [SCN]^k ) for k=0 to 4 )

Wait, but wait. The complexes are [Co(SCN)_n]^{3−n}, but [Co] here is free Co^2+.

Wait, I think the standard approach is to model the speciation using the formation of complexes step by step, considering each possible complex.

Alternatively, the formula for the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β_n [Co] [SCN]^n ) / ( [Co] + [CoSCN]^+ + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3]^- + [Co(SCN)_4]^2- )

Wait, but that denominator is the sum of all possible cobalt species.

Wait, but [Co] itself is the concentration of free Co^2+.

So the formula for the fraction f_n for the nth complex is:

f_n = (β_n [Co] [SCN]^n ) / ( [Co] + β_1 [Co][SCN] + β_2 [Co][SCN]^2 + β_3 [Co][SCN]^3 + β_4 [Co][SCN]^4 )

Because each step involves adding a SCN- to the previous complex. So for the nth complex, it's [Co(SCN)_n], and the formation constant is β_n.

So, the fraction is (β_n [Co][SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all terms from n=0 to n=4.

Wait, but [Co] here is the concentration of free Co^2+.

Wait, the initial concentration of Co is 1e-2 M. But some of it is complexed into the various complexes. So the free [Co] is less than 1e-2 M.

Hmm, that complicates things because [Co] is part of the denominator.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The formula for the fraction f_n is:

f_n = (β_n [Co][SCN]^n ) / ( K_0 + K_1 [SCN] + K_2 [SCN]^2 + K_3 [SCN]^3 + K_4 [SCN]^4 )

Where K_0 is 1 (since it's the free ion), K_1 = β_1 [Co], K_2 = β_2 [Co], etc.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model the formation step by step.

Alternatively, the fraction of each complex can be found using the expression:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / ( 1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but I think that's assuming that [Co] is 1 M, which it's not. So perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, let me think again. The total concentration of cobalt is the sum of all the species:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2−]

Which is given as 1e-2 M.

The fraction f_n is defined as [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total].

So, [Co(SCN)_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n

So, the total [Co_total] is [Co^2+] + β_1 [Co^2+][SCN^-] + β_2 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^2 + β_3 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^3 + β_4 [Co^2+][SCN^-]^4

Factor out [Co^2+] from each term:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] [ 1 + β_1 [SCN^-] + β_2 [SCN^-]^2 + β_3 [SCN^-]^3 + β_4 [SCN^-]^4 ]

So, [Co^2+] = [Co_total] / ( 1 + β_1 [SCN^-] + β_2 [SCN^-]^2 + β_3 [SCN^-]^3 + β_4 [SCN^-]^4 )

Once we have [Co^2+], we can compute each [Co(SCN)_n] as β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n.

So the fraction f_n is [Co(SCN)_n] / [Co_total] = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN^-]^n ) / [Co_total]

Substituting [Co^2+] from earlier:

f_n = (β_n [Co^2+] [SCN]^n ) / [Co_total] = (β_n * [Co_total] / ( S ) ) * [SCN]^n / [Co_total] )

Where S is the denominator: 1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4.

Wait, that's a bit confusing, but perhaps let's write it as:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n ) / S

Where S = 1 + β_1 [SCN] + β_2 [SCN]^2 + β_3 [SCN]^3 + β_4 [SCN]^4.

Ah, that makes sense. Because [Co^2+] cancels out, and [Co_total] is 1e-2 M, but since f_n is a fraction, it's normalized.

So, the fraction of each complex is (β_n [SCN]^n ) / S.

So, given that, let's compute S first.

Given [SCN^-] is 0.1 M.

So, let's calculate each term in S:

Term 0: 1.

Term 1: β_1 [SCN] =9 * 0.1= 0.9

Term 2: β_2 [SCN]^2 =40 * (0.1)^2 =40 *0.01=0.4

Term3: β_3 [SCN]^3=63*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063

Term4: β_4 [SCN]^4=16*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016

Now, sum all terms to get S.

S = 1 + 0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016 = Let's compute:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +0.4=2.3

2.3 +0.063=2.363

2.363 +0.0016=2.3646

So S≈2.3646

Now, compute each f_n:

f_0 = (β_0 [SCN]^0 ) / S = (1 * 1)/2.3646 ≈0.4223

Wait, but β_0 is 1, right? Because β_0 is the stability constant for the complex with zero SCN-, which is the free ion. So yes.

Wait, but in the problem statement, β1 is given as 9, which is the first complex, [CoSCN]^+.

So, our calculation is:

f_0 = 1/(S) → 1/2.3646 ≈0.4223 → 42.23%

f_1= β1 [SCN]/S →9 *0.1 /2.3646 →0.9 /2.3646≈0.3807 →38.07%

f_2=β2 [SCN]^2/S →40*(0.1)^2=40*0.01=0.4 →0.4/2.3646≈0.169 →16.9%

f_3=β3 [SCN]^3/S →63*(0.1)^3=63*0.001=0.063 →0.063 /2.3646≈0.0266 →2.66%

f_4=β4 [SCN]^4/S →16*(0.1)^4=16*0.0001=0.0016 →0.0016/2.3646≈0.000676 →0.0676%

So, the fractions are:

f0=42.23%

f1=38.07%

f2=16.9%

f3=2.66%

f4=0.0676%

Wait, but the question is asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Wait, the dithiocyanato would imply two SCN ligands, so that's [Co(SCN)_2], which is f2. But in our calculation, f2 is 16.9%. Looking at the options, option D is 16.9%.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the blue complex might be the tetrathiocyanato, which is f4, which is 0.0676%, which is way too low. So, perhaps the dithiocyanato is f2, 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the question says "blue dithiocyanato", implying the blue color is due to the [Co(SCN)_2] complex. Hmm, I thought that the [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is the deep blue one, but maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ as the dithiocyanato complex, which is f2. So our calculation gives f2 as 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the computations.

Compute S: 1 +0.9=1.9, +0.4=2.3, +0.063=2.363, +0.0016=2.3646. Correct.

Then each f:

f0 = 1/2.3646 ≈0.4223 (42.23%).

f1 = (9 * 0.1) / 2.3646 = 0.9 / 2.3646 ≈0.3807 (38.07%).

f2 = (40 * 0.01) / 2.3646 = 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈0.169 (16.9%).

So, that's correct.

So, the percentage of dithiocyanato (n=2) is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, the options given are:

A)42.3%

B)25.6%

C)38.1%

D)16.9%

So option D is 16.9%.

Hence, the correct answer is D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants and the given concentrations to calculate the fraction of each cobalt complex. The stability constants are given as:

- β₁ = 9 (for [CoSCN]⁺),
- β₂ = 40 (for [Co(SCN)₂]),
- β₃ = 63 (for [Co(SCN)₃]⁻),
- β₄ = 16 (for [Co(SCN)₄]²⁻).

The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The fraction of each complex, \( f_n \), is given by:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{S},
\]

where \( S = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( S \)
Substitute \( [\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M} \) into the expression for \( S \):

\[
S = 1 + \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] + \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 + \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 + \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4.
\]

Compute each term:
- \( \beta_1 [\text{SCN}] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \),
- \( \beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.4 \),
- \( \beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.063 \),
- \( \beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.0016 \).

Sum these terms:
\[
S = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the fraction of each complex
The fractions of the complexes are:

\[
f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{S}.
\]

- For \( f_0 \) (free Co²⁺):
\[
f_0 = \frac{1 \cdot 1}{2.3646} \approx 0.4223 \, (42.23\%).
\]

- For \( f_1 \) ([CoSCN]⁺):
\[
f_1 = \frac{9 \cdot 0.1}{2.3646} = \frac{0.9}{2.3646} \approx 0.3807 \, (38.07\%).
\]

- For \( f_2 \) ([Co(SCN)₂]):
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169 \, (16.9\%).
\]

- For \( f_3 \) ([Co(SCN)₃]⁻):
\[
f_3 = \frac{63 \cdot (0.1)^3}{2.3646} = \frac{0.063}{2.3646} \approx 0.0266 \, (2.66\%).
\]

- For \( f_4 \) ([Co(SCN)₄]²⁻):
\[
f_4 = \frac{16 \cdot (0.1)^4}{2.3646} = \frac{0.0016}{2.3646} \approx 0.000676 \, (0.0676\%).
\]

### Step 3: Identify the blue dithiocyanato complex
The blue dithiocyanato complex corresponds to [Co(SCN)₂], which is \( f_2 \). From the calculations, \( f_2 \approx 16.9\% \).

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes is **16.9%**, which corresponds to option D.

**Answer: D**
