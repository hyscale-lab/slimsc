Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The problem has two reactions, A and B. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them to the options given. Let's take them one at a time.

Starting with reaction A: 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one is reacting with ethyl acrylate in the presence of t-BuOK. Hmm, t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, so this is probably an enolate formation reaction. Enolates are involved in aldol reactions, right?

Wait, the starting material is a ketone. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. Let me draw the structure. Cyclohexane ring, with a ketone at position 1. Then at position 2, there's an ethyl group and a methyl group? Or wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think: position 1 is the ketone, position 2 has an ethyl and a methyl group, and position 6 has a methyl. So the ring has substituents at 1, 2, and 6 positions.

Wait, wait. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethyl... So position 2 has both an ethyl and a methyl group. So that's a substituted cyclohexanone. The molecule is probably quite bulky because of all those substituents.

When we form the enolate, the base (t-BuOK) will deprotonate the alpha position. The alpha carbons are adjacent to the ketone. So in 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one, the alpha positions are at carbon 2 and carbon 3? Or wait, cyclohexanone is a ring with a ketone, so the carbonyl is at position 1. The adjacent carbons (2 and 6) are alpha.

Wait, in cyclohexanone, the carbonyl is at position 1. So the adjacent carbons (2 and 6) are alpha. So in this molecule
