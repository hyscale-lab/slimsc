Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says: There's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Their mass is negligible, so I don't have to worry about that. 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. I need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals, in Joules.

Hmm. The options are given, but I'll try to work it out myself first.

Wait, so all the particles are the same. Each has charge 2e. Point P has one charge fixed there. The other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the setup is a central charge with 12 surrounding charges at a fixed distance.

I remember that the potential energy of a configuration of point charges is calculated based on the work done to assemble them. Since the system is isolated, I think we're considering the electrostatic potential energy between all the charges.

But wait, the charges are identical and have the same sign, right? Because each has 2e. So all are positively charged, I assume.

So, the potential energy U of the system is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. But calculating all pairs might be tedious. Oh wait, I think there's a formula for the potential energy of a system of point charges. For a system of N identical charges, each q, placed in a way that each is a distance r
