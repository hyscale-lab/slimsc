Okay, so I'm looking at this organic chemistry problem, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me outline what each reaction does. The starting material is cyclohexanone. Then, a series of reactions are performed, and I need to track the structure through each step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2) to form product 1. I remember that cyclohexanone has a ketone group. Bromine can undergo various addition reactions. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so it's likely undergoing some kind of addition. Maybe it's the formation of a dibromide. Oh, right, when ketones react with bromine, it's typically a bromohydrin formation if it's a cyclic ketone. Wait, no, waitâ€”another possibility is the addition of Br2 across the carbonyl group. But wait, ketones don't usually open up with bromine on their own unless in certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening via some other mechanism?

Wait, cyclohexanone has a cyclic structure. When you add bromine, especially in a dienophile context, but I think that's for dienes. Alternatively, maybe this is a dihydroxylation? Wait, no, dihydroxylation is more with other reagents like OsO4. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination on the ring? Wait, but cyclohexanone is a ketone, so it's more about the carbonyl group.

Wait, another option: the first step could be the addition of Br2 to the carbonyl group. The carbonyl in cyclohexanone is a ketone. When you add Br2 to a ketone, you get a bromide. Let me think: the mechanism is probably the nucleophilic attack. The carbonyl is attacked by a bromide ion, but wait, in Br2, maybe it's adding across the carbonyl. Alternatively, the bromide could be adding in a conjugate addition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the first step is a bromination via the formation of a bromohydrin. No, wait, bromohydrin is when you have a ketone reacting with HOBr. But if you just add Br2, under certain conditions, perhaps it's a diaddition.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a vicinal dihalide. Wait, but the carbonyl group
