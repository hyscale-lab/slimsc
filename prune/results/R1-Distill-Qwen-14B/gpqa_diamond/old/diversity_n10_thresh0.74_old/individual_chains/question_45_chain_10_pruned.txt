Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. The question is asking about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state when four identical particles are placed in the well. The energy E is given as pi²ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy level is a multiple of this E.

Wait, wait. Since the particles are identical and in a 1D infinite well, I remember that each particle's energy depends on the quantum number n. The energy levels are quantized, right? The formula for each particle's energy is E_n = (n²)E, since E is already defined as pi²ħ²/(2mL²) multiplied by 1² in that case. So each particle's energy is E multiplied by the square of its quantum number n.

But wait, these are spin-1/2 particles, which are fermions. So they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two fermions can occupy the same quantum state. But in a 1D box, the quantum state is determined by the quantum number n and the spin. So for each n, there are two possible spin states: up and down. So each energy level can hold two particles.

Oh right, so for each n, two particles can occupy that state. So for four particles, let's see how they fill up the energy levels.

The ground state would have the lowest possible energy. The first energy level (n=1) can hold 2 particles. The next level (n=2) can hold another 2. So with four particles, the lowest energy configuration would have two in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait. No, each particle is spin-1/2, so each n can have two particles. So for four particles, n=1 has 2, n=2 has 2. But wait, that's four. So the ground state would be all four in the two lowest energy levels, each level filled with two.

Wait, but no, wait. Each particle is in a specific quantum state. So the ground state would be the lowest energy possible arrangement. So for identical spin-1/2 particles, each orbital (each n) can have two particles. So the first two particles would go into n=1 with opposite spins, the next two into n=2.

Wait, but wait another thing. If the particles are identical fermions, each must have a unique set of quantum numbers. So for each n, two particles can be placed (with opposite spins). So four particles would fill n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So the total energy would be the sum of each particle's energy. Each n=1 contributes 1² E = E each, so two particles give 2E. Each n=2 contributes 4E (since 2²=4; so each is 4E, two particles sum to 8E). So total energy for ground state would be 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, but wait, no. Wait, the particles are in different states. Wait, no, each particle's energy is (n²)E, so for n=1, each has E
