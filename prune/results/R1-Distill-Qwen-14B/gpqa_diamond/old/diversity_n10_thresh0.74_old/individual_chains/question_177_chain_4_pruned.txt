Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. 

Alright, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Hmm, but wait, the question is about luminosity. I remember that the luminosity of a star has a specific formula related to its radius and temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is radius and T is temperature. So L is proportional to R squared times T to the fourth power.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, the peak wavelength of a blackbody's emission is given by Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if their λ_max are the same, their temperatures must be the same. Because the λ_max is inversely proportional to T. So if λ1 = λ2, then T1 = T2. That's helpful. So both stars have the same temperature.

So, if the temperatures are the same, then the luminosity ratio depends on the radii. Because L is proportional to R² T⁴, and T is same, so L1/L2 = (R1/R2)². Wait, but wait, R1 is 1.5 times R2. So R1/R2 = 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 should be 2.25 times L2. Hmm, but wait, the options have A as ~2.25. But wait, wait a second. The problem also mentions radial velocities. Oh, the radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2. How does that affect the problem?

Wait, I'm confused. Radial velocity is the velocity along the line of sight. But how does that relate to luminosity? Oh, maybe I'm thinking about Doppler shift here. Because the observed wavelength can be affected by the star's velocity. The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. Oh, so the observed λ_max is the same for both stars. But the actual emitted λ_max would depend on their temperatures and velocities.

Wait, so perhaps the stars' wavelengths as observed are
