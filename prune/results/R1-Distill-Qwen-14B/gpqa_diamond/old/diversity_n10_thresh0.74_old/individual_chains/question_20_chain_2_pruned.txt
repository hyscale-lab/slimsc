Okay, so I've got this physics question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking which assumptions lead to the idea that nucleons behave like free particles. The options are combinations of four statements. I need to figure out which three are correct.

First, I should recall what the impulse approximation is. From what I remember, it's an approximation where the internal structure of the nucleus is ignored, and each nucleon is treated as if it's free. So, the idea is that nucleons don't influence each other much during the interaction—like they just get a quick "kick" or impulse.

Looking at the four statements:

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons.
   - I think this is right because if the interaction is only with individual nucleons, it implies each one is treated separately, not as part of a collective. So this supports the impulse approximation.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   - Wait, transparent? Oh, maybe it means that other nucleons don't affect the interaction. So the nucleus doesn't impede the interaction beyond the selected nucleon. That makes sense because if others aren't influencing, each behaves as if free. So this supports the approximation.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   - Hmm, not sure. I think this might be about the internal structure. If quarks are non-relativistic, maybe their motion is simple, but does that directly affect the approximation? If the quarks are non-relativistic, perhaps the nucleon's internal structure is treated classically, which might mean it's treated as a point particle, making it behave more like a free particle. So this could be an assumption, but I'm not 100% sure. Or maybe this isn't directly related to the external interactions of the nucleon but more about its internal state.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   - Oh, right! If the nucleon is bound in the nucleus, during the interaction, the binding forces are ignored. So the nucleon is treated as if it's free, not feeling the nuclear forces. That definitely implies the impulse approximation because binding forces are neglected.

So the question is which three of these statements together imply the impulse approximation.

The options are:
A) 1,2,4
B) 2,3,4
C) 1,2,3
D) 1,3,4

Wait, let's reevaluate each statement.

Statement 1: Interaction current interacts with individual nucleons. That sounds correct because it's the basis of treating each nucleon separately.

Statement 2: The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected one. So other nucleons don't block or influence the interaction. So the interaction is only with that one nucleon, others are transparent—so correct.

Statement 3: Quarks are non-relativistic. Does this matter? Maybe it's about the internal motion. If quarks are non-relativistic, then their binding is weak or treated simply, perhaps allowing the nucleon to be approximated as a point particle. But I'm not sure if this directly contributes to the impulse approximation. Because the impulse approximation is more about external interactions rather than internal structure. So perhaps statement 3 isn't a premise for the impulse approximation. Alternatively, if the quarks are non-relativistic, maybe it's easier to model the nucleon as a free particle without considering internal binding effects. But I'm a bit confused here.

Statement 4: Nucleon experiences no binding forces during interaction. That's exactly what the impulse approximation assumes. So statement 4 is definitely part of the assumptions.

So which options include 1, 2, and 4? That's option A.

Wait, but what about statement 3? The question is which assumptions jointly imply the approximation. So if statement 3 is not necessary, then the correct set would be 1,2,4.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 — that's the three
