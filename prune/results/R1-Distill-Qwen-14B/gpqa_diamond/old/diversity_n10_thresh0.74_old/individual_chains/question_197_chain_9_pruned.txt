Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these spectroscopy problems. Let me take it step by step.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that when alkenes react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydrohalogenation reaction. Oh wait, no, wait—red phosphorus is usually involved in the preparation of the phosphorus ylide for Wittig reactions, but sometimes HI is used for other types of additions. Alternatively, maybe it's about the addition of HI across a carbonyl group? Or wait, no, if it's reacting with red phosphorus and HI, that might be a situation where it's forming a ylide for a Wittig reaction. But I think more likely, since the question is about the product after this reaction, perhaps the starting material is something that can form an ylide, like an alkene.

Wait, but let me think again. Red phosphorus and HI are often used together in the hydroxymercuration reaction, but no, wait, that's mercury-based. Alternatively, maybe it's a situation where the starting compound has a carbonyl group. Oh, wait, another possibility: the use of red phosphorus and HI is for the conversion of a carbonyl group into an alcohol via a substitution mechanism. Or wait, another thought: when an alkyne reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it's a hydration reaction to form a ketone or an aldehyde, depending on substitution.

But let's step back. The first step is to figure out what Compound X is, based on the IR and NMR data provided. Once I know X, I can determine what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Looking at the IR data: strong peaks in the 3400–2500 cm-1 region, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretches. The 1720 cm-1 peak is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1610 and 1450 cm-1 are in the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So putting that together, Compound X likely has an aromatic ring (because of the peaks at 1610 and 1450), a carbonyl group (1720), and possibly an O-H group (3400–2500). Alternatively, that
