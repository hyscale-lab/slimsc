Okay, I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question is asking about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. The operator P seems to be given in terms of its components: Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators like P are often components of angular momentum. Since the eigenvalue is ħ/2, maybe it's the spin operator for a spin-1/2 particle like a muon. Oh wait, muons are leptons and have spin-1/2, so yeah, that makes sense. So operator P is likely the spin operator S, perhaps?

Wait, but the problem says P, but maybe it's analogous. So the operator P is given with three components. The question is to find the eigenvector when P is measured along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So the operator is probably the spin component in the direction of n, which would be S·n, right?

Wait, but the problem statement says "eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n". Oh, wait, maybe P is the spin operator S. So the operator in the direction n would be S·n, where n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so n = (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ) but since it's in x-z plane, φ=0? Wait, no, in the x-z plane, the direction is determined by θ where θ is measured from the z-axis, and φ is 0 or π? Hmm, but wait, the x-z plane is spanned by angles where φ is 0 and π? Or maybe it's a different convention. Wait, actually, the x-z plane is any direction where the y-component is zero. So the unit vector would have components (x, 0, z), meaning it's of the form (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

But the operator P is along direction n, which is in x-z plane. So the operator would be P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Wait, n is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, but the components P_x, P_y, P_z are already given. So I think the operator along direction n is given by (n_x P_x + n_z P_z). Because n_y is zero, so the Py term doesn't contribute.

Wait, but the problem is to find the eigenvector of P (along n) with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So I need to find the eigenvector of the operator (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) with eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Let me write down the given matrices:

Px is (ħ/2) * [ [0, 1], [1, 0] ]
Py is (ħ/2) * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]
Pz is (ħ/2) * [ [1, 0], [0, -1] ]

So each of these is a Pauli matrix multiplied by ħ/2.

The operator P along n is S·n, which is S_x n_x + S_z n_z, since n is in x-z plane (n_y=0). So the operator matrix is (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) * ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is [ (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) * ħ/2 ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. So if I factor out ħ/2, the equation becomes:

( n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ> .

Wait, but the eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so the equation would be:

( n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = (1) |ψ> .

Because (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) * ħ/2 |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ> implies (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) |ψ> = |ψ>.

So now I need to find the eigenvector of this matrix (n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z ) which is a 2x2 matrix.

Let me represent this matrix as:

( n_x * [ [0,1],[1,0] ] ) + (n_z * [ [1,0],[0,-1] ] )

So, putting it together, the matrix is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]

Because when you add the two matrices, the (1,1) element is n_z, (1,2) is n_x, (2,1) is n_x, and (2,2) is -n_z.

So the matrix is:

| n_z    n_x  |
| n_x   -n_z |

We need to find the eigenvector for eigenvalue 1. So, the eigenvalue equation is:

[ [n_z - 1, n_x  ]   [a]   = 0
  [n_x,     -n_z -1 ] [b] ]

So, the equations are:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Wait, no, the matrix is M = [ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ]. So M - I (identity matrix) is:

[ n_z -1, n_x        ]
[ n_x,   -n_z -1 ]

So the equations are:

(n_z -1) a + n_x b = 0
n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0

So from the first equation, (n_z -1) a = -n_x b → a = [ (-n_x) / (n_z -1) ] b

Wait, but we can also write this as:

a = [ (n_x) / (1 - n_z) ] b

But perhaps it's easier to look for non-trivial solutions. Let's assume b ≠ 0, so a = [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ] b.

Alternatively, I can compute the determinant of (M - I) and set it to zero for non-trivial solutions. Wait, but since we're looking for eigenvectors, the equations must be dependent, so the determinant must be zero.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to normalize the eigenvector. Let me think.

Alternatively, another approach: The operator S·n is a spin operator. The eigenstates are the eigenstates of the spin along the direction n. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates for eigenvalue +1/2 (since ħ/2 is the eigenvalue, so 1/2 when considering dimensionless spin matrices) are given by the spin-up state along n.

The general form of the eigenvector for eigenvalue +1/2 along direction n is |+n> = [ cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) ]^T, where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle. But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π? Wait, n is in the x-z plane, which means φ=0 or φ=π, because the y-component is zero. So the state becomes either [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T or [ cos(θ/2), -sin(θ/2) ]^T, depending on the direction in the x-z plane.

Wait, but the direction n is in the x-z plane, so in spherical coordinates, the direction is (θ, φ=0). But wait, no. Let me think. In the standard spherical coordinate system, θ is the angle from the z-axis, and φ is the angle in the xy-plane from the x-axis. So if the vector is in the x-z plane, φ is 0 or π. So, for a direction in the x-z plane, φ is 0 (if in the x>0, z>0 direction) or π (if in the x<0, z>0 direction), but more generally, any direction where the y-component is zero.

But in this problem, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, which means φ can be 0 or π, but the state's components would depend on that.

Wait, but the eigenvectors for spin in a direction (θ, φ) are given by:

|+> = [ e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

But perhaps I'm mixing conventions. Alternatively, perhaps the spin-up state along n is (cos(θ/2), e^{iφ} sin(θ/2))^T.

But wait, let me think again. The spin state |+n> can be written in terms of the eigenstates of S_z. For a direction n with polar angle θ and azimuthal angle φ, the spin-up state is:

|+n> = e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2)|+z> + e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2)|-z>

Wait, or maybe:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + e^{iφ} sin(θ/2) |−z>

Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on this, so maybe it's better to approach it algebraically.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to parameterize the direction n as (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). Since it's in the x-z plane, φ is either 0 or something else? No, wait, any angle φ where y=0. So, for the x-z plane, the direction is (sinθ cosφ, 0, cosθ). But since the problem states it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so n is (n_x, 0, n_z), where n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So, let me proceed with the algebraic approach. The eigenvector equation is:

[ [n_z, n_x], [n_x, -n_z] ] [a; b] = [a; b]

Which gives us two equations:

1) (n_z) a + n_x b = a
2) n_x a + (-n_z) b = b

Simplify equation 1: (n_z - 1) a + n_x b = 0 → equation (1)
Simplify equation 2: n_x a + (-n_z -1) b = 0 → equation (2)

We can solve these two equations. Let's take equation (1):

(n_z - 1) a = -n_x b → a = [ -n_x / (n_z -1) ] b → a = [ n_x / (1 - n_z) ] b

Now substitute a into equation (2):

n_x * [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b + (-n_z -1) b = 0

Multiply through by (1 - n_z) to eliminate denominator:

n_x^2 b + [ (-n_z - 1)(1 - n_z) ] b = 0

Factor out b (since we're looking for non-trivial solutions, b ≠ 0):

n_x^2 + [ (-n_z - 1)(1 - n_z) ] = 0

Let me expand the second term:

(-n_z -1)(1 - n_z) = (-n_z)(1) + (-n_z)(-n_z) + (-1)(1) + (-1)(-n_z)
= -n_z + n_z^2 -1 + n_z
= (n_z^2) -1

So the equation becomes:

n_x^2 + (n_z^2 -1) = 0 → n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1

But that's consistent because n is a unit vector, so n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1.

So the substitution is correct, and the equations are dependent.

Therefore, the condition is satisfied for any a and b related by a = [n_x / (1 - n_z)] b.

So the eigenvector can be written as:

[a; b] = [n_x / (1 - n_z) * b; b] = b [n_x/(1-n_z), 1]^T.

We can choose b as a parameter, say b=1, but we need to normalize the vector. Alternatively, express the eigenvector in terms of θ, since n lies in the x-z plane.

Let me parameterize n. Since it's in the x-z plane, n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), assuming θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x = sinθ, n_z = cosθ.

Substituting into the expression for a:

a = (sinθ) / (1 - cosθ) * b

But 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So:

a = [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ] / [2 sin²(θ/2) ] * b = [ cos(θ/2) / sin(θ/2) ] * b = cot(θ/2) * b.

So the components are a = cot(θ/2) b, and b = b.

So the eigenvector is:

[ cot(θ/2) * b, b ]^T.

We can factor out b and write the vector as:

b [ cot(θ/2), 1 ]^T.

To normalize this vector, compute the squared magnitude:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |cot(θ/2)|² |b|² + |b|² = |b|² (cot²(θ/2) + 1) ) = |b|² ( csc²(θ/2) ) 

So the normalization factor is |b| = 1 / |csc(θ/2)| = sin(θ/2).

Wait, let's compute:

cot²(θ/2) + 1 = csc²(θ/2) = 1 / sin²(θ/2)

So the normalization condition is |b|² (1/sin²(θ/2)) ) = 1 → |b| = sin(θ/2).

So choosing b = sin(θ/2), the normalized eigenvector becomes:

[ cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T

Simplify cot(θ/2) sin(θ/2) = [cos(θ/2)/sin(θ/2)] * sin(θ/2) ) = cos(θ/2)

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but wait. What about the phase? Because in the earlier substitution, a was expressed as [n_x/(1-n_z)] b, which for n_x positive, gives a positive real value. But in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have a phase factor, so perhaps the general solution includes a phase factor e^{iφ}.

Wait, but in our case, n is in the x-z plane, which means that the direction is (n_x, 0, n_z). So, the angle φ is zero? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps the phase comes from the choice of eigenvector.

Wait, when n is in the x-z plane and in the positive x direction (θ=90 degrees, so n=(1,0,0)), the state should be [0,1]^T. But according to the expression I obtained, for θ=90°, θ/2=45°, so cos(45°)=√2/2, sin(45°)=√2/2. So the vector would be [√2/2, √2/2]^T. Wait, but that's not correct. Because along x, the eigenstate should be |+x> = (|+z> + |-z>)/√2 = [1, 1]/√2, which is [1/√2, 1/√2]^T. So when θ=90°, the state is [cos(45°), sin(45°)]^T, which is correct.

But wait, what about when n is along the negative x direction, θ=270°, which is (n_x = -1, n_z=0). Then θ=3π/2 radians. Then θ/2=3π/4, so cos(3π/4) is -√2/2, and sin(3π/4)=√2/2. So the vector would be [-√2/2, √2/2]^T. But along negative x, the eigenstate for +1/2 should be [1, -1]/√2. Hmm, but according to our formula, it's [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)] which for θ=3π/2 gives [cos(3π/4), sin(3π/4)] = [-√2/2, √2/2]^T, which is [ -1, 1 ]/√2. That's correct as well. So the phase seems to be handled correctly.

Wait a minute, but the general eigenvector for spin in direction (θ, φ) would have a phase factor e^{iφ} in the second component. But in our case, since the direction is in the x-z plane (φ=0), the phase would be zero, leading to the second component being real. So the eigenvector is [cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2)]^T.

Wait, but look at the options given:

Option C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I've got.

But wait, let me check the options again.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is exactly what I have.

But wait, the problem statement mentions that the eigenvector corresponds to eigenvalue +ħ/2. So the components are as I derived.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options:

Option C says exactly that, so the answer should be option C.


The problem involves finding the normalized eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is given in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are proportional to the Pauli matrices. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the operator along $\vec{n}$ is $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $n_x^2 + n_z^2 = 1$.

The eigenvalue equation for the operator $P$ is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 
n_z & n_x \\ 
n_x & -n_z 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 
a \\ 
b 
\end{pmatrix}
= 
\begin{pmatrix} 
a \\ 
b 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to the following system of equations:

1. $(n_z - 1)a + n_x b = 0$,
2. $n_x a + (-n_z - 1)b = 0$.

From the first equation, $a = \frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} b$. Substituting this into the second equation confirms that the equations are consistent, and the eigenvector can be expressed as:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 
a \\ 
b 
\end{pmatrix}
= 
b 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\frac{n_x}{1 - n_z} \\ 
1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, note that $n_x = \sin\theta$ and $n_z = \cos\theta$, where $\theta$ is the polar angle of $\vec{n}$ from the z-axis. Substituting these into the eigenvector components gives:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 
a \\ 
b 
\end{pmatrix}
= 
b 
\begin{pmatrix} 
\frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} \\ 
1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} = \cot(\theta/2)$, so the eigenvector becomes:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 
\cot(\theta/2) \\ 
1 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To normalize, multiply by $\sin(\theta/2)$, yielding:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 
\cos(\theta/2) \\ 
\sin(\theta/2) 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

This matches the general form of the spin-up state along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. Among the given options, this corresponds to **Option C**.

**Critical Analysis of Options:**

- **Option A:** $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$ does not match the derived eigenvector.
- **Option B:** $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$ is incorrect because the eigenvector components depend on $\theta/2$, not $\theta$.
- **Option C:** $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$ is correct and matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D:** $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$ introduces incorrect normalization factors.

**Answer:** C
