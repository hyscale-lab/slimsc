Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident about organic reactions, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. Let me read the problem again.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, that's a mouthful. I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency tells us about the number of rings plus double bonds in the molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index. So the product's structure after reaction will determine the index.

The reagents used are red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, red phosphorus is often used in the presence of iodine or HI for deoxygenation reactions. Oh right, I think that's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen reduces ketones or aldehydes to alkanes, removing the oxygen. So any carbonyl groups in the starting material should be converted to CH2 groups.

Let me draw the structure of the starting compound to visualize it better. The base structure is cyclohexene, so it's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait no, vinyl is CH2=CH-. So the substituents are CHO and CH2CH2? Wait, no, wait. No, position 5 is a vinyl group which is a CH2CH2 with a double bond. Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is a vinyl group attached to the ring. So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond at position 3 and substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH2CH2?), no, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, the compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring (cyclohex-3-ene) has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, at position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2=CH-). Also, there's a carboxylic acid group, so wait, where is that? Oh, wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enec
