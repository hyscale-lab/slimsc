Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step because I'm a bit rusty on this topic.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and it absorbs a photon. We need to find the momentum of that photon so the molecule switches to the next lowest energy state. The options are given as A to D with various values.

First, I remember that for diatomic molecules, the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. The model they're using is the rotation-vibration model, which I think combines both rotational and vibrational energy levels.

Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So the molecule is in the ground state, which includes the lowest vibrational and rotational levels. When it absorbs a photon, it will transition to the next higher energy state. But I need to figure out what that transition requires.

I think that the energy levels for a diatomic molecule in this model are given by the sum of vibrational and rotational energies. So the transition might involve a change in either vibration, rotation, or both.

The photon's energy must match the energy difference between the two states. But wait, the question is about momentum, not energy. Oh, right, because the momentum of a photon is related to its energy. The momentum p is equal to E/c, where E is the energy and c is the speed of light.

So first, I need to find the energy difference between the fundamental state and the next state. But what exactly is the next state? Let me think: in quantum mechanics, the states are labeled by quantum numbers. For the rotation-vibration model, the energy depends on both the vibrational quantum number ν and the rotational quantum number J.

The fundamental state is when both ν and J are at their lowest. So ν is 0, and J is 0 as well. The next possible state could be either an increase in ν or J. But I'm not sure if both change or just one. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are purely rotational, but here it's the non-rigid rotor, which includes both rotation and vibration.

Wait, no, the rotation-vibration model includes both. So the total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational.

The vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_ν = (ν + 1/2) hν̄, where ν̄ is the vibrational frequency. And the rotational energy is E_J = (J(J+1
