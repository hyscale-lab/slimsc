Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying the chemical formula of a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound based on its IR and NMR spectra.

First, the IR spectrum shows peaks indicating an ester group. Esters typically have two strong absorption bands in IR: one for the C=O stretch around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹ and another for the O-C-O stretch around 1200-1300 cm⁻¹. So, the compound must have an ester functional group somewhere.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. There are six signals. Let's break them down.

1. **Aromatic-H**: Two signals. Since it's a di-substituted benzene ring, the substituents would influence the splitting. If the substituents are in positions that make the ring not symmetrical, like para or ortho, but wait, if it's di-substituted, para would have two equivalent Hs, but in a meta substitution, the Hs might not be equivalent. Wait, but the question says two signals for aromatic H. So maybe the substituents are in para positions, making it a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. But wait, if it's 1,4 (para), then the aromatic protons would have two equivalent sets. For example, if the substituents are both ester groups, but that would make it a di-ester, which is less likely. Or perhaps one substituent is an ester and the other is something else? Hmm.

Wait, no, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. Each substituent contributes their own groups. But the aromatic Hs are split into two signals. So maybe the substituents are in such a way that the ring has two sets of non-equivalent Hs. For example, if the substituents are in para positions, but each substituent is different. Let's say one substituent is an ester and the other is something else, like a methyl group? Wait, but wait, the NMR also mentions -CH3 groups. Oh, right, the NMR has two signals for -CH3 groups. So maybe the substituents include an ester and a methyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The substituents on the benzene ring could be an ester group and another group which has CH3 groups. Or perhaps the substituents themselves have parts with CH3.

But let me go back to the NMR signals. There are two signals for aromatic H, two for vinyl H, and two for -CH3. No signals for -CH2. So, no methylene groups. So, the structure likely doesn't have any CH2 groups, which means maybe it's a ring with substituents that don't have CH2 chains.

The ester group is probably part of the substituent on the benzene ring. The structure could be something like benzyl acetate or similar, but let me think. If one substituent is an ester, perhaps OAc (acetate), which would be O-CO-OCH3? Wait, no, an ester is R-O
