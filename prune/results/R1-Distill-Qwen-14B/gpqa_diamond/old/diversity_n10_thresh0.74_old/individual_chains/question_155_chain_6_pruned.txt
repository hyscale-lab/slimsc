Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about uncertainty in the operator P_z for a given quantum state. Hmm, okay. Let me try to think this through step by step.

First, let me read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). I need to find the uncertainty ΔP_z, which is the standard deviation of the operator P_z when the system is in this state.

Wait, right. The uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩ for the given state.

But wait, the state is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I can't directly say that the expectation value of P_z is zero or anything like that. I have to compute it explicitly.

First, let me note the given matrices for P_x, P_y, and P_z.

P_x matrix:
First row: 0, ħ/√2, 0
Second row: ħ/√2, 0, ħ/√2
Third row: 0, ħ/√2, 0

P_y matrix:
First row: 0, -iħ/√2, 0
Second row: iħ/√2, 0, -iħ/√2
Third row: 0, iħ/√2, 0

P_z matrix:
First row: ħ, 0, 0
Second row: 0, 0, 0
Third row: 0, 0, -ħ

And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis states are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, and |-z⟩, corresponding to eigenvalues ħ, 0, and -ħ respectively.

The state given is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this state as |ψ⟩.

I need to compute ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩ and ⟨ψ| P_z² |ψ⟩.

Wait, but P_z is diagonal, right? Because its matrix is diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So P_z squared would be the same, because each diagonal element is squared. So P_z² would be (ħ², 0, (-ħ)^2) → (ħ², 0, ħ²). So P_z² = (ħ²) I, since the 1st and 3rd elements are ħ², middle is zero. Wait no, no, matrix-wise, P_z squared would be a diagonal matrix with each element squared. So the (1,1) is (ħ)^2, (2,2) is 0^2 =0, (3,3) is (-ħ)^2= ħ².
