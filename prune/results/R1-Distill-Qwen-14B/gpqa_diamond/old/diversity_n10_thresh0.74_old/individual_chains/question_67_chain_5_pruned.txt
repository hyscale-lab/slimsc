Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read it again.

The question is about two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're told to ignore their spin angular momentum. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So, l1 and l2 are both 1, which makes sense since p orbitals have l=1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

The question asks about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ. So, each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction is measured, and we want the probability that both are -ħ.

Wait, but wait. I remember that for angular momentum, each Lz eigenvalue is given by m multiplied by ħ. So for an electron, Lz can be -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l-1, l. Since l=1 here, each Lz can be -ħ, 0, or ħ.

So for each electron, the possible Lzi eigenvalues are -ħ, 0, ħ.

The state is |1,1,2,-1>. Hmm, I think I need to expand this coupled state into the product basis states. Because the coupled state is a combination of the individual states.

Wait, in angular momentum coupling, the |l1, l2, l, m> state can be written as a combination of |l1, m1> ⊗ |l2, m2>, where m1 + m2 = m. But here, in the coupled state, m is given as -1. So each m1 and m2 must add up to m = -1.

But wait, the initial state is |1,1,2,-1>, so it's an eigenstate of L^2 and L_z, where L is the sum of the two individual angular momenta. So, L = L1 + L2.

To find the probability of getting L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ, we need to find the component of the coupled state where each electron has m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because L1z |m1> = m1 ħ |m1>, so if m1 is -1, L1z is -ħ.

Wait, but the sum m1
