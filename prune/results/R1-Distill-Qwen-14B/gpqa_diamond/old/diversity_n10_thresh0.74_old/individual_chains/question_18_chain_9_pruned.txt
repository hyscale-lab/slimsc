Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about stellar abundances, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll have to think it through. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, each with different masses. Star_1 has 1.5 solar masses, and Star_2 has 1.2. But wait, I'm not sure if their masses directly affect the elemental abundances. Maybe the mass affects other things like their lifetimes or nucleosynthesis, but I think in this problem, the abundances are given, so maybe the mass isn't directly relevant here. Let me focus on the given data.

The problem gives me the following elemental abundances using the equivalent width (EW) method under LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium). The symbols are [X/Y] which I remember represent logarithmic abundance ratios relative to the Sun. 

For Star_1:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex

For Star_2:
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the Sun's photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5)
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7 → log10(nMg/nH) = 7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =10^(-5)

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find (nSi,1 / nH,1) divided by (nSi,2 / nH,2), or perhaps (nSi,1 / nSi,2) * (nH,2 / nH,1)? Hmm, no, wait, the ratio of silicon atoms would be (nSi1 / nH1) divided by (nSi2 / nH2), but maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the ratio is (nSi1 / nH1
