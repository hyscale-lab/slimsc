Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a star similar to the Sun. Half of the star's surface is covered in dark spots, with a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star over time, its brightness changes periodically because the spots rotate into and out of view. The question is saying that this situation can look similar to an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. They're asking, if the star wasn't spotted, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would cause the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do now.

Hmm. So the key here is that the star's brightness variation due to spots is being compared to the variation caused by a transiting exoplanet. When a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of that dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area.

First, I need to find the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots. Then, I can compare that to the amplitude that would be caused by an exoplanet and solve for the planet's radius.

So, let's break it down.

The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, Rstar = R_sun. The spots cover one hemisphere, so the area of the spotted region is 50% of the star's surface. But the filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. Wait, the wording says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. So the total area covered by spots is 0.5 (hemisphere) * 0.2 (filling factor) = 0.1 or 10% of the star's total surface area.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface, and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, then the total area of spots is 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 or 10% of the star's surface.

Now, the brightness variation comes from the difference in temperature between the spots and the surrounding star. The spots are cooler: 6000 K - 1000 K = 5000 K. So the area of the spots emits less light.

The total flux from the star is the sum of the flux from the spotted regions and the rest of the star. But when the star rotates, the spotted area moves into view and out of view, causing variations in the observed flux.

But wait, the
