Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting quasars using neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I need to figure out the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Let me think through this.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstrom. I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet range, around 121.6 nm (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm). Wait, no, wait—no, wait. Wait, wait. Oh! 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nanometers, right? So 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nanometers. That's in the far ultraviolet, which I think is also called the Lyman-alpha line because it's the first transition in hydrogen, from n=2 to n=1.

So quasars emit light, and if there's a neutral hydrogen cloud in front of them, the light from the quasar passes through it. The hydrogen will absorb at this Lyman-alpha wavelength. But, wait, the quasar is at a high redshift, so the absorption line we observe would be redshifted.

But the question is about detecting this absorption using optical telescopes. So optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So the redshifted Lyman-alpha line must be in the optical range when it reaches us.

So the key here is to find the redshift z such that the observed wavelength is in the optical range. Let me think about the wavelength ranges. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 nm to about 700 nm, so visible light. But wait, sometimes optical can go a bit beyond, but I think the Lyman-alpha line at 1216 Angstrom is 121.6 nm, which is in the far UV. So if it's redshifted, we want the observed wavelength λ_obs to be less than maybe 400 nm? No, wait, wait. Wait, no
