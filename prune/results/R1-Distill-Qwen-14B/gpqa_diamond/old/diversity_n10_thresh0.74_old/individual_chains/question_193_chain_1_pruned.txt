Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So that's like N ∝ 1/plx^5. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance, r. The options are various powers of r.

Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the angle subtended by the distance to an object at a baseline. Oh right, the formula for distance is r = 1/(plx), but wait, that's in parsecs if plx is in arcseconds. So r (in parsecs) equals 1 divided by plx (arcseconds). So plx is inversely proportional to r, right? So plx = 1/r.

But wait, the question is about the number of stars varying with parallax. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Let's substitute plx with 1/r. Because plx =1/r, so 1/plx would be r.

So substituting that in, N ∝ (1/(1/r))^5) = r^5. Wait no, wait: 1/plx is r. So if N is proportional to (1/plx)^5, which is r^5. So N ∝ r^5. But wait, that can't be right because if you're looking at a range of distances, the number of stars per unit distance would depend on how the density changes with r.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N = k * (1/plx^5 ), where k is a constant. Since plx is inversely proportional to r, plx = 1/r. So substitute that in.

So N = k * (1/( (1/r)^5 )) = k * r^5. So N is proportional to r^5. But wait, that's the number of stars as a function of r. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. So maybe it's the number density or the count per distance.

Wait, let me think again. The number of stars in a region as a function of distance. Suppose we have a thin shell at distance r, with a small thickness dr. The number of
