Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Regularization... I remember that's a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences, like when calculations give infinite results. So, you introduce a cutoff or some other method to make the infinities manageable, and then you take the cutoff to infinity again. But some theories might not need this because they're already finite or don't have the same kinds of divergences.

Let's go through each option:

Option A: Superstring Theory. I think string theory is supposed to be a candidate for a theory of everything, combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Because strings have a minimum size, maybe they don't have the same high-energy divergences that point particles do. So perhaps superstring theory doesn't require regularization because it doesn't run into the same issues with infinities. I'm not entirely sure, thoughâ€”I remember that string theories can have different formulations, and sometimes they use regularization techniques, but maybe in their high-energy (UV) limit, they don't need it as much? Or maybe because they're background-independent or have other properties that prevent divergences.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory, similar to Yang-Mills. I remember that QCD does have asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling becomes weak, which makes perturbative calculations manageable. But wait, do we still need regularization? I think yes, because even if the coupling is weak, the loop diagrams can still lead to divergences. So they must use regularization methods like lattice QCD or other techniques to handle the infinities. So QCD requires regularization.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's a well-understood theory. I remember that QED does require renormalization because of divergences in loop diagrams. For example, the electron's self-energy or photon vacuum polarization. So you need to regularize the calculations, maybe using a cutoff or dimensional regularization, then renormalize by absorbing the divergences into counterterms. So QED definitely needs regularization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Wait, classical theories don't have the same issues as quantum ones. In classical E&M, you don't have divergent integrals because you don't have the same mathematical framework as quantum field theory. For example, in classical theory, point charges have issues, like the self-energy problem, but these are more about the limitations of the classical theory rather than needing regularization. But regularization is a quantum field concept. So classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. But wait, the question is about high energies. Would classical theories ever need regularization? I don't think so. Because regularization is a technique used in quantum theories to handle divergences, not in classical ones. So classical electrodynamics doesn't require regularization, regardless of energy scales.

Wait, but the question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. So
