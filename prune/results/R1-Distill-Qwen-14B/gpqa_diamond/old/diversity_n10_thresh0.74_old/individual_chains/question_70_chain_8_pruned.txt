Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and try to break it down.

The problem describes several reactions involving different substances. My goal is to find the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are A) C2, B) D4h, C) D∞h, D) C2v.

Hmm, I think I should start by mapping out all the reactions to identify what each compound could be. Let's list out the given information:

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A and two acids F and G. F is strong, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, used as a solvent.

Alright, let's think about each reaction. Maybe the bright red product C can give a clue. I remember that some compounds are bright red, like maybe some transition metal compounds. For example, could C be something like Fe³+ or MnO4^-?

Wait, reaction 4 says D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Solvents are often things like water, ethanol, maybe something else. Alternatively, H could be something like H2O. Wait, but D reacts with B to form H. Let me think about possible reactions.

If D is a gas, maybe it's something like O2 or H2. Let's think about reaction 4: suppose B is, say, H2? Then D could be something else. Wait, maybe D is O2. Let me think: if B is H2 and D is O2, then H would be H2O. But H is a solvent, which makes sense if H is water.

But wait, if B is H2, then reaction 1 would involve H2 reacting with A to form C. Also, in reaction 3, C reacting with water gives back A and two acids. So if C is an oxide or something that reacts with water.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reactions are forming metal oxides. Let me think
