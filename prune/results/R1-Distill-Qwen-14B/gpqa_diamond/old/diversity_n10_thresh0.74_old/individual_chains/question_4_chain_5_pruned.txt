Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, magnets always have both North and South poles; you can't isolate them. That's why, for instance, you can't just have a single pole sticking out; they come in pairs. But in this question, they're saying that's not the case—magnets can have isolated poles.

Wait, how does that affect Maxwell's equations? Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall them. 

The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition): ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero. That's because there are no isolated magnetic charges—no monopoles. So equation number two reflects that: ∇·B = 0.

But if in this other universe, magnets can have isolated North or South poles, that means magnetic monopoles exist. So there are magnetic charges, just like electric charges. 

If magnetic monopoles exist, then the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. Because in Gauss's Law for magnetism, the divergence of B equals the magnetic charge density divided by some constant, right? So equation 2 would change. So equation 2 would become ∇·B = ρ_m / μ₀ (or something like that), similar to Gauss's Law for E.

But wait, the question is about which equations are different. So equation 2 would definitely change. What about the others? Let me think about the others.

Equation 1 deals with electric fields and charge—so if there's a magnetic monopole, equation 1 shouldn't change because it's about electric charges. So equation 1 is the same.

Equation 3 is Faraday's Law. In our universe, it's ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If magnetic monopoles exist, does this equation change? Hmm. Faraday's Law is about the curl of E, which relates to the time derivative of B. I don't think that equation would change. Because the presence of magnetic charges might affect the other equations but not this one. Or maybe... Wait, I'm not so sure. Wait, if magnetic monop
