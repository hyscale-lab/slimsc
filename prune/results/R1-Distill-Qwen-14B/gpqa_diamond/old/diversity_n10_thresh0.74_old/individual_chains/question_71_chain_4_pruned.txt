Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Since all these planets are in orbital resonance and have circular orbits, I think the key here is figuring out their distances from the star.

The question says the planets have orbital periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So, the periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. But wait, orbital period and distance are related by Kepler's third law. Kepler's law states that P² is proportional to a³, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from the star). Since these are circular orbits, a is just the radius.

So for each planet, P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. But since we're comparing ratios, the constants will cancel out. Let me think: the ratio of their distances would be the cube root of the ratio of their periods squared. More precisely, a_i = ( (P_i)^2 * (M_star) / (4π²) )^(1/3), but since all planets orbit the same star, M is the same, so a_i is proportional to (P_i)^(2/3).

Wait, wait, no. Let me get that straight. Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So a³ = (P² * GM)/(4π²). So a is proportional to P^(2/3). So each planet's distance depends on the square of the period, but then we take the cube root. So a_i is P_i^(2/3) times some constant factor.

But since all planets are around the same star, the same constant applies, so the ratio between a_i and a_j is (P_i / P_j)^(2/3). So the ratio a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3). P4 is 3.5, P2 is 2. So 3.5 / 2 is 1.75. So (1.75) raised to the 2/3 power.

Wait, alternatively, let me think about each planet's a in terms of a base unit. Let's let P1
