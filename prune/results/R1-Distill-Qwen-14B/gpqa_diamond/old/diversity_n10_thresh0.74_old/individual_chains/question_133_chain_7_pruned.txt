Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, orthophosphate is PO4^3- I think. 

So, the problem says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH2PO4 and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate.

Wait, the goal is to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions. I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can donate three protons. The dissociation steps are as follows:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3)

The given Ka values are Ka1 = 7.5e-3, Ka2 = 6.2e-8, and Ka3 = 1.8e-12. Since Ka3 is so small, PO4^3- is a very weak base and exists in very low concentration. But wait, the problem is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-. So how do I find its concentration?

Wait, but wait a second. The solution contains KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So those are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- salts. When they dissolve in water, they form their respective ions. 

KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-.
Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-.

So the solution has both H2PO4^- and
