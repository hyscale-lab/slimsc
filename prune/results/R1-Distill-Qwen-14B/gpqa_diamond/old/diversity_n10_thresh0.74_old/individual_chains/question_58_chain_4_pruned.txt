Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and whether they require regularization at high energies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which theory never needs regularization when the energies are high. Regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences or infinities that appear in calculations. It's a way to make the math work out by introducing a cutoff or some other method to handle the divergent terms. So the theory that doesn't need this would presumably be one that doesn't have these kinds of problems, maybe because it's a classical theory or has some other feature that avoids infinities.

Looking at the options:

A) Superstring Theory
B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)
C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)
D) Classical Electrodynamics

I remember that Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) deals with electrons and photons. It's a quantum field theory, and I think it does have issues with renormalization. Wait, isn't QED known for needing renormalization because of loop divergences? Because when you calculate things like the electron self-energy or the photon vacuum polarization, you get divergent integrals. So people like Feynman had to develop renormalization techniques for QED. Renormalization is related to regularization, but I think they're similar concepts. So QED does require regularization.

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory of the strong force. It also is a quantum field theory and uses the same kind of perturbative methods as QED. So QCD would definitely require regularization, especially since at high energies (like in the UV limit), the coupling becomes weaker (asymptotic freedom), but I'm not sure if that affects regularization. Still, QCD calculations would have divergences that need handling, so they probably use regularization techniques.

Superstring Theory is a quantum theory of strings. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same kind of divergences as QFTs. Or wait, perhaps they don't require the same kind of regularization because the underlying framework is different. String theories work at higher energies better, maybe not needing the same cutoffs because the description is different. So maybe superstring theory doesn't require regularization. But I'm not entirely sure. Some sources I've read suggest that string theories avoid some types of divergences, but I'm not certain if that means they never require regularization. Alternatively, maybe they do use some forms of regularization but in a different way.

Then there's option D, Classical Electrodynamics. That's the Maxwell's equations kind of theory, which is classical. Since it's a classical theory, there's no quantum fluctuations or loops. So it doesn't involve the same divergences that quantum theories have, like the infinite charge density at a point charge. Wait, but in classical ED, there are issues like the infinite self-energy of a point charge. How is that handled? Oh, wait, in classical ED, you often ignore those infinities because you can't have a point charge in reality. But when you quantize it, as in QED, you have to deal with these things. So in the classical version, they don't require regularization because they don't use perturbative expansions with loops. But wait, wait. The question is about the theory never requiring regularization
