Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is stationary before the decay. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays into two or more particles, conservation laws like energy and momentum must be applied.

The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c² and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, what about the neutrino? Oh right, neutrinos have very tiny masses, but since we don't have a specific value, I think in these kinds of problems, the neutrino's mass is usually neglected. So I can treat the neutrino as massless for this calculation.

I need to find the kinetic energies of the muon and the neutrino. Hmm, but wait, wait. In the rest frame of the pion, the total momentum before decay is zero. So after the decay, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to conserve momentum. So, their momenta are equal and opposite. That means the magnitudes of their momenta are the same, but directions are opposite.

Let me think about energy conservation. The total energy before decay is just the rest energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The energy of each particle is the sum of their rest energy and kinetic energy. But for the neutrino, since its rest mass is negligible, its energy is approximately equal to its kinetic energy. Similarly, for the muon, its energy is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy.

So let me denote:
- m_pi = 139.6 MeV/c²
- m_mu = 105.7 MeV/c²
- m_nu ≈ 0, so E_nu ≈ K_nu

The total energy after decay is E_mu + E_nu = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + (K_nu)
But since m_mu c² is 105.7 MeV, let's write E_mu as 105.7 + K_mu.

So energy conservation gives:
m_pi c² = (m_mu c² + K_mu) + K_nu
So, 139.6 = (105.7 + K_mu) + K_nu
Which simplifies to K_mu + K_nu = 139.6 - 105.7 = 33.9 MeV.

But we have another equation from momentum conservation. Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum is zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. So the magnitudes are the same.

Momentum p is given by sqrt( (E/c)^2 - (m c)^2 ) * c. So for each particle:

p_mu = sqrt( (E_mu/c)^2 - (m_mu c)^2 ) * c
Similarly for p_nu, but since m_nu ≈0, E_nu = p_nu c.

So p_mu = p_nu.

Wait, let me write that in terms of equations:

E_mu^2 = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2
E_nu^2 = (p_nu c)^2 + (m_nu c^2)^2 → since m_nu is negligible, E_nu ≈ p_nu c.

But since p_mu = p_nu, let's denote p as their common magnitude.

So, E_mu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )

Similarly, E_nu = p c.

So, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) + p c = m_pi c².

Wait, but m_pi c² is 139.6 MeV, right?

So, we have the equation:

sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 )
