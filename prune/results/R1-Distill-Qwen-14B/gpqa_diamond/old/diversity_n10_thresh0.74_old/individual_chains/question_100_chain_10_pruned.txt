Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem starts with Compound A, which is C3H6. Hmm, wait, C3H6 is an alkene because the formula is CnH2n. For n=3, 2n=6, so it's an alkene. There are two possible structures for this: propene (propylene) or cyclopropane. But cyclopropane is C3H6 too. Oh wait, but cyclopropane is a strained ring. I think in this reaction, since it's undergoing bromination in CCl4, which typically is a substitution reaction for alkenes, probably via an addition mechanism. Wait, no, wait. Bromination in CCl4 is usually for alkenes; it's a bromination via an addition reaction, like adding Br2 across a double bond. So if A is C3H6, then it's propene. Because cyclopropane would undergo ring-opening perhaps, but I'm not sure.

So, Compound A (C3H6 is propene) undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form compound B. Propene plus Br2 would add Br across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) would add Br2 to give 1,2-dibromopropane? Wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. When Br2 adds to it, the double bond breaks,
