Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable. Hmm, let's see. The question says the state of the system is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). And there's this observable represented by matrix P. I need to find the probability that measuring P gives 0.

Wait, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian matrices, and the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of that matrix. Oh right, so the first thing I should probably do is find the eigenvalues of matrix P because those will be the possible measurement outcomes. The probability of each outcome is the square of the absolute value of the corresponding eigenvector's components.

Wait, but wait. The state vector given is (-1, 2, 1), right? Or is it a column vector? Oh, the question says it's a column matrix, so it's a column vector. Let me write that down. The state vector is |Ïˆ> = [-1; 2; 1]. But wait, do I need to normalize it? Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their norm is 1. Let me check the norm of this vector. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1 = 6. So the norm is sqrt(6), so the actual state should be 1/sqrt(6) times this vector if it's normalized. But wait, the problem doesn't say anything about normalization. Hmm. Oh,
