Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model where GADD45G is overexpressed. The goal is to study its role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The person introduced a coding sequence with a single influenza hemagglutinin determinant at the N-terminus. They transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells with this plasmid using Lipofectamine and selected antibiotic-resistant colonies. However, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the sequence provided, it's the plus strand of the construct. I need to figure out why the protein isn't being expressed. The options given are A to D, each suggesting a different reason.

First, I'll look at the sequence to see if there are any obvious issues. Since the protein isn't overexpressing, perhaps the construct is faulty. Let me check if the reading frame is correct, if there are stop codons, or any other issues.

The sequence is from 5' to 3'. Let's look for the start and stop codons. The start codon is at the beginning, which is ATG. Now, I'll scan through the sequence to find any in-frame stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA). If there's an early stop codon, the ribosome would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated or nonfunctional protein.

Looking for TAA, TAG, TGA:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTC... Hmm. Let's go through it carefully.

Wait, the first few bases are ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Looking for TGA or TAA or TAG in triplets.

Wait, let me go through each triplet:

The sequence starts with ATG (start). Then TAC (tyrosine), CCA (proline), TAC (tyr), GAT (aspartic acid), GCT (alanine), TCC (serine), AGA (arginine), TTA (leu?), etc. Hmm, perhaps I can search for the triplet sequences.

Wait, perhaps the presence of a TGA or TAA somewhere in the reading frame would cause a problem. Let me look.

Looking at the sequence, after the start codon, the next few triplets:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTC...

Breaking it down:

ATG TAC CCC ATA CGA TT CCA GAT TAC GCA CAA TGA...

Wait, wait, here: let's look for TGA.

Looking around the middle of the sequence:
