Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. The question is about what happens when 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, I need to figure out how many possible organic products are formed.

Wait, let me think. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. And when it's in ammonia, especially in a condensed solution, it's usually for elimination, probably E2 mechanisms. So this might be a dehydrohalogenation reaction.

The starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Wait, wait, benzene rings, substituents... Oh, 1-bromo-2-deutero benzene. So the bromine is at position 1, and the deuterium is at position 2. So the structure is a benzene ring with Br at one carbon and D (deuterium) at the adjacent carbon.

But wait, the reaction is NaNH2 in ammonia. That's a typical condition for elimination, specifically for dehydrohalogenation. So the bromide leaves, and a double bond is formed. But wait, wait, wait. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so if it's 1-bromo-2-d, the substituents are on adjacent carbons. 

Wait, but benzene is a ring, so positions 1 and 2 are next to each other. So the bromine is on carbon 1, and the deuterium is on carbon 2.

In an E2 elimination, the hydrogen (or deuterium) abstracted is anti to the leaving group (bromine), and the electrons form a double bond. So the H and Br are on adjacent carbons but opposite sides (anti) for the E2 mechanism.

Wait, but in a benzene ring, each carbon is connected to the next. So if the Br is on C1 and the D is on C2, what happens when they eliminate? 

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, benzene is a planar molecule. So the substituents are all on the same plane. So, can the H (or D) on C2 be anti to the Br on C1? Because in E2, the H and leaving group need to be antiperiplanar. But in benzene, all substituents are adjacent in a circle. So the H on C2 and Br on C1 are adjacent on the ring.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me visualize it. The benzene ring: C1 has Br, C2 has D. The positions are adjacent. So if the Br is on C1, and the D is on C2, then their positions are right next to each other. In a chair conformation, maybe, but benzene doesn't have a chair. Oh wait, it's a flat ring. So in what way could they be anti?

Wait, in a flat ring, each substituent is in a plane. So for E2, the H and Br need to be on opposite sides (i.e., dihedral angle of 180 degrees).
