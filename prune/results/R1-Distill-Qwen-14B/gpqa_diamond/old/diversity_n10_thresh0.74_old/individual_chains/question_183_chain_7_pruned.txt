Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a certain reaction.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is either a ring or a double bond. So I need to find how many rings and double bonds are present in the product after the reaction.

The reagents are red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh wait, I think red phosphorus is used in the hydroborylation reaction, but wait, no, another reaction comes to mind. Red phosphorus with HI is often used in the Perkow reaction, which is for the addition to carbonyl groups. Oh wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's about the elimination or addition in a different context. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's more for ketones and amines to remove carbonyl groups. Or wait, maybe it's about the reduction of triple bonds or something else. No, another thought: red phosphorus and HI is used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes, maybe for anti-Markovnikov addition?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Red phosphorus is often a catalyst in some reactions. Oh, right! The reaction with HI and red phosphorus is used for the cleavage of carbonyl groups. For example, when
