Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm going to try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's give it a go.

The problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of spin. Then, there's an operator whose matrix elements A_ij are hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. We need to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate of this operator and the average value of the operator.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

First, I need to normalize the state |alpha>. Because it's given as proportional to those terms, so the coefficients aren't necessarily normalized yet. The coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i) for |up> and |down> respectively.

So, the state |alpha> can be written as:
|alpha> = ( (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ) / N
where N is the normalization factor.

To find N, I calculate the inner product of the state with itself and set it equal to 1.

Calculating the inner product:

(1+i)(1-i) for |up><up| term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1 - i + i - i² = 1 - (-1) = 2.

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the inner product is (a + b)(a* + b*), but for the state |alpha>, the coefficients are (1+i) and (2-i), so the normalization is |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2.

Yes, because in quantum mechanics, the state's norm is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of the coefficients.

So |1+i|^2 is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2, because 1+i's magnitude squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Wait, no. Wait, |a + ib|^2 is a² + b². So |1 + i|² = 1² + 1² = 2.

Similarly, |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So, the normalization factor N squared is 2 +5 =7. So N= sqrt(7). So, the state is correctly normalized as |alpha> = [ (1+i) |up> + (2 -i) |down> ] / sqrt(7).

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation where A_ij = hbar/2 if i≠j, and 0 otherwise. So for a 2x2 matrix, it would look like:

[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, because when i≠j, A_ij is hbar/2. So in the first row, second column and second row, first column, it's hbar/2, and the diagonals are zero.

Wait, that's a 2x2 matrix. So the operator A is this matrix
