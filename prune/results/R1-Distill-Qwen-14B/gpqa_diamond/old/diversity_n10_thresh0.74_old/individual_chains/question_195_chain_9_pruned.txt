Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and see what it's about.

So, there are two planets. The first has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. Its orbital period is 3 days. The question is about a second planet, which is twice as big as Earth (2.5 Earth radii), and we need to find the maximum orbital period it can have while still causing both transit and occultation events. Both planets share the same orbital plane and the second planet's orbit is also circular.

Hmm, okay, so transit and occultation events. Transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we can't see its light—so the planet's light is blocked. For both events to happen, the planet must be in a position where it can both pass in front of and behind the star. That probably depends on the size of the planet's orbit relative to the star's size.

Wait, but how does the orbital period factor into this? Oh right, the orbital period determines the size of the orbit. Because of Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis (which, since it's circular, is just the radius). The formula is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, or in the version using astronomical units and solar masses, P² = a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. But wait, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii, but what about its mass?

Wait, the problem gives the star's radius, not its mass. But for Kepler's third law, we need the mass of the star. Oh, but wait, the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, but the mass isn't given. Oh, but wait, maybe I can assume the star's mass is like the Sun's? Because for stars with radii similar to the Sun, the mass is about the same, especially if we're not given any other info. So, I think I'll proceed under the assumption that the star's mass is approximately 1 solar mass.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the first planet has an orbital period of 3 days. So using Kepler's third law, I can find the semi-major axis (a) of the first planet's orbit. Then, for the second planet, I can find the maximum a where it's still possible for both transits and occultations to occur.

Wait, no, wait. Because both transit and occultation events require that the planet passes in front of and behind the star. But for that to happen, the planet's orbital radius must be such that the planet's position relative to the star's position varies enough. Wait, perhaps the key here is that the planet's orbital distance must be less than or equal to the star's radius plus the planet's radius. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, no, that might not be right. Let me think about the transit condition. For a transit to occur, the planet must pass in front of the star. The impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) from the
