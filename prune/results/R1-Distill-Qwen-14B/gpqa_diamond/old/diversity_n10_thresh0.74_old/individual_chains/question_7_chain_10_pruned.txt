Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it's everywhere in the universe. The question is about high-energy gamma-rays annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs.

The process given is γγ → e+ e-. So, a gamma-ray photon and a CMB photon collide and produce an electron and a positron. The question is asking from what energy γ-rays their lifetimes in the universe would be limited by this process. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV.

Wait, what does it mean for the lifetime to be limited by this process? Oh right, that probably refers to the photon's mean free path. If a photon can annihilate with a CMB photon, it won't travel as far before doing so. So the energy at which the annihilation becomes significant would determine the photon's lifetime. If the annihilation happens quickly, the photon can't travel far, so its effective lifetime is short.

I think this involves some sort of cross-section calculation. The cross-section is a measure of the probability that a certain interaction will occur. If the cross-section is high enough, the photon will interact quickly, limiting its lifetime.

The general approach for such problems is to calculate the energy where the interaction length (mean free path) becomes comparable to the size of the universe or the distance the photon has to travel. Alternatively, the optical depth becomes about 1, meaning that the photon has a significant chance of interacting.

The cross-section for the γγ → e+ e- process is probably given by some formula. From what I remember, this process is a two-photon annihilation into a pair. The cross-section for this might depend on the energy of the photons involved.

The cross-section σ for γγ → e+ e- is proportional to the square of the logarithm of the energy, but wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think it's proportional to the square of the photon energy over the square of the electron mass or something like that.

Wait, the cross-section for pair production by two photons (gamma-gamma to e+ e-) is given by:

σ ≈ ( (α² / (4π)) (m_e² c^4) ) / (E_γ E_γ') )

But wait, that's when the photons are low energy. Wait, no, for high-energy photons, maybe the cross-section scales differently.

Wait, more accurately, the cross-section for two-photon pair production is given by:

σ ≈ (8 π α² (m_e^2 c^4) ) / (E1 E2) )

Where E1 and E2 are the energies of the two photons. But I'm not 100% sure if that's correct. Alternatively, for the process γγ → e+ e-, the cross-section is inversely proportional to the product of the energies of the two photons. So σ ≈ (constant) / (E1 E2).

But wait, for very high energies, maybe relativistic effects come into play. Hmm.

Alternatively, since the CMB photons have a known energy, and the gamma-ray photon is high-energy, maybe we can model E_cm, the center-of-mass energy, for the process. The reaction can occur only
