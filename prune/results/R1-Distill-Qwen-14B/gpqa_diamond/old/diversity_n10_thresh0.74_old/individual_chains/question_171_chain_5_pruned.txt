Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but let me see if I can figure this out.

The question is about six different benzene derivatives reacting with excess bromine. And we're supposed to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm, wait, what's that exactly? Oh right, when a substituent directs incoming groups to certain positions. The para-isomer would form if the substituent is a meta director, or maybe if it's an activating group that allows for para substitution.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. Electrophilic substitution—so the substituents on the benzene ring will direct the incoming Br+ either to the ortho, meta, or para positions. But for each substituent, the directing effect depends on whether they're activating or deactivating, and whether they're meta or ortho directors.

Each substituent in the compounds provided (1-6) will influence where the bromine adds. The question is about the para-isomer yield. So, the more the substituent directs to the para position, the higher the para-isomer's weight fraction. But wait, wait—no. Wait, in monobromination, each substituent will have a certain directing effect, and the product will be a mix of ortho, meta, and para, but with varying ratios.

Wait, but the question says that each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. Oh, no, wait, no—the question says that only one monobromo derivative is formed. Wait, wait, the question says: "only one monobromo derivative is formed." Oh, that's a bit confusing. So does that mean each substituent directs the Br to a single position, leading to only one product?

Wait, but that can't be the case because some substituents are meta directors and others are ortho/para. So perhaps it's about the major product, but in the given problem, each reaction gives only one product, which is the major product. So for each substance, bromine adds in a single position, which is the major product.

Wait, but how? Because, for example, a substituent that is an activating, ortho/para director would lead to a mixture, but perhaps under certain conditions or excess reagent, only one is formed. Or maybe it's about the para-isomer's weight fraction in each reaction. Wait no, the question says
