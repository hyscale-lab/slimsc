Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about buffer solutions and phosphate ions. I remember that buffer solutions are those that resist changes in pH when you add acids or bases. They're usually made by mixing a weak acid with its conjugate base or a weak base with its conjugate acid. 

The question says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 200 mL. In that solution, there are 1.00 grams each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. The temperature is 25°C, and we need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

Wait, orthophosphate is PO4^3-, right? But I'm a bit confused because phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. The problem gives the Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 values for H3PO4. Let me jot those down: 

Ka1 = 7.5x10^-3
Ka2 = 6.2x10^-8
Ka3 = 1.8x10^-12.

Hmm, so H3PO4 is a triprotic acid. It can donate three protons. The first dissociation is H3PO4 → H+ + H2PO4^- with Ka1. The second is H2PO4^- → H+ + HPO4^2- with Ka2. The third is HPO4^2- → H+ + PO4^3- with Ka3.

But wait, the salts we have are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about what each of these salts dissociates into.

KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. When it dissolves in water, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. So that gives me H2PO4^-.

Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it gives Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So that gives HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, I have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. That's interesting. I remember that when you mix a weak acid (like H2PO4^-) with its conjugate base (like HPO4^2-), it forms a buffer solution. So this solution is a buffer solution involving H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which is PO4^3-. So I'm a bit confused because the initial salts produce H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, but not PO4^3-. Unless some of the HPO4^2- depro
