Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty in an electron's energy. Hmm, okay, I remember from my studies that this has something to do with Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. Let me think about how that works.

The question says the electron is moving along the x-direction with a speed v of 2*10^8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. I need to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE.

Wait, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But since we're looking for the minimum uncertainty, I think we can take the equality Δx * Δp = ħ/2.

Right, so first I should find Δp, the uncertainty in momentum. Momentum p is mass times velocity, so p = mv. But since it's an uncertainty, Δp would be mΔv, but wait, wait. No, wait. If the speed is known exactly, then the uncertainty in velocity Δv is zero, which can't be right. Oh, wait, no, wait. No, I think the uncertainty in momentum comes from the uncertainty in velocity multiplied by mass. So Δp = m * Δv.

Wait, but in this problem, the speed v is given as 2e8 m/s. So if the speed is known exactly, then Δv would be zero, which would make Δp zero. That can't be right because the position uncertainty would be infinite. But in reality, the electron's speed isn't known exactly. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the uncertainty in velocity is non-zero, but since the problem gives v, maybe that's the average speed, and the actual speed has some uncertainty. Hmm, but the problem gives v as a
