Okay, so I've got this question about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, I remember that entropy is related to the area of the event horizon, right? Oh wait, the formula for the entropy S is something like S = (A * k) / (4 * l_p^2), where A is the area, k is Boltzmann's constant, and l_p is the Planck length. Yeah, I think that's right.

The question gives the angular size θ of the event horizon as 1e-17 degrees, and the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. So I need to find the size of the event horizon, calculate its area, and then plug that into the entropy formula.

First, let's think about the angular size. Angular size is usually in radians, so I should convert θ from degrees to radians. The conversion factor is π/180 radians per degree. So θ_rad = θ_deg * (π/180). Let me compute that. 1e-17 degrees * (π/180) ≈ 1e-17 * 0.01745 ≈ 1.745e-19 radians. So approximately 1.7e-19 radians.

Angular size θ is related to the actual size (diameter, perhaps) and the distance. The formula is θ ≈ s / d, where s is the size of the object. Wait, but is that for small angles where the approximation holds? Since θ is very small here, I think that's valid. So s ≈ θ * d.

Wait, but wait. Since θ is the angular diameter, the actual diameter of the event horizon would be s = d * θ. Oh wait, but wait—no, because θ is the angular size, which is the angle subtended by the diameter. So yeah, s = d * θ. So that's how to get the size.

d is given as 1e10 parsecs. Wait, but I should convert that to meters because the entropy formula uses SI units. 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 m = 3.086e26 meters.

So s = d * θ = 3.086e26 m * 1.745e-19 rad ≈ 5.372e7 meters. Wait, 3.086e26 * 1.7e-19 is approximately 5.246e7 m. So the diameter is about 5.25e7 meters, so the radius would be half of that, 2.625e7 meters.

But wait, the area of the event horizon is a sphere, so area A = 4π R^2. So R is the radius of the event horizon, which is 2.625e7 m. Let's compute R squared first.

R^2 = (2.625e7 m)^2 = approx (2.6e7)^2 = 6.76e14 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 * 6.76e14 ≈ 12.566 * 6.76e14 ≈ 8.47e15 m².

Wait, wait, let me do that more accurately. 2.625e7 squared is (2.625)^2 * 1e14 = 6.8906 * 1e14, so 6.89e14 m². Multiply by 4π: 4 * 3.1416 ≈12.566, so
