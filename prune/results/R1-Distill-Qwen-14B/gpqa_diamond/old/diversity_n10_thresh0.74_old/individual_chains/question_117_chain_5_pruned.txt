Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about isomers and optical isomerism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking which of the given organic compounds show optical isomerism. Optical isomerism, if I remember right, is when a compound has stereoisomers that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, causing the compound to rotate plane-polarized light. These stereoisomers are called enantiomers, and they must have a chiral center, which is a carbon atom attached to four different groups.

The options given are four different compounds, and the choices are which of them exhibit optical activity. Let's go through each one by one.

1. The first compound is dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Okay, so it's a biphenyl structure with substituents. Biphenyls can have what's called a biphenyl group, which can have some kind of stereoisomerism if there's a possibility of the rings being in different positions. Wait, but biphenyls can have something called conformational isomerism, but that's different from stereoisomerism. Oh wait, no—wait, in biphenyls, if the two rings are connected in a way that allows for different arrangements, but I think that's geometric isomerism or maybe conformational. But optical isomerism would require a chiral center.

Wait, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's see. The structure is dimethyl, so two methyl ester groups attached. The substituents are at positions 2 and 6 on each benzene ring. Wait, 6,6'-dinitro means each benzene has a nitro group at the 6 position. And the 2,2' positions have carboxylate ester groups. So each benzene ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester at positions 2 and 6.

Wait, but each of the benzene rings—do they have any substituents that would make them chiral? No, because benzene rings are flat, and substituents are on them, but unless a carbon attached to the ring has four different groups, there won't be a chiral center. So, the central carbon where the two benzene rings are connected—each benzene is connected via a single bond. So that's a single bond between the two carbons. Wait, the biphenyl group is connected by a single bond, allowing for rotation, but that's conformational isomerism, not stereoisomerism. So even if the substituents are in different positions, it's not a stereoisomer but a conformational one. But wait, this is a question about optical is
