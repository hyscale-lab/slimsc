Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look normalized, does it? Oh right, because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors must have a norm of 1. So I think I need to normalize this state first. Let me jot that down.

The state vector is ψ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To normalize it, I calculate the norm squared, which is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state is ψ_normalized = [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T. Got that.

Now, the operators for the observables P and Q are given. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row as (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Hmm, that's a bit of a complex matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

And the operator Q is given by a diagonal matrix:

Q = [ [1, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, 0],
       [0, 0, -1] ]

The question is asking: if we measure P first and then measure Q, what's the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q?

Wait, no. Wait, the wording says "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P." But the question is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q. So the measurement sequence is P first, then Q.

In quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the corresponding operator. So first, measuring P would collapse the state into an eigenstate of P. Then, measuring Q would collapse it further based on that new state.

But actually, no, because after the first measurement, the state is projected onto an eigenstate of P. Then, when we measure Q, it's based on that new state.

Hmm, but wait, I think I need to find the probability of getting 0 when measuring P, and then, given that outcome, the probability of getting -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the joint probability of both happening in sequence. So, first P=0, then Q=-1.

But perhaps I should approach this step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P, because when you measure P, the result will be an eigenvalue, and the state collapses into the corresponding eigenvector.

So, let me find the eigenvalues of P. To find the eigenvalues
