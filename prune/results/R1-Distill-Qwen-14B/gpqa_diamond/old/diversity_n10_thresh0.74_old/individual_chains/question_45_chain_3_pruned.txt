Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. 

Wait, right, the particles are spin-1/2, so they obey the Pauli exclusion principle. That means no two particles can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system. Since they're in a 1D well, each particle's state is determined by its quantum number n and its spin.

The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n² π² ħ²)/(2mL²). Oh, the problem says E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so E_n = n² E. Got it.

So each particle's energy is E multiplied by the square of its quantum number n. But because the particles are fermions, each must occupy a unique quantum state, considering spin as well.

Wait, but spin is another degree of freedom here. Spin-1/2 particles have two possible spin states: up and down. So for each n, we can have two particles with the same n but different spins. Because in 1D, the spatial part is just n, and spin is an additional quantum number.

So the particles can't have the same n and spin. So for each n, two particles can be placed. Let's think about how to fill the states.

We have four particles. So let's list the possible quantum numbers and spins.

The ground state would be the lowest energy state, where particles are filled into the lowest available n with their spins. Let's think about how to fill the four particles into the available states.

Each n can hold up to two particles (since spin is up and down). So for four particles, we can fill the first two n's completely (each with two particles) or maybe have to go higher.

Wait, but wait. Let's see. The possible states are (n, spin). So for n=1, two particles (spin up and down). Then n=2 can have two more (spin up and down), but if we have four particles, that would be n=1 and 2 filled. Wait, four particles would be exactly the first two n's, each with two particles.

Wait, but wait. The number of particles is four. So each n can hold two, so two n's (n=1 and 2) would account for four particles. So all four are in the first two levels.

But wait, that's if each n can hold two. So ground state: two in n=1 (spin up and down), and two in n=2 (spin up and down). So the energies would be E*(1²) * 2 particles and E*(2²) * 2 particles. So the total energy is 2E + 8E = 10E? Wait, no, wait, each particle's energy is n² E. So for each particle in n=1, it's E. Two of them: 2E. For n=2, each is 4E, so two particles is 8E. Total for four particles is 10E.

Wait
