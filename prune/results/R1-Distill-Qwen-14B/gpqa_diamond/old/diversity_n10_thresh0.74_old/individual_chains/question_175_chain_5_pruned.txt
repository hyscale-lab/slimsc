Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, let's see what it says. The setup is an oscillating charge that's spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it oscillates, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis.

The question is asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta=30 degrees, and the possible form of f in terms of lambda. The options are A to D, each with a fraction and a lambda dependence.

I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The radiation pattern depends on the symmetry of the charge distribution. Since it's spheroid-shaped and symmetric along the z-axis, I think it's similar to an electric dipole oscillating along the z-axis.

Wait, for a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern isn't isotropic. The intensity (which is power per unit solid angle) depends on the angle theta. For a dipole, the intensity pattern is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis, right? So the maximum intensity is at theta=90 degrees. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, a dipole's radiation has intensity that's proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)) in some cases. Wait, no, wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

I think for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far zone (radiation zone) is given by the dipole radiation formula. The intensity (which is the power per unit area) is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) / (r^2), where theta is the polar angle from the dipole axis. Wait, no, that's for the electric field. The intensity, which is the power per solid angle, is different. Let's get this right.

The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ0 * (d^2E/dt^2)^2 ) / (12π c^3) ) * something... Wait, perhaps I should recall the formula for the intensity (I) as a function of theta.

Oh right, the intensity for a dipole is I = ( ( (μ0 * (e^2) * (a^4) ) / (4π ε0 c^3) ) ) * ( (1 + 3
