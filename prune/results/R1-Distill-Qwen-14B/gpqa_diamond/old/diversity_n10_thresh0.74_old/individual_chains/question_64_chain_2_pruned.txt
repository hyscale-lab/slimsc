Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about heating a mixture of salts and then analyzing the resulting gases. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

So the problem states that an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams, was heated to 200°C without air. Then, only a mixture of gases formed, which were passed through several tubes. The results from these tubes give some data, and I need to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B.

First, I need to understand what's happening in each of the tubes. The gases passed through anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, then Ca(OH)2 solution, and then red-hot copper.

Tube 1: Mg(ClO4)2 is a drying agent. When it's anhydrous, it absorbs water vapor. So if the gas mixture contains water, the tube would gain weight. The problem says tube 1 increased by 3.60 grams. So that suggests that the gas had water vapor in it, which was absorbed here.

Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. I remember that when CO2 gas is passed through a solution of Ca(OH)2, it forms calcium carbonate precipitate. So if the gas had CO2, tube 2 would react. But the problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change. So that suggests that no CO2 was present in the gas mixture.

Tube 3: Red-hot copper. I think this is a setup for the reaction where CO (carbon monoxide) is oxidized to CO2. So if there's CO in the gas, it would react with copper to form CO2 and Cu. The tube's weight increased by 0.80 grams, which came from the CO that was oxidized.

The remaining gas after these tubes is 2.24 liters under standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP is 0°C and 1 atm, where 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles.

Now, let's figure out what each gas was.

From tube 1: gained 3.60g of H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So 3.6 / 18 = 0.2 mol of H2O. So the gas mixture had 0.2 moles of H2O.

Tube 3: 0.80g gained. Since CO has a molar mass of 28 g/mol, 0.80 /28 = 0.02857 mol (approx 0.0286 mol) of CO. So the gas mixture had 0.0286 mol of CO.

The remaining gas after all this is 0.1 moles. What's left? Well, since CO2 didn't react in tube 2, but tube 2 didn't gain any weight. Wait, no, wait. The problem says the weight of tube 2 didn't change, so it didn't absorb any CO2. That suggests that either there was no CO2 in the gas, or that the CO2 didn't react, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the gas didn't contain any CO2. So maybe the only gases were H2O (as vapor), CO, and another gas.

Wait, but after passing through all the tubes, the only gas left is gas C, which is 0.1 moles. Let's see: after the reactions, the H2O is absorbed in tube 1. CO is absorbed in tube 3 (it reacts with copper to form CO2). So any CO2 would then react with tube 2 (Ca(OH)2). But since tube 2 didn't gain weight, perhaps the CO2 wasn't present, or the amount was so small that it didn't show, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, let me think again. The gas mixture after tube 3 is gas C.
