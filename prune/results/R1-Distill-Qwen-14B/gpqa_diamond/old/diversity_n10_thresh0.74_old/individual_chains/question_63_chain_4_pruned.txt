Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question says the molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. So, I remember that in such models, the molecule is treated as a system where both rotation and vibration are considered, unlike the rigid rotor model which ignores vibration.

The molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon, causing it to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized and given by something like E_J = B J(J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, maybe the energy levels are a bit different? Or perhaps the question is focusing on the vibrational part.

Wait, the problem also mentions an angular frequency of vibration, ω, which is 4e14 rad/s. Oh, right, that's the vibrational angular frequency. So maybe this problem is about the vibrational energy transition.

But wait, the question asks about the momentum of the absorbed photon. So the photon's energy should match the energy difference between two states.

Wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state. In quantum mechanics, the fundamental state would be the lowest energy state. So if it's a diatomic molecule, the ground state is the state with the lowest vibrational and rotational energy. But in the non-rigid rotor model, does it mean that the rotational energy is considered along with the vibrational?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me break it down.

The molecule is initially in the fundamental state. The fundamental state for vibration is the ground vibrational state, n=0. But rotationally, the ground state is J=0. So the molecule is in the state (n=0, J=0), perhaps.

But when it absorbs a photon, it transitions to the next lowest energy state. What's the next state? The next higher energy state would be either increasing the vibrational quantum number (n=1) or increasing the rotational quantum number (J=1). Which transition requires less energy?

Wait, because the photon's energy would have to match the energy difference between the two states. The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the one where the energy increase is smallest.

So I should calculate the energy needed for both a vibrational transition and a rotational transition and see which is smaller.

Wait, but the question is about the next state. The next state after (n=0, J=0) would likely be the next higher energy, which could be either a vibrational transition (n=1, J=0) or a rotational transition (n=0, J=1). So which transition requires a smaller energy change?

The energy levels for vibration are given by E_vib = (n + ½) h ω. The energy difference between n=0 and n=1 is ΔE_vib = h ω.

For rotation, in the rigid rotor model, E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For J=0, E_rot=0. For J=1, E_rot = 2B. So the energy difference is 2B. But wait, the molecule is considered non-rigid; does that change the rotational energy levels
