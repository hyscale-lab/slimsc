Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. A spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. I need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. The options are A to D. 

Alright, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator and ψ is the state. So the first thing I should probably do is find the expectation value of σz and σx individually and then combine them.

Wait, the given state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The coefficients squared add up to (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. So that's good, normalized.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value is just the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. 

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the probability of |↑⟩ is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. The probability of |↓⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the expectation value of 10σz would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5. But wait, I'll get to that later. Let me also find ⟨σx⟩.

Wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is different. The expectation value of σx is more complicated because |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, not σx. So I can't directly compute it like σz. I need to find the expectation value another way.

I remember that σx can be written in terms of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. Let me think. The Pauli matrices: σz is diagonal, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So maybe the expectation value is calculated using the state as a vector.

Alternatively, I can express σx in terms of its eigenstates or use the formula for expectation values.

The state is ψ = a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, where a=0.5 and b= sqrt(3)/2.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by (a* b + b* a) where a and b are coefficients. Wait, no. Let me think more carefully.

Wait, σx is represented as a matrix. So to compute ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩, I can write this as:

⟨ψ| = [a*, b*] (since |↑⟩ is the first basis vector
