Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma and n vectors. Oh wait, sigma is the Pauli spin matrices, right?

Wait, the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product would involve multiplying each component by the corresponding sigma matrix and then adding them up. But since n is a unit vector, it's normalized, so n squared is 1. But wait, no, the dot product is actually summing the products of the components. Oh right, so H is a 2x2 matrix because each sigma is 2x2.

Eigenvalues... right, for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are plus and minus 1. Because, for example, sigma_x has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But wait, H here is epsilon multiplied by the dot product of sigma and n. So wait, H is like epsilon times a unit vector in some direction multiplied by the Pauli matrices.

Wait, the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so H must be Hermitian too because epsilon is a real constant (given as energy dimension). So the eigenvalues should be real.

So what's the general form of H? Let's think. Let me denote n as (n_x, n_y, n_z), because it's a unit vector. Then H would be epsilon*(n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z). Oh right, that's the same as epsilon multiplied by the vector n dotted with sigma vector.

Now, each sigma is a Pauli matrix. So what's the eigenvalue of the operator (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z)?

Wait, I remember that for any unit vector n, the operator (n · sigma) has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because sigma matrices are like spin components, and when you have a spin in some direction, the eigenvalues are plus and minus the spin component.

So if that's the case, then when you multiply by epsilon, the eigenvalues will be epsilon * (+1) and epsilon * (-1), right?

So the eigenvalues of H are +epsilon and -epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B says +epsilon and -epsilon. Option C is about hbar/2 times epsilon, but I don't see any hbar in the problem statement. The Pauli matrices are usually represented without hbar factors because, for example, sigma_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]], which has eigenvalues ±1 when multiplied by 1. So if H is epsilon times a sum of sigmas, each term would contribute 1 and -1, so the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon.

Wait, but wait. Maybe I'm mixing up notation. Let me think again. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So the operator (n · sigma) has eigenvalues ±1. Therefore, multiplying by a constant epsilon gives eigenvalues ±epsilon.

So the correct answer would be option B.


The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with energy dimensions, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The Pauli matrices (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) are Hermitian, and their eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\). 

For the operator \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})\), which is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \(\vec{n}\), the eigenvalues are also \(\pm 1\) because \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector. When this operator is scaled by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \(\varepsilon\), not just \(\pm 1\).
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct because the eigenvalues of \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})\) are \(\pm 1\), and multiplying by \(\varepsilon\) gives \(\pm \varepsilon\).
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because there is no \(\hbar\) factor in the problem statement.
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because it does not involve \(\varepsilon\), which is explicitly part of the Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

Answer: B
