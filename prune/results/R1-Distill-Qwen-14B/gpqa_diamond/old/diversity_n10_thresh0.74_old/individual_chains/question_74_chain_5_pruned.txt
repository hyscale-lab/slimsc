Okay, so I've got this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but let me try to work through it.

Alright, the question says we have an atom that's been around for 50 minutes and hasn't decayed. We know from experiments that the probability of decay is 32% within 100 minutes. Now, we want to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes after the initial 50 have passed.

Wait, wait. So the initial decay probability is 32% over 100 minutes. But now, 50 minutes have gone by without decay, and we're looking for the probability over the next 150. Hmm, does that mean the total time could be 200 minutes? Or is it just 150 minutes starting now?

Wait, no. The problem is phrased as, "the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes." So, the time we're considering is the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes into its existence.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model. The key idea is that the decay process is memoryless, meaning the probability of decay in the next interval doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So, each atom has a certain probability of decaying in a given time, regardless of how old it is.

So, the decay probability over a time t is given by 1 minus the exponential function. The formula is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

But wait, how do I find λ from the given information? Oh right, because the probability of decay in 100 minutes is 32%, which is 0.32. So:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)

I can rearrange this to solve for λ.

Let me compute that. Subtract 1 from both sides: 0.32 - 1 = -e^(-100λ), so -0.68 = -e^(-100λ). Multiply both sides by -1: 0.68 = e^(-100λ). Take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln
