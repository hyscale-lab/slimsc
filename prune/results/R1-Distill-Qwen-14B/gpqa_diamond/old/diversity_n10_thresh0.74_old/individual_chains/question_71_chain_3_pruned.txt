Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm, let's see what I remember about equilibrium temperature and orbital periods.

Wait, equilibrium temperature relates to how much energy a planet absorbs from its star. The basic formula I think is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16 * π * σ * D² )) )^(1/4) ), but maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_eff * sqrt(R/(2D)), where T_eff is the star's effective temperature, R is its radius, and D is the planet's distance from the star. Or wait, actually, another version I remember is that the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because the farther away, the cooler.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, right! The equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * ( (1 - albedo) / (2 * (1 + e)^(1/2)) )^(1/4) ) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), where a is the semi-major axis. But since they're in circular orbits, the eccentricity e is zero. So that simplifies the formula.

Wait, but in this problem, all the planets have the same albedo. So the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio. So when comparing Planet_4 and Planet_2, their albedos are the same, so that part doesn't matter.

So the key is the distance from the star. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. Because T_eq is proportional to (L/(16πσ D²))^(1/4), which simplifies to (1/D)^(1/2), because (D²)^(1/4) is D^(1/2). So T_eq ∝ 1/√D.

But wait, the problem gives the orbital periods in a ratio. The periods are 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So each planet's period is a multiple of the first one's period. Let's assign variables. Let P1 = P, so the periods are P1 = P, P2 = 2P, P3 = 2.5P, P4 = 3.5P
