Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again and see what it's about. Hmm. The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. They've given the volumes and masses of two compounds: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Oh right, and there are these Ka values for H3PO4 too.

Wait, orthophosphate ions are PO4^3- right? No, wait, H3PO4 is the fully protonated form. So deprotonating H3PO4 gives H2PO4^- (that's the first dissociation), then HPO4^2- (second), and finally PO4^3- (third). So orthophosphate is PO4^3-, which is the completely deprotonated form.

But wait, the solution has both KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So KH2PO4 is K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Na2HPO4 is Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. So when they dissolve in water, they'll dissociate into their respective ions. But then, phosphate can undergo further dissociation. So I think this is a buffer solution situation, but maybe involving two different phosphate species.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the concentration of orthophosphate ions, PO4^3-.

So, I need to find [PO4^3-] in the solution. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, let's calculate the moles of each compound present. That's a starting point.

The volume is 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. So the concentration would be moles divided by 0.2 L.

Molar masses given: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol.

So moles of KH2PO4 = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 136.09 is approximately 0.007337 mol. Hmm, wait, 1/136 is about 0.00735, so yeah, around 0.007337.

Similarly, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O would be 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol. Let me compute that. 1 / 177.99 is approximately 0.005613 mol.

Wait, but Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. When it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- and 2 H2O. So the moles of HPO4^2- would be 0.005613 mol.

Now, in solution, HPO4^2- can
