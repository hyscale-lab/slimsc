Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to work through it. I remember from my notes that when you measure an observable in quantum mechanics, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of the corresponding operator matrix. The probability of each outcome is determined by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state of the system.

Wait, the state is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3-dimensional vector. And the observable is represented by the matrix P. Let me write down P.

P looks like this:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Wait, so it's a 3x3 matrix. Let me arrange that:

P = 
[ 0        1/√2      0       ]
[1/√2      0       1/√2    ]
[ 0        1/√2     0       ]

I think I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix P. Because the observable's possible values are the eigenvalues, and the eigenvectors tell us the probabilities when the system is in a particular state.

So, the state vector is |ψ> = (-1, 2, 1)^T. Let me normalize it first, but wait, actually, in the probability calculation, I think I need to normalize it. So I should find the normalization factor.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4+1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1)^T.

But wait, the probability calculation might not require me to normalize it because perhaps the observable's eigenvectors are orthonormal. Hmm, maybe I can proceed without normalizing the state first. I'll think about that as I go.

So, first step: find the eigenvalues of P. To find eigenvalues, I need to solve det(P - λI) = 0.

Let me compute the characteristic equation.

The matrix (P - λI) is:

[ -λ       1/√2      0         ]
[1/√2     -λ      1/√2      ]
[
