Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and their light being absorbed by neutral hydrogen clouds. Hmm, I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at specific wavelengths. Oh right, the Lyman-alpha line is around 1216 Angstroms. Wait, that's in the ultraviolet range, right?

The question is about estimating the lower limit on the redshift so that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So, redshift... I think redshift (z) affects the wavelength we observe. When something is moving away, the light stretches, right? So the observed wavelength lambda_obs is lambda_emit multiplied by (1 + z). 

But wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by hydrogen clouds. So the absorption line would be at lambda_abs = 1216 Angstroms * (1 + z). But ground-based optical telescopes can't detect certain wavelengths. I remember that Earth's atmosphere is opaque to some UV light, like the ozone layer. So what's the cutoff?

Optical telescopes typically observe wavelengths from about 300 nm (which is 3000 Angstroms) up to maybe 2500 Angstroms (infrared). Wait, wait, more precisely, visible light is 400-700 nm, but optical telescopes can sometimes go a bit beyond. But the key is that if the observed wavelength is too short (like UV), it gets absorbed by the atmosphere and can't be seen from the ground. So the Lyman-alpha absorption has to shift into the optical range.

So, the Lyman-alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm (since 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm). If the absorption is at 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms, that needs to be greater than the cutoff wavelength that the telescope can observe.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the quasar's light is in the optical, but the hydrogen cloud's absorption is at Lyman-alpha, which is in the UV. When the quasar is at a high redshift, the absorption line moves into the optical range because of the redshift. So the Lyman-alpha absorption line would be at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. For it to be detectable in optical, this wavelength must be longer than the UV cutoff of the atmosphere.

So the maximum wavelength that can be observed from the ground is about 300 nm, which is 3000 Angstroms. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Earth's atmosphere doesn't transmit wavelengths below about 300 nm, so anything bluer than that (shorter wavelength) is absorbed. So the Lyman-alpha line, when redshifted, must be longer than that 300 nm (3000 Angstroms) to be observed. Or wait, noâ€”because if the quasar is at a high redshift, the Lyman-alpha line shifts into longer wavelengths, possibly into the optical range where telescopes can see it.

Wait, maybe I should think about when the Lyman-alpha
