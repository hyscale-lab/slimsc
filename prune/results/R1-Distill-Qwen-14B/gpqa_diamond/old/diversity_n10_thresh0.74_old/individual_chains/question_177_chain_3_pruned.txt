Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the question involves two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let me jot down the given information.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 * R2.

Mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times that of Star_2. So M1 = 1.5 * M2. Hmm, but wait, does the mass affect the luminosity? I remember that luminosity for stars is often related to their radius and temperature, not directly to their mass. Or is it through other factors like in the mass-luminosity relation? Oh, right, the mass-luminosity relation says that Luminosity is proportional to mass to some power, like L ∝ M^α, where α is around 3-4 for main-sequence stars. But I'm not sure if this is necessary here. Let me think.

The problem says that the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and they are the same. Oh, that must mean their peak emission wavelengths are the same. Wait, for black bodies, the peak wavelength is given by Wien's Law. Wien's Law says λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant and T is the temperature. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then their temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is the same, so T1 = T2. That's important.

So both stars have the same temperature. Wait, but how? Because usually, if two stars have different radii and masses, their temperatures might vary. But in this case, the peak wavelengths are the same, so T1 = T2.

Now, the problem says the astronomers calculated the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So we need to find L1/L2.

Luminosity of a star as a black body is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So in formula terms, L ∝ R² T⁴.

Since both stars have the same temperature (T1 = T2), the ratio of luminosities will be (R1² / R2²) * (T1⁴ / T2⁴). But since T is the same, T1⁴ = T2⁴, so that factor is 1.

So L1/L2 = (R1²)/(R2²). We know R1 = 1.5 R2, so R1/R2 = 1.5. Squaring that, (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25.

Wait, but let me check the options. Option A is ~2.25. But wait, the options are a bit close. Did I miss anything else?

Wait, the problem also mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has radial velocity 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How does radial velocity affect luminosity? Hmm. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Are they talking about Doppler shift affecting the observed wavelengths? Because when a star is moving towards us, its light is blueshifted,
