Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because electrophilic substitution reactions can get a bit tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about the para-isomer yield in monobromination reactions for six different benzene derivatives. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. Hmm.

First, I remember that in electrophilic aromatic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to either the ortho, meta, or para positions. Electron-donating groups typically activate the ring and direct the incoming group to ortho and para positions, whereas electron-withdrawing groups deactivate the ring and direct to meta positions. But wait, some groups are strong enough to direct in specific ways regardless.

So each of these substituents will influence where the bromine adds. The question is about the para-isomer yield, so I need to predict which substituents are more likely to lead to para substitution, and in what order.

Let's list the substituents:

1) C6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group attached to benzene. Methyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So para-substitution is a major product here. But wait, sometimes bulky groups can lead more to the para position because ortho might be hindered, but methyl isn't that bulky. So for toluene (methyl benzene), the para isomer is a significant product. How much? I think for toluene, the para isomer is the major, but it's more than meta and ortho? Or maybe the ortho and para are both possible, but more para than meta? I'm not sure about exact percentages.

2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5: That's a phenyl ester group. The substituent is COOEt (ethyl ester). The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. Wait, esters are usually meta directors because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. So the ester group is deactivating and meta-directing. So when bromine adds, it'll go to the meta position. So the para isomer would be less in this case. So for this substituent, the main product is meta, so para is a minor product.

3) C6H5-Cl: Chlorine is attached. Chlorine is an interesting substituent
