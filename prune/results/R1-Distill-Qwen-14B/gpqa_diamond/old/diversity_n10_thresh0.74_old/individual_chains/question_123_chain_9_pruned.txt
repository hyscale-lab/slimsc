Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames are those where Newton's laws hold, no acceleration. So from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Wait, that's pretty fast—like a significant fraction of the speed of light, I think.

Wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, right? So 60,000 is 20% of that. So we're definitely dealing with relativistic speeds here, which means I can't just use classical mechanics. I need to consider time dilation and possibly length contraction.

The question is asking: what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm. So let's clarify the frames. The Galaxy is stationary in its own frame. The ejecta is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. But from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at that same speed. So we have two frames: S (Galaxy) and S' (ejecta).

In the Galaxy frame (S), the ejecta is moving at v = 60,000 km/s towards the center. So in S, the ejecta's speed is v, and the time experienced by the ejecta (S') is different due to time dilation.

Wait, but the problem says that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So Δt' =50 s. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame during that time. So in S, the time experienced is longer because of time dilation.

So how do I relate the two? Let me think about the time experienced in each frame. The time in the Galaxy frame (Δt) is related to the ejecta's frame time (Δt') by the Lorentz factor gamma. The Lorentz factor γ is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but wait: the direction matters. Because the ejecta is moving towards
