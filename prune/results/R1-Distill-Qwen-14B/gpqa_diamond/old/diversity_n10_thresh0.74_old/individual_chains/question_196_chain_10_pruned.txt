Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass is attached to a spring and experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. But wait, this one's relativistic, so I'll have to consider special relativity effects.

The question asks for the maximum speed of the mass. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, let me recall the basic setup. In the non-relativistic case, the potential energy of a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is (1/2)kA², where A is the amplitude. The speed at the equilibrium point (x=0) is maximum. Using conservation of energy, the kinetic energy there is equal to the total energy, so (1/2)mv_max² = (1/2)kA², which gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m) = A√(k/m). But wait, that's the non-relativistic case, and the options have a 'c' in them, so this must be a relativistic scenario.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². The total relativistic energy is gamma mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The rest energy is mc², so the kinetic energy would be (gamma - 1) mc².

But wait, in this case, the oscillator's potential and kinetic energies change with position and velocity. At maximum amplitude, the potential energy is maximum, and kinetic is zero. At the equilibrium point, potential is zero, and kinetic is maximum.

So, for the relativistic case, the total energy (which is conserved) would be the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. But wait, in the harmonic oscillator, the potential is (1/2)kx², but we're in a relativistic context so maybe the potential energy expression is different? Or is the problem still using the classical Hooke's law F = -kx, implying the potential is (1/2)kx²?

Assuming that the potential energy is (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA² plus the rest energy? Wait, no. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², which is purely kinetic at the equilibrium point. But in relativity, the total energy at any point is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Hmm, maybe I need to model the energy correctly.

At maximum displacement x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But in relativity, the total energy also includes rest mass energy. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because in the non-relativistic case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², but in relativity, the energy is higher because of gamma.

Wait, perhaps the total energy E is gamma mc². Since the oscillator is moving, at some points the kinetic energy is higher, but the potential is lower. But at x=A, the potential is maximum (1/2 kA²), and kinetic is zero. So the total energy is E
