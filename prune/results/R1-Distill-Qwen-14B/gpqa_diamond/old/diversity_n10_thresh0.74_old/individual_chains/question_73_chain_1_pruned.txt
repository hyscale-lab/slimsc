Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember from my studies that when dealing with speeds close to the speed of light, you can't just use classical mechanics because the effects of relativity come into play. Right, so I should use Einstein's theory of relativity here.

The problem states: two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m are moving at 0.6c and 0.5c respectively in the positive x-direction. The options are A to D, each giving a relative speed and a total energy.

First, let's tackle the relative speed part. I think the formula for adding velocities in relativity is different from the classical addition. Oh right, the formula is (v1 + v2)/(1 + (v1*v2)/(c²)) but wait, that's when you're adding the speeds of two objects as observed from a stationary frame. But here, I'm supposed to find the relative speed of one astronaut as seen from the other's frame. So I have to calculate how fast one is moving relative to the other.

Wait, actually, no. Because both are moving in the same direction. So the relative speed isn't just 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c? But wait, no, that's not correct because of relativity. Because when you switch frames, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

Let me clarify. Let's say astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. From A's perspective, what is B's speed? Because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed isn't simply 0.1c. We need to apply the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u*v)/(c²)), where u is the speed of B in the stationary frame, and v is the speed of A. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think: if we're in A's frame, then A is stationary, and B is moving at a speed relative to A. So in the stationary frame (let's say the lab frame), A is moving at v = 0.6c, and B
