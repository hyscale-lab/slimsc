Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question involves heating a mixture of salts A and B, which are equimolar. The total mass is 7.20 grams. After heating, a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through some tubes with different reagents.

Let me list out what each part does:

1. Tube 1: Anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2. I remember that Mg(ClO4)2 is a strong desiccant and can absorb water. So any water vapor in the gas would be absorbed here. The tube's weight increased by 3.60 grams. That probably means 3.60 grams of water were removed.

2. Tube 2: Ca(OH)2 solution. Calcium hydroxide is a base and would react with acidic gases like CO2. If the weight didn't change, that suggests there was no reaction. So maybe there was no CO2 or another acid gas in the mixture? Or perhaps the amount was zero? Or maybe another possibility...

3. Tube 3: Red-hot copper. This setup is typically used to react with carbon monoxide (CO), converting it to CO2. The increase of 0.80 grams suggests that some CO was present. Since copper is involved, the reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. The product is CuO, so the increase in mass would be due to the oxygen from CO reacting with copper. Let me think about the calculations here.

The gases after all the tubes left was 2.24 liters of gas C under standard temperature and pressure (STP). STP conditions mean 1 mole is 22.4 liters. So 2.24 L is 0.1 moles.

Hmm, so what gases are we dealing with here?

Let me think about each step.

First, the heating of salts A and B. Since they're heated without air, it's likely a decomposition reaction. So the salts are probably decomposing into gases.

Looking at the tubes:

- Tube 1: Absorbs water, so the initial gases have water vapor. The mass gained (3.60 g) is H2O. So that means the decomposition produced water vapor, which was captured here.

- Tube 2: No change. So no CO2 or H2 was present, perhaps. Because Ca(OH)2 reacts with CO2 to form CaCO3 and water. If no reaction, then no CO2. Wait, but if there was H2, it would also react with Ca(OH)2? Or not? Let me remember: H2 is a reducing agent. H2 and Ca(OH)2 might not react directly unless under certain conditions. Hmm, perhaps if the gas had H2, it would react, but if the tube 2's weight didn't change, maybe there was no H2 either.

Wait, but hydrogen gas is light and can be flammable. Maybe it was used up elsewhere, but in this case, the tube with Ca(OH)2 didn't react, so perhaps H2 wasn't present. Or maybe the conditions didn't allow reaction, like if the solution was not basic enough, or maybe the gas wasn't acidic. Alternatively, maybe there's another possibility.

Then tube 3: reacts with CO. The mass increase is 0.80 grams. Let me compute how much CO was there. The reaction is 2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. For each 2 moles of CO, we get 1 mole of CuO. The molar mass of Cu is about 63.55 g/mol, O is 16. So CuO is 79.55 g/mol. Wait, but the mass gained is 0.80 grams. The CuO formed would have a mass equal to the oxygen in CO, because Cu comes from the tube which is red-hot, so it's in solid form.

Wait, let me think. The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.
