Okay, so I have this physics problem about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy of a nucleus moving at 0.96c. Hmm, I remember that RHIC collides heavy ions, so this must be about calculating the total energy of the nucleus when it's moving at that high speed. 

The question says the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium. So, what's the atomic number for lithium? I think lithium has an atomic number Z of 3. So, if it's Li-6 maybe? Because 3 protons, and 3 neutrons would make it Li-6. Wait, Li-6 is a stable isotope, right? So the mass number A is 3 + 3 = 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

I need to calculate the total energy of this nucleus when it's moving at 0.96 times the speed of light. The energy here is probably the total relativistic energy, which includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy. But wait, in particle physics, when they talk about the energy of a collider, they usually mean the total energy, not just the kinetic part.

The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So first, I'll compute gamma when v is 0.96c.

Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96c)^2 / c² is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = approximately 3.5714.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Let me compute 1 - (0.96)^2. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28. So yes, gamma is 1/0.28 which is 3.57142857... So approximately 3.5714.

Now, I need the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is m0 c². The mass of a single nucleon (proton or neutron) is about 938 MeV/c². Wait, but more accurately, the proton is about 938.272 MeV, and the neutron is about 939.565 MeV. Oh wait, maybe I should get the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, since Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, the total rest mass would be 6 nucleons. But wait, the actual mass is a bit less than 6 times the mass of a proton because of binding energy, but I think for this problem, we're to use the sum of individual nucleon masses, or perhaps the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, no, in particle physics, when calculating the rest mass of a nucleus, you have to account for the mass defect due to binding energy. But I don't remember the exact mass of Li-6 off the top of my head. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it as 6 times the mass of a proton. But wait, the actual mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 6 * 938 would be 5628 MeV, which is 5.628 GeV. But that's probably an overestimation, because the actual mass is less due to binding energy.

Alternatively, maybe I can look up the exact mass of Li-6. Hmm. Let me think. I'm pretty sure that the mass of Li-6 is about 6 atomic mass units (u). Because 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So 6 u is 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV, which is 5.589 GeV. But wait, that's an approximation because the actual mass is a bit different. Let me see, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a single nucleon multiplied by the number of nucleons in the nucleus, but that might not be precise.

Wait, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is given by the sum of the masses of its protons and neutrons. So for Li-6, which is 3 protons, 3 neutrons. So 3 * (mass of proton) + 3 * (mass of neutron). The mass of a proton is about 938.272 MeV/c², the neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c². So 3*(938.272 + 939.565) = 3*(1877.837) = 5633.51 MeV, which is 5.63351 GeV.

Wait, but that's the sum of individual nucleon masses, which is higher than the actual mass of Li-6 because the binding energy (mass defect) causes the nucleus's mass to be less. However, in this calculation, perhaps the problem is expecting me to use the sum of the individual masses, or perhaps the exact mass of Li-6.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the sum of the protons and neutrons. So 3*(938.272) + 3*(939.565) = let's compute that.

3 * 938.272 = 2814.816 MeV.

3 * 939.565 = 2818.695 MeV.

Total: 2814.816 + 2818.695 = 5633.511 MeV, which is 5.633511 GeV.

So m0 c² is 5.6335 GeV.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident about this approach. Another approach is to find the exact mass of the Li-6 nucleus in MeV. Let me think. I think the actual mass is about 5584 MeV/c². Wait, perhaps I can recall that the mass of ^6Li is approximately 5584.5 MeV/c². Let me confirm. 

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Wait, 1 atomic mass unit (u) is about 931.5 MeV/c². So ^6Li has a mass of about 6.016 u (I think that's the accurate value, considering mass defect). So 6.016 * 931.5 MeV. Let me calculate that.

6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.016 * 931.5 = approximately 14.9 MeV.

So total is about 5603.9 MeV, which is 5.6039 GeV.

Wait, that's different from the sum of the individual nucleon masses. Because the actual mass is less than the sum due to binding energy. So the rest mass energy is about 5.6039 GeV.

Hmm, the problem is giving me options in the range of about 20 GeV, so I need to compute gamma * m0 c².

Gamma was approximately 3.5714.

So E = gamma * m0 c² = 3.5714 * 5.6039 GeV.

Let me compute that.

3.5714 * 5.6039.

Let me compute 3.5 * 5.6039 = approx 19.61365.

0.0714 * 5.6039 ≈ 0.4012.

So total approx 19.61365 + 0.4012 ≈ 20.01485 GeV.

Wait, but that's an approximate calculation. Let me compute more accurately.

3.57142857 * 5.6039.

Hmm, 3 * 5.6039 = 16.8117.

0.57142857 * 5.6039 ≈ let's compute 0.5 * 5.6039 = 2.80195.

0.07142857 *5.6039 ≈ 0.4012.

So 0.57142857 *5.6039 ≈ 2.80195 + 0.4012 = 3.20315.

So total E ≈ 16.8117 + 3.20315 = 20.01485 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is close but a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps my approximations are causing this.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let me re-calculate gamma.

v = 0.96c → v² = (0.96)^2 c² = 0.9216 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784) = 0.28.

So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = exactly 3.57142857...

Wait, but perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Wait, 0.0784 is 0.0784. Let me compute sqrt(0.0784) exactly. Because 0.28^2 is 0.0784, so sqrt(0.0784)=0.28 exactly. So gamma is exactly 1/0.28 = 3.57142857...

So, 3.57142857...

Now, the mass of Li-6. Let me look it up more accurately. The exact mass of ^6Li is approximately 5584.5 MeV/c². So 5.5845 GeV.

So m0c² = 5.5845 GeV.

So E = gamma * m0c² = 3.57142857 * 5.5845 GeV.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 * 5.5845.

Let me use a calculator approach.

First, 3 * 5.5845 = 16.7535.

0.57142857 * 5.5845.

0.5 *5.5845 = 2.79225.

0.07142857 *5.5845 ≈ 0.07142857 *5.5845.

Compute 0.07 *5.5845 = 0.390915.

0.00142857 *5.5845 ≈ approx 0.00798.

So total is 0.390915 + 0.00798 ≈ 0.398895.

So 0.57142857 *5.5845 ≈ 2.79225 + 0.398895 ≈ 3.191145.

So total E = 16.7535 + 3.191145 = 19.944645 GeV.

Wait, that's about 19.9446 GeV. But the options given are A)18.475, B)23.069, C)20.132, D)21.419.

Hmm, 19.9446 is close to 20. But option C is 20.132, which is a bit higher. So perhaps my mass of Li-6 is wrong.

Wait, maybe the correct mass is higher. Let me think again. Let me find the exact mass of Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to calculate using the mass in atomic mass units (u), considering that the mass is 6.016 u for Li-6. So 6.016 u * 931.5 MeV/u = ?

Compute 6 * 931.5 = 5589 MeV.

0.016 * 931.5 = approx 14.904 MeV.

Total is 5603.904 MeV, which is 5.603904 GeV.

So m0c² = 5.603904 GeV.

Then E = 3.57142857 *5.603904.

Let me compute this:

3.57142857 *5.603904.

Compute 3 *5.603904 = 16.811712.

0.57142857 *5.603904.

0.5 *5.603904 = 2.801952.

0.07142857 *5.603904 ≈ let's compute 5.603904 *0.07 = 0.39227328.

5.603904 *0.00142857 ≈ approx 0.008 (exactly, 5.603904 * 0.00142857 ≈ 0.0079995).

So total for 0.07142857 is approximately 0.39227328 + 0.0079995 ≈ 0.40027278.

So 0.57142857 *5.603904 ≈ 2.801952 +0.40027278 ≈ 3.20222478.

So total energy E = 16.811712 + 3.20222478 = 20.0139368 GeV.

Ah, that's about 20.0139 GeV. So approximately 20.014 GeV.

Looking at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV, which is a bit higher. But our calculation is about 20.014 GeV. Hmm, perhaps I have an error in my mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact value for the mass of ^6Li. I think the exact value is 5584.3 MeV/c², which would be 5.5843 GeV. Let me try this.

E = 3.57142857 *5.5843.

3 *5.5843 = 16.7529.

0.57142857 *5.5843.

0.5 *5.5843 = 2.79215.

0.07142857 *5.5843 ≈ 0.07142857 *5.5843.

Compute 0.07 *5.5843 = 0.390901.

0.00142857 *5.5843 ≈ approx 0.007982.

So total 0.390901 +0.007982=0.398883.

So 0.57142857 *5.5843 ≈ 2.79215 + 0.398883=3.191033.

So total E=16.7529 +3.191033=19.943933 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.944 GeV. Still not matching the options. The options don't have 19.944; the closest is C)20.132.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass of Li-6. Alternatively, maybe I should use the mass as 6.016 u. Let me compute that again.

6.016 u *931.5 MeV/u = ?

6 *931.5=5589 MeV.

0.016 *931.5=14.904 MeV.

So total 5589 +14.904= 5603.904 MeV, which is 5.603904 GeV.

Now, E= gamma * m0 c²=3.57142857 *5.603904.

Let me compute that exactly.

3.57142857 *5.603904.

Breaking it down:

3.57142857 = 3 + 0.57142857.

So 3 *5.603904=16.811712.

0.57142857 *5.603904.

Let me compute this as (4/7) *5.603904.

Because 0.57142857 is 4/7.

Wait, 4/7 times 5.603904.

Let me compute 5.603904 *4 =22.415616.

Divide by 7: 22.415616 /7=3.202230857.

So 3.57142857 *5.603904=16.811712 +3.202230857=20.013942857 GeV.

So approximately 20.0139 GeV.

So the closest option is C)20.132 GeV, but there's a discrepancy. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps my calculation of gamma is wrong.

Wait, let me recheck gamma. v=0.96c. So beta=0.96. gamma=1/sqrt(1-beta^2).

Beta squared is 0.96^2=0.9216.

1-0.9216=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28, so gamma=1/0.28=3.57142857..., correct.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong mass. Let me check if the mass is per nucleon or per nucleus.

Wait, the question says the nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, which is Li-6. So the mass is that of a Li-6 nucleus. So perhaps the exact mass is 5.5843 GeV, not 5.6039.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 5.5843 GeV, which I'll use.

So E=3.57142857 *5.5843.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.5843.

3 *5.5843=16.7529.

0.57142857 *5.5843 ≈0.57142857 *5 =2.85714285; 0.57142857 *0.5843= approx 0.57142857 *0.5=0.285714285; 0.57142857 *0.08=0.0457142856; 0.57142857 *0.0043=0.0024571428.

So total for 0.5843: 0.285714285 +0.0457142856=0.33142857 +0.0024571428=0.33388571.

So 0.57142857 *5.5843 is approximately 3.19142857 GeV.

So E=16.7529 +3.19142857=19.9443 GeV.

Hmm, that's about 19.944 GeV.

But the options don't have that. The closest option is C)20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Because sometimes in these problems, it's easy to mix up the two.

Wait, the question says, 'the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) so that the speed of the nucleus X is equal to 0.96c.' The energy in colliders is usually the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's stated as the total energy. Hmm, but I'm not certain. Let me think.

In high-energy physics, when you say the energy of a particle in a collider, it's often the kinetic energy. But some contexts present the total energy. Let me think: the total energy E = gamma m c², and the kinetic energy K = (gamma -1) m c².

If the question is about the total energy, then I have approximately 20 GeV. But if it's about the kinetic energy, then K = (3.5714 -1) *5.5843 GeV = 2.5714 *5.5843 ≈14.349 GeV. But this is not among the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the total energy, including rest mass, as I initially thought. So E= gamma m c² = approximately 20 GeV.

Looking back at the options, option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, but my calculation was 20.0139 GeV, which is about 20.01 GeV. So why is the option 20.132?

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the mass of Li-6. Let me look it up. Oh, I can't actually look it up, but I think the exact value is around 5.584 GeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute gamma * m0 c² again.

gamma=3.57142857.

m0 c²=5.5843 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.5843.

Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.5843.

3.57142857 times 5 is 17.85714285.

3.57142857 times 0.5843.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.5=1.785714285.

3.57142857 *0.08=0.2857142856.

3.57142857 *0.0043= approx 0.0153571428.

Adding: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856 =2.07142857 +0.0153571428=2.086785713.

So 3.57142857 *5.5843 = 17.85714285 +2.086785713=19.94392856 GeV.

Hmm, about 19.944 GeV.

But the options don't have 19.944. The closest is option C, which is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps the mass I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is 5.584 MeV? No, that can't be. Wait, no, 5 GeV is correct. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So 5.584 GeV is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider the mass of the nucleus. Another approach: the mass of ^6Li is 6.016 u, which is 6.016 *931.5 MeV = 6.016 *931.5.

Let me compute that precisely.

6 *931.5 =5589 MeV.

0.016 *931.5 = 14.904 MeV.

Total: 5589 +14.904=5603.904 MeV=5.603904 GeV.

So using this mass, E=3.57142857 *5.603904.

Compute 3 *5.603904=16.811712.

0.57142857*5.603904.

Again, 0.57142857 is 4/7. So 4/7 *5.603904.

5.603904 *4=22.415616.

Divided by 7:22.415616 /7=3.202230857.

So E=16.811712 +3.202230857=20.013942857 GeV.

Which is approximately 20.0139 GeV.

But the options don't have this; the closest is option C at 20.132 GeV.

Wait, perhaps the calculation requires more precise computation. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

v=0.96c → beta=0.96.

gamma=1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)=1/sqrt(1 - 0.96^2)=1/sqrt(0.0784)=1/0.28=3.5714285714.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.5714285714... but the mass is precise.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the calculation should be done using the exact value of gamma, and more precise mass.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the mass of a proton and neutron in a more precise way.

Mass of proton: 938.272 MeV/c².

Neutron: 939.565 MeV/c².

So for ^6Li, 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Total mass: 3*(938.272) +3*(939.565) =3*(938.272+939.565)=3*(1877.837)=5633.511 MeV=5.633511 GeV.

So m0c²=5.633511 GeV.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511.

Compute:

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511.

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6=2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.033511= approx 0.11975.

So 2.14285714 +0.11975=2.2626.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.2626=20.1197 GeV.

Hmm, this is about 20.1197 GeV, which is closer to option C, which is 20.132 GeV. So perhaps the intended approach is to sum the individual masses of protons and neutrons, leading to a higher m0c², which gives a higher E.

So that would give E≈20.12 GeV, which is close to option C:20.132 GeV. But it's not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more precisely. Let me compute gamma with more decimal places.

beta=0.96 → beta squared=0.9216.

1 - beta^2=0.0784.

sqrt(0.0784)=0.28.

gamma=1/0.28=3.5714285714...

So gamma is exact here.

Now, using m0c²=5.633511 GeV.

E=3.57142857 *5.633511.

Let me compute this precisely.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.633511= ? 

Compute 3.57142857 *0.6 =2.14285714.

3.57142857 *0.033511= let's compute 3.57142857 *0.03=0.107142857.

3.57142857 *0.003511= 0.0125334.

So 0.107142857 +0.0125334=0.119676257.

So 3.57142857 *0.033511=0.119676257.

So total for 0.633511: 2.14285714 +0.119676257=2.262533397.

So E=17.85714285 +2.262533397=20.11967625 GeV.

Rounded to four decimal places, that's 20.1197 GeV.

But option C is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, again, a bit off. Perhaps the question expects the sum of individual nucleon masses, leading to a higher E. Alternatively, perhaps the mass of the nucleus is given as 5.633 GeV, and gamma is precise.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approximation. Let me compute 3.57142857 *5.633511 precisely.

Compute 3.57142857 *5.633511.

Using a calculator:

3.57142857 ×5 = 17.85714285.

3.57142857 × 0.633511 = let me compute:

0.633511 ×3 = 1.899533.

0.633511 ×0.57142857 ≈ 0.633511 *0.5=0.3167555; 0.633511 *0.07142857≈ approx 0.04525.

So 0.3167555 +0.04525=0.3620055.

So 3.57142857 ×0.633511≈1.899533 +0.3620055=2.2615385.

So total E=17.85714285 +2.2615385=20.11868135 GeV.

Hmm, approximately 20.1187 GeV.

If I round this to four decimal places, it's 20.1187 GeV, which is 20.1187 GeV.

But the option is 20.132 GeV. Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement or the options. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some factor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the nucleus as a whole, and using the exact mass, which is 5.5843 GeV. Let's compute that precisely.

Gamma=3.57142857.

E=3.57142857 *5.5843.

Compute 3 *5.5843=16.7529.

0.57142857 *5.5843.

Compute 5.5843 *0.5 =2.79215.

5.5843 *0.07142857 ≈0.07142857 *5.5843.

Compute 0.07 *5.5843=0.390901.

0.00142857 *5.5843=0.007982.

So 0.390901 +0.007982=0.398883.

So 0.57142857 *5.5843 ≈2.79215 +0.398883=3.191033.

So E=16.7529 +3.191033=19.943933 GeV.

Which is about 19.944 GeV.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the sum of the individual nucleon masses, leading to E≈20.119 GeV, which is close to option C:20.132 GeV. But it's not exact. Maybe the problem expects us to use more precise values or a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma. Let me recompute gamma more precisely.

Compute gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.96)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.9216) = 1/sqrt(0.0784) = 1/0.28 =3.57142857... So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the kinetic energy, which is E = (gamma -1) m c².

If I compute that with m=5.5843 GeV.

Kinetic energy K = (3.57142857 -1) *5.5843 =2.57142857 *5.5843.

2 *5.5843=11.1686.

0.57142857 *5.5843=3.191033.

So K=11.1686 +3.191033=14.3596 GeV.

But none of the options are near 14 GeV.

So back to the total energy approach. The problem must be asking for total energy since the options don't match the kinetic.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it using more precise gamma and mass values.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the exact value of gamma is 3.57142857, and the exact mass of Li-6 is 5.5843 GeV.

So E = 3.57142857 *5.5843.

Let me compute:

5.5843 *3.57142857.

Compute 5 *3.57142857=17.85714285.

0.5843 *3.57142857.

Compute 0.5 *3.57142857=1.785714285.

0.08 *3.57142857=0.2857142856.

0.0043 *3.57142857=0.0153571428.

Sum: 1.785714285 +0.2857142856=2.07142857 +0.0153571428=2.08678571.

So E=17.85714285 +2.08678571=19.94392856 GeV.

Hmm, 19.9439 GeV. But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct option is missing, or I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mass assumption. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the nucleus is moving relativistically, and the question is asking for the kinetic energy, but it's not matching the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass of Li-6 is taken as 5.584 GeV, and gamma is 3.57142857, so E=3.57142857 *5.584 = let's compute.

3.57142857 *5 =17.85714285.

3.57142857 *0.584 = ?

Compute 3.57142857 *0.5=1.785714285.

3.57142857 *0.08=0.2857142856.

3.57142857 *0.004=0.01428571428.

Sum:1.785714285 +0.2857142856=2.07142857 +0.01428571428=2.085714285.

So E=17.85714285 +2.085714285=19.94285713 GeV.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, considering just the charge or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is higher, but no, the speed is given as 0.96c.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the assumption that the nucleus is composed of 3 protons and 3 neutrons. Wait, the question says X is Li with 3 neutrons, so it's ^6Li, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to use the rest mass of the proton and neutron in a different way, perhaps including binding energy. But I don't have exact binding energy for Li-6.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, and the intended answer is option D)21.419 GeV. But that doesn't align with my calculations.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that I used the mass of Li-6 as 5.584 GeV, but perhaps the problem expects the mass to be the sum of individual nucleons, leading to about 5.633 GeV, which would give E=3.5714 *5.633=20.119 GeV, which is close to option C)20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem, and option C is the correct choice.

So, based on summing the individual nucleon masses, the energy is approximately 20.119 GeV, which rounds to 20.12 GeV, which is close to option C's 20.132 GeV.

Alternatively, perhaps the intended approach is to use the exact formula and precise calculation, leading to E=20.119 GeV, but the options have it as 20.132. So perhaps the intended answer is option C.


To determine the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) for a nucleus X (Li with 3 neutrons, i.e., ^6Li) moving at 0.96c, we calculate the total relativistic energy \( E = \gamma m_0 c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The rest mass energy \( m_0 c^2 \) for ^6Li is approximated as 5.5843 GeV, based on its atomic mass.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The speed of the nucleus is \( v = 0.96c \). Using the formula for \( \gamma \):
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.96)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.9216}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.0784}} = \frac{1}{0.28} \approx 3.5714
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Energy \( E \)
The total energy is given by:
\[
E = \gamma m_0 c^2
\]
Substituting \( \gamma \approx 3.5714 \) and \( m_0 c^2 = 5.5843 \, \text{GeV} \):
\[
E = 3.5714 \times 5.5843 \approx 20.014 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 3: Refine the Calculation
To improve precision, the rest mass energy of ^6Li is taken as 5.5843 GeV, and \( \gamma \) is calculated more accurately as \( \gamma = 3.57142857 \). Recomputing:
\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.5843 \approx 19.944 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 4: Consider Alternative Mass Assumptions
If the rest mass energy is approximated as the sum of individual nucleon masses (3 protons and 3 neutrons), the total rest mass energy is:
\[
m_0 c^2 = 3 \times 938.272 \, \text{MeV} + 3 \times 939.565 \, \text{MeV} = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV}
\]
Using this value:
\[
E = 3.57142857 \times 5.6335 \approx 20.119 \, \text{GeV}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The calculated energy \( E \) depends on the assumed rest mass energy of the nucleus:
- Using \( m_0 c^2 = 5.5843 \, \text{GeV} \), \( E \approx 19.944 \, \text{GeV} \).
- Using \( m_0 c^2 = 5.6335 \, \text{GeV} \), \( E \approx 20.119 \, \text{GeV} \).

The closest option to these calculations is **C) 20.132 GeV**, which aligns with the assumption of summing individual nucleon masses. Thus, the intended answer is likely **C**.
