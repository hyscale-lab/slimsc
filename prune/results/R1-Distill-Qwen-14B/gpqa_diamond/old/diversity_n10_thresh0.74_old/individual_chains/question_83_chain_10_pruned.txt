Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again. 

The question is about diluting acetic acid and then titrating it with NaOH. The goal is to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, and I have to choose the right one. 

Alright, let me break it down. So, the problem states that we have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. After that, we titrate the diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. I need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

First, I think I need to find the concentration of the acetic acid after dilution. I remember that when you dilute a solution, the concentration changes based on the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2. 

So, initial volume V1 is 20 cm³, concentration M1 is 0.05 M. We're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume V2 is 40 cm³. 

Calculating M2: M2 = (M1 * V1) / V2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³. Let me compute that: 0.05 *20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, which is a strong base, the reaction will be between acetic acid (CH3COOH) and NaOH. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So at the equivalence point, all the acetic acid will be converted to its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-).

But wait, the question asks for two points: 25% titration and equivalence point. Let me handle each separately.

First, let's find the equivalence point. To find the volume of NaOH needed for equivalence, I need to calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution.

Moles of CH3COOH = Molarity * Volume (L). The volume after dilution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles = 0.025 M * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the moles of NaOH required for equivalence is also 0.001 mol. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume V = moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, that's the volume needed for equivalence. But when the question says 25% titration, I think that refers to 25% of the equivalence volume. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

But wait, that's one way to interpret it. Alternatively, maybe 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. Hmm, but in titration, the percentage usually refers to the fraction of the equivalent point. So 25% titration would mean 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So I think my initial approach is correct.

So, at 25% titration, volume of NaOH added is 2.5 cm³, which is 0.0025 L. Moles of NaOH added = 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.000
