Okay, I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. It's a multiple-choice question, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question has two parts, A and B, each involving a different reaction. I need to determine the major products for each and select the correct option from the given choices.

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH, and then H+. The product is A.

Second reaction: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is reacted with acetyl bromide (CH3COBr) in the presence of a base, LDA. The product is B.

The options are A, B, C, D, each giving possible A and B products.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A:

The starting material is 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. Spiro compounds have two rings connected by a single atom, which in this case is the oxygen. The molecule has a spiro ring system with a vinyl group attached (the 1-vinyl part). The structure probably has a five-membered and a seven-membered ring, but wait, the name is spiro[3.5], so one ring is 3 carbons (like cyclopropane?) but wait, no. The spiro notation is [m.n], where m and n are the number of carbons in each ring on each side of the spiro atom. So spiro[3.5]non means that the main chain is nonane (9 carbons), but arranged in two rings. Hmm, maybe it's a bicyclic structure where the spiro atom is connected to two rings, one with 3 carbons and the other with 5 carbons. Wait, actually, the spiro system has two rings sharing one atom. So the formula would be (for spiro[m.n]alkyl): the total number of carbons is m + n + 1. So here, 3 +5 +1 =9, which matches the non- part. So the structure is a spiro compound with two rings: one is a 4-membered ring (since m=3 → 3+1=4, because the spiro atom is part of both rings), and the other is a 6-membered ring (n=5 →5+1=6). Wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Let me think again: for a spiro[m.n]alkyl, the molecule has a central atom connected to two rings, one with m+1 atoms and the other with n+1 atoms. So spiro[3.5]non would have rings of 4 and 6 atoms, maybe.

But the exact structure might not be critical right now. The reaction conditions are THF, KH, and then H+. I think THF is a solvent, and KH is potassium hydride, a strong base. Alternatively, sometimes in such reactions, when a base like KH is used, it's for deprotonation. Wait, but in this context, perhaps it's a hydride transfer.

Wait, the starting material is an alcohol (the 'ol' suffix) with a vinyl group. So the structure is a spiro ring with a hydroxyl group at position 1 and a vinyl group attached as well. So perhaps the hydroxyl is at the spiro atom.

Reaction conditions: I'm trying to remember what reaction involves using THF and a strong base like KH. Oh, wait, maybe it's a pinacol coupling? Alternatively, perhaps it
