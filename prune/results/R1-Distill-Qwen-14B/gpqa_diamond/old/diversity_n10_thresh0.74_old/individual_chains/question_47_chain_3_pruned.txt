Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectral data. Let's see what I remember about IR and NMR spectroscopy.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea about the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H -X + N)/2. So here, C=9, H=11, N=1, O=2. Assuming no halogens (X=0). Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11)/2 = 9/2=4.5? Wait, that can't be right because degrees are usually whole numbers. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate: 2*9 is 18, plus 2 is 20. Subtract H:11, so 20-11=9. Add N: 1 (since each N adds one). So 9+1=10. Then divide by 2: 5. So 5 degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a benzene ring (which is 3), a double bond or ring (another 1), and maybe an amide or ester group which has a carbonyl (another 1). So maybe a benzene ring plus an amide or ester.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are probably N-H stretches. Since they're broad, maybe amide N-H. But wait, amides usually have a medium band around 3300, and maybe a sharp peak for the amide I band. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm-1 is likely a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. If it's around 1720, that's probably an ester or an amide. Amide carbonyls are usually a bit lower, around 1650, but maybe if it's an aromatic amide, it could be higher. Ester carbonyls are around 1740-1720, so that's a big clue.

Now, the NMR data. Let's go through it piece by piece.

1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – this is a triplet, probably from a CH2CH3 group. The triplet suggests coupling with two protons, so adjacent to a CH2 which is next to another CH2? Or perhaps a ethyl group attached to something else.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – a broad singlet integrating for two protons. Broad could mean exchange, like NH, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, it's adjacent to something that causes a broad peak. Or perhaps it's a methylene group (CH2) next to an electronegative atom, but not necessarily split into a singlet. Wait, could this be an ethyl group where the adjacent group is causing a broadening? Or maybe an OCH2? But OCH2 in esters usually is around 4.2-4.5, but sometimes
