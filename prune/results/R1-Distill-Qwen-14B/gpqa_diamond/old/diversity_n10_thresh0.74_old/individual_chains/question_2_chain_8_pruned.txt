Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's happening.

The question says: trans-cinnamaldehyde was treated with methylmagnesium bromide, forming product 1. Then, product 1 was treated with pyridinium chlorochromate to form product 2. Then, product 3 was treated with (dimethyl(oxo)-16-sulfaneylidene)methane in DMSO at elevated temperature, forming product 3. Wait, no, actually, I think I misread that. Let me check again. Oh yes, the third step: product 2 is treated with that reagent to form product 3. So how many carbons are in product 3?

The options are A)14, B)10, C)12, D)11.

Hmm. Okay, let me break this down. I'll start by drawing the structures or at least visualizing them.

First step: trans-cinnamaldehyde. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde. The structure is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group attached. So the structure is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait, no. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. Oh right, cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CHO, but wait, no. Wait, I think cinnamaldehyde is Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, no. Let me think. No, wait, the structure of cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. So it's Ph-CH2-CH2-CHO? No, wait. No, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait. Wait, the correct structure is benzaldehyde with a vinyl group. So it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, no. Wait, isn't cinnamaldehyde: Ph-CH₂-CHO? No, no, that's cinnamaldehyde is actually Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO? Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps it's Ph-CH₂-CH₂-CHO, but wait
