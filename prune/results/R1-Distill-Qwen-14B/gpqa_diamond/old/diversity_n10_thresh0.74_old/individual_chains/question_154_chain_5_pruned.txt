Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which structure matches the given spectral data. Let me go through this step by step.

Alright, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. Then, there's another peak at m/z 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is the heaviest peak, so the molecular weight is 156. The other peak at 158 is probably an isotope. Chlorine has a significant mass difference, so maybe there's a Cl in the molecule. Let me think, chlorine has an atomic mass of about 35.5, so maybe the molecule has one Cl. But wait, the molecular weight is 156. Let me check the possible options' molecular weights.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see, benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but with Cl and another O (from the hydroxy). Wait, molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total: 84+5=89, +35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156, so maybe that's off by 0.5, but perhaps it's just an approximation. Alternatively, maybe another structure.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2, adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate: 12*7=84, 5H=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. Wait same as option A.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. Molecular formula would be C8H7ClO2. Let me calculate: 12*8=96, H7=7, Cl=35.5, O=32. So 96+7=103, +35.5=138.5, +32=170.5. But the molecular ion is 156, so this can't be. So option C is out.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B, but position is different. Molecular formula is same: C7H5ClO2. So same molecular weight as B, around 156.5, but the given is 156. So that's possible.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. So maybe the molecular formula has an even molecular weight. Let me think. Cl has a mass
