Okay, so I have this physics problem about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the galaxy. Hmm, let's read it again to make sure I get all the details.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames of reference. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, I think that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at 60,000 km/s as well, right? Because if the galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta, that's the same as the ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center in the galaxy's frame. Since both are inertial frames, no acceleration involved, so it's just about relative velocity.

The problem asks what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh wait, okay, so time isn't the same in both frames because of special relativity effects. Because when you have relative motion at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs.

Wait, but 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. Let me calculate that in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 3e5 km/s. So 6e4 is 60,000 km/s, which is 0.2 times the speed of light (because 6e4 / 3e5 = 0.2). So beta (β) is 0.2, and gamma (γ) would be 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let me compute that.

Beta squared is 0.04. 1 - 0.04 is 0.96. Square root of 0.96 is roughly 0.98. So 1/0.98 is about 1.02, approximately. Wait, more accurately, let's calculate sqrt(0.96):

Hmm, since 0.98^2 is 0.9604, which is just a bit over 0.96. So sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798. So 1 divided by that is about 1.0203. So gamma is approximately 1.0203.

Now, the time given is in the ejecta's frame, which is the moving frame relative to the galaxy. So in the galaxy frame, the time would be longer because of time dilation. Because the ejecta is moving at high speed relative to the galaxy.

Wait, wait. If the galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame, then in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the galaxy's frame is the rest frame. The ejecta's frame is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the galaxy.

In the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So we need to find out how much time passes in the galaxy's frame during that time, and then multiply the velocity by the galaxy's frame time to get the distance
