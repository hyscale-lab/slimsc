Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how many loops are in this Feynman diagram based on the size estimate that my colleague wrote down. Hmm, I remember that loop diagrams in Feynman diagrams contribute to the calculation of certain terms in perturbation theory. Each loop typically adds a factor of the coupling constant and some other terms depending on the integrals involved.

The expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I need to break this down. Let me think about what each part signifies.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, usually associated with the electromagnetic interaction. But in a quantum field theory, especially with gauge symmetries like electromagnetism, loops often involve alpha. Wait, but the overall question is about the number of loops, not the specific interactions.

Each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of (1/(4π))^{d/2}, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, no, more accurately, for each loop integral in four dimensions, you get a factor of 1/(16π²) from the integral. So each loop would bring a 1/(4π)^2 term. But looking at the expression, there's a 1/(4π)^6 factor. Hmm, that would suggest something about the number of loops. Let's see: 1/(4π)^6 is (1/(4π)^2)^3. So if each loop contributes 1/(4π)^2, then three loops would give (1/(4π)^2)^3 = 1/(4π)^6. So maybe the number of loops is 3?

Wait, but wait. The number of loops also affects the power of the coupling constants. The expression has alpha^3 and g^2. In a Feynman diagram, each loop can bring in factors of the coupling constants. For example, each vertex in a loop might contribute a factor of the coupling.

Wait, in QED, a loop typically comes with an alpha factor. Let's think about a one-loop diagram. The electron self-energy has a loop with two vertices, so each vertex has a factor of e (or sqrt(alpha)), and each loop contributes 1/(16π²) because the integral over four dimensions gives that. So for a one-loop diagram, you might have something like e^2/(16π²) times some other factors.

But in
