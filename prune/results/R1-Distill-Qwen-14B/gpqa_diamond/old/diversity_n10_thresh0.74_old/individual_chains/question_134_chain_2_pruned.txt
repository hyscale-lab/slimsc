Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember everything perfectly, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing some solutions. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt, and the enthalpy change is usually measured in kilojoules per mole or something like that.

The problem gives me three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Let me write down the details. HCl is 500 mL of 0.2 M, H2SO4 is 300 mL of 0.3 M, and Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL of 0.5 M. So I need to figure out what happens when they're all mixed together.

Wait, wait. Neutralization between acids and bases. So the acids here are HCl and H2SO4, and the base is Ba(OH)2. I think that when you mix an acid with a base, they react to produce water and a salt. But wait, in this case, there are two acids and one base. So maybe the bases from Ba(OH)2 will react with the acids.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, and both HCl and H2SO4 are strong acids. So they should neutralize each other. Hmm. I think I need to find out how much acid and base are present, and see which is in excess, if any, because the neutralization depends on the stoichiometry.

First, I should calculate the moles of each substance. Moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters).

Let me compute each:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong
