Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So, X has an element with a heavier isotope. Then, X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Oh wait, same number of neutrons and protons means each atom of W has an equal number of both. Since protons and neutrons are roughly similar in mass, but more importantly, for a molecule to have equal number of each, the element probably is hydrogen because each H atom has 1 proton and 0 neutrons, but wait, that's not equal. Wait, maybe deuterium? D has 1 proton and 1 neutron. Oh wait, but here it's a molecule, not an atom. So, if W is H2, each H atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron? No, regular H has 0 neutrons. Deuterium has 1. So if the molecule is D2, then each D has 1 proton and 1 neutron, so 1 each. That makes W as D2 gas. Or maybe H2, but in that case, the H atoms have 1 proton and 0 neutrons, so the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. So that doesn't fit. So W must be D2, because each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So the molecule has 2 of each, so same number of protons and neutrons. That makes sense.

Then, a precipitate G forms. When heated, G releases B. The melting point of B is about 277 K. Normal conditions, so B is a solid at that temp. 277 K is roughly 4 degrees Celsius. Hmm. What's a solid that melts around there? Like, maybe water ice? No, water freezes at 273 K. Oh wait, 277 is a bit higher, so perhaps something else. Or maybe that's a typo and it's 273 K. Alternatively, maybe B is another compound. Alternatively, perhaps B is something like iodine, which has a melting point around 459 K. No, that's too high. Maybe something else. I'm not sure yet, but let's keep that aside.

The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. I'm thinking, keto acid—so that's an acid with a ketone group. Common keto acids include things like acetoacetic acid, which has two carbonyl groups. But more importantly, when a keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Wait, perhaps X is something that adds oxygen. Or maybe it's a base.

Wait, the first part is about X reacting with Y. Let's think about reactions that produce gas. If X is a metal, and Y is something like water or acid, perhaps. For example, metals reacting with acid to produce hydrogen gas. But earlier I thought W is D2, but that's a heavy isotope. Alternatively, perhaps W is CO2 or something else. But CO2 has 22 neutrons and 12 protons, which don't match. So probably not.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the reactions. If X reacts with Y to produce gas W, which is D2 (as discussed), then Y could be something like D2O, but that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a strong acid, and X is a metal. So, when a metal reacts with acid, it produces hydrogen gas. But in this case, the gas is D2, so maybe Y is a heavy water solution, and X is a metal that reacts with D2O. But then, the precipitate G would be the metal hydroxide, perhaps?

Wait, but then when G is heated, it releases B. If G is a metal hydroxide, upon heating, it might decompose into metal oxide and water. But if the melting point is around 277 K, maybe it's a different product. Alternatively, perhaps G is a carbonate that decomposes into CO2 and something else. I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the other part. The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. So, the product has a molecule with two oxygens. Suppose X is NaOH, a strong base. If a keto acid reacts with NaOH, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction. But a keto acid has a carboxylic acid group and a ketone. For example, acetoacetic acid. If you neutralize it with a base, you'd get a salt. So the product would be something like the sodium salt of the keto acid. Let's count the oxygens. Acetoacetic acid is HC(CO2H)2. So neutralizing it with NaOH would give the sodium salt: NaC(CO2H)2. Wait, but that's still three oxygens in each CO2H group. But the question says the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe the product isn't a neutralization but another reaction. If X is a oxidizing agent, perhaps it oxidizes the keto acid. Or maybe it's a reducing agent. Alternatively, perhaps X is something that adds an oxygen, but that would increase the number of oxygens. Alternatively, maybe X is a base that deprotonates the keto acid, but that would more likely add a -OH group, not change the oxygen count.

Wait, perhaps X is something like a chlorinating agent. Or maybe it's a halogen. Let's think differently. Let's suppose X is Na, reacting with water (Y). But then W would be H2, which isn't matching the neutron and proton count. Alternatively, perhaps X is Ca, which reacts with water to produce H2. But again, the earlier part about W's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. When a carbonate reacts with an acid, it produces CO2 gas. So if Y is an acid, then X (carbonate) plus Y (acid) → CO2 (gas W) + precipitate (maybe a salt). But then, let's see: the precipitate G would be a salt. When heated, it might decompose into something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's get back to the first part. The gas W has same number of neutrons and protons per molecule. So each molecule has n protons and n neutrons. So total protons = 2n and total neutrons = 2n? No, wait, per molecule. Wait, each molecule is made of atoms. If the molecule has multiple atoms, each contributing protons and neutrons. For example, if the molecule is D2, each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron. So total protons = 2, total neutrons = 2. So same number. So W is D2. So when X reacts with Y, it's releasing D2 gas. So what reaction produces D2 gas? Probably a metal reacting with D2O (heavy water) as an acid. For example, magnesium or zinc reacting with heavy water. Or perhaps a metal like sodium.

Wait, sodium reacts with water to produce H2, but if Y is heavy water (D2O), then sodium would react to produce D2 gas. So X could be sodium, Y is D2O. The reaction would be 2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + H2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The reaction of Na with D2O would be: 2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + D2↑. So in this case, W is D2 gas. Then, the precipitate G would be NaOD, which is sodium deuteroxide. But sodium hydroxide is soluble, but maybe sodium deuteroxide is also soluble. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps Y is not D2O but something else.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Y is H2O with some acid, like HCl. Then CO3^2- + 2 H+ → CO2 + H2O. So W is CO2, but CO2 has 12 protons (for C) and 16 neutrons (since C has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So each CO2 molecule has 12 protons (6 C + 6 O) and 24 neutrons (6 C + 16 O). No, that's not equal. So W can't be CO2 because 12 protons and 24 neutrons—so 12 vs 24, not the same. So that can't be the case.

Wait, what if W is O2? No, O2 has 16 protons and 16 neutrons per molecule (since each O atom has 8 each). So per O2 molecule, 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So that would fit the condition. But does any reaction produce O2 gas when X reacts with Y? Like a metal and acid producing O2? Not that I can think of. Alternatively, perhaps a reaction involving peroxides decomposing, but that's maybe not fitting.

Alternatively, if W is NH3, but that's a gas, but each molecule has 14 protons (1 N, 3 H) and 14 neutrons? Let me see: N has 7 protons and 7 neutrons (since it's the most common isotope, but maybe the heavier one), and H has 1 each. So for NH3: 7 (N) + 3*(1) = 10 protons. Neutrons: 7 + 3*0 =7. So 10 protons and 7 neutrons—doesn't match. So that's out.

Wait, maybe W is CH4. But that has 6 protons (C) + 4 H =10 protons. Neutrons: C has 6, H has 0. So 6 neutrons. Not equal. Doesn't fit.

Another approach: the gas W has same number of protons and neutrons in each molecule. Let's calculate possible molecules.

Possible molecules where protons = neutrons:

- H2: 2 H atoms. Each has 1 proton, 0 neutrons. So 2 protons, 0 neutrons. Not equal. So no.

- D2: Each D has 1 proton, 1 neutron. So 2 protons, 2 neutrons. Equal. So W is D2.

- O2: 16 protons, 16 neutrons (each O has 8 p and 8 n). So 16 each. So yes, O2 would fit.

Wait, earlier I thought O2 might be a possibility. So maybe W is O2.

But what reaction produces O2 gas? Decomposition of something like a peroxide, but I'm not sure how that would fit with X and Y.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal reacting with an acid to produce O2. But I don't think metals react with acids to produce O2; they produce H2. Unless it's a very reactive metal like potassium, but even then, I think they produce H2 when reacting with water.

Wait, another angle: the product of a keto acid and X has 2 oxygen atoms. So the product is a molecule with two O's. Let's think about possible reactions.

If X is a base, like NaOH, and the keto acid is something like acetoacetic acid (which has two COOH groups), then the product would be the sodium salt, which would have more oxygens. Wait, but the product has two oxygen atoms. Hmm, maybe the product is something like an acetal or ketal? Or perhaps a hemiacetal?

Wait, another thought: maybe X is a dehydrating agent. For example, in the presence of a keto acid, X could cause dehydration to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. That reaction would remove water, but how does that affect the oxygen count? Let me think. Suppose the keto acid is something like glyoxylic acid (HOOC-COOH?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the keto acid is something else. Wait, perhaps the reaction is oxidation. For example, oxidizing a keto acid to a diketone. But that might not change the oxygen count.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a reducing agent. For example, it could reduce a ketone group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the product having two oxygen atoms. Maybe it's something like CO2? But that's from a decomposition. Or perhaps a carbonyl group. Wait, maybe the product is a hemiacetal or something else that has two oxygens.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chlorinating agent. For instance, if X is Cl2, and the keto acid reacts with it to form an acid chloride. But that would add a Cl atom, not necessarily change the oxygen count.

Wait, another approach: the product of the keto acid and X has a molecule with 2 oxygens. Let's think of possible products when a keto acid reacts with a substance. For example, if X is a base, perhaps it deprotonates the keto acid, but that wouldn't change the number of oxygens. Unless it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, perhaps X is a dehydrating agent like PCl5 or something else. If the keto acid is heated with a dehydrating agent, it could lose water and form an anhydride. For example, two keto acid molecules losing water to form an anhydride. In that case, the anhydride would have more oxygens than the original acid. But the product is said to have two oxygens. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the product is an ester. If the keto acid reacts with an alcohol (like ethanol) in the presence of acid catalyst, it would form an ester. But the ester would have more oxygen atoms than the acid.

Wait, perhaps the product is an acetal. When a ketone reacts with an alcohol, it forms an acetal. For example, a diol and a ketone form an acetal. So if the keto acid has a ketone group, and X is a diol or something that can form an acetal, then the product would have more oxygens. But wait, the product should have only two oxygen atoms. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is an enol. But enols have the same number of oxygens as the keto form.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the main points again.

1. Substance X has a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So X has an element with a heavy isotope, possibly with higher atomic mass.

2. X reacts with Y violently, producing gas W with same protons and neutrons (so W is D2 or O2). Let's think D2.

3. The precipitate G, when heated, releases B, which has a melting point near 277 K.

4. A keto acid reacts with X to give a product with two oxygen atoms.

5. X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry.

Thinking about reagents used in organic chemistry, X could be something like NaOH, KOH, or maybe a metal like Mg, which is used in Grignard reactions. Or perhaps it's a halogen, but let's see.

Wait, X is used in organic chemistry as a reagent. So maybe it's NaOH, which is used in many reactions, like saponification, hydrolysis, etc. Alternatively, it's a metal like Mg for Grignard reagents, but I'm not sure.

If X is NaOH, then when it reacts with Y (could be water?), but that doesn't produce a gas. Wait, but if Y is another substance, like an acid. For example, if Y is H2O, and X is a metal, but that produces H2 gas. But earlier I thought W is D2, so perhaps Y is D2O.

Wait, let me think about the reaction of X (Na) with Y (D2O). Reaction: 2 Na + 2 D2O → 2 NaOD + H2↑, but wait, that's H2, not D2. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is a deuterated metal, like NaD or something, but that's stretching it.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a heavy water version of a reagent. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the precipitate G forms when X reacts with Y. If X is NaOH and Y is a salt, that could form a precipitate. But then the gas would be something else, perhaps NH3 or CO2. But earlier, W needs to have equal protons and neutrons.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a carbonate. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Y is H2SO4. Then reaction: Na2CO3 + H2SO4 → Na2SO4 + CO2↑ + H2O. So W would be CO2. But CO2 has 12 protons (6 C + 6 O) and 16 neutrons (6 C + 16 O). Wait, no, each molecule of CO2 has 2 oxygen atoms, each with 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So per CO2 molecule: 12 protons (6 C, 6 O) and 24 neutrons (6 C, 16 O). So 12 vs 24, not equal. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Let me think again about W. The molecule of W has same number of protons and neutrons. So, for the entire molecule, not per atom.

So, for example, if W is O2, each O atom has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So the molecule has 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So 16 each. That fits.

So W could be O2. Now, which reaction produces O2 gas? Decomposition reactions, like the decomposition of a peroxide. For example, 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2↑. So if Y is H2O2 and X is a catalyst, maybe. But what's X in that case? If X is MnO2 as a catalyst, then X would be Manganese dioxide. But does MnO2 incorporate a heavier isotope? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if X is a metal like potassium, which reacts with water to produce O2. Wait, no, potassium reacts with water to produce H2. Unless it's a different condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that reacts with an acid to produce O2. But I can't think of any such metals. Most metals produce H2 when reacting with acids.

Wait, another thought: perhaps W is D2O. No, because it's a gas. Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe W is CO, which has 12 protons (C) and 14 neutrons (C has 6, O has 8). So molecule has 12 protons and 14 neutrons. No, not equal.

Hmm. This is challenging. Let's think about the options given.

The options are A)35, B)25, C)31, D)29.

These are cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. So X has two elements, let's say. The lightest has an atomic mass, the heaviest another. Sum them.

So, for example, if X is NaOH, it's Na (23) and O (16) and H (1). So the lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23) → sum 24. But that's not an option. So maybe X isn't NaOH.

Alternatively, if X is something like CH3COOH (acetic acid), but that's a liquid. Wait, but the problem says X is a substance, could be anything.

Wait, another approach: think about the elements in X. If X has a heavier isotope, perhaps one of the elements is chlorine, which has a heavy isotope (Cl-35 and Cl-37). Or maybe something else.

Wait, the product of the reaction with the keto acid has 2 oxygen atoms. So let's think about the product. Maybe the product is something like an ester, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an ether. But ethers don't have that many oxygens.

Wait, think of a keto acid. Keto acids include things like acetoacetic acid (CH3COCH2COOH), which has two ketone groups. When it reacts with a base like X (NaOH), it would form the sodium salt: CH3COCH2COO^- Na^+. The product would have four oxygens. So that doesn't fit the two oxygen condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't with a base but something else. Maybe a dehydration reaction. For example, forming an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone by removing water. So the product would be CH2=COCH2COOH? Wait, but that still has multiple oxygens.

Alternatively, maybe the keto acid is reacting with a reducing agent. For example, X could be LiAlH4, which reduces ketones to alcohols. But then the product would have an -OH group. Let's see: if the keto acid is RCOCH2COOH, after reduction, it becomes RCH2CH2COOH. So the product would have the same number of oxygens. Unless the reduction leads to loss of oxygen. Hmm, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something that adds a methyl group. For example, formaldehyde could add a methyl group, but that's a stretch.

Wait, another angle: the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a simple ketone. But how would a keto acid react to form a ketone? Maybe by eliminating a CO2. For example, decarboxylation. If the keto acid undergoes decarboxylation, it would lose CO2 and form a ketone. So for example, acetoacetic acid could lose CO2 to form acetone (which has one ketone group, so (CH3)2CO). Acetone has three oxygen atoms? No, acetone is (CH3)2CO, which has one oxygen. Wait, no: (CH3)2CO is a ketone with one oxygen. So the product would have one oxygen. But the question says two oxygens. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product is a molecule with two oxygen atoms, like CO2. But that would require the keto acid losing both COOH groups, which doesn't seem likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a condensation reaction. For example, two keto acid molecules losing water to form an anhydride. That would have more oxygens, not fewer.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about the reagent X.

The question says that X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH, KOH, H2SO4, etc. But let's think about NaOH. If X is NaOH, then when it reacts with Y (maybe an acid), it would produce Na salt and water, but what gas would form? Probably none. Alternatively, if Y is a carbonate, but then W would be CO2, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal. For example, Mg. Mg reacts with H2O (if it's heavy water, D2O) to produce Mg(OH)2 and D2 gas. So the reaction would be Mg + 2 D2O → Mg(OH)2 + D2↑. So W is D2, which fits. Then Y would be D2O.

The precipitate G is Mg(OH)2. When heated, Mg(OH)2 decomposes into MgO and H2O. But wait, D2O would be involved. So perhaps G is MgOD (magnesium deuteroxide?), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Mg(OH)2 is the precipitate. When heated, it becomes MgO and H2O. But the melting point of B is 277 K. Wait, MgO has a high melting point (around 2800 K), so that's way higher than 277 K. So B can't be MgO.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Let me think of another reaction. Suppose X is Na. It reacts with D2O to produce NaOD and H2 gas. Wait, but earlier that would be H2, not D2. Hmm. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: X is Ca, which reacts with D2O. The reaction would be Ca + 2 D2O → Ca(OH)2 + D2↑. So W is D2. Precipitate G is Ca(OH)2. When heated, Ca(OH)2 decomposes into CaO and H2O. But CaO has a high melting point. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is a carbonate. If X is Na2CO3, but I'm not sure about the gas.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is a sulfide. If X is H2S, but that's a gas itself. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a carbonate, and X is an acid. For example, H2SO4 reacting with Na2CO3 to produce CO2. But earlier, CO2 doesn't fit the gas condition.

This is getting a bit too tangled. Let me try to think of the possible elements in X.

The question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X. Options given are 35,25,31,29.

Which pairs of elements have atomic masses adding up to these numbers?

For example:

A)35: possible pairs could be 1 (H) +34 (Se), but that's unlikely. Or 16 (O) +19 (F) → 35. But O and F are adjacent in the periodic table.

B)25: possible pairs are 1+24 (Mg), but Mg is 24. Or 16 (O) +9 (F, but F is 19). Wait, 16 + 9 is 25, but F is 19. Alternatively, 12 (C) +13 (Al) =25. That's possible. Or perhaps 15 (P) +10 (Ne) →25. But Ne is noble gas, probably not in X.

C)31: 16 (O) +15 (P) =31. Or 14 (N) +17 (Cl) =31. Or 12 (C) +19 (F) =31. Alternatively, 1 (H) +30 (Zn) =31. Hmm.

D)29: 12 (C) +17 (Cl)=29. Or 14 (N) +15 (P) =29. Or 1 (H) +28 (Si)=29. Or 16 (O) +13 (Al)=29.

Hmm. Now, considering X is a reagent used in organic chemistry. Common reagents include NaOH (Na and O), KOH (K and O), H2SO4 (S and O), etc.

If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum 24. Not an option.

If X is KOH: K (39), O (16), H (1). Sum of lightest (H) and heaviest (K) is 40. Not an option.

If X is H2SO4: H (1), S (32), O (16). Lightest H (1), heaviest S (32). Sum 33. Not an option.

Another reagent is CH3COOH (acetic acid): C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is CH3CH2OH (ethanol). C (12), H (1), O (16). Lightest H, heaviest O. Sum 17. No.

Alternatively, X could be something like NH3 (ammonia). N (14), H (1). Sum 15. No.

Wait, another reagent: KMnO4. K (39), Mn (55), O (16). Lightest H? No, in KMnO4, elements are K, Mn, O. So lightest is O (16), heaviest Mn (55). Sum 71. Not an option.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe X contains Cl. Let's think of Cl-based reagents. For example, Cl2 is a reagent, but that's a gas. Or maybe NaCl. Na (23), Cl (35.5). Sum is 58.5. But the options are up to 35. So maybe not.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH2Cl2. Then elements are C, H, Cl. Lightest H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum 36.5. Closest option is A)35. But the option is 35, which is lower. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is CCl4. Then C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum 47.5. Not an option.

Alternatively, maybe X is something with O and Cl. For example, ClO2. Cl (35.5), O (16). Sum 51.5. No.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the possible pairs that sum up to the options.

Option C is 31. Possible pairs: O (16) + P (15) =31. So if X contains O and P, perhaps as in phosphate salts. For example, Na3PO4. Then elements are Na, P, O. Lightest is O (16), heaviest P (31). Sum 47. No, but 16+31=47.

Wait, another possibility: X contains C and Cl. C (12) + Cl (19) →31. But Cl is usually around 35.5. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe X has N and S. N (14) + S (32)=46. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps X is something like CH2O (formaldehyde). Elements C, H, O. Lightest H (1), heaviest O (16). Sum 17. No.

Wait, another possibility: X is something like SiO2. But that's a compound, not a reagent in organic chemistry.

Alternatively, X could be a halogen, like Cl2. Then, it's Cl and Cl. Lightest and heaviest are the same. Sum 35.5 +35.5 =71. No.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture or a compound with two elements, say, C and O. So, C (12) + O (16) =28. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like MgO. Mg (24) + O (16) =40. Sum of lightest (O,16) and heaviest (Mg,24) gives 40. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is something like Na2O. Na (23) + O (16). Lightest O, heaviest Na. Sum 39. Not an option.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Let's think about the problem again.

X reacts with Y to produce gas W (same protons and neutrons per molecule, so D2 or O2).

The product of a keto acid and X has two oxygens.

X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry.

The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X are among the options.

If W is D2, then X might be a metal that reacts with D2O. For example, Mg.

So, X could be Mg. Y is D2O. The reaction is Mg + 2 D2O → Mg(OH)2 + D2↑. Then, G is Mg(OH)2. When heated, Mg(OH)2 → MgO + H2O. But MgO's melting point is about 2800 K, not 277 K. So B can't be MgO.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something else. Or perhaps the product when heated is different.

Wait, perhaps the precipitate is NaOH. When heated, NaOH doesn't decompose. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something like a carbonate. For example, CaCO3. When heated, it decomposes into CaO and CO2. CO2's melting point is way lower, but as a gas, it doesn't fit.

Wait, the melting point of B is about 277 K. That's about 4°C. What's a solid that melts around there? Maybe something like water ice. But that's H2O. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different compound.

Wait, another thought: perhaps B is a metal that has a low melting point. For example, mercury melts at about 266 K, which is close to 277 K. Or maybe gallium, which melts around 300 K. Not exactly matching, but perhaps I'm on the right track.

Alternatively, maybe B is a different compound. For example, maybe it's a salt like NaHCO3, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal like potassium, which has a melting point around 336 K. Close to 277? Not really.

Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the product of the keto acid and X. Suppose X is a base like NaOH, and the product is a sodium salt of the keto acid. Let's say the keto acid is something with two carboxylic groups. Then the product would have more oxygens, but the question says two oxygens. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic hemiacetal, which has fewer oxygens. But I'm not certain.

Another angle: the product has two oxygen atoms. So perhaps it's a molecule like CO2, but that would require decarboxylation. Alternatively, maybe it's a simpler structure.

Wait, let's think about the elements in X. If X is Mg (atomic mass ~24.3), then when it reacts with D2O, it incorporates deuterium. The elements in X would be Mg and D. So the lightest element is D (which is H, atomic mass ~2), and the heaviest is Mg (24.3). Sum would be about 26.3. Closest option is B)25. If the question is considering the lightest as H (1) and heaviest as Mg (24), sum is 25. So that would fit option B.

But wait, the question says 'the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X'. So if X is Mg, the elements are Mg and D (which is H), so lightest is H (1), heaviest Mg (24.3). Sum 25.3, which rounds to 25. That's option B.

But then, does the reaction fit? X is Mg, Y is D2O. Reaction produces D2 gas. Precipitate is Mg(OH)2 (or MgOD?), which when heated produces B with melting point ~277 K. MgO has a high melting point, so not that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps X is Na, and the reaction with D2O produces NaOD and D2. The precipitate would be NaOD. When heated, NaOD might decompose into Na and OD, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps the precipitate is NaOH, which when heated doesn't change much. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal that produces a different precipitate. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: if X is Mg, which reacts with D2O to produce Mg(OH)2 and D2. The precipitate is Mg(OH)2. When heated, Mg(OH)2 might lose water and form MgO, but that has a high melting point. Alternatively, if the precipitate is something else, like a carbonate, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is NaHCO3. When heated, it decomposes into Na2CO3, CO2, and H2O. But I'm not sure about the melting point.

Alternatively, perhaps the precipitate is something like Fe(OH)3, which when heated becomes Fe2O3. But Fe2O3 has a high melting point.

Hmm. I'm stuck on this part, but perhaps I can proceed. The option that fits is B)25, which would correspond to H (1) and Mg (24).

So, the lightest element is H (atomic mass 1), heaviest is Mg (24.3). Sum is about 25.3, matching option B)25.

So the answer would be option B.


The problem revolves around identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. Key observations and deductions are as follows:

1. **Gas W**: The gas released during the reaction of X with Y has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. This suggests that W is **D₂** (deuterium gas), as each D atom has 1 proton and 1 neutron, making the molecule have 2 protons and 2 neutrons.

2. **Reaction of X with Y**: X reacts violently with Y to produce D₂ gas. A plausible reaction is a metal (e.g., Mg or Na) reacting with heavy water (D₂O), as this produces D₂ gas. For example:
   - Mg + 2D₂O → Mg(OH)₂ + D₂↑
   - Na + 2D₂O → NaOD + D₂↑

3. **Precipitate G**: The reaction forms a precipitate, which could be a metal hydroxide (e.g., Mg(OH)₂ or NaOD). When heated, G releases B, a substance with a melting point close to 277 K (~4°C). This melting point aligns with substances like water ice (H₂O), though further clarification is needed.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of the reaction between a keto acid and X contains 2 oxygen atoms. This suggests a reaction where X modifies the keto acid to form a product with a specific oxygen count, possibly through neutralization or dehydration.

5. **Organic Chemistry Reagent**: X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry. Common reagents like Mg or Na align with this description, as they are used in reactions such as Grignard formation or deuterium exchange.

6. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**: The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X must match one of the given options (35, 25, 31, 29). If X is Mg, the elements are Mg (24.3) and H (1). Their cumulative atomic mass is approximately 25, which matches **Option B**.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible candidate for X is Mg, which reacts with D₂O to produce D₂ gas and forms a precipitate. The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (H) and heaviest (Mg) elements in X sum to approximately 25, corresponding to **Option B**.
