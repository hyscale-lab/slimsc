Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R.

Wait, divergence... right. The divergence of a vector field is a scalar. So I have to compute the divergence of f and then integrate it over the volume of the sphere.

First, the vector field f has only a radial component. Let me write that in spherical coordinates. So f(r) = f_r e_r, where e_r is the unit radial vector. And f_r is 1/r².

I remember that the divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only the radial component (and zero angular components) is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Let me write that down: ∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

Substituting f_r = 1/r² into that, I get:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ].

Wait, r squared times 1/r squared is just 1. So that becomes (1/r²) d/dr (1).

But the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = 0? That can't be right, can it? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait no, wait. Let me double-check. Because f_r is 1/r², so r² f_r is (r²)(1/r²) = 1. Taking the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin where r=0.

Wait, but if the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, then the integral of the divergence over the volume would be zero, right? Because the divergence is zero in all space except a single point. But wait, integration in three dimensions over a volume—does that include points?

Wait, no. The sphere of radius R is a volume, and the origin is just a single point within it. But in calculus, when we integrate over a volume, a single point contributes nothing because its volume is zero. So the integral of the divergence over the sphere would be zero.

But wait, wait a second. There's a possibility that the divergence is not defined at r=0. The vector field f(r) = 1/r² e_r. At r=0, this field would be undefined because you can't divide by zero. So perhaps the divergence isn't zero there, but maybe there's a delta function or something.

In electromagnetism, for example, the electric field of a point charge has a similar form. The divergence of that field is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function. So in that case, the integral of the divergence over all space is 4π times the charge, but here I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of Gauss's law. Gauss's law says that the integral of the divergence of E over a volume is equal to the enclosed charge. But in that case, E is proportional to 1/r², similar to this field.

So if E = (k q / r²) e_r, then the divergence is zero except at r=0, and the integral over any volume enclosing the origin would be 4π k q. But in our case, f is 1/r², so if k q were 1, the integral would be 4π. But wait, in our problem, the field is defined as f(r), and the divergence is zero except perhaps at the origin.

So wait, the integral of the divergence of f over the volume of the sphere would be 4π if there's a charge-like source at the origin. But wait, in our case, the divergence of f is zero everywhere except r=0. So the integral should be zero except for the contribution from the origin.

But Gauss's law comes into play when you have a point charge. Let me think again. The divergence of E is (1/ε₀)ρ, where ρ is the charge density. So if E is (1/r²) e_r, then the divergence is 4π δ³(r), so the integral of the divergence over any volume including the origin would be 4π times the charge enclosed, which is 4π q/(ε₀), assuming E is (q/(4π ε₀ r²)) e_r.

Wait, but in this problem, the field f is 1/r², so perhaps f corresponds to E with q/(4π ε₀) equals 1. So f would be E, and the divergence would be 4π δ³(r). Then the integral of divergence over the sphere would be 4π × 1, giving 4π.

But wait, earlier I thought that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. So inside the sphere (radius R), the integral would be 4π if the divergence is a delta function, but if the divergence is zero elsewhere, the only contribution is from the origin.

Wait, but in the problem statement, I'm supposed to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence within the sphere. So if the divergence is zero except at the origin, then the integral would be zero, but that's not correct because the origin is a point with zero volume. Unless the divergence actually has a delta function there, which would imply a non-zero integral.

Wait, in reality, if the vector field behaves like 1/r², the divergence would be zero except at r=0. So the integral over the sphere would be zero because the divergence is zero everywhere except a point, which contributes zero when integrating over volume.

But that seems contradictory. Because if the field is similar to the electric field of a point charge, then the divergence should be non-zero at the origin, leading the integral to be 4π. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the divergence.

Wait, let me recalculate the divergence correctly. For a vector field that depends only on r and has the form f(r) e_r, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

So f_r is 1/r², so substituting:

(1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

But wait, this is correct. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where the function might be singular.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the electric field of a point charge has non-zero divergence at the origin. Oh wait, because when you take the limit as r approaches zero, the derivative may involve a delta function.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the divergence using the limit definition. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe I need to think about the flux through a small sphere around the origin. The divergence theorem tells us that the integral of the divergence of F over a volume is equal to the flux of F through the surface of that volume.

So if I take a small sphere of radius a, centered at the origin, then the flux is the integral of F · n da over the surface. Here, F is f(r), which is (1/r²) e_r.

n is e_r on the surface of the sphere, so F · n = (1/r²) * (1) = 1/r². But wait, r is the radius of the sphere, which is a. So F · n = 1/a².

The surface area is 4π a², so the flux is (1/a²) * 4π a² = 4π.

According to the divergence theorem, this flux should equal the integral of the divergence of F over the volume. But earlier, I thought the divergence was zero. Hmm, that's a contradiction.

Wait, so this suggests that the divergence is not zero. Because the flux is 4π, which can't be zero. So where did I go wrong?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Let me recalculate:

f(r) = (1/r²) e_r.

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

f_r is 1/r², so r² f_r is 1. The derivative of 1 is 0, so ∇·f = 0? But that can't be right because the flux is 4π.

Wait a second. Oh no! Wait, I'm so confused. Because according to the calculation, the divergence is zero, but according to the flux, it's 4π. That's a problem.

Ah, wait, I think I made a mistake in the divergence formula. Let me double-check the divergence in spherical coordinates for a radial field.

The divergence of a vector field F = F_r e_r + F_θ e_θ + F_φ e_φ is given by:

∇·F = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dθ (F_θ sinθ) + (1/(r sinθ)) d/dφ F_φ.

In our case, F_θ and F_φ are zero, so the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r).

So substituting F_r = 1/r², we get:

(1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0.

But that contradicts the flux calculation. So why is the flux 4π if the divergence is zero?

Ah, I see the issue. The problem is that the field f(r) behaves as 1/r², which is similar to the electric field of a point charge. For such a field, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function. So when I compute the divergence using the formula, I get zero everywhere except r=0, but in reality, the divergence should include a delta function at the origin.

Wait, but our calculation gives zero. So perhaps the divergence is zero, but the flux is 4π. That suggests that the divergence is zero, which can't be right because the flux is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the flux calculation.

Wait, the flux is the surface integral of F · n da. F is 1/r² e_r, so on the surface of radius a, F · n is (1/a²) * 1 = 1/a².

The surface area is 4π a². So the flux is (1/a²) * 4π a² = 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, that should equal the volume integral of the divergence. But according to our calculation, the divergence is zero, so the integral would be zero. So there's a contradiction here.

Hmm, this suggests that either our divergence calculation is wrong or our flux calculation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the field isn't defined at r=0, so the divergence at r=0 is undefined. But the flux through any surface that encloses the origin is 4π, which suggests that the divergence is 4π δ³(r), a delta function at the origin. So the divergence is zero everywhere except r=0, where it's a delta function.

In that case, the integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius R, which includes the origin, would be 4π. Because the integral of 4π δ³(r) over any volume containing the origin is 4π.

Wait, that makes sense. So the divergence isn't zero everywhere. It's zero except at the origin, where it contributes a delta function. So the volume integral of the divergence would be 4π, regardless of R as long as R is greater than zero.

So the integral is 4π, which corresponds to option A.

But wait, the original calculation of the divergence using the formula gave zero. So why is that?

Ah, because the field is singular at the origin, the function isn't differentiable there, so the standard formula for divergence in spherical coordinates doesn't account for the delta function. So the divergence isn't just (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r), but also includes a Dirac delta function term when the field is singular.

Alternatively, perhaps the field isn't differentiable at r=0, so the divergence isn't zero everywhere, but has a delta function contribution.

So, putting it all together, the integral of the divergence over the sphere of radius R would be 4π, so the answer is A) 4 π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \), we start by analyzing the field. The vector field has only a radial component in spherical coordinates, given by \( \mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{e}_r \), where \( \hat{e}_r \) is the radial unit vector. The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates for a field with only the radial component is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right).
\]

Substituting \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we get:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0.
\]

This suggests that the divergence is zero everywhere except at \( r = 0 \), where the field is singular. To resolve this, we consider the flux of \( \mathbf{f} \) through a small sphere of radius \( a \) centered at the origin. The flux is given by:

\[
\Phi = \int \mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n} \, dA,
\]

where \( \mathbf{n} = \hat{e}_r \) is the outward unit normal vector on the sphere. Substituting \( \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{e}_r \), we find:

\[
\Phi = \int \frac{1}{r^2} \, dA = \frac{1}{a^2} \cdot 4\pi a^2 = 4\pi.
\]

By the divergence theorem, the flux through the surface of the sphere is equal to the volume integral of the divergence over the enclosed volume. Since the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, the divergence must include a Dirac delta function \( 4\pi \delta^3(r) \) at the origin. Thus, the volume integral of the divergence over any region containing the origin is:

\[
\int \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

This result holds regardless of the radius \( R \) of the sphere, as long as the sphere encloses the origin. Therefore, the integral of the divergence of \( \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).

**Critical analysis of options:**
- **Option A (4π):** Correct, as shown by the flux calculation and the divergence theorem.
- **Option B (1):** Incorrect, as the integral is not a dimensionless quantity.
- **Option C (\( 4/3 \pi R \)):** Incorrect, as the result does not depend on \( R \).
- **Option D (0):** Incorrect, as the divergence includes a delta function at the origin, leading to a non-zero integral.
