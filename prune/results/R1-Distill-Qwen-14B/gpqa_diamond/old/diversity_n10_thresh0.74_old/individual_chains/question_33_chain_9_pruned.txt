Okay, I've got a cycloaddition reaction to figure out. The reactants are 2,5-dimethylthiophene and furan-2,5-dione, and the reaction is done under heat. I need to find the exo product from the given options.

First, I remember that cycloadditions, especially [4+2] ones, are Diels-Alder reactions. But wait, Diels-Alder is usually between a diene and a dienophile. So, which of these molecules is the diene and which is the dienophile?

2,5-dimethylthiophene is a thiophene ring with two methyl groups at positions 2 and 5. Thiophene is aromatic, and when it's part of a Diels-Alder reaction, I think the thiophene acts as the dienophile. Because the dienophile is usually electron-deficient. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups on the furan ring. Furan is electron-rich because of the oxygen atoms, but with two ketones, maybe it becomes more electron-deficient. Wait, no. Electron-deficient dienophiles are things like maleic anhydride, which have electron-withdrawing groups. Furan-2,5-dione has two ketone groups, which are electron-withdrawing. So perhaps furan-2,5-dione is the dienophile, and 2,5-dimethylthiophene is the diene? Or wait, diene is usually conjugated with double bonds. Thiophene has alternating double bonds, but when it's part of a cycloaddition, maybe it's acting as a diene. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, maybe both are acting as dienophiles or dienes, but that's less likely in a Diels-Alder. Let me think about the structure. Thiophene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds. Furan-2,5-dione is a furan ring with two ketones, so positions 2 and 5 have O=C-O groups. Wait, no, furan-2,5-dione would have two ketone groups in the 2 and 5 positions. So, the molecule is O=C-O-C6H2-O-C=O? No, wait, furan is five-membered. So the structure is O=C
