Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The setup is that it has mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, which is F = -kx. The options are all different expressions involving c, the speed of light, so I know relativity is definitely a factor here.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed for a harmonic oscillator is v_max = sqrt(kA/m), right? But wait, that's non-relativistic. This problem is relativistic, so I can't use that directly. Oh, right, because at high speeds, relativistic effects become significant. So I need to account for that.

Relativistic harmonic oscillators complicate things because the equations of motion change. Instead of the usual F = -kx, in relativity, the force might be different, but the problem states it still obeys F = -kx. So maybe the setup is using a relativistic version of the oscillator.

I think the energy considerations might help here. In the non-relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential. But relativistically, the kinetic energy is given by (gamma - 1)mc², and the potential energy is (1/2)kA², I guess. Wait, no, the potential for a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², so at maximum amplitude x = A, potential
