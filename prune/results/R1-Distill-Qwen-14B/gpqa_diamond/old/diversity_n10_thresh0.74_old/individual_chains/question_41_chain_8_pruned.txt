Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, I need to find the speed of the light relative to the observer in the lab. Let me think about this step by step.

Alright, the setup: a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer. Wait, wait, no, the glass is moving towards the observer, but the beam is in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the light beam is going in the same direction the glass is moving, and the glass is moving towards the observer. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam, which is toward the observer. So the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well. So from the lab frame, the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which is towards the observer. Or maybe the beam is moving towards the observer, but the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam, which would be towards the observer. Wait, I might need to clarify that.

Wait, the question says the glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. So the beam is moving towards the observer, and the glass is moving towards the observer as well, in the same direction as the beam. So the glass is moving towards the observer, and the beam is also moving towards the observer, but the glass is
