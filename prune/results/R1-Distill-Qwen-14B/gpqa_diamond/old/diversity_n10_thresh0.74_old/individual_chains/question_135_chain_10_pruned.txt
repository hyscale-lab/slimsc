Okay, so I have this question about particle physics and the decay of a boson. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, let's read the problem carefully. The interaction Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So, λ is a coupling constant, and X is the bosonic field. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV. The question is about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order.

I remember that for a boson to decay into fermions, it must couple to them. The decay products must have a combined mass less than the mass of the boson. Also, the fermions should come in pairs because of charge conservation and the nature of the interaction (like creation and annihilation of particles).

Looking at the Lagrangian, I see that X couples to ψ_f, which I assume is a fermion field. The term looks similar to Yukawa coupling terms, where a scalar field (like X) interacts with fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So any fermions that X decays into must each have a mass less than 3 GeV because each fermion must have energy at least equal to their rest mass, and since they come in pairs, the sum must be less than 6 GeV.

So, what are the possible fermions that can be produced? Let's list the known fermions and their masses:

- Electron (e-): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): about 0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ-): about 1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV.

Wait, but for each quark pair, the mass would be twice the mass of the quark. So for example, a strange quark pair would be 2 * 0.095 ~ 0.19 GeV. Similarly for others.

So, the boson X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs as long as 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

Given m_X is 6 GeV. Let's see which fermions satisfy 2m_fermion ≤6.

- Electron pair: 2 * 0.0005 = 0.001 GeV → allowed.
- Muon pair: 0.21 GeV → allowed.
- Tau pair: 3.554 GeV → 3.554 <6 → allowed.
Wait no, wait: 2 * 1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV. That's less than 6, so allowed.
- Up quark: 0.006 GeV → allowed.
- Down quark: 0.01 GeV → allowed.
- Strange quark: 0.19 GeV → allowed.
- Charm quark: 2.55 GeV → allowed.
- Bottom quark: 8.26 GeV → which is more than 6 → not allowed.

Wait, wait: 2 * 4.13 ≈ 8.26 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV, so can't decay into bottom quarks.

Top quarks are way too heavy. So possible fermion pairs are e, μ, τ, u, d, s, c.

But wait, the question is about what the Lagrangian allows. The given Lagrangian has ψ_f, which is a fermion field. The interaction term is λf ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. So the fermion field is ψ_f, which could be any fermion that this term is written for.

Wait, perhaps the fermion type depends on what the term is. The term is -λf ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, perhaps this is a Yukawa interaction where X couples to fermions of flavor f.

So, the field ψ_f is a Dirac spinor for a specific fermion. The term λf would be a coupling for each fermion species. So, the Lagrangian implies that X can interact with any of the fermions ψ_f. So, in this case, X can decay into any fermion-antifermion pair, as long as energy allows.

But wait, in reality, the coupling strength is another factor, but the question only asks about kinematically allowed decays, not which ones are actually possible due to other factors like coupling constants or selection rules.

So, X can decay into any pair of fermions where each is lighter than 3 GeV. Let's list the possible ones:

Electron (e+ e-): allowed.
Muon (mu+ mu-): allowed.
Tau (tau+ tau-): allowed because 2 * 1.777=3.554 <6.
Strange (s s): allowed, 2 * 0.095=0.19 <6.
Up (u u): allowed, 0.006 <6.
Down (d d): allowed, 0.
