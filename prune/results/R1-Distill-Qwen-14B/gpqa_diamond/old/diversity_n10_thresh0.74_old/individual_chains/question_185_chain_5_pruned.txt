Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Let me think. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ are the Pauli matrices and n is a unit vector. Oh right, Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices, so H is a 2x2 matrix as well.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz, each of which has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But here, the Hamiltonian is a vector product of σ and n. So σ · n is like the dot product, which is σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1.

But wait, the eigenvalues of any Pauli matrix σ_i are ±1. But when you have a sum of them scaled by some coefficients, what happens? Oh, right. The general form for the eigenvalues of a spin operator in direction n is ±ħ/2 times something. Wait, no, wait. Spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but in this case, the Hamiltonian is given as ε times σ · n, so maybe the eigenvalues are scaled by ε and something else.

Wait, let me think again. The Pauli matrices, when multiplied by a scalar and added together with coefficients, their eigenvalues are given by the square root of the sum of squares of the coefficients times the eigenvalues of each. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the structure of the matrix.

The operator σ · n is a sum of the Pauli matrices multiplied by components of n. So for example, if n is along the z-axis, σ · n would be σ_z. Then, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1. So the Hamiltonian would be ε σ_z, which would have eigenvalues ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), so eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, but wait, in the question, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n. So if n is any unit vector, σ · n is like a spin component in arbitrary direction. The eigenvalues of σ · n would be ±1, because each Pauli matrix's eigenvalues are ±1, and σ · n is a linear combination with coefficients that are direction cosines, but the magnitude would still be 1 because n is a
