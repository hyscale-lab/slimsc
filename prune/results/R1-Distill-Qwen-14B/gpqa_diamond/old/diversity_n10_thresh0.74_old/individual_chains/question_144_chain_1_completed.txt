--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonances and their decay distances. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that X is a meson resonance. We need to find the mean decay distance. The given data are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, which are various distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the formula is something like c multiplied by the lifetime gamma factor, multiplied by the velocity. But wait, let me get the exact formula right.

The mean proper lifetime (the lifetime in the particle's rest frame) τ is given by the reciprocal of the width Γ. So τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, since we're dealing with units where ħ is in GeV·s, how does that work? Let me think.

Wait, Γ is in MeV, so I need to convert that to GeV. Γ_X is 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. Because 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. So Γ = 0.32 GeV. Then τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, that's the proper time. But then, the mean distance the particle travels before decaying is L = γ * v * τ. Where γ is the Lorentz factor, and v is the velocity.

Wait, but how do we find γ and v from the given data? Because the production energy is E_X =8 GeV, and the mass is m_X=1.2 GeV. So the total energy E is 8 GeV, mass m =1.2 GeV.

So the energy E is related to the rest mass and momentum via E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². Oh wait, but I think in natural units (where c=1), E² = p² + m². So E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So p² = E² - m² = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56. So p = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

So momentum p is approximately 7.91 GeV/c. Then, the velocity v can be found from beta = p c / E. Wait, beta is v/c = (p c)/(E). So since p is 7.91 GeV/c, so beta = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 ≈ 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c, which is about 0.989c.

Then, the Lorentz factor gamma is E/(m c²). Since E is 8 GeV, m c² is 1.2 GeV. So gamma = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.666666...

So gamma is about 6.6667.

Now the mean lifetime in the lab frame is gamma times the proper lifetime. So τ_lab = gamma * tau. So tau was about 2.056875e-24 s, so tau_lab = 6.6666667 * 2.056875e-24 ≈ 1.37125e-23 seconds.

Wait, wait no, wait. Wait, the proper time is tau = ħ / Γ. So when we calculate the mean lifetime in the lab frame, it's gamma multiplied by tau. So yes, that's correct.

Then, the decay length L is v multiplied by tau_lab, which is v * gamma * tau. Alternatively, since L = v * t, where t is the lifetime in the lab frame. So:

L = v * gamma * tau.

But wait, the expression can be written as L = v * gamma * (ħ / Γ). Alternatively, since v is beta * c, and gamma is E/(m c²), maybe there's a more compact way to write this.

Alternatively, we can combine terms. Let me think.

We have:

L = v * gamma * (ħ / Γ)

v = beta c = (p c / E) * c = p c² / E.

Wait, but maybe another approach is better. Let me try substituting all the variables step by step.

First, compute tau = ħ / Γ. As before, ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV·s, Γ is 0.32 GeV.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈ 2.056875e-24 s.

Then, gamma is E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6666667.

v is (p c)/E. But p is sqrt(E^2 - m^2), so p = sqrt(8^2 - 1.2^2) = sqrt(64 - 1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈ 7.91 GeV/c. So v = (7.91 GeV/c * c) / 8 GeV → 7.91/8 ≈ 0.98875 c.

So v = 0.98875c.

Now, L = gamma * v * tau.

So substituting:

gamma = 6.6666667

v = 0.98875c

tau = 2.056875e-24 s

So L = 6.6666667 * 0.98875 * c * tau.

Wait, but wait, tau is already calculated as ħ / Γ, which is in seconds, so when multiplied by c (m/s) and gamma, it gives meters.

Let me compute each part:

Compute 6.6666667 * 0.98875 first.

6.6666667 * 0.98875 ≈ 6.6666667 * 0.98875 ≈ Let me compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325, and 0.6666667 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.6591667. So total is approximately 5.9325 + 0.6591667 ≈ 6.5916667.

So approximately 6.5916667.

Wait, perhaps a more precise calculation: 6.6666667 * 0.98875 = ?

Well, 6.6666667 is 20/3.

So 20/3 * 0.98875 = (20 * 0.98875)/3 = 19.775 /3 ≈ 6.591666667.

So approximately 6.591666667.

So then, L = 6.591666667 * c * tau.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.591666667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute that:

First, multiply 6.591666667 * 3e8 = 6.591666667 * 3e8 ≈ 1.9775e9.

Wait, 6.591666667 ×3=19.775, so 19.775e8 = 1.9775e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, no, wait: the time is in seconds, so the product is (1.9775e9 m) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, no, because L = (gamma * v) * c * tau? Wait, I think I messed up the units a bit. Let me re-express.

Wait, v is in terms of c, so v = beta c.

So tau is in seconds, so when you multiply by v (beta c) and gamma, the units are:

gamma (dimensionless) * beta c (m/s) * tau (s) → gamma*beta*c*tau → (m/s * s) → meters.

So actually, the calculation is:

L = gamma * beta * c * tau.

Gamma is 20/3 ≈6.6666667.

Beta is 7.91/8 ≈0.98875.

So gamma * beta ≈6.6666667 * 0.98875 ≈6.591666667.

So L = 6.591666667 * c * tau.

c is 3e8 m/s, tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 6.591666667 * (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s).

Wait, no, wait: 6.591666667 * 3e8 = 1.9775e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 * 2.056875) * 1e-15.

Calculating 1.9775 * 2.056875:

Let me compute 2 * 2.056875 =4.11375. Then subtract 0.0225 * 2.056875 = 0.046284375. So approx 4.11375 - 0.046284375 ≈4.067465625.

Wait wait, perhaps another approach: 1.9775 ≈ 2 - 0.0225.

So (2 - 0.0225) * 2.056875 = 2 * 2.056875 - 0.0225 * 2.056875.

Which is 4.11375 - (0.046284375) = 4.067465625.

So approximately 4.067465625e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655 *10^-15 m, and option C is 5.0223e-15.

Wait, so our approximate calculation gives 4.067e-15, which is very close to option B's 4.0655e-15. So perhaps option B is the correct answer.

But wait, let me check the exact calculation again to see if I missed anything.

Wait, perhaps I should go back and calculate more precisely. Let me recompute gamma, beta, and the product.

Gamma: E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV. So gamma= E/(m c²) → but since we're in natural units, it's E/(m). So 8 /1.2 = 6.6666666667.

Beta: p = sqrt(E² - m²) = sqrt(64 -1.44) = sqrt(62.56) ≈7.91 GeV/c. So beta= p c / E → (7.91 GeV/c * c)/8 GeV → 7.91/8 = 0.98875.

So gamma * beta = (8/(1.2)) * (7.91/8) = (7.91/1.2) ≈6.591666667.

So L= gamma * beta * c * tau.

Tau= ħ/(Γ) = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L= 6.591666667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute 6.591666667 *3e8 = 1.9775e9.

Then multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24.

Compute 1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 *2.056875) * 1e-15.

Compute 1.9775 *2.056875:

Let me compute 1.9775 * 2 = 3.955.

1.9775 * 0.056875 = ?

0.056875 is 37/656, but perhaps it's easier to compute 1.9775 * 0.056875.

Compute 1.9775 * 0.05 = 0.098875.

1.9775 * 0.006875 = 0.013546875.

Add them: 0.098875 + 0.013546875 = 0.112421875.

So total 1.9775 *2.056875 = 3.955 + 0.112421875 = 4.067421875.

So L=4.067421875e-15 meters.

Looking at the options: option B is 4.0655e-15, option D is 4.0655e-16.

So 4.067e-15 is closest to option B, 4.0655e-15.

But wait, perhaps I made an approximation in the calculation of sqrt(62.56). Let me compute that more accurately.

62.56 is 62.56, so sqrt(62.56) is 7.91, but let's check.

7.91² = 7.91 *7.91.

7 *7=49, 7*0.91=6.37 → 49 + 2*6.37 + 0.91².

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute 7.91^2.

7.91 *7.91: 7*7=49, 7*0.91=6.37, 0.91*7=6.37, 0.91^2=0.8281.

So (7 + 0.91)^2 = 7^2 + 2*(7)(0.91) + 0.91^2 =49 + 12.74 + 0.8281=49+12.74=61.74 +0.8281=62.5681. Oh, so sqrt(62.56)=7.91 because 7.91^2=62.5681. So that's correct.

So in that case, beta is 7.91/8=0.98875.

Hmm, but wait, that's accurate, so the calculation of gamma*beta is accurate.

But perhaps I should compute the product 6.591666667 times 2.056875e-24 more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation of L would give a more precise number.

Wait, but perhaps I should use more precise values for ħ. I used 6.582e-25 GeV·s as ħ, but the actual value is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let's recalculate tau more precisely: tau= ħ/(Γ) = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) × 1e-25 s.

6.582 /0.32: 0.32 ×20.56 =6.582. So 6.582/0.32=20.5625.

Wait, because 0.32 ×20 =6.4, 0.32 ×0.5625=0.180. So 6.4 +0.180=6.58. So 6.582/0.32≈20.56875.

Wait, more accurately:

0.32 ×20.5625 = 6.58 (because 0.32 ×20=6.4; 0.32 ×0.5625=0.180; 6.4+0.180=6.58). So 6.582 is a bit more. So 6.582/0.32 =20.56875.

So tau=20.56875e-25 s. Wait, that's 2.056875e-24 s, which is what I had before. So that's correct.

So the calculation of L= gamma * beta * c * tau is 6.591666667 *3e8 m/s *2.056875e-24 s.

So 6.591666667 * 3e8 =1.9775e9 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s: 1.9775e9 * 2.056875e-24 = 1.9775 *2.056875 *1e-15.

As before, 1.9775 ×2.056875.

Wait, perhaps more accurately:

1.9775 × 2 = 3.955.

1.9775 ×0.056875 = Let me compute it as 1.9775 * (0.05 + 0.006875) = (1.9775 *0.05) + (1.9775 *0.006875).

1.9775 *0.05 =0.098875.

1.9775 *0.006875 = Let's compute 1.9775 × 0.006875:

0.006875 is 11/1600, but perhaps it's easier to compute 1.9775 * 0.006875.

1.9775 × 0.006 =0.011865.

1.9775 ×0.000875= approx 0.001727.

Adding them: 0.011865 +0.001727=0.013592.

So 0.098875 +0.013592=0.112467.

So total 3.955 +0.112467=4.067467.

So 4.067467e-15 meters.

The options are:

A) 5.0223 *1e-16

B)4.0655 *1e-15

C)5.0223 *1e-15

D)4.0655 *1e-16

So my calculation gives approximately 4.0675e-15 meters, which is very close to option B:4.0655e-15.

But wait, perhaps I should be more precise in the calculation of gamma and beta.

Wait, let me re-calculate gamma and beta exactly.

Gamma = E/(m) = 8 /1.2 =6.666666666666667.

Beta = p/E, where p= sqrt(E² -m²) = sqrt(64-1.44)=sqrt(62.56)=7.91 GeV/c.

So beta=7.91/8=0.98875.

So gamma*beta=6.666666666666667 *0.98875.

Let me compute that as fractions.

6.666666666666667 is 20/3.

0.98875 is 791/800. Let me see, 0.98875= 98875/100000= but perhaps it's better to write as 791/800.

So (20/3) * (791/800).

Multiply numerator: 20 ×791= 15820.

Denominator: 3 ×800=2400.

So 15820/2400 = let's reduce it.

Divide numerator and denominator by 20: 15820/20=791, 2400/20=120.

791/120 ≈6.591666667.

So yes, 6.591666667.

So the product gamma*beta is exactly 15820/2400= 791/120.

So 791/120=6.591666667.

So L= (791/120) * c * tau.

c=3e8 m/s.

Tau=2.056875e-24 s.

So L= (791/120) *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 791/120 =6.591666667.

Now, 6.591666667 *3e8 =1.9775e9.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 ×2.056875) ×1e-15.

As before, 1.9775 *2.056875=4.067467.

So 4.067467 ×1e-15 m.

So approximately 4.06747e-15 m.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, which is very close. So why is there a slight discrepancy?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the product 1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it more precisely.

Wait, 1.9775e9 is 1,977,500,000.

2.056875e-24 is 0.000000000000000000000002056875.

Multiplying them:

1,977,500,000 * 0.000000000000000000000002056875.

Wait, this is 1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 ×2.056875) × 1e-15.

Which is 4.067467 ×1e-15 meters.

So approximately 4.067e-15 m.

But option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Hmm, the difference is about 2e-16, which is about 0.05% or so. Which suggests that perhaps I made a minor error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the value of ħ is more precise. I used 6.582e-25 GeV·s. The actual value is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Wait, let me check that. ħc is approximately 197.3 MeV·fm. But perhaps using a more precise value of ħ would change tau slightly.

Wait, perhaps an exact calculation would be better.

Tau = ħ / Γ.

Given ħ = 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s.

Γ=0.32 GeV.

So tau = (6.582e-25) / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32) ×1e-25.

6.582 /0.32 = let's compute this exactly.

0.32 ×20 =6.4 → 6.582-6.4=0.182 remaining.

So 0.182 /0.32 = 0.56875.

So total 20.56875 → tau=20.56875e-25 s = 2.056875e-24 s.

So that's correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the difference comes from using more precise values for gamma and beta, but I think my calculations are correct.

So the correct answer should be option B:4.0655e-15 m.

Looking again at the options, option C is 5.0223e-15, which is larger, perhaps that would be if someone uses a different calculation, like using the mass in the denominator without considering the units correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the width is given in MeV, not GeV. Wait, no, I did convert Γ from 320 MeV to 0.32 GeV correctly.

So I think the correct answer is option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

where:
- \( \gamma = \frac{E}{m} \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \beta = \frac{p}{E} \) is the velocity in units of \( c \),
- \( \tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma} \) is the proper lifetime,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant,
- \( E \) is the total energy of the particle,
- \( m \) is the rest mass of the particle,
- \( \Gamma \) is the width of the particle.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \tau \)
The proper lifetime \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \) and \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

Given \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \), we find:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} = 6.6666667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \beta \)
The velocity \( \beta \) is:

\[
\beta = \frac{p}{E}, \quad \text{where } p = \sqrt{E^2 - m^2}.
\]

First, calculate \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{8^2 - 1.2^2} = \sqrt{64 - 1.44} = \sqrt{62.56} = 7.91 \, \text{GeV}/c.
\]

Then:

\[
\beta = \frac{7.91}{8} = 0.98875.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \gamma \beta \)
The product \( \gamma \beta \) is:

\[
\gamma \beta = 6.6666667 \times 0.98875 = 6.591666667.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( L \)
The mean decay distance \( L \) is:

\[
L = \gamma \beta c \tau
\]

Substitute \( \gamma \beta = 6.591666667 \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \tau = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s} \):

\[
L = 6.591666667 \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24}.
\]

First, calculate \( 6.591666667 \times 3 \times 10^8 \):

\[
6.591666667 \times 3 \times 10^8 = 1.9775 \times 10^9.
\]

Then, multiply by \( 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9775 \times 10^9 \times 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = (1.9775 \times 2.056875) \times 10^{-15}.
\]

Calculate \( 1.9775 \times 2.056875 \):

\[
1.9775 \times 2.056875 = 4.067467.
\]

Thus:

\[
L = 4.067467 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 6: Compare with options
The closest option to \( 4.067467 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
