Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. And the question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. The options are A to D, with different exponents on r.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. So plx = 1/distance, where distance is usually in parsecs. So if plx is small, the distance is large, and vice versa.

The problem says the number of stars N varies as 1/plx^5. Let me write that down: N ‚àù 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/r (assuming r is the distance), substituting that in, N would be proportional to (r)^5. Because 1/(1/r)^5 equals r^5.

But wait, the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. Oh, right, so we're looking for the differential relationship, like dN/dr. Because the question is about the change in number per unit distance.

So if N is proportional to r^5, then the derivative dN/dr would be proportional to 5r^4. But wait, the options don't have a 5, they're just looking for the functional form. So the change in number would be proportional to r^4.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Alternatively, maybe the number of stars in a shell at radius r with thickness dr is proportional to r^5 times dr. Because the number of stars in a volume element depends on how the density changes with distance. Wait, that might complicate things.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider that the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r is given by the surface density (stars per unit area) multiplied by the area of the shell.

Wait, but the question says that in a specific region, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the surface density (number per unit area) is proportional to 1/plx^5.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think in terms of volume. The number of stars in a volume is related to the density and the volume. But perhaps in this case, it's a surface phenomenon, like the number per unit area or something else.

Wait, let's think about it more clearly. The number of stars per unit area (surface density) could depend on distance. So if a region has a certain surface density, like sigma, then sigma = N/(Area). If the area is 4 pi r^2 (for a sphere), but that's if it's a thin shell. Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the number of stars in a region is proportional to 1/plx^5, which is r^5, as plx is 1/r.

Wait, perhaps the number of stars is being considered as a function of distance. But in any case, the question is about how the number changes with distance. So if N(r) is proportional to r^5, then the change in N with r (dN/dr) is proportional to r^4.

Looking at the options, option C says ~ r^4, which would be the case.
