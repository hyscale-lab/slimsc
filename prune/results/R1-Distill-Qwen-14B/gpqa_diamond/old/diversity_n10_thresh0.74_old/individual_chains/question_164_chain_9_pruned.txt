Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. Then, spectroscopic observations show radial velocity (RV) variations. In system_1, the two stars have RV amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. The question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. We need to consider the total mass of each system.

Hmm, I remember that in binary star systems, the stars orbit their common center of mass. The radial velocity method measures their Doppler shifts as they move towards and away from us. The amplitude of these velocities relates to the mass of the companion.

Wait, right, the radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by some formula. I think it's related to the mass function. Oh yeah, the mass function formula comes into play here. The mass function involves the orbital period, the velocity semi-amplitudes, and the masses of the two stars.

But wait, since we're comparing two systems, maybe there's a way to relate their masses without knowing the exact individual masses. Let me think.

The mass function for each star in a binary system is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), where M1 and M2 are the masses of the stars, and i is the inclination angle. But since both systems are eclipsing, their inclination i is near 90 degrees, so sin i is approximately 1. So, the mass function simplifies.

But wait, in our case, we're looking at the RV amplitudes. Each star's RV amplitude is inversely proportional to its mass. Because the more massive star would have a smaller orbit, hence smaller velocity. So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2, no, wait, the product of mass and velocity should be the same for both stars because they share the same orbital period. Right, because M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a is the semi-major axis. And the velocity is proportional to a / period. So, M1 * (a1) = M2 * (a2). Since the period is the same for both stars in a binary, because they orbit each other, their velocities are proportional to a. So M1 * K1 = M2 * K2.

Wait, that might not be right. Let's think again: in a binary system, the two stars orbit the center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit. The velocity is determined by how fast each star moves around the center of mass.

The formula for velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (2 Ï€ G )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (P)^(1/3) (M1 + M2)^(2/3)
