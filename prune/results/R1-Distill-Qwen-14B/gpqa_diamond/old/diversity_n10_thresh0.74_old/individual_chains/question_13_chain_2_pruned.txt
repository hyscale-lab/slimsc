Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and break it down.

The starting material is a methanol solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember that Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene. Its structure is a bicyclic monoterpene with a specific configuration. The (R) configuration refers to the specific stereoisomer, right? So I think Limonene has a structure that's a bicyclic system, maybe something like a cyclohexene ring with a methyl group and some substituents.

The first reaction is with Pd/C under hydrogen. That's a hydrogenation catalyst. So I guess the double bond in Limonene is going to be hydrogenated. Wait, but how many double bonds does Limonene have? Oh right, Limonene has one double bond in a six-membered ring, so hydrogenation would add hydrogen across that double bond.

But wait, the problem says that after one equivalent of hydrogen is consumed, product 1 is isolated. So I think the hydrogenation would add two hydrogens per double bond. But if only one equivalent is used, maybe it's a partial hydrogenation? Hmm, no, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a question of when the reaction stops. Oh, maybe the hydrogenation isn't complete. Wait, no, because one equivalent of H2 would mean two moles of H2 per mole of double bond, but wait, no, wait. Each equivalent of H2 would add two hydrogens. So if it's one equivalent, maybe it's fully hydrogenated. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think: for each mole of H2, one mole of H2 is consumed. Each H2 molecule has two H atoms, so each mole of H2 adds two H atoms per molecule. So, for a double bond, which is a diene, each H2 adds two H's. So for one equivalent, that's one mole of H2 per mole of limonene, which would fully hydrogenate the double bond.

Wait, no, maybe the reaction stops after one equivalent is consumed, so perhaps it's a partial hydrogenation. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe the hydrogenation is for a different purpose, like maybe moving a substituent in a ring-opening scenario. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the structure of (R
