Alright, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, okay, I remember that parallax is related to the distance of a star. Parallax (p) is the apparent shift in position of a star as observed from Earth due to our orbit around the Sun. The formula I recall is p = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. Wait, actually, no, it's p in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So d = 1/p.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed. Uniformly distributed in what sense? I think it means that the number density of stars is uniform in space. So the number of stars per unit volume is constant. Let's call that n_0, a constant. So, n_0 = number of stars per cubic parsec, or something like that.

Now, the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, how does N depend on the parallax p? Let's think about the volume of space between two parallax ranges, say p and p + dp. Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a small change in p corresponds to a certain volume.

Wait, so for a given parallax p, the distance is d = 1/p. So if the parallax increases (p goes up), the distance decreases. That makes sense because closer stars have larger parallaxes.

Now, think about a thin shell at distance d with thickness dd. The volume of that shell would be the surface area of a sphere with radius d multiplied by the thickness. The surface area is 4πd², so the volume is 4πd² dd. But since d = 1/p, substituting that in gives 4π (1/p²) (dp/dp) * dp. Wait, let me clarify that.

Wait, parallax p is 1/d, so dp = - (1/d²) dd. So, dd = -d² dp. Since d is positive, and p is positive, but when p increases, d decreases. So, perhaps the volume element in terms of p is 4π (1/p²) * (dp). Let me think again.

Alternatively, the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dd is n_0 * 4πd² dd. Because the volume is 4πd² dd, and n_0 is the number per
