Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle. Hmm, I remember that spin-1/2 particles have some interesting quantum mechanical properties, especially when it comes to magnetic moments and their interactions with magnetic fields.

The question says the particle's magnetic moment mu is equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin component in the z-direction. So mu = γ S_z. Got it.

Initially, the magnetic field is along the +Z direction. So the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with this field. Then the field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction, same magnitude B. So initially, the particle was in a state aligned with the Z field, and then the field direction changes to Y. 

Wait, when the field is turned off, does that mean the particle's state doesn't change immediately? Because quantum states don't change unless there's a perturbation. Oh right, when the field is suddenly turned off, the state remains the same, but the Hamiltonian changes because the field is now in a different direction.

So the initial state is along the +Z direction, which I think is the spin-up state. Let me denote that as |↑⟩_z. The magnetic moment in the z-direction is mu_z = gamma * (ħ/2) since for spin-1/2, S_z is ħ/2 for spin-up. So the initial magnetic moment is gamma*(ħ/2) in the +z direction.

Now, the magnetic field is turned off, and then a new field in the +Y direction is applied. The particle's state doesn't change immediately because the field change is sudden. So the initial state after the change is still |↑⟩_z.

But the Hamiltonian now depends on the new magnetic field direction. The Hamiltonian for a magnetic moment in a magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Since the field is along Y, H = -μ_y B. But wait, mu is gamma S_z initially. Wait no, mu is given as gamma * S_z, but when the field is along Y, the magnetic moment will have components in all directions. Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the spin and the Hamiltonian.

Wait, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, right? Because for spin, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin operator. So mu = gamma S, where S is the vector (S_x, S_y, S_z). So when the magnetic field B is in the Y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes H = - gamma B S_y. Because the energy is -mu·B, which is -gamma B (S · direction of B). Since B is along Y, it's -gamma B S_y.

Wait, but the ordering of the negative sign. The energy is H = -μ·B. So if B is along +Y, then H = -gamma B S_y. Alternatively, sometimes people write H = -gamma B (S · B), which would be -gamma B S_y in this case.

Now, the time evolution of the state is determined by this Hamiltonian. The initial state is |↑⟩_z. We can express this state in terms of S_y eigenstates or find its expectation value over time.

But the question is about the average of the z-component of the particle's moment, <mu_z>, which is gamma times <S_z>, since mu_z = gamma S_z. So we need to find how <S_z> oscillates over time.

Wait, but the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the time evolution is governed by this Hamiltonian.

I think I can model this using time-dependent perturbation theory, but since the system is two-level, maybe I can diagonalize the Hamiltonian or use the time evolution operator.

Alternatively, since H is proportional to S_y, and the initial state is |↑⟩_z, which is an eigenstate of S_z, let's express |↑⟩ in terms of S_y eigenstates.

The eigenstates of S_y are |+y⟩ and |-y⟩. The spin-up state in the z-direction can be written as a combination of these. Specifically, |↑⟩_z = (|+y⟩ + |-y⟩)/√2. Because the eigenstates of S_y are superpositions of S_z eigenstates.

So when we apply the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y, which can be written in terms of the ladder operators. S_y = (S_+ + S_-)/(2i). So H = -gamma B (S_+ + S_-)/(2i) * something? Wait, H is proportional to S_y, which is (S_+ - S_-)/(2i)? Wait, let me get the ladder operators right.

The raising operator S_+ = S_x + i S_y, and lowering operator S_- = S_x - i S_y. So S_y can be expressed as (S_+ - S_-)/(2i). So S_y = (S_+ - S_-)/(2i). 

Thus, H = -gamma B (S_+ - S_-)/(2i) * something. Wait, no, H = -gamma B S_y, which is H = -gamma B (S_+ - S_-)/(2i) * multiplied by some factor?

Wait, let me compute S_y in terms of S_+ and S_-.

S_+ = S_x + i S_y,

S_- = S_x - i S_y.

Adding these, S_+ + S_- = 2 S_x.

Subtracting, S_+ - S_- = 2 i S_y.

So S_y = (S_+ - S_-)/(2i).

So H = -gamma B ( (S_+ - S_-)/(2i) ) 

Simplify that:

H = -gamma B/(2i) (S_+ - S_-).

We can factor out the constants:

H = (gamma B)/(2) ( S_- - S_+ ) /i * (-1). Wait, let me compute.

Wait, H = -gamma B * S_y = -gamma B (S_+ - S_-)/(2i).

So,

H = (-gamma B) (S_+ - S_-) / (2i) 

Which can be written as (gamma B/(2i)) (S_- - S_+).

The i is imaginary, so 1/i = -i. So,

H = (gamma B / (2i)) (S_- - S_+) = (gamma B (-i)/2) (S_- - S_+).

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to write H in terms of raising and lowering operators and then find its matrix elements in the S_z basis.

Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to find the time evolution of the state |↑⟩ under H.

The initial state is |↑⟩_z. Let's write down the matrix of H in the
