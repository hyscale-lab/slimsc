Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the question is about identifying the chemical formula of an organic compound based on its spectroscopic data. Hmm, let's start by going through the information provided.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring. So, that's like a benzene ring with two substituents. The FTIR shows ester groups, right? Esters have carbonyl groups (C=O) which typically absorb around 1700-1750 cm⁻¹. So, the presence of ester groups is confirmed.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. There are six signals in total. Let's break them down:

1. Two signals for aromatic-H. That suggests that there are two sets of aromatic protons. Since it's a di-substituted benzene, the substituents could be in positions that split the aromatic protons into two groups. Like, maybe para or ortho substitution. If it's para, the aromatic protons would be two sets: two equivalent and two others. Wait, actually, if it's para, the four aromatic protons would split into two doublets. Or maybe it's not exactly para, but two substituents causing different environments.

2. Two signals corresponding to vinyl-H. One is a doublet, and the other is a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds, so maybe part of an ester group? Because esters have an -O-CO-O- group, and maybe some adjacent CH2 or CH groups. Wait, but esters usually have a carbonyl and an adjacent oxygen. Another thought: maybe the substituents on the benzene include an ester group, which might have a vinyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, no, the substituents on the benzene would be groups like esters. Oh wait, the compound is a di-substituted aromatic ring with an ester group. So perhaps each substituent is an ester group. Or maybe one substituent is an ester and another is something else.

Wait, but wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl protons usually come from double bonds, like in alkenes or possibly in aromatic rings. But since it's a benzene ring which is aromatic and already conjugated, maybe the substituents have their own vinyl groups.

Wait, but benzene can have substituents that are vinyl groups, like in the case of styrene. But in this case, the substituents might be something else. Let me think: the NMR shows two sets of vinyl-H. One is a doublet (maybe coupling with one adjacent proton), and the other is a doublet of quartets (so coupling with two different sets perhaps? Or maybe it's a more complex splitting).

3. Two signals for -CH3 groups. So, there are two different methyl groups. And importantly, there are no signals for -CH2 groups. So any CH2 groups must be either not present or possibly in a quartet that's overlapping with something else, but the question says there are none.

Putting it all together. So, the molecule has benzene rings with two substituents, one of which is an ester group (since IR shows ester). The substituents might be an ester and another group that has a
