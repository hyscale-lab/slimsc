Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me start by understanding what's being asked here.

The question provides a compound with the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and after reacting it with a series of reagents, I need to identify the final product from the options provided.

First, I'll try to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The molecular formula is C8H9NO. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea about the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1. So plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18 -9 +1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is 3), plus two double bonds, or a benzene ring and a double bond and a ring. Alternatively, maybe a benzene ring and a carbonyl group (since O is present), which would account for 4, but wait, the O is in the formula, so maybe a ketone or aldehyde group.

Looking at the NMR data: 
- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H) â€“ that's a high chemical shift, likely an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show around 9-10 ppm. A triplet suggests coupling with two protons, but wait, aldehyde protons are usually deshielded and appear as singlets or maybe triplets if adjacent to something. Hmm, but wait, maybe it's an aromatic proton in a different environment? Or could it be an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group? Or maybe part of an enol structure? Hmm, I'm not sure yet.

- 6.98 (d, 2H) and 6.51 (d, 2H): These are probably two sets of doublets, each integrating to two protons. This looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Maybe a benzene ring with substituents on opposite positions. The downfield shift (around 6.98) suggests electron-withdrawing groups, but looking at the values, 6.98 and 6.51, that's more like a di-substituted benzene, possibly with two substituents in para positions. Wait, but the upfield of 6.51 is a bit lower, which might suggest substituents like -OCH3 or something else. But without more info, I'll set that aside.

- 6.27 (bs, 2H): Broad singlet integrating to two protons. Broad signals can be from protons near oxygen, like in an enol form, or perhaps from an aromatic ring with adjacent substituents. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde adjacent to a CH2 group or something else. Wait, but I already considered 9.72 as aldehyde.

- 3.
