Okay, so I've got this immunology question here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about rotavirus tagged with GFP and given to mice. The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins. They observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid. Oh right, because the stomach has a lot of acid which can break things down, so that makes sense. Then some were entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. Intestinal mucus is a barrier, so maybe the GFP didn't get to where it needed to go.

They identified fluorescent Peyer patches. Peyer patches are these structures in the small intestine, part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). They're like little immune hubs. So the GFP must have made it to the Peyer patches, meaning the rotavirus was taken up by the immune cells there.

Then they isolated the proliferating cell population. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are probably B cells or T cells that are activated. When B cells are activated, they start proliferating and differentiating into plasma cells and memory cells.

They sequenced the variable heavy chain gene and found high variability. High variability in the variable region... wait, what processes cause changes in the variable regions of antibodies?

Hmm, the options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching recombination, D) VDJ recombination.

I remember that VDJ recombination is during B cell development in the bone marrow. It's when the V, D, and J segments are combined to form the variable region of the heavy chain. Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the B cell is activated, usually in the germinal centers. This process introduces mutations to increase the diversity of the antibody. Class switching is when the B cell changes the class of antibody it produces (like from IgM to IgG), which doesn't change the variable region but the constant region.

So, in this scenario, the cells are proliferating in the Peyer patches. Peyer patches have a lot of B cells, and if the rotavirus is acting as an antigen, the B cells would be activated. Once activated, they go into the germinal centers where somatic hypermutation occurs. That would lead to a lot of different variable regions in the heavy chains, which explains the high variability in the sequencing results.

Wait, the variable heavy chain gene has high variabilityâ€”so each cell's gene is different. Somatic hypermutation does cause point mutations, leading to more diversity. So the process must be A) somatic hypermutation.

Alternatively, VDJ recombination happens earlier when the B cell is developing, so that's not during the immune response happening here. Class switching doesn't affect the variable region, so option C is about changing the class, but the variable sequences are already made. So the right answer should be A.


The question involves rotavirus tagged with GFP being administered to mice, with observations of fluorescence being destroyed by stomach acid and intestinal mucus. Despite this, fluorescence was detected in Peyer patches, which are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Peyer patches are immune hubs where B cells can encounter antigens like rotavirus. The isolated proliferating cell population, likely activated B cells, showed high variability in their variable heavy chain gene sequences upon sequencing.

To determine the process responsible for this variability, the options were analyzed:

- **A) Somatic hypermutation**: This process occurs in germinal centers during the immune response, introducing mutations to increase antibody diversity. It explains the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene sequences.
- **B) Complement activation**: This is a part of the innate immune response and does not involve changes to the variable regions of antibodies.
- **C) Class switching recombination**: This process alters the constant region of the antibody but does not affect the variable region, so it does not explain the observed variability.
- **D) VDJ recombination**: This occurs during B cell development in the bone marrow, where the variable, diversity, and joining (V, D, J) segments are combined. However, this process happens earlier in development and does not account for the variability observed in this immune response.

The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences is best explained by **somatic hypermutation**, which occurs after B cell activation in germinal centers. This process increases antibody diversity to better target the antigen.

Answer: A
