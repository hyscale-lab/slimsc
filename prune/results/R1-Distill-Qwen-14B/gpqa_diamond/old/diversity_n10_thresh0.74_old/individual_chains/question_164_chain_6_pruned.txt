Okay, let's try to figure out this astronomy problem. Hmm, so it's about binary star systems and their masses. I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, and their radial velocities can tell us something about their masses.

So, the question gives us two systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, and the periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. The radial velocity (RV) amplitudes are given as 10 km/s and 5 km/s for system_1, and 15 km/s and 10 km/s for system_2.

Wait, RV amplitude is the maximum speed that a star moves towards or away from us. I think that's related to the mass of the other star. The more massive the companion, the larger the velocity amplitude of the smaller star.

I remember that in a binary system, the two stars orbit each other. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit (because it's closer to the center of mass) and a smaller velocity amplitude. The less massive star has a larger orbit and larger velocity.

So, the mass ratio (q) is the mass of the secondary divided by the mass of the primary. So if q is small, the secondary is much less massive.

But wait, the RV amplitudes are inversely proportional to the masses. So if star A has velocity v_A and star B has velocity v_B, then v_A / v_B = M_B / M_A.

Because the system's center of mass requires M_A * v_A = M_B * v_B. So M_A / M_B = v_B / v_A.

So in system_1, let's denote the two RV amplitudes as v1a (10 km/s) and v1b (5 km/s). So v1a is the velocity of the first star, and v1b of the second.

So for system_1, the mass ratio q1 = M1b / M1a = v1a / v1b = 10 /5 = 2. So the primary is twice as massive as the secondary.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the velocity amplitude is the speed of each star. The more massive star moves less. So if star A has a smaller velocity, it's more massive. So the primary would be the one with the larger mass and smaller velocity.

So in system_1, star A has
