Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The problem says that particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. They're asking for the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, so I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed (the dilated time) depends on their speed. The proper lifetime τ₀ is the lifetime in the rest frame of the particle. The observed lifetime τ would be longer because of time dilation, right? So τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) or equivalently, γ = E/(m c²), since E = γ m c².

Wait, but E is given here as 27 GeV, and mass m is 3.41 GeV. So let me compute γ. E is the total energy, so γ = E/(m c²). But since m is already given in GeV/c² (assuming, because m c² is 3.41 GeV), then E is 27 GeV. So γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, 3.41 * 8 is 27.28. So 27 /3.41 is approximately 7.91. So γ is about 7.91.

So the observed lifetime τ is γ τ₀. So τ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that: 7.91 *8 = 63.28, so 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does this relate to the decay length and the resolution needed in the bubble chamber? Oh right, the decay length L is the average distance the
