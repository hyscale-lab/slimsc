Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. The question is about the decay of the |3,0,0> state to the |1,0,0> state through two dipole transitions. Hmm, I remember that in the hydrogen atom, electrons can transition between energy levels via photon emission or absorption, and these transitions are governed by certain selection rules.

Wait, right, the selection rules for dipole transitions. I think the key selection rules for the hydrogen atom are that delta l (change in angular momentum) can be ±1, and delta m (change in magnetic quantum number) can be 0, ±1. Oh, and another thing, n can change by any integer, but the transitions are only allowed if l changes by ±1. So for a dipole transition, l must go from whatever it was to l±1.

The initial state is |3,0,0>. So n=3, l=0, m=0. It's decaying to |1,0,0>, so n=1, l=0, m=0. But wait, if l starts at 0, can it transition to another l=0? That doesn't fit the selection rule. Oh, right, because for a dipole transition, the change in l must be ±1. So the initial state has l=0, so the next state must have l=1. So the first transition must go to l=1.

So the first transition goes from |3,0,0> to some |2,1,m>. Because n decreases by 1 (but wait, no, n could change by more than 1? Wait, the selection rules for n aren't as strict as for l. So from n=3, it can go to n=2,1, etc. But in this case, since the final state is n=1, maybe two steps: 3→2→1.

So the possible first steps are from |3,0,0> to |2,1, m>, where m can be −1, 0, +1. Because delta m can be up to ±1.

Wait, the initial state has m=0. So the first transition can change m by 0, +1, or -1. So the possible m values after the first transition are m= -1, 0, +1. So the first state could be |2,1, -1>, |2,1,0>, or |2,1,+1>.

Then, the second transition would be from n=2 to n=1. So what are the possible l values for n=2? Well, for n=2, l can be 0,1. So in the second step, from l=1 (since the first step is to l=1), the next l must change by ±1. So from l=1, possible l for second state is 0 or 2. But the final state is l=0, so the second step must go from l=1 to l=0.

Wait, but how? Because the only way for l to go from 1 to 0 is a dipole transition (delta l = -1). So the second transition must be from l=1 → l=0. So the second state is |1,0, m'>.

Wait, but how about m in the second transition. The initial state after the first transition is |2,1, m1>, where m1 is -1, 0, +1. Then, the second transition would have m changing by 0, ±1. So m2 can be m1-1, m1, m1+1.

But the final state is m=0. So for the transition from the first to the second state, the m must end at 0. So let's see. Let's take each possibility from the first transition.

First possibility: first transition is to |2,1, -1>. Then, in the second transition, m can change by +1, so from -1 to 0. Because m2 = m1 +1. Or could it also change by 0 or -1? Wait, from m1=-1, delta m can
