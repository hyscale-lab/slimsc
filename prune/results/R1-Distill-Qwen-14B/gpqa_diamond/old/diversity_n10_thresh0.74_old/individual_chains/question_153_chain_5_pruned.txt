Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think through it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions (A), (B), and (C) with their respective reactants and products. The options are A, B, C, D, each listing what each product (A, B, C) is. I need to figure out which option is correct.

Starting with reaction (A): the reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, with NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol) as the conditions. So, what's going on here?

Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile since it's an enolate equivalent. Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl. In a Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) would attack the beta position of the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl.

Wait, but wait, when the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, it forms a new carbon-carbon bond. So, the product would have the malonate group added to the beta position. Let me imagine the structure. The acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but wait, actually 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)OCH3? Wait no, wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C-OCH3 where the middle carbon is attached to a p-tolyl group. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurately:

The structure is CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but wait, the substituent is on the beta carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-(p-tolyl) as the acrylate. Hmm, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-C(=O)-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group attached to the middle carbon. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3?

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. The acrylate is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester: structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the gamma position? Wait, maybe not. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3? Or perhaps it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No, I think the correct structure is CH2=CH-C(O)OCH3, but that's the regular acrylate. If it's 3-(p-tolyl), then the p-tolyl is on the third carbon from the ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (E
