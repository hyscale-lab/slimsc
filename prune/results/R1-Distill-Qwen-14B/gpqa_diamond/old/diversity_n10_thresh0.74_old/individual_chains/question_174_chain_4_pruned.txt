Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about atomic nuclei and fission. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the problem says an atomic nucleus with mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So wait, if the initial mass is M, the sum after fission is 0.99 M. That means some mass was converted into energy, right? Because in fission, some mass is lost as binding energy.

So let me get the masses of the two fragments. Let's call the less massive one m. Then the more massive one is 2m. Together, they're 3m. According to the problem, 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.99 M /3. That would make the masses of the fragments: m = 0.33 M, and 2m = 0.66 M. Wait, no, 0.33 *3 is 0.99, so yeah.

Wait, but the initial rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. So M c² is 300 GeV. But after fission, the sum of rest masses is 0.99 M c², so 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the energy released is 3 GeV, right? But that's probably not needed directly.

The question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1. And we need to find the difference between the correct (relativistic) T1 and the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Hmm. So in a classical approximation, we might assume that the fragments move with some speed where their kinetic energies are small compared to their rest mass energy. But given that the initial mass is 300 GeV, but the sum is 297, so 3 GeV is lost as energy, which is about 1% loss. Wait, actually, that's a significant amount, so maybe relativistic effects are important here.

Wait, but the kinetic energy in the center-of-momentum frame would be considered, but the nucleus is initially at rest, so
