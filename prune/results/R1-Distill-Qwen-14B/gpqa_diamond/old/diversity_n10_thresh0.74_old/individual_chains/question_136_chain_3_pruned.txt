Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let me first understand what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r squared. So the magnitude of the field is f(r) = 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. We need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇·f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, right. So the integral is ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV over the volume of the sphere. I remember from Gauss's law in electromagnetism that the divergence of a radial vector field can be expressed in terms of spherical coordinates. But wait, I'm not sure if I remember the exact formula.

So, the vector field is radial and depends only on r, the distance from the origin. In spherical coordinates, the divergence for such a field should have a specific form. Let me think. Oh right, for a vector field that's purely radial and depends solely on r, the divergence is given by (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² f(r)). That rings a bell. 

Given f(r) = 1/r², let's compute its divergence. Plugging into the formula:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) 

Wait, simplifying the expression inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is just 1. So d/dr of 1 is zero. Oh, so the divergence would be zero? That seems odd. 

But wait, maybe I should double-check that formula. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in plugging in the function. Let me go through it again.

The general formula for the divergence of a radial vector field F = F(r) er (where er is the unit radial vector) in spherical coordinates is:

∇·F = (1/(r²)) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So F(r) here is 1/r². So substituting:

∇·F = (1/(r²)) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ] 
= (1/r²) * d/dr (1
