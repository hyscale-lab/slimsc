Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, parallax is a measure of distance in astronomy. Remember, the parallax (plx) of a star is inversely proportional to its distance. So, smaller plx means the star is farther away. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, parallax is the angle subtended at the Earth's orbit, so the formula is plx = 1/distance in parsecs. So if a star is closer, its parallax is larger. Oh right, so plx is bigger for closer stars.

The question is about the number of stars per unit range of plx. So I guess it's asking how the density of stars in terms of parallax changes as plx increases or decreases. Wait, it's the number per unit plx. So as plx increases (meaning closer stars), how does the number per unit plx change.

Wait, stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. So the assumption is that space is uniformly filled with stars, but since we can't see infinitely far, the number of stars at a certain distance depends on the volume they occupy. Oh wait, but the problem says the distribution is uniform in the sky, so maybe in terms of number density, the number of stars in any volume is uniform.

But wait, the number of stars per unit volume is constant. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d with thickness dr would be proportional to the volume of the shell, which is 4πd² dr. Because the volume of a spherical shell is 4πr² dr.

But here, the problem is related to parallax. Parallax plx is 1/d, so d = 1/plx. So let's think in terms of plx. Let me denote plx as p. So p = 1/d → d = 1/p.

We want to find how the number of stars per unit p (since p is in inverse parsecs or something) changes. So per unit change in p, how many stars?

Wait, the number density of stars is n, a constant. So the number of stars in a volume dV is n * dV. The volume in question here is a thin shell at distance d, thickness dr, which is 4πd² dr.

But dr is in terms of distance, and we want to relate it to p. Since p = 1/d, dr = - (1/d²) dp. Because differentiating p = 1/d, dp = -1/d² dd → dr = -d (dp) → Hmm, wait: Let me think. Since p = 1/d → d = 1/p. So dr = derivative of d with respect to p. dr = d(1/p)/dp = -1/p² dp. Oh right, so dr = - (1/p²) dp.

But since we're considering a small change in p, the negative just indicates the direction, but when considering absolute numbers, we'll take the magnitude. So dr = (1/p²) dp.

Putting it all together, the number of stars in a shell at p is n * 4π d² dr. But d is 1/p, so d² is 1/p². Substituting:

Number of stars = n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp.

Wait, because dr is (1/p²) dp. So the expression becomes 4π n (1/p^4) dp.

So the number of stars per unit p (since dp is the unit range) is proportional to 1/p^4.

Wait, but wait a minute. The question says 'number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx)'. So is it the number per unit of plx? Like, if you have a range dp, how many stars are in that range.

Yes, that's exactly what we've calculated. So the number per unit p is proportional to 1/p^4.

Looking at the options, option A is ~1/plx^4. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure. Because I remember that the number of stars as a function of distance goes like 1/d², because the surface area increases as d². But here, we're talking about parallax, which is 1/d, so it's more inverted.

Wait, number of stars in a shell at distance d is proportional to d² dr. But since dr = (1/p²) dp, and d=1/p, then substituting, the number becomes proportional to (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp = 1/p^4 dp.

So yeah, that's correct. So the number per unit p is 1/p^4.

So the correct option is A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that parallax \( p \) is inversely proportional to distance \( d \), i.e., \( p = \frac{1}{d} \). The problem assumes a uniform distribution of stars in the sky, meaning the number density of stars (\( n \)) is constant. The number of stars in a thin spherical shell at distance \( d \) with thickness \( dr \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dr \).

To express this in terms of \( p \), we use \( d = \frac{1}{p} \) and \( dr = -\frac{1}{p^2} dp \). Substituting these into the volume expression, the number of stars in a shell becomes proportional to \( 4\pi \left(\frac{1}{p^2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{p^2} dp\right) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{4\pi}{p^4} dp \). Thus, the number of stars per unit range of \( p \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{p^4} \).

From the given options:
- **A) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \)** matches this result.
- **B) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \)**, **C) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^1} \)**, and **D) \( \sim \frac{1}{\text{plx}^3} \)** do not align with the derived proportionality.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
