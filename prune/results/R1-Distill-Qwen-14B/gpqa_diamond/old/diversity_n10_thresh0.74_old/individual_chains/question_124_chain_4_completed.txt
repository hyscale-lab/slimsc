Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particles and Lorentz factors. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types, travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these fast-decaying particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The radius of the detector is 30 meters.

The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls. The options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, I think I remember that the number of particles reaching the detector depends on how fast they're moving. Because if they're moving faster, they might live longer (from our frame's perspective) and have more time to travel further before decaying.

But wait, the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, so their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer due to time dilation. The lifetime τ in the lab frame is γ times the proper lifetime τ0. So τ = γ τ0.

The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel before hitting the detector walls is the radius, R. So the time they have to reach the wall is t = R / v, where v is the speed of the particle.

But wait, in the lab frame, their speed is v ≈ c, since it's ultra-relativistic. So t ≈ R / c. But their lifetime is γ τ0, so for the particles to reach the wall, their lifetime must be at least t. So τ = γ τ0 ≥ t → γ τ0 ≥ R/(c). So the maximum distance they can travel is R = v t = c t (since v≈c) but considering their lifetime.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The particles are created at the center, and they decay after traveling some distance. The proper lifetime is τ0. The time they have to reach the wall is t = R / (β c), where β = v/c. So the condition is that the lifetime τ must be greater than or equal to t. Because if τ is longer than t, the particle has time to reach the wall before decaying. But if τ is shorter, they decay before reaching.

Wait, τ is the dilated lifetime, so τ = γ τ0. So the condition is γ τ0 ≥ R/(β c).

Wait, but in the problem, they say that for a Lorentz factor of 20, one third of the particles reach the inner walls. So when γ=20, the fraction reaching is 1/3. We need to find the γ that gives 2/3.

I think the fraction is determined by the ratio of the number of particles that reach the wall versus those that decay before. But since the particles are moving at a high speed, the fraction depends on how much their lifetime is compared to the time it takes to reach the wall.

Wait, maybe the number of particles that reach the wall is proportional to the ratio of their lifetime (γ τ0) to the time it takes to reach the wall (R/(β c)).

Wait, no, perhaps it's a probability. The probability that a particle reaches the wall is the probability that its lifetime τ is greater than the time t it takes to reach the wall.

So the survival probability P is the probability that τ ≥ t.

But τ is gamma times tau_0, and t is R/(beta c).

Wait, but beta is approximately 1 for high gamma. So beta ≈ 1, so t ≈ R/(c).

So for a given gamma, the time t is R/(c). The particle's lifetime in the lab frame is gamma tau_0. So the condition is gamma tau_0 >= t.

Wait, but wait. No, because the particles have a probability distribution of decaying at any time. The survival probability P is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by time t. For an exponential decay, P = exp(-t/(tau_0)).

Wait, wait, I think I'm getting confused between the proper time and the lab frame time. The decay rate is given by the proper time. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer by gamma.

So the decay process in the lab frame has a lifetime tau = gamma tau_0. So the survival probability is P = exp(-t/(tau)) = exp(-t/(gamma tau_0)).

But in our case, the time t is the time from creation to when they reach the detector wall, which is R/(beta c).

So the survival probability is P = exp( - (R/(beta c)) / (gamma tau_0) ).

But wait, because beta is approximately 1 for high gamma, as gamma increases, beta approaches 1.

So we can approximate beta as 1 for simplicity.

So t ≈ R/(c) = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds.

So P = exp( - t/(gamma tau_0) ) = exp( - (30/(c gamma tau_0)) )

Wait, but tau_0 is the proper lifetime. Hmm, but the problem gives that when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3.

So when gamma =20, P1 = 1/3 = exp( - (30)/(c * 20 tau_0) ) )

Let me write that equation:

1/3 = exp( -30/(20 c tau_0) )

Take natural log on both sides:

ln(1/3) = -30/(20 c tau_0 )

ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986

So,

-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau_0 )

Multiply denominator:

20 c tau_0 * 1.0986 =30

So,

c tau_0 = 30/(20 *1.0986 )

Calculate 20 *1.0986 ≈21.972

30 /21.972 ≈1.366

So c tau_0 ≈1.366. So tau_0 ≈1.366/(3e8) seconds.

But maybe we don't need the exact value of tau_0, because when we consider the other case, with a different gamma, the tau_0 will cancel out.

So, the problem says that when gamma=20, P=1/3. We need to find gamma_new where P_new=2/3.

So let's set up the equation for P_new=2/3.

2/3 = exp( -30/(gamma_new * c tau_0) )

Take natural log:

ln(2/3) = -30/(gamma_new c tau_0 )

ln(2/3) ≈-0.4055

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma_new c tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055=30/(gamma_new c tau_0 )

Multiply both sides by gamma_new c tau_0:

0.4055 gamma_new c tau_0 =30

But from the first case, when gamma=20, we have:

c tau_0 =30/(20 * 1.0986 )

Which is approximately 30/(20 *1.0986) =30/(21.972) ≈1.366.

So substitute c tau_0 =1.366.

Then,

0.4055 * gamma_new *1.366=30

Calculate 0.4055 *1.366 ≈0.4055 *1.366.

Let me compute: 1.366 *0.4 is 0.5464, and 0.0055 *1.366≈0.0075. So total ≈0.5539.

So,

0.5539 *gamma_new =30

gamma_new =30 /0.5539 ≈54.15.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close. So the answer should be A)54.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because I might have made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let's do the exact steps:

From the first case:

gamma1=20, P1=1/3.

Equation 1: ln(1/3) = - (30)/(gamma1 c tau_0 )

Which is ln(1/3)= -30/(20 c tau_0 )

Equation 2: gamma2 is the new gamma where P2=2/3.

ln(2/3)= -30/(gamma2 c tau_0 )

Dividing equation 1 by equation 2:

[ln(1/3)]/[ln(2/3)] = [ -30/(20 c tau_0 ) ] / [ -30/(gamma2 c tau_0 ) ]

Simplify:

[ ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ] = (gamma2)/(20 )

Because the ( -30/(c tau_0 )) terms cancel.

So,

gamma2 = [ ln(1/3) / ln(2/3) ] *20.

Compute ln(1/3) is approx -1.0986; ln(2/3) is approx -0.4055.

So,

gamma2 ≈ ( (-1.0986)/(-0.4055) ) *20 ≈ (2.708)*20 ≈54.16.

So yes, around 54, so answer A)54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability \( P \) is given by the exponential decay formula:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\tau}\right),
\]

where \( t \) is the time it takes for a particle to travel from the center of the detector to its inner walls, and \( \tau \) is the particle's lifetime in the lab frame. For ultra-relativistic particles, \( \tau = \gamma \tau_0 \), where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor and \( \tau_0 \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The time \( t \) is approximately \( t \approx \frac{R}{c} \), where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the detector and \( c \) is the speed of light.

The survival probability becomes:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{\gamma \tau_0 c}\right).
\]

### Step 1: Relating the given data
When \( \gamma = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the formula:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{20 \tau_0 c}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986 = -\frac{30}{20 \tau_0 c}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\frac{30}{20 \tau_0 c} = 1.0986 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tau_0 = \frac{30}{20 \cdot 1.0986 \cdot c}.
\]

This gives \( \tau_0 \) in terms of known constants.

### Step 2: Finding the new Lorentz factor
We now seek \( \gamma_2 \) such that \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \). Using the same survival probability formula:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma_2 \tau_0 c}.
\]

Substituting \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \) and solving for \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
0.4055 = \frac{30}{\gamma_2 \tau_0 c}.
\]

Substituting \( \tau_0 \) from Step 1:

\[
0.4055 = \frac{30}{\gamma_2 \cdot \frac{30}{20 \cdot 1.0986 \cdot c} \cdot c}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
0.4055 = \frac{30 \cdot 20 \cdot 1.0986}{\gamma_2}.
\]

Rearranging:

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{30 \cdot 20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculating \( \gamma_2 \)
Compute \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 \approx \frac{30 \cdot 20 \cdot 1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 54.16.
\]

### Step 4: Selecting the closest option
The closest value to \( \gamma_2 \approx 54.16 \) is \( \gamma_2 = 54 \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
