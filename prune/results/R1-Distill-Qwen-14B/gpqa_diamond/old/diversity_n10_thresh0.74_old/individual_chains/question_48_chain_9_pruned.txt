Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. So I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone with a six-membered ring. The structure is a cyclohexane ring with a ketone group (O) attached. The first reaction is treating it with bromine, which forms product 1.

Wait, bromineâ€”Br2. I think when a ketone like cyclohexanone reacts with bromine, it's usually a nucleophilic addition. But wait, no, wait. Oh right, bromine can add to the double bond if it's present. But wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Hmm. Wait a second, maybe it's some kind of enol formation. Oh wait, no, maybe it's a dienophiles thing? Or perhaps it's an epoxidation? No, wait, bromine (Br2) in certain conditions can add across the carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think. The carbonyl group in cyclohexanone is a ketone. When you add Br2 to a ketone, I'm not sure. Oh, maybe it's a bromination via the enolate? Or perhaps it's an electrophilic addition. Wait, the carbonyl is an electrophilic site. So Br2 can add to the carbonyl, right?

Wait, in the presence of a base, maybe. So when cyclohex
