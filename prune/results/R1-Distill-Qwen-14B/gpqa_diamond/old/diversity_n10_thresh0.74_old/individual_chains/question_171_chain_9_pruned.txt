Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions with bromine. Hmm, I need to figure out the order of the substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer. Let's see.

The question gives six substances, all substituted benzene rings. They undergo substitution with excess bromine, and each forms only one monobromo derivative. Wait, so we're looking at where the bromine substitutes.

Wait, in electrophilic substitution, the substituents on the benzene ring direct the incoming electrophile (Br+) to certain positions. Depending on whether the substituent is activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para directing.

So each substituent in the given compounds will direct the substitution. For each compound, I need to determine the directing effect and then figure out whether the major product is para or something else, but wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each compound, how much of the para product is formed compared to others.

Wait, but all are undergoing substitution to form mono-bromo derivatives. So it's about the regiochemistry—so each substituent directs the Br to certain positions.

Wait, but if a substituent is meta-directing, then the Br would add in the meta position, but if it's para, then it adds in para. But in some cases, like when there are strong activating groups, the para product would be major. For deactivating groups, maybe the para is a minor product.

Wait, but wait, if the substituent is strongly activating (like -OCH3, -NH2, etc.), the ring is activated, and the substituent is ortho/para directing. So the para product would be a major isomer.

For deactivating groups, like nitro (-NO2), which is meta directing. So substitution occurs at meta, so the para isomer would be minor. But wait, when the substituent is strong deactivating, like -NO2, the ring is deactivated, so the substitution is slower but more directed. But nitro is meta directing, so the substitution would be meta. So the para product would not form much in that case.

Wait, but wait, what about the substituents given in the problem?

Let's go through each substituent:

1) С6H5-CH3: This is toluene. The substituent is -CH3, which is an activating group (since it's an alkyl group, electron donating via induction and hyperconjugation). So it's ortho/para directing. So substitution occurs primarily at ortho and para positions. In a monobromination, the product distribution would have more para than meta. But since there are two ortho positions and one para, the para would be major compared to meta.

Wait, but wait. For toluene, the major products are para and ortho. Since para is one position and ortho has two, but steric factors might make para more favorable. Or perhaps in the case of bromination, which is a harsher condition, more para? Or maybe the para is a major product, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe for bromination, the substitution occurs more in the para position because activation is better there.

But wait, in any case,
