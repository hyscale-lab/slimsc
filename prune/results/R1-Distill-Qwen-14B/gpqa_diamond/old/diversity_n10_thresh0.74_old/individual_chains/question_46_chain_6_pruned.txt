Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is: Racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene is treated with Grubbs catalyst. How many possible products are there (excluding ethene)?

The options are A)4, B)8, C)6, D)2.

Hmm, I remember Grubbs catalyst is used in olefin metathesis reactions. Grubbs is a transition metal catalyst, typically used for ring-closing metathesis or cross metathesis. Metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups. So when Grubbs is used on an alkene, it can cause the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds.

Wait, the starting material is racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Let me draw its structure. Pent-1-ene means the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2CH3)2? Wait no, wait. 3-methylpent-1-ene is CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)-CH2-? No, wait again. Wait, pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. But with a methyl group on carbon 3.

Wait, pent has five carbons. So for 3-methylpent-1-ene: the chain is CH2=CH-C(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, let me index this properly. The double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, the structure is CH2
