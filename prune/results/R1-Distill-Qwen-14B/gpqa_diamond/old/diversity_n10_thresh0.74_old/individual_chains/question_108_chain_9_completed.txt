Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term to the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says the magnetic field B is parallel to the Oz axis and has a value of 1 Tesla. They mention small values of m, which is the orbital magnetic quantum number. Wait, m is the z-component of the angular momentum, right? So for a given orbital angular momentum l, m can be -l, -l+1,...,0,...,l.

They're asking to compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE. The options are whether ⟨H⟩ is much larger, much smaller, equal, or greater than ΔE.

I remember that the paramagnetic effect arises from the interaction between the magnetic moment of an electron and an external magnetic field. The magnetic moment μ is given by μ = -gμ_B m, where g is the Landé g-factor (approximately 2), μ_B is the Bohr magneton, and m is the magnetic quantum number.

The energy of the system in the magnetic field should be H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, this simplifies to H = -μ_z B. Substituting μ_z gives H = g μ_B B m.

Wait, so ⟨H⟩ would be the expectation value of this Hamiltonian. Since the state is an eigenstate of L_z (because m is well-defined), ⟨H⟩ would just be H itself for that state. So ⟨H⟩ = g μ_B B m.

Now, what's the transition energy ΔE? Oh, that's the energy difference between two atomic energy levels. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by the Rydberg formula. The wavelength λ is given as 0.4861 micrometers, which I think is about the wavelength for the Balmer series, like the H-alpha line. Let me calculate the energy difference ΔE from the wavelength.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. Planck's constant h is about 6.626e-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. The wavelength λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 4.861e-7 meters.

So, E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (4.861e-7 m). Let me compute that. The numerator is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = approx 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 4.861e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 ≈ 4.089e-19 J.

Hmm, converting Joules to eV because energy levels are often discussed in eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So 4.089e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, what's the paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩? It's g μ_B B m. Let's compute that. g is approximately 2, μ_B is the Bohr magneton which is about 9.274e-24 J/T. B is 1 T. So ⟨H⟩ = 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 1 T * m.

But wait, m is given as a small value. For hydrogen, the orbital angular momentum quantum number l can be up to n-1. The possible m values range from -l to l. But in the problem, m is small, like m=0 or m=±1. Let's assume m=1 for a maximum case, perhaps. Wait, but if m is small, maybe we should take m=0. Then ⟨H⟩ would be zero. But that can't be right because the question is comparing magnitudes. Alternatively, maybe m is non-zero but small in magnitude. Let's think about possible m for hydrogen.

For example, in the 2p orbital, l=1, so m can be -1, 0, +1. So m is small in magnitude, up to 1.

If m is 1, then ⟨H⟩ is 2 * 9.274e-24 J * 1 T * 1 = 1.8548e-23 J. Convert to eV: 1.8548e-23 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 1.158e-4 eV. That's about 0.0001158 eV.

Compare that to ΔE of 2.55 eV. So 0.0001158 eV is way smaller than 2.55 eV. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

Wait, but wait. The problem says 'small values of m' which could mean m is small in magnitude, but perhaps in a state where m is not zero. But even if m is 1, as calculated, the energy is way smaller. What if m is zero? Then ⟨H⟩ is zero, which is even smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me double-check: the Hamiltonian for the Zeeman effect is H = -μ·B = -g μ_B m B. So yes, that's correct.

So the paramagnetic term is H = g μ_B B m. So when B=1 T, g=2, μ_B=9.27e-24 J/T, m=1, it's about 1.85e-23 J, which is 1.85e-23 / 1.6e-19 ≈ 0.000115 eV.

ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

So the question is, is ⟨H⟩ much less than ΔE? If so, option C says ⟨H⟩ << ΔE, which would be correct.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the question is considering the hyperfine structure due to spin-orbit coupling or something else. Oh wait, no, the paramagnetic term here is due to the orbital magnetic moment, not spin. The spin term is similar, but maybe m is for spin here. Wait, no, the orbital magnetic quantum number is l, not s. Hmm, but the problem says orbital m, so orbital angular momentum.

Wait, but in hydrogen, especially for higher energy levels, the orbital m can be larger. Or wait, no, m is up to l, which is up to n-1. So for n=2, l=1, m=±1. For n=3, l=2, m up to ±2. But if m is small like m=1, it's still small.

Wait, but let's think about the numbers again. The paramagnetic term ⟨H⟩ is about 1e-4 eV, and ΔE is about 2.5 eV. So 1e-4 is much less than 2.5.

So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE. Therefore, the correct option is C.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ with the transition energy ΔE of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energies.

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term ⟨H⟩
The paramagnetic energy is given by:

\[
\langle H \rangle = g \mu_B B m
\]

Where:
- \( g \approx 2 \) (Landé g-factor),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) (Bohr magneton),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) (magnetic field strength),
- \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number (small in magnitude).

Assuming \( m = 1 \) (maximum small value), we compute:

\[
\langle H \rangle = 2 \cdot 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \cdot 1 \cdot 1 = 1.8548 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\langle H \rangle = \frac{1.8548 \times 10^{-23}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 0.0001158 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Transition Energy ΔE
The transition energy is derived from the wavelength of the emitted photon:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}.
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 3 \times 10^8}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.089 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{4.089 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The paramagnetic coupling term ⟨H⟩ is approximately \( 0.0001158 \, \text{eV} \), while the transition energy ΔE is approximately \( 2.55 \, \text{eV} \). Clearly, ⟨H⟩ is much smaller than ΔE.

### Conclusion
The paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct option is:
