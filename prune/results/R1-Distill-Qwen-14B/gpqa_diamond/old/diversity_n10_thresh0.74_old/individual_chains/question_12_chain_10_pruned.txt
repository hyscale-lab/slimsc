Okay, I've got this physics problem here. Let me read it carefully. So it's about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) and a neutrino. Pi(+) is at rest, so that simplifies things a bit. The rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two kinetic energies, probably for mu and the neutrino.

Hmm, right. I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. So after the decay, the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal and opposite. But neutrinos are neutral and super light; I think their rest mass is negligible compared to the others, right? So for the neutrino, maybe we can treat its mass as zero. Or wait, I should check. Oh, but for pion decay, the neutrino is actually a charged lepton, maybe a muon neutrino, which is nearly massless. Okay, so m_ν ≈ 0.

So the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + ν. Since the pion is at rest, the muon and neutrino must move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta. Because initial momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel each other out. So p_mu = -p_ν. But since the neutrino has negligible mass, its energy is just |p_ν|c, because E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), which becomes E_ν = |p_ν|c. Similarly, the muon's energy would be E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 c^4 + m_mu^2 c^4 ).

Wait, but I'm working in units where c=1 for particle physics, so I can ignore the c factors for simplicity. So E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2).

Since the pion is at rest, the total energy before decay is just its rest energy, E_initial = m_pi c^2, which is 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy is E_mu + E_ν = m_pi c^2. So E_mu + E_ν = 139.6 MeV.

Also, the momenta are equal and opposite, so p_mu = p_ν, because the neutrino's momentum is equal in magnitude to the muon's. But wait, no. Wait, p_mu and p_ν must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So |p_mu| = |p_ν| = p, let's say.

So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2).

For the neutrino, E_ν = p, because m_ν is zero. So E_ν = p.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_ν = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6 MeV.

Hmm. I can set up the equation: sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me write this as sqrt(p² + a²) + p = M, where a = 105.7, M=139.6.

I need to solve for p.

Let me subtract p from both sides: sqrt(p² + a²) = M - p.

Now, square both sides: p² + a² = (M - p)^2.

Expand the right side: M² - 2 M p + p².

So, p² + a² = M² - 2 M p + p².

Subtract p² from both sides: a² = M² - 2 M p.

Then, rearrange: 2 M p = M² - a².

So p = (M² - a²) / (2 M).

Plugging in the numbers: M is 139.6, a is 105.7.

Compute M²: 139.6^2. Let me compute that. 139.6 * 139.6. Let's see: 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16.

a² is (105.7)^2. 105^2 is 11025, 0.7^2 is 0.49, and cross term is 2*105*0.7=147. So (105 + 0.7)^2 = 105^2 + 2*105*0.7 + 0.7^2 = 11025 + 147 + 0.49 = 11172.49.

So M² - a² is 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Wait, 19488.16 minus 11172.49. Let me subtract step by step. 19488 - 11172 is 8316. Then 0.16 - 0.49 is -0.33. So 8316 - 0.33 = 8315.67? Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because 19488.16 minus 11172.49. Let me compute:

19488.16
-11172.49
= ?

19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's see:

19488.16 minus 11172 is 8316.16. Then minus 0.49: 8316.16 - 0.49=8315.67.

So M² - a² = 8315.67.

Then p = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6).
