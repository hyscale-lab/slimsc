Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they form sodium acetate and water.

The question says we start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So, the first thing I need to find is the new concentration after dilution. Oh, right, dilution uses the formula M1V1 = M2V2. Let me calculate that.

So M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The total volume after adding 20 cm³ of water is 40 cm³. So M2 would be (0.05 * 20) / 40. Let me compute that: 0.05 times 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

Wait, for the equivalence point, I think I need to find out how much NaOH is needed to neutralize all the acetic acid. So let's find the moles of acetic acid initially. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). The volume after dilution is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1 between acetic acid and NaOH, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence would be 0.001 moles. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed is moles / concentration = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 liters, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point occurs when 10 cm³ of NaOH is added.

But wait, the problem says to find the pH at 25% titration. So 25% of the equivalence volume. Oh, wait, no. 25% titration usually refers to the fraction of the acid that has been neutralized. So if the equivalence volume is 10 cm³, then 25% would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. Or wait, sometimes 25% titration refers to 25% of the way to equivalence, meaning 25% of the equivalence volume has been reached. So for the equivalence volume of 10 cm³, 25% would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So that’s when 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe the 25% is of the total NaOH needed. So, for the first part, 25% of the equivalence point. So at that point, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So moles of NaOH added would be 0.25 × 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

So, let me structure this. For the 25% titration point:

We have a mixture of acetic acid and its conjugate base (acetate ion) because the NaOH will have reacted with some of the acetic acid. So it's a buffer solution. So I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation here.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA])

First, find pKa. The Ka is given as 1.85e-5. So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)). Wait no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 5.267 on the negative scale. Wait, wait, no: The log(1.85e-5) is log(1.85) + log(1e-5) → 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Now, for the 25% titration, how much of the acid has been neutralized? So, moles of HA initially after
