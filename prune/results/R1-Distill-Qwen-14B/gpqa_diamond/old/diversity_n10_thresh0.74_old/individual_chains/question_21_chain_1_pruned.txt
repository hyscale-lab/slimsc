Alright, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but let's try to break it down. Okay, the question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let me read it again. Part A is about which compound doesn't show tautomerism, and part B is about which compound shows optical isomerism.

First, let's tackle part A. The compounds given are benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. So, I need to figure out which of these doesn't exhibit tautomerism.

Tautomerism occurs when a hydrogen atom moves from one atom to another, leading to the formation of an enol and a keto form. This usually happens in compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups or in cyclic ketones. For tautomerism to occur, the molecule must have a structure that allows for the shifting of the hydrogen and the conjugated double bonds.

Benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups (quinone structure). I remember that quinones can undergo tautomerism. For example, para-benzoquinone can tautomerize to ortho-benzoquinone. Wait, but wait, isn't benzoquinone a conjugated di-ketone? So, it should have the possibility for enol formation, leading to tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, on the other hand, is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. I'm wondering if this structure allows for tautomerism. Maybe each ketone is separated by a CH2 group, so the ring is 1,3,5-trione. Now, for tautomerism, the molecule must have a hydrogen adjacent to a carbonyl group that can shift. But wait, in 1,3,5-trione, each carbonyl is adjacent to two other carbonyls in a way that might not allow for such hydrogen movement. Alternatively, maybe it's more rigid because it's a tricyclic structure. Or perhaps each of the carbonyl groups is too separated to allow for the necessary conjugation for tautomerism. If each carbonyl is on alternating positions, maybe the structure is more rigid and doesn't allow the tautomerism shift. Or maybe the molecule doesn't have any hydrogens that can shift because the adjacent carbons are all carbonyls. Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have each of the three carbonyl groups, each on a carbon that is between two other carbonyl groups. So each of those carbons is C=O, so their adjacent carbons are also C=O. So, the carbons next to the carbonyl groups are either quaternary (like part of the ring) or maybe not. Wait, in 1,3,5-trione, each oxygen is on a carbon that is connected to two other carbons which are also carbonyls. So, the structure is O=C-(CH2)-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-, or something like that, but in a ring.

Wait, no. Let me visualize the structure. Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring where positions 1, 3, and 5 have carbonyl groups. So, the structure is:

O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C- arranged in a ring. So each of the carbonyls is separated by a CH2 group. So each carbonyl is on a carbon that is connected to two other carbons, both of which are carbonyl carbons. Hmm, that's a bit unusual. So, in this setup, each carbonyl is across from another. Wait, perhaps in this case, the molecule might not have any hydrogens that are alpha to a carbonyl group. Because all the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are either also carbonyls or part of the ring structure, maybe without any hydrogens attached. For example, each carbonyl is at a position where the adjacent carbons are either another carbony
