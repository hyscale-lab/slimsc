Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about pericyclic reactions, specifically sigma-tropic rearrangements. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question has three parts (A, B, C) each with a starting material and conditions, and I need to choose the correct product from the given options.

First, let me go through each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacts with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form product A.

Hmm, I remember that when there's a dienol or something similar under acid conditions, it can form an oxonium ion, which might undergo a Claisen rearrangement. But wait, the starting material here is an amine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon. Oh, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amineâ€”so that's like a structure where the amine is attached to a carbon that has two methoxy groups.

But then it's reacting with but-3-en-2-ol. But-3-en-2-ol is a secondary alcohol with a double bond at C3. So maybe it's something like (CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2?), but wait, but-3-en-2-ol structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CHCH2CH2OH? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol would have the OH on C2 and a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but that's not possible because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: but-3-en-2-ol would have the structure CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait, but 3-en is double bond between C3 and C4? But but only has four carbons, so positions would be 1, 2, 3, 4. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, that can't be. Oh wait, perhaps it's CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Because but-3-en-2-ol would be HOCH2-C(H)=CH2. Wait, no. Let me draw it out. Carbon 1: CH2, carbon 2: CH(OH), carbon 3: CH2, and carbon 4: maybe a double bond? Wait, no. Alternatively, it's CH2=C-CH(OH)-CH3. Oh, wait, but that would be 3-en-2-ol. So the structure is CH2=C-CH(OH)-CH3? So the double bond is between C1 and C2, then the OH is on C3. No, wait, no. Wait, numbering: the double bond starts at C3, so for but-3-en-2-ol, the double bond is between C3 and C4, and
