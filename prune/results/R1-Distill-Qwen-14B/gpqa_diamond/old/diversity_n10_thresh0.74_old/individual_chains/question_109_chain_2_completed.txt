Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle and Pauli statistics. Hmm, let me read through it again.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, I'm a bit confused about that equation. Oh right, I think it's a condition for the symmetry of the wavefunction under exchange because they are identical particles. So the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric if they have half-integer spins.

The final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I remember that isospin T is related to the symmetry of the state. For two nucleons, the isospin can be 0 or 1. So if T is 0, it's an isosinglet state, which is symmetric under exchange (since I think T=0 implies antisymmetric spatial wavefunction if the spin is symmetric, or vice versa? Wait, maybe I should think more carefully about the Pauli exclusion principle here.)

Wait, the condition given is T = S + L + 1 mod 2. So when T is 0, that means S + L + 1 is even, so S + L must be odd. Because 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2. So S + L = 1 mod 2. So S + L is odd.

Now the problem is about which partial wave is not permitted. The options are about the emitted particle's angular momentum state, which is denoted by a lowercase letter.

Wait, the process is the initial state is 1S0. So the initial state has S=0 (since it's 1S0, which refers to spin 0? Wait, wait. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0: 2S+1=1 implies S=0. L is S (so orbital angular momentum is l=0, which is S). J is 0. So the initial state has spin S=0, orbital L=0, and total angular momentum J=0.

They emit a particle X, so the final state is the two nucleons (NN) in some state, and the emitted particle X in some state. So the final NN state will have some isospin T(NN)=0, and we need to figure out what their angular momentum and spin would be, and then see which of the options doesn't satisfy the condition.

Wait, but the particle X is emitted along with the NN. So the process must conserve angular momentum and parity.

I'm a bit stuck, but let me think step by step.

First, the initial state is 1S0, which is S=0, L=0, J=0. So the total angular momentum is zero.

When the NN system emits a particle X, the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial state has J=0. So the final state (NN plus X) must also have total J=0. But wait, the problem is only considering the final NN state, not the emitted particle X. Wait, no, the question is about the NN final state and the emitted particle. Wait, the options describe the emitted particle X's angular momentum state. So the question is about the angular momentum state of X, given the final NN state.

Wait, the question says which partial wave is not permitted, where the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to a final state (like 7D1 + p), with p possibly being the particle X.

Wait, perhaps the initial 1S0 is the NN state, which emits a particle X, resulting in a new NN state. So the initial NN state is 1S0, which changes after emitting X.

Wait, but the problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So, for the final NN state, their isospin is 0. And based on the condition, their isospin T = S + L +1 mod 2. So T=0 implies S + L =1 mod 2 (because 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = -1 ≡ 1 mod 2). So S + L must be odd.

So for the final NN state, S (their total spin) plus L (their orbital angular momentum) must be odd.

Wait, but the final state's spin and L are part of their state. So in the final state, the NN has some spin S and orbital L, such that S + L is odd.

Now, considering angular momentum conservation. The initial state has J=0 (since it's 1S0, so J=0). The total angular momentum of the system before and after emission must be the same. So the initial state is J_initial =0.

After emission, the system consists of the NN state and the emitted particle X. The total angular momentum J_final must also be 0.

So J_initial = J_final → 0 = J_NN + J_X + ... Hmm, but actually, the total angular momentum is a vector sum. So the vector sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta of NN and X must sum to zero.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the total angular momentum. So J_initial is zero, so J_final must be zero. So the final state's total angular momentum (NN plus X) must be zero.

Wait, but X is a particle emitted, so the process is NN → NN' + X. So perhaps the initial angular momentum is J_initial =0, and the final state must have J_NN' + J_X =0. But J is a vector, so it's not just the sum; it's the vector sum.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state has angular momentum J=0, and the final state (NN' + X) must have their total angular momentum conserved. But without knowing the details of how the angular momenta of NN' and X add, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, but each option gives the angular momentum state of X. So let's look at the options.

Each option is labeled as initial state → final state + particle X. For example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So here, the particle X is p, with angular momentum state l=1 (since D is l=2? Wait, wait—no, wait. The notation in the options is a bit unclear. The emitted particle X is given with a lowercase letter: for example, 'p' is probably a pion, which I think has spin 0, so its angular momentum comes from its orbital angular momentum. Or wait, perhaps the letter denotes the orbital angular momentum state. Hmm, wait, the term refers to the angular momentum state. So the term letters are S, P, D, F, etc., which denote the orbital angular momentum quantum number l. So 's' is l=0, 'p' is l=1, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc.

Wait, but in the options, the emitted particle has a term symbol like p, s, etc. So, for example, in option D: 3P0 + s. But that would mean that X has an orbital angular momentum l=1 (since P is l=1), and the lowercase 's' is l=0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the term is for the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum. So in option D, the particle X would have an orbital angular momentum state of s, which is l=0.

Wait, maybe in the options, the emitted particle's angular momentum is given as l. So for each option, the angular momentum of X is given by the lowercase letter.

So, for example, option A: 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So X is p, which would have l=1 (since p is l=1). Similarly, option D: 3P0 + s → X has l=0.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the emitted particle's angular momentum state (as in its orbital angular momentum) is given by the lowercase letter. So for example, 'p' is l=1, 's' is l=0, 'd' is l=2, 'f' is l=3, etc.

So, in each option, the emitted particle X has an orbital angular momentum l given by the lowercase letter. So for each option, X has l_x.

Wait, but the problem is about the conservation of angular momentum and parity. So let's think about parity as well.

The initial state is 1S0. The parity of the initial state is (-1)^L_initial. Since L_initial is 0 (from 1S0), the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

The emitted particle X has intrinsic parity of -1. So the parity of the emitted X is -1. But when it's emitted, its spatial wavefunction contributes a parity factor of (-1)^l_x, where l_x is the orbital angular momentum of X.

So the parity of the entire final state (NN' and X) would be the product of the parity of NN' and the parity of X (including its orbital part). Because parity is multiplicative.

But wait, the parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L_NN', since their orbital angular momentum is L. The parity of X is (-1)^{l_x} * intrinsic parity of X. X's intrinsic parity is given as -1. So overall, the parity of X is (-1)^{l_x} * (-1) = (-1)^{l_x +1}.

So the total parity of the final state would be [parity of NN'] * [parity of X] = (-1)^L_NN' * (-1)^{l_x +1} = (-1)^{L_NN' + l_x +1}.

But since parity must be conserved, the initial parity (+1) must equal the final parity.

So, (-1)^{L_NN' + l_x +1} = 1.

That implies that L_NN' + l_x +1 must be even.

So L_NN' + l_x +1 ≡ 0 mod 2.

Which means L_NN' + l_x ≡ 1 mod 2.

So L_NN' and l_x must have opposite parity. One must be even, the other odd.

So, L_NN' and l_x must be such that their sum is odd.

Now, combining this with the earlier condition from Pauli's exclusion (T(NN) = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2.)

So S + L_NN' must be odd.

So, S and L_NN' must be of opposite parity.

Now, the final NN state has some spin S and orbital angular momentum L. To find the possible l_x, let's look at each option.

Each option gives the emitted particle's angular momentum state (l_x), and the final NN state's term symbol.

Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The options are given as initial state → final state + X.

Wait, no, the options are: for example, option A is 1S0 → 7D1 + p. So the initial state is 1S0, the final state is 7D1 (the NN state), and the emitted particle is p (which has l_x =1? Because p is l=1).

Wait, but wait, the initial state is 1S0, and the NN state after emission is 7D1. So the NN state has L = 2 (since D is l=2). So L_NN' is 2.

So, for the final NN state, L=2. So from our earlier condition, S + L must be odd. So S + 2 must be odd → S must be odd → S=1,3, etc. But since S is the total spin of two nucleons, which can be 0 or 1. Because two nucleons (each spin-1/2) can combine to S=0 or S=1.

So in this case, S is 1. Because 1 + 2 =3, which is odd.

So, the final NN state must have S=1 and L=2.

Now, let's check the other condition: the parity condition.

L_NN' is 2 (from D1), l_x is 1 (from p). So L_NN' + l_x = 2+1=3, which is odd. So 3 +1=4, which is even. So the parity would be (-1)^4=1, which matches the initial parity. So this is allowed. So option A is allowed.

Let's move to option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

So the final NN state is 3S1. So L=0 (S is l=0), S=1.

Again, S + L =1 +0=1 → odd, which satisfies the Pauli condition.

Now, parity condition: L_NN' is 0, l_x is 1 (p). So 0 +1=1 → 1+1=2, which is even. So parity is 1, which matches initial. So this is allowed. So option B is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 + f.

The final NN state is 3D3. So L=2 (D is l=2), S is 3? Wait, wait. S is the total spin, which for two nucleons can be 0 or 1. So 3D3 would imply S=3? That's impossible because two spin-1/2 particles can't have S=3. So this is a problem.

Wait, wait, the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So for the final state 3D3, 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is D → 2. So J would be 3, but S=1 and L=2. Then possible J values are 1+2=3, 1, or |1-2|=1. So J can be 3 or 1. So 3D3 is possible.

Wait, but the question is about the final NN state's spin S? Oh wait, no, the term symbol is 3D3, which is 2S+1=3 → S=1. So S is 1, L=2.

So, S + L =1+2=3 → odd, which satisfies T=0 condition.

Now, parity condition: L_NN' is 2, l_x from the emitted particle is f → l=3.

So L_NN' + l_x =2+3=5 → odd. So 5+1=6 → even. So parity is 1. So this is allowed.

But wait, the emitted particle is f, which has l=3. So the parity of X is (-1)^{3+1}= (-1)^4=1. But X's intrinsic parity is given as -1. So X's parity is 1 * (-1) = -1. So total parity is 1 (NN') * (-1) = -1. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the parity of the final state is (parity of NN') * (parity of X). Parity of X is (spatial parity) * intrinsic parity.

Parity of X is (-1)^{l_x} * intrinsic_parity. So for X, l_x is 3, so (-1)^3 = -1. Intrinsic parity is -1. So overall, X's parity is (-1)*(-1)= +1.

Wait no, the parity of X is [spatial part] * [intrinsic]. Spatial part is (-1)^l_x. Intrinsic is given as -1.

So X's parity is [(-1)^l_x]*(-1) = (-1)^{l_x +1}.

So for option C, l_x is 3, so parity of X is (-1)^4=1. Because 3 +1=4.

Wait, 3+1=4, so (-1)^4=1. So X's parity is 1*(-1) = -1? Wait no, wait. Wait, no, no. The parity of X is [(-1)^l_x] * (intrinsic parity). Intrinsic_parity is given as -1.

So, parity_X = (-1)^l_x * (-1).

So for l_x=3, parity_X is (-1)^3 * (-1) = (-1)*(-1) = 1.

So, the total parity of the final system is parity_NN' * parity_X.

parity_NN' is (-1)^L_NN' = (-1)^2=1.

parity_X is 1.

So, 1*1=1. Which matches the initial parity of 1. So this is allowed. So option C is allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought about the condition L_NN' + l_x +1 must be even.

In option C: L_NN'=2, l_x=3. So 2 +3+1 =6 → even. So yes, the parity condition is satisfied.

So, what about option D?

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s.

Final NN state is 3P0. So L=1 (P is l=1), S=0 (since 2S+1=1 → S=0).

So S + L =0 +1=1 → odd. So condition is satisfied.

Now, parity condition: L_NN' is 1. l_x is 0 (s is l=0).

So L_NN' + l_x =1 +0=1. 1 +1=2, which is even. So parity is 1. So that's allowed.

Wait, but let's check the parity of X.

X has l_x=0, so parity_X = (-1)^0 * (-1) = 1*(-1)= -1.

parity_NN' is (-1)^1 = -1.

Total parity: (-1)*(-1)=1. Which matches the initial parity. So this is allowed.

Wait, but wait. The emitted particle X in option D is s, which is l=0. So X's orbital part is l=0, so its parity is (-1)^0 * (-1)= -1.

So the parity of the final state is NN' (parity -1) * X (parity -1) → (-1)*(-1)=1. So yes, it's allowed.

Wait, but I thought that the condition was L_NN' + l_x +1 must be even. Let me recheck.

Yes, the condition was L_NN' + l_x +1 ≡0 mod 2.

So for D: 1 +0 +1=2 → even. So condition satisfied.

So all the options seem to satisfy both the Pauli condition and the parity condition. But this can't be right because the question says one of them is not permitted.

Wait perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, let's reevaluate each option, especially for the spin and angular momentum.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, so J_initial=0.

The final state must have J_final=0, which is the vector sum of the NN' state and the X particle.

Wait, but each option gives the final NN' state and the emitted X's angular momentum state. So perhaps we need to consider the angular momentum conservation more carefully.

Wait, but the initial state has J=0. So the total angular momentum after emission must be zero.

The total angular momentum J_final is the sum (vector) of the NN' state's angular momentum and the X's angular momentum.

Wait, but how are they arranged? Are they in a way that their angular momenta add up to zero?

Alternatively, perhaps the process is that the NN' state has J (from their spin and orbital angular momentum), and X has j (from its spin and orbital). But since X is a spin-0 particle (like a pion), its angular momentum comes only from its orbital part.

Wait, wait, the pion is a pseudoscalar meson, which has spin 0 and pseudoscalar (spin 0, intrinsic parity -1, orbital angular momentum contributes to parity).

Hmm, but maybe the emitted particle X is a spin-0 particle. So, its spin doesn't contribute to angular momentum.

So, for X, its angular momentum is entirely from its orbital part, l_x.

So, X's total angular momentum is l_x, because its spin is zero. So, j_X = l_x.

Similarly, the NN' state has its own angular momentum, which is J_NN' = \sqrt{(S + L)^2}? No, wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is vector sum of S and L. S is the spin (vector), L is the orbital angular momentum (vector). So J = S + L.

But in the term symbol, J is given. So for the NN' state, their J is given by the term symbol.

Wait, but in the options, the final NN state is given as, say, 7D1. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So 7D1 would be (2S+1)=7 → S=3, L=D→2, J=1.

But wait, how can J=1 when S=3 and L=2? Because J can be |S-L| to S+L in integer steps. S=3, L=2 → J can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So J=1 is allowed.

But earlier we thought that S can't be 3 for two nucleons. Because S for two nucleons (each spin-1/2) can be 0 or 1. So 2S+1 can be 1 or 3. So 7D1 would imply S=3, which is impossible for two nucleons. So that would make option A impossible.

Wait, yes! That's a mistake I made earlier. The term symbol for the NN' state in option A is 7D1. So 2S+1=7 → S=3. But two spin-1/2 particles can't have S=3. The maximum S is 1. So this is impossible. So option A is not allowed.

Ah, that's the mistake I made earlier. I didn't consider that the NN' state's spin must be 0 or 1. So any term symbol where S is 3 is impossible.

So let's reevaluate the options.

Option A: 7D1. 2S+1=7 → S=3. Impossible. So option A is invalid.

Option B: 3S1. 2S+1=3 → S=1. Possible.

Option C: 3D3. 2S+1=3 → S=1. Possible.

Option D: 3P0. 2S+1=3 → S=1. Possible.

So option A is forbidden because S=3 is impossible. So the correct answer is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option C's S was 3, but in option C, the term is 3D3. 2S+1=3 → S=1. So that's okay.

So the only option that has an impossible spin state is option A. So the partial wave that's not permitted is option A.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions and the options systematically:

### Key Conditions:
1. **Pauli Statistics**: For the final NN state with isospin \( T(NN) = 0 \), the condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \ (\text{mod} \, 2) \) must hold. This implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) must be odd.
2. **Parity Conservation**: The initial state has parity \( +1 \) (since \( L = 0 \) for \( 1S_0 \)). The final state's parity is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle \( X \). The parity of \( X \) is \( (-1)^{l_x + 1} \), where \( l_x \) is the orbital angular momentum of \( X \). Thus, \( L(NN') + l_x + 1 \) must be even.

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 1S_0 \to 7D_1 + p \)**
- The final NN state is \( 7D_1 \), which implies \( 2S + 1 = 7 \). This gives \( S = 3 \), which is impossible for two nucleons (spin-1/2 particles can only have \( S = 0 \) or \( S = 1 \)).
- **Conclusion**: This option is forbidden due to the impossible spin state \( S = 3 \).

#### **Option B: \( 1S_0 \to 3S_1 + p \)**
- The final NN state is \( 3S_1 \), which implies \( 2S + 1 = 3 \). This gives \( S = 1 \), which is valid.
- \( L(NN') = 0 \) (since \( S \) denotes orbital angular momentum \( l = 0 \)).
- \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \), which is odd, satisfying the Pauli condition.
- The emitted particle \( X \) has \( l_x = 1 \) (denoted by \( p \)).
- Parity condition: \( L(NN') + l_x + 1 = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even, satisfying parity conservation.
- **Conclusion**: This option is allowed.

#### **Option C: \( 1S_0 \to 3D_3 + f \)**
- The final NN state is \( 3D_3 \), which implies \( 2S + 1 = 3 \). This gives \( S = 1 \), which is valid.
- \( L(NN') = 2 \) (since \( D \) denotes orbital angular momentum \( l = 2 \)).
- \( S + L = 1 + 2 = 3 \), which is odd, satisfying the Pauli condition.
- The emitted particle \( X \) has \( l_x = 3 \) (denoted by \( f \)).
- Parity condition: \( L(NN') + l_x + 1 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6 \), which is even, satisfying parity conservation.
- **Conclusion**: This option is allowed.

#### **Option D: \( 1S_0 \to 3P_0 + s \)**
- The final NN state is \( 3P_0 \), which implies \( 2S + 1 = 3 \). This gives \( S = 1 \), which is valid.
- \( L(NN') = 1 \) (since \( P \) denotes orbital angular momentum \( l = 1 \)).
- \( S + L = 1 + 1 = 2 \), which is even. This violates the Pauli condition, which requires \( S + L \) to be odd.
- **Conclusion**: This option is forbidden.

### Final Answer:
The only option that violates the given conditions is **Option A**, as it involves an impossible spin state \( S = 3 \) for two nucleons.

**Answer: A**
