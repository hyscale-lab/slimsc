Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but let's think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that in quasars, emission lines are prominent, especially from things like the Lyman-alpha emission or other transitions. Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is in the ultraviolet, around 121 nm. But here the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared. That's way longer than Lyman-alpha. So maybe this is a rest frame emission line that's been redshifted.

Wait, but wait. The peak is observed at 790 nm. If it's a rest frame line, like say the Lyman-alpha, which is 121 nm, then the redshift would be z = (observed wavelength - emitted wavelength)/emitted. So z = (790 - 121)/121 ≈ 669/121 ≈ 5.528. So z ≈ 5.5. But wait, that's just if it's the Lyman-alpha line. Alternatively, maybe it's the Lyman break or some other feature. Or maybe it's another line, like H-alpha, which is about 656 nm in the rest frame. But wait, if the observed wavelength is 790, that's longer than 656, so the redshift would be (790-656)/656 ≈ 134/656 ≈ 0.204. So z≈0.2. But the peak being in the near infrared suggests it's a high-redshift object, so the first scenario where z is about 5.5 is more likely.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. If the observed peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, but the flux decreases at shorter wavelengths (bluer than 790 nm), that suggests that the peak is from a feature that's redshifted into the infrared. So, perhaps the quasar's rest frame optical emission is at a certain wavelength, but due to
