Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what each part is about. The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. In these reactions, a pi bond moves along with a sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, and they're usually thermodynamically favored, so they tend to go to their more stable products.

The problem has three separate reactions, A, B, and C, each with different starting materials and conditions. I need to determine the products for each and match them with the options given.

Starting with the first reaction: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine reacting with but-3-en-2-ol under H+ and heat to form A. Hmm, what's happening here? Both reactants have oxygen-containing groups. Let me think about their structures.

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be (CH3O)2CH-NH2, right? That's like a tertiary amine with two methoxy groups attached. But wait, the structure is ethan-1-amine, so the amine is on the first carbon, and the two methoxys are also on the same carbon. So it's N-methyldimethylamine? Or maybe N,N-dimethylethylamine? Wait, ethan-1-amine is CH3CH2NH2, but if both oxygens are on the same carbon as the amine, it's N,N-dimethylethanamine. So structure is CH2(NMe2)CH2OCH3? No, wait, wait. 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CH2NH2? Wait no, ethanamine has two carbons. So the structure would be CH2(NH2)CH2 with two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So it's CH2(OCH3)2NH2. So the molecule is (CH3O)2CHNH2.

But-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2, wait no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-
