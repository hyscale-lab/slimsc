Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, let's see. I remember that density is mass divided by volume, right? So the formula for density is ρ = m/V. 

The question is asking which exoplanet among the options has the highest density. There are four options: a, b, c, d. Let me read each one carefully.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth? Then its density is the same as Earth's. I think Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, but wait, let me make sure. Yeah, Earth's average density is about 5.5, so a would have that density.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, so if the density is already given as 5.5, then it's same as Earth's. But the mass is double. How does that affect the radius? Because density is m/V, so if mass is twice but density same, volume must be twice. Volume relates to radius cubed. Because volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if the volume doubles, the radius would be the cube root of 2, which is about 1.26 times Earth's radius. But wait, this option's density is already provided, so for this planet, the density is 5.5. So same as Earth's.

Option c: A planet with the same composition as Earth but 5 times more massive than Earth. Same composition means same density, right? Because density depends on the material it's made of. So if it's same as Earth, then density is 5.5 g/cm³. But wait, wait. Or does composition affect density? Hmm, same composition would mean same density. So this planet's density is 5.5 as well. But being more massive, what about the radius? Let's think, because mass is proportional to density times volume. So if density is same, mass is 5 times Earth's. So volume is 5 times Earth's. Volume goes as radius cubed, so radius would be cube root of 5, which is about 1.71 times that of Earth.

Option d: A planet with the same composition as Earth but half the mass of Earth. Again, same composition, so same density of 5.5. Mass is half, so volume is half. So radius would be cube root of 0.5
