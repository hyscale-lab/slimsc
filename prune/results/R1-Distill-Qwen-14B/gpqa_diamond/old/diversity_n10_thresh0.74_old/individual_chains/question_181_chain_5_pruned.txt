Alright, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun, and I need to figure out the flux ratio between two energy bands after a specific reaction stops. Hmm, okay, let me think through this.

The question says that the pp-III branch in the Sun's core suddenly stopped about 8.5 minutes ago. I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, like the proton-proton chain. The pp-III branch must be a part of that. Wait, the proton-proton chain has multiple branches, right? I think pp-I and pp-II are the main ones, but pp-III might be another part of the chain or a different process.

Wait, no, maybe I should be precise. The pp chain is the primary fusion process in the Sun. The main branch, pp-I, produces helium-4 through two proton collisions. Then, there's another branch, pp-II, where a helium-3 nucleus captures a proton to form carbon-12, which later decays. Oh wait, maybe pp-III is a different process altogether. Or perhaps it's another name for the same steps. I'm a bit confused here.

But the question specifies that only the pp-III branch stops. So, the other reactions continue normally. Okay, so I need to figure out what neutrinos are produced by the pp-III branch and how their flux would change if that branch stops.

Solar neutrinos are produced in several processes. The main ones are the proton-proton (pp) chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen (CNO) cycle. The pp chain produces neutrinos from the decay of b
