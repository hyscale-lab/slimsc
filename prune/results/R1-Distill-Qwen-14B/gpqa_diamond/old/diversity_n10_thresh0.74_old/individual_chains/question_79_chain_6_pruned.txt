Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by breaking down what's given and what I know.

The question is about identifying Compound X based on the reaction and the NMR data of the product. The reaction involves 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Hmm, wait, that sounds familiar. Oh right, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a common reagent used in the Sharpless epoxidation. Or wait, no, wait. Or maybe it's part of a different reaction. Wait, another thought: 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is actually a base, often used in the Hofmann elimination, but wait, I might be mixing things up. Alternatively, it's used as a catalyst in certain reactions. Wait, no, maybe I should think about what the reaction conditions imply.

Wait, another angle. Compound X is reacting with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane. Alternatively, perhaps it's an epoxidation reaction. Because epoxidation typically uses peracids, but wait, that's more for epoxidizing double bonds. Oh wait, Sharpless epoxidation uses a different setup—maybe a different reagent. Alternatively, could this be a ring-opening of an epoxide? Or perhaps it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, looking at the product's NMR data. Let's first analyze the product's structure based on the NMR data. The 1H and 13C NMR are given, so I can try to piece together the structure.

Looking at the 1H NMR first: 

- δ 2.28 (3H, s): A singlet, so probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split the signal. Maybe a carbonyl group or an aromatic ring.
- δ 2.31 (3H, s): Another singlet. So two methyl groups as singlets. Could they be adjacent to carbonyls or something else?
- Then, the aromatic signals: 
   - δ 6.75 (1H, d): A doublet, probably adjacent to another proton.
   - δ7.08 (2H, d): Two protons as a doublet. Could be part of a para-substituted aromatic group, perhaps.
   - δ7.68 (1H, d): Another doublet.
   - δ7.71 (2H, d): Two protons as doublet.

Wait, putting this together, perhaps there's a styryl group (a vinyl benzene) involved. Styryl groups have a benzene ring with a double bond attached. So for example, a structure like benzene-CH2-CH2, but actually, styryl is more like benzene-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond, like benzene-CH=CH2? No, more accurately, styryl would be a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring.

So, looking at the aromatic region, if I have two doublets and some other signals, maybe it's a para-substituted benzene. Alternatively, perhaps an ortho substitution.

Wait, but let's think about the coupling. The doublets suggest that each proton is coupled to one adjacent proton. So, maybe a para-substituted benzene, but with substituents leading to certain coupling patterns. Alternatively, it could be a meta-substituted group, but I'm not so sure.

Looking at the 13C NMR, the data includes:

- 21.3 (1C, s): A methyl group, maybe attached to something like an oxygen or a carbonyl.
- 28.4 (1C, s): Another methyl group, perhaps.
- Then, several signals in the 125-130 range, which are typical for sp² carbons, like aromatic carbons or double bonds.
- 141.5 and 144.1 (each 1C, s): These might be carbonyl carbons, but wait, 141 is a bit low for a carbonyl. Alternatively, they could be quaternary carbons, like those in an epoxide ring or perhaps carbons attached to oxygen (like in an ether or an ester).

Wait, the 13C NMR has a peak at 197.7, which is quite upfield for a carbonyl. Wait, no, 197 is more typical for a ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, no, wait: 197 ppm is a carbonyl, perhaps a ketone. Alternatively, an ester carbonyl is around 170. An aldehyde is around 190-205. Wait, 19
