Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll try to visualize the target molecule. The structure is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, that's a phenyl group attached to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The phenyl group has two substituents: a bromine at the 3 position and a nitro group at the 5 position. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring, so positions 3 and 5 are meta to each other. So the substituents are on carbons 3 and 5 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. When substituents are on a benzene ring attached to a ketone, the numbering is such that the ketone is at position 1. So, the ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. So the ketone is at position 1, then bromo at 3 and nitro at 5.

So the plan is to start with benzene and introduce the substituents in the correct positions.

Let me think about the substituents. We have a nitro group, a bromine, and a ketone group (from the ethanone). Wait, no, the ethanone is at position 1, so it's a phenyl group attached to a ketone group. So the main structure is a benzene ring with a ketone substituent, along with Br and NO2 groups.

Wait, no, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-. Wait, no, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO- attached to the benzene. So the benzene ring is attached to a ketone (COCH3), and on the benzene ring, there are substituents: Br at 3 and nitro at 5.

To make this, I'll need to perform various substitutions on benzene. Let's think about the order of reactions and
