Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and the compound undergoes a series of reactions with specific reagents. I need to figure out what the final product is from the options provided.

First, I should probably analyze the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. Let's look at the 1H-NMR:

- 9.72 ppm (t, 1H): A triplet around 9.7 ppm. That's a region where aldehydic protons usually show up. So maybe this is an aldehyde group.

- 6.98 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet around 6.98. This could be aromatic protons, maybe in a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton, so maybe two aromatic protons each with one neighbor.

- 6.51 ppm (d, 2H): Another doublet, lower downfield. Maybe another set of aromatic protons. If the first set was para-substituted, this could be another para-substituted group, but perhaps in a different environment.

- 6.27 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for two protons. Broad suggests maybe exchange with something, like an -OH group, but the integration is 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's part of a conjugated system, like a vinyl group adjacent to an oxygen, causing some hydrogen bonding or something.

- 3.66 ppm (d, 2H): A doublet at around 3.66. This seems like a methylene group (CH2) attached to something electronegative, perhaps an oxygen. The doublet suggests two neighboring protons, so maybe it's a -CH2- group adjacent to another CH2 or some other group.

Putting this together, maybe the structure is something like a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. Let's think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Breaking it down, that's 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, one nitrogen, and one oxygen.

Wait, the molecular formula could be interpreted as including a benzene ring (which is 6 carbons). So the remaining part would be 2 carbons. But wait, let's check: 8 carbons in total. So, 6 from benzene, leaving 2 more. Maybe a substituent with two carbons. Oh, but wait, let's think about the functional groups.

The aldehyde proton is at 9.72. So perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde with substituents. Let's see the NMR again. The aromatic protons: two doublets. That suggests maybe two para-substituted benzene rings. Like two phenyl groups attached to something.

Wait, but the molecular formula is C8H9NO. Benzene is C6H6
