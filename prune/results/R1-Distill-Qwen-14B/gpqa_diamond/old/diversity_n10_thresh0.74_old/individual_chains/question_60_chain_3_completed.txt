Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember that when you're moving at speeds close to the speed of light, time slows down from the perspective of someone not moving relative to you. That's the idea behind special relativity, right?

So the problem says that the aliens have a spacecraft going at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. Wow, that's almost the speed of light. The astronaut is 22 years old and wants to get to Earth. The question is, from the astronaut's point of view, how long will the trip take?

Wait, no, wait. The astronaut's perspective is important here. Because of time dilation, the astronaut's own clock will experience less time than the time measured by someone on Earth. Or wait, no—wait, it's the other way around. Let me think. If the spaceship is moving relative to Earth, from the astronaut's frame, Earth is moving really fast. So the distance to Earth would be contracted, right? Because in the astronaut's frame, the Earth is approaching at a high speed, so the distance is shorter.

Wait, no. Wait, let's get this straight. Time dilation affects how much time passes for the traveler versus the stationary observer. Also, the distance between stars (or here, the distance between the aliens' home and Earth) is measured differently in each frame.

The aliens' home is in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Oh, wait, but the problem says the average lifetime is about 150 solar years. So, the astronaut is 22, so he's got about 128 years left on Earth time? But wait, that's from Earth's perspective. But wait, the question is about the astronaut's perspective.

Wait, no. The question is asking how long the trip will take from the astronaut's point of view. So we need to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

So, first, I need to figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. I'm not sure of the exact distance, but I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, wait, let's think. No, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years from the Sun. Wait, but the problem says "their destination is Earth," but Earth is in the Milky Way, which is part of the LMC's vicinity. So if the distance is about 160,000 light-years, then at 0.99999987c, how long would it take?

Wait, but from the astronaut's perspective, the distance is length-contracted. Because in their frame, the Earth is approaching at 0.99999987c, so the distance is shorter.

Length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame), and L is the length in the moving frame (astronaut's frame).

So, first, calculate the proper distance from Earth's perspective. Let's say it's 160,000 light-years. The speed is 0.99999987c, which is very close to c. So v≈c.

Wait, let me compute the gamma factor here. Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, let's compute (v/c)². Let me calculate that. (0.99999987)^2 is approximately (1 - 1.3e-7), because 0.99999987 is 1 minus 1.3e-7 (since 1 - 0.99999987 = 0.00000013). So (v²/c²) is (1 - 2.6e-7) approximately? Wait, wait, let me square 0.99999987. Hmm, more accurately, (1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. So approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 2.6e-7. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5. Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, and 1e-3.5 is 1e-3.5 = 3.16e-4? Wait, 1e-3 is 0.001, 1e-4 is 0.0001. 3.5 is between, so 3.16e-4 is about 0.000316.

Wait, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is sqrt(2.6)*1e-3.5 = approx 1.612 * 3.16e-4 = approx 5.10e-4. So 5.10e-4.

Thus, gamma is 1/(5.10e-4) ≈ 1960. So gamma is about 1960. So from Earth's frame, the time taken is the distance divided by speed. So distance is 160,000 light-years, speed is 0.99999987c. So time is (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ (160,000 /0.99999987) years ≈ approx 160,000 years. Because 1 ly at nearly c takes about 1 year. So 160,000 ly would take 160,000 years in Earth's frame.

But from the astronaut's perspective, due to time dilation, the time experienced would be Earth time divided by gamma. So the proper time tau is t / gamma. So tau = (160000 years) / 1960 ≈ approx 81.6 years. So about 81 years.

Wait, but wait, no. No, wait, the astronaut's own experienced time (proper time) is less than the Earth time. Because the Earth time is longer. So, if Earth time is 160,000 years, and gamma is 1960, then tau = 160,000 /1960 ≈ 81.6 years. So the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years on the trip.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 now. So 22 + 81.6 is 103.6, which is less than 150 (average lifetime). So the astronaut would live to reach Earth.

But wait, wait, the question says the average lifetime is about 150 solar years. So if the trip takes 81 years for the astronaut, and the astronaut is 22, they would be 103 when they arrive, which is within their lifetime.

But looking at the options, option D is 77, option C is 81, option B is 72, option A says he'll die before reaching. So option C is 81 years. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I compute the gamma correctly? Because 0.99999987c is extremely close to c. Let me think about v = 0.99999987c.

Compute beta = v/c = 0.99999987.

1 - beta = 1.3e-7.

Beta squared is (0.99999987)^2 = approx 0.99999974.

So 1 - beta^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

sqrt(1 - beta^2) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 5.1e-4.

Gamma is 1/(5.1e-4) ≈ 1960, as before.

So distance in Earth's frame is about 160,000 ly. So time in Earth's frame is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 years.

Wait, but that's if the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c relative to Earth. So, in Earth's frame, the time to travel 160,000 ly at 0.99999987c is t = d / v = (160,000 ly) / (0.99999987c) ≈ 160,000 years.

But the astronaut's experienced time is t' = t / gamma = 160,000 / 1960 ≈ 81.6 years. So about 81 years.

Looking at the options, option C is 81 years.

But wait, the problem statement says the average lifetime is 150 years. So starting at 22, the astronaut would be 22 +81=103, which is well within 150. So the astronaut would reach Earth alive. Hence, option A is wrong.

So the correct answer must be option C: 81 years.


To determine how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective, we must account for time dilation and length contraction due to the spacecraft's speed being extremely close to the speed of light (\(v = 0.99999987c\)).

### Key Concepts:
1. **Time Dilation**: The proper time (\(\tau\)) experienced by the astronaut is related to the time (\(t\)) measured in Earth's frame by the Lorentz factor (\(\gamma\)):  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma}, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
   \]
2. **Length Contraction**: From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted. The contracted distance (\(L\)) is given by:  
   \[
   L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}},
   \]
   where \(L_0\) is the proper distance in Earth's frame.

### Calculations:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Thus, \(L_0 = 160,000 \, \text{ly}\).

2. **Lorentz Factor (\(\gamma\))**:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}.
   \]
   Since \(v = 0.99999987c\),  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974, \quad \text{so } 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 2.6 \times 10^{-7}.
   \]
   \[
   \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.1 \times 10^{-4}.
   \]
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{5.1 \times 10^{-4}} \approx 1960.
   \]

3. **Time in Earth's Frame (\(t\))**:  
   From Earth's perspective, the time to travel 160,000 light-years at \(v = 0.99999987c\) is:  
   \[
   t = \frac{L_0}{v} \approx \frac{160,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}.
   \]

4. **Proper Time (\(\tau\))**:  
   From the astronaut's perspective, the time experienced is:  
   \[
   \tau = \frac{t}{\gamma} = \frac{160,000}{1960} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years during the trip. Since the astronaut is 22 years old, they will be 103 years old upon arrival, well within their average lifetime of 150 years. Therefore, the astronaut will survive the journey.

**Correct Answer**: C) 81 years.
