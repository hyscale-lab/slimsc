Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), and I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

Wait, I remember that expectation value is calculated using the formula <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ, where σ_y is the Pauli matrix for the y-component. Oh right, σ_y is given as a matrix with 0 on the diagonal and -i and i off-diagonal. Let me write that matrix down.

So σ_y is:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

The spin state is given as (3i, 4). I think this is a column vector, so it's ψ = [3i; 4]. But wait, when calculating the expectation value, I need to take the conjugate transpose of ψ, right? So ψ† would be [ -3i, 4 ] because taking the conjugate changes 3i to -3i.

So the expectation value is ψ† multiplied by σ_y multiplied by ψ. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll compute σ_y multiplied by ψ. Let's do that matrix multiplication.

σ_y * ψ = [ [0, -i] [3i]   , [i, 0] [4] ] ?

Wait, no, I think each row of σ_y multiplies the column vector ψ. So:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-i)(4) = -4i.
Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ is a column vector [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ]. So I multiply this row vector by the result from the previous step.

So ψ† (σ_y ψ) is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

Let me compute each component:

-3i * (-4i) = (-3)(-4) * i * i = 12 * i^2. Since i^2 is -1, this becomes 12*(-1) = -12.

4 * (-3) = -12.

Now sum these two terms: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, expectation value should have units of ħ/2 or something like that. Because spin-½ particles have S^2 = (ħ/2)^2 * 3 (like for total spin), but each component has eigenvalues ± ħ/2.

Wait, but the expectation value calculation I did gives me a number without ħ, which doesn't make sense because the options have factors of ħ. Hmm, did I forget to consider the ħ somewhere?

Wait no, because the Pauli matrices are usually multiplied by ħ/2. Oh wait! Oh right! The spin operator S is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So σ_y is part of the operator S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. So when calculating expectation value, it's (ħ/2) times the result I computed.

Wait, didn't I just compute ψ† σ_y ψ, which is the expectation of σ_y, but S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the correct expectation value is (ħ/2) multiplied by the value I got.

Wait, so let me go back. In my calculation, I found ψ† σ_y ψ = -24. So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -12 hbar/25. Hmm, that's not matching. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation steps. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the initial state is ψ = [3i; 4]. Let me compute σ_y ψ again.

σ_y is [[0, -i],[i, 0]]. So:

First component: 0 * 3i + (-i) * 4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i * 3i + 0 *4 = 3i^2 + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i; -3 ].

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† (σ_y ψ) is:

(-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3) 

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i)(-4i) = (12) i^2 = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term:
