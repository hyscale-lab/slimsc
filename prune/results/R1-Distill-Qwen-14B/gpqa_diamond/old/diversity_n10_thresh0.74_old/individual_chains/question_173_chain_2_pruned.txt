Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle, right? I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question is about an electron moving at a certain speed, and we're given the uncertainty in its position, and we need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy. Hmm.

Wait, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle! Yeah, that's what it's about. The principle states that there's a limit to how precisely we can know both the position and momentum of a particle simultaneously. The formula I remember is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes the inequality is approximated as ΔxΔp ≈ ħ/2, but for the purpose of finding the minimum uncertainty, maybe we can use the equality part.

So, the electron is moving along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in position Δx is 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters or 1e-10 meters. Oh wait, no, 0.1 nm is 1e-10 m? Wait, no, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters. Right.

Our goal is to find the minimum uncertainty in energy, ΔE. But how do I relate position uncertainty to energy? Well, I think I need to find the uncertainty in momentum first, because energy of a particle is related to its momentum.

The uncertainty in momentum Δp can be found using the uncertainty principle. So, Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. Rearranging that, Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). 

Once I have Δp, I can relate it to the uncertainty in energy. The kinetic energy of a particle is given by E =
