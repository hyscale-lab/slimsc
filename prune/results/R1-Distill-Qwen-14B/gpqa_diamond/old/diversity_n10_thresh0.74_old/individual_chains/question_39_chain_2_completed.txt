Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Alright, the problem says we have ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving along a tube, which is the x-axis. The wave function is given, and when they measure the position, the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. I need to find the value of 'a' from the options provided.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i. Oh wait, but the wave function in quantum mechanics usually is a complex function, right? The real and imaginary parts. But when we talk about probabilities, we take the square of the absolute value, which is the sum of the squares of the real and imaginary parts.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. But wait, in reality, the wave function should satisfy the normalization condition, meaning the integral of |ψ|^2 dx over all space equals 1. Because probabilities must add up to 1.

But wait, the problem states that when measuring, particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function must be zero outside this interval. Oh, but in the given wave function, it's expressed as a function that might not necessarily be zero outside. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the wave function is only non-zero between x=1 and x=3, so elsewhere it's zero. But the given equation doesn't have a factor that makes it zero outside. Or perhaps the given function is only valid in that region, and zero otherwise. Oh, maybe the wave function is given in the region where it exists (x between 1 and 3), and zero otherwise.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "the wave function... can be described as..." So perhaps the wave function is non-zero only between x=1 and x=3, and the given expression is valid in that interval. So outside that region, ψ(x) is zero.

So to normalize the wave function, the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|^2 dx should be equal to 1.

Calculating |ψ(x)|²: [a / sqrt(1+x) - 0.5i]^2? Wait, no, because when you take the absolute square of a complex number, it's (real part)^2 + (imaginary part)^2. So ψ(x) = [a / sqrt(1+x)] + (-0.5i), so real part is a/(sqrt(1+x)), imaginary part is -0.5. So |ψ(x)|^2 = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (0.5)^2.

Wait, no, because when you have a complex number z = a + ib, where a and b are real numbers, then |z|^2 = a² + b². So in our case, ψ(x) = real_part + i * imaginary_part. Wait, the given function is (a / sqrt(1 + x)) minus 0.5i, which is real_part = a/sqrt(1+x), imaginary_part = -0.5. So |ψ|^2 = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [ (a²)/(1+x) + (0.25) ] dx should equal 1.

So let's compute this integral.

Let me split it into two parts: Integral of a²/(1+x) dx from 1 to 3, plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to 3.

Compute the first integral: a² ∫ dx/(1+x) from 1 to 3.

The integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|. So evaluating from 1 to 3: ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) )= ln(2). So the first integral is a² * ln(2).

The second integral: 0.25 ∫ dx from 1 to 3 is 0.25*(3-1) = 0.25*2 = 0.5.

So the total integral is a² ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So solving for a²:

a² = (1 - 0.5) / ln(2) = 0.5 / ln(2).

Calculate ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213. Then a is the square root of that.

Wait, let's compute sqrt(0.7213). Hmm, since 0.85 squared is 0.7225, which is very close to 0.7213. So a ≈ 0.85.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85. So the answer should be B.


To determine the value of \( a \), we start by normalizing the wave function. The wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the normalization condition requires that:

\[
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

Since the wave function is non-zero only between \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \), the integral simplifies to:

\[
\int_1^3 |\psi(x)|^2 dx = 1.
\]

The absolute square of the wave function is:

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (-0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

Thus, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
\int_1^3 \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

This integral can be split into two parts:

1. \( a^2 \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \),
2. \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \).

For the first integral, \( \int_1^3 \frac{1}{1+x} dx \), the antiderivative of \( \frac{1}{1+x} \) is \( \ln|1+x| \). Evaluating this from 1 to 3 gives:

\[
\ln(4) - \ln(2) = \ln(2).
\]

Thus, the first integral becomes \( a^2 \ln(2) \).

For the second integral, \( 0.25 \int_1^3 dx \), the result is:

\[
0.25 \times (3-1) = 0.5.
\]

Combining these results, the normalization condition becomes:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Solving for \( a^2 \):

\[
a^2 = \frac{1 - 0.5}{\ln(2)} = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \), we find:

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.85.
\]

Thus, the value of \( a \) is approximately 0.85, which corresponds to option B.

**Answer: B**
