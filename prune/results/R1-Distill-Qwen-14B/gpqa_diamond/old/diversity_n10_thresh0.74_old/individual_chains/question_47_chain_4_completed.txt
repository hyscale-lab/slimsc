Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, looking at the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are in the range for N-H or O-H stretches. But wait, in the options, some have amides, others have esters or formamides. An amide would have a broad N-H stretch around those regions. Alternatively, O-H would be a broad band too, but I don't see one here. Wait, no, the IR shows two bands in that area. Maybe they're from an amide. Because aliphatic amines usually have a single N-H stretch, but if it's an aromatic amine, maybe? Or maybe it's an amide where there are two sets of N-H (like in a secondary amide), but wait, the intensity is medium to strong. Alternatively, maybe it's an O-H stretch, but if it's an alcohol or a phenol, but then the other data might fit better.

Wait, the 1720 cm-1 is a strong band. That's a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group. Now, looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. That would have a carbonyl (amide) and an ethoxy group.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Again, formamide, so carbonyl.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. That would have an amine group and an ester (since propionate is an ester). So the ester carbonyl would be around 1720 cm-1.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Another ester, so same as C in terms of carbonyl.

So the IR data: 3420 and 3325 are likely N-H stretches from an amide or an amine. Let me think about each option.

In the 1H NMR, let's look at the data. The peaks are at 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) – that's a triplet, likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) – broad singlet, 2H. Maybe an OCH2 group, like an ethoxy that's next to an oxygen, but why is it a singlet? Or perhaps it's an NH2 group, but then it would be a broad peak, but it's 2H, so maybe it's an ethyl group attached to something else.

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) – quartet, 2H. A quartet suggests coupling with two neighboring groups. So maybe this is a CH2 next to an oxygen, like an OCH2CH2 group. Wait, but quartet of 2H could be adjacent to a CH2 group. Maybe an ethyl ester group, like OCH2CH3. But the ethyl group is usually split into a quartet when next to a CH3. Wait, but in the question, the 1.20 ppm is a triplet (3H), which is a CH3 at the end of a CH2CH3. So that would fit with an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That might be an NH2 group, but in that case, it's a broad peak, but if it's an amide, the N-H would be a broad peak. Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet, perhaps it's a CH2 group connected to oxygen. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the 4.5 ppm is an OCH2 group, which is split into a quartet because it's next to another CH2. So if you have OCH2CH2something, but then the 4.0 ppm would be a CH2 attached to something else.

Let me think about each option's structure and their NMR.

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: the benzoate would mean a benzene ring with a COOEt group (ethyl ester) and an NH2 group at the para position.

So, the benzoate ester would have OCH2CH3. In the NMR, the ethyl group would be triplet at 1.2 ppm (the CH3), and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.2-4.3 ppm. But in the given data, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm. Hmm. Also, the NH2 group would be a broad peak. But in the given data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Wait, but an NH2 would be a broad singlet but maybe integrating to 2H? Or wait, the NH2 in amines can sometimes appear as a broad peak, but in D, the amine is a primary amine, which would typically show up as a broad peak, perhaps around 2-5 ppm, but in D, maybe it's exchanged and not showing up, but in the NMR data, do we see it?

Wait, looking at the NMR data: the 4.0 ppm is 2H, broad singlet. Maybe that's the ethyl group attached to something else. Wait, the 4.5 ppm is a quartet of 2H. So perhaps OCH2.

Wait, maybe it's an ethyl ester group. So, for option D, the structure is benzene with COOCH2CH3 and NH2. So the ethyl ester would have a triplet at 1.2 (CH3), quartet at 4.3 (OCH2CH3), and the OCH2 would be as a quartet.

Wait, but in the given data, quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which is a bit higher than usual for an OCH2 in an ester. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide.

Let me look at another option. Option B is N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure: benzene ring with OCH2CH3 at para position, and a formamide group (HCONH-). So the formamide would have a CONH2 group.

The formamide's OCH2 would be part of the ethoxy group. So in the NMR, the ethoxy would have triplet at 1.2 (CH3), and the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm. Also, the formamide would have an NH2 group, which would give a broad peak. But looking at the data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Wait, maybe that's the NH2, but NH2 in formamide is a secondary amide. So the NH2 would be a singlet, but perhaps split into a doublet or something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the OCH2 of the ethoxy group. But then why is it a singlet? Wait, ethoxy groups are usually split into quartets because the OCH2 is next to CH3. So perhaps that's not it.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Structure is benzene with NH2 at para and a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-) attached. Wait, no, propionate would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the benzene. So the ester would have an OCH2CH2CH3 group? No, wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO- attached to something else. Wait, no, the structure would be benzene-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 and NH2 in para. Wait, no, actually, 4-aminophenyl propionate would be OCOCH2CH2CH2 attached to the benzene, with an NH2 group. So the propionate would have a propyl ester group.

In the NMR, the ethyl groups would come from where? Oh wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the ester would have a CH2CH2COO group. So for the propyl group, we'd expect a triplet at around 1.6 ppm (the CH2 next to the COO), and a quartet for the CH2 next to that, maybe around 4.0 ppm? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ester is attached differently.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, there's a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), so that must be a CH3 group attached to a CH2, like an ethyl group. So if the ester is ethyl, that would fit. But option C is propionate, which is a propyl ester, so maybe that's not it. Wait, maybe C is ethyl propionate, but no, the name is 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be a propyl group as the ester. So maybe this is not matching the NMR data because the ethyl group is prominent in the data.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide (so benzene with CONH2) and an ethoxy group at the meta position.

In the NMR, the ethoxy group would be OCH2CH3. So the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and the quartet around 4.0-4.3 ppm (OCH2). Then the benzamide has NH2 as a broad peak.

Looking at the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H. Wait, but OCH2 should be a quartet, not a singlet. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH2 group, but in that case, it would integrate to 2H, but NH2 in an amide is usually a singlet, perhaps broad.

Wait, the NMR data:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → maybe the OCH2? But why is it a singlet? Usually, OCH2 would split into a quartet because it's adjacent to CH3.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 is the NH2 group. But in that case, why is it a singlet? Because NH2 protons are usually broad and might not show up as a singlet. Or perhaps it's another group.

Looking back at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl. That would be amide (amide I band) or ester or formamide.

If it's an amide, the carbonyl is around 1680-1700, but this is 1720, which is higher. Wait, but wait, depends on the substitution. An ester's carbonyl is around 1720-1750, so perhaps the compound is an ester.

So in the options, options C and D are esters, as they have the propionate and benzoate esters, respectively.

So let's think again about the NMR.

Looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure: benzene ring with COOCH2CH3 and NH2 groups at para positions.

The ethyl group (CH2CH3) would give a triplet at around 1.2 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at around 4.3 ppm (OCH2). Also, the NH2 group would show up as a broad peak, maybe around 2-5 ppm, integrating to 2H.

In the given data, the triplet is at 1.20, which matches the ethyl CH3. The quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher than the usual 4.3 for OCH2. Hmm, but perhaps it's within the range because of the electronegative groups.

The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. Could this be the NH2 group? Maybe, but NH2 protons are usually broad and might not appear as a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2 group, but why is it a singlet?

Wait, maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is the OCH2. So in D, OCH2 would be quartet at 4.5, and the ethyl CH3 is triplet at 1.20. The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That would fit the NH2 group. So maybe the amine's protons are at 4.0 ppm as a broad singlet.

But wait, I thought the NH2 in aminobenzoate would be more downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's deprotonated, but that's unlikely in the NMR conditions.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group, but why is it a singlet? That doesn't make much sense.

Another approach: looking at the aromatic protons in the NMR. The peaks are at 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene, as you get two doublets each integrating to 2H, which is typical for para substituents. So the substituents are in the para positions.

So for the options:

Option D: 4-aminobenzoate ethyl ester. So the benzene has COOEt and NH2 in para. So the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each 2H, which matches the NMR.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. The benzene would have an ester (O-CO-CH2CH2CH3) and NH2 in para. So the aromatic protons would be similar, two doublets.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The benzene has OCH2CH3 and formamide (CONH2) in para positions. So aromatic protons as two doublets.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide (CONH2) and OCH2CH3 in meta positions. So aromatic protons would be more complex, perhaps a triplet or something else, not two doublets. So probably not A because the NMR shows two doublets, suggesting para substitution.

So that narrows it down to options B, C, D.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR again. The 4.5 ppm quartet for 2H. If it's an OCH2 group, then what else is connected to it? For D, it's the ester OCH2. So the quartet would be the OCH2 in the ester. The triplet at 1.20 is the CH3 of the ethyl group. That fits.

The 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet for 2H. That could be the NH2 group. But in D, the NH2 is a primary amine, which usually appears as a broad peak, maybe around 1-5 ppm. But in D, the amine is para to the ester, so perhaps it's exchanging quickly and shows as a broad peak. The integration is 2H, which makes sense for NH2.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 4.0 ppm is 2H as a broad singlet. If it's NH2, then why is it a singlet? Because it's exchanging rapidly and can't be split. Alternatively, perhaps it's another group.

Wait, another angle. Let's look at the options that have an ethyl group. So options A, B, D have ethyl groups, while C has a propyl group (but the NMR shows a triplet for 3H, so it must be an ethyl group).

Wait, option C is propionate, so the ester would have a propyl group (CH2CH2CH3). So the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2 next to the COO, but the given data has a triplet at 1.20, which is a CH3. So perhaps option C is not the correct one because it's a propyl group, which would have a triplet further upfield.

Wait, no, propyl ester would have a CH2CH2CH3, so the end CH3 would be a triplet at around 1.2 ppm. Then the next CH2 would be a quartet around 1.6 ppm, and the one next to the ester oxygen would be a triplet around 4.0 ppm. But in the data, we only see a triplet at 1.20 ppm, and a quartet at 4.5 ppm. So maybe that's not matching, so option C is out.

So now, possible options are B and D.

Looking at option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Structure is benzene with OCH2CH3 and formamide (CONH2) in para. So the ethoxy group would give triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet around 4.0-4.3 (OCH2). Then the formamide has NH2, which would be a broad peak.

So in the NMR, the ethoxy would have triplet at 1.20, quartet at 4.0-4.3. The formamide's NH2 would be a broad peak. But looking at the data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet of 2H. So that could fit the NH2. The 4.5 is a quartet of 2H, which would be the OCH2 of ethoxy.

Wait, but in option B, the formamide's NH would be part of a CONH2 group, so the NH2 would be a singlet, broad, perhaps around 4.0 ppm.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.5 ppm quartet is the OCH2, and the 4.0 is the NH2.

Now, looking at the IR data. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is the carbonyl. For formamide, the carbonyl is around 1680-1700, but maybe it's higher because it's an aromatic formamide or other substitution. Alternatively, an ester would have a higher carbonyl.

Wait, but option D's ester would have a carbonyl around 1720, which matches the IR. So the 1720 suggests an ester.

So, if D is an ester with a carbonyl at 1720, and the NMR shows the ethyl ester groups, that would fit. So let's think about D again.

In D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the ester group is OCOOCH2CH3.

So, the ethyl group would have triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (OCH2). Then the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0, which matches the data.

The 4.0 ppm would be the NH2 group, which is a broad singlet. But wait, in practice, NH2 protons are broad and may not be very visible. But in the given data, the 4.0 is a broad singlet for 2H, which would fit the NH2.

The IR shows medium to strong intensity at 3420 and 3325, which would be the N-H stretches of the amine. The strong band at 1720 is the ester carbonyl.

So, putting this together, D would have the ester and amine groups as described.

Looking at the other options, option B is a formamide, which would have a lower carbonyl stretch, perhaps around 1680. But the IR shows 1720, which is more in line with an ester.

So, the correct option is D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.


The compound C9H11NO2 is identified based on the provided spectral data:

### IR Analysis:
- **3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹**: These are medium to strong intensity bands, likely corresponding to N-H stretches, suggesting the presence of an amine or amide group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: A strong band indicating a carbonyl group, likely from an ester or amide.

### 1H NMR Analysis:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: A triplet integrating to 3H, characteristic of a CH3 group in an ethyl group (CH2CH3).
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: A broad singlet integrating to 2H, likely corresponding to an NH2 group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: A quartet integrating to 2H, characteristic of an OCH2 group in an ethyl ester.
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicating a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - Contains a benzamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) in the meta position.  
   - The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (as seen in the NMR), making this option unlikely.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - Contains a formamide group (CONH2) and an ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) in the para position.  
   - The ethoxy group would produce a quartet at ~4.2 ppm and a triplet at ~1.2 ppm, which matches the NMR data. However, the carbonyl stretch for a formamide is typically weaker (~1680-1700 cm⁻¹), whereas the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, more consistent with an ester. This makes B less likely.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - Contains an amino group (NH2) and a propionate ester (CH2CH2COO-) in the para position.  
   - The NMR data shows a triplet at 1.20 ppm, which matches the CH3 of an ethyl group. However, a propionate ester would have additional peaks for the CH2 groups, which are not observed in the given data. This makes C unlikely.

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - Contains an ethyl ester (COOCH2CH3) and an amino group (NH2) in the para position.  
   - The ethyl ester produces a triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH3) and a quartet at 4.5 ppm (OCH2), matching the NMR data.  
   - The aromatic protons produce two doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, consistent with a para-substituted benzene.  
   - The IR band at 1720 cm⁻¹ matches the carbonyl stretch of an ester, and the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm corresponds to the NH2 group.  
   - This option fits all the spectral data.

### Conclusion:
The compound is identified as **ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** based on the IR, NMR, and molecular formula.
