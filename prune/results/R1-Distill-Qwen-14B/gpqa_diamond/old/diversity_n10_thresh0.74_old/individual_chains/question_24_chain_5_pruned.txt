Okay, let's try to figure this out. Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. So, the problem revolves around some chemical reactions and mixtures. Let's read it again.

We have an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. So, those liquids must have some unsaturated bonds because bromine water decolorizes when it reacts with alkenes or alkynes. Then, when X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y, which is a result of a disproportionation. Disproportionation means a reaction where an element in a compound is both oxidized and reduced. But the key here is that Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, so the products don't have double or triple bonds anymore. Or maybe they have different structures that don't react with bromine.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y with platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen 14.28% and is a constituent of Y, widely used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's probably a saturated compound. 

Wait, so Z is a product of hydrogenating both X and Y. Since Y is formed from X via a reaction, perhaps Y has some double bonds that are more reactive or in a structure that allows for hydrogenation to stop at Z.

The question is about the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X.

Let me try to break it down. 

First, mixture X decolorizes bromine, so X must have at least one component with a double or triple bond. Since it's an equimolar mixture, let's say it's two different compounds in a 1:1 ratio.

Then, when X is heated with platinum, which is a catalyst, a disproportionation reaction occurs. So, one component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction. Let's think about possible candidates. Maybe ethylene and another alkyne or something else?

Wait, but wait, the mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components don't have any double or triple bonds that can react with bromine. So Y's structure is fully saturated.

Hydrogenation of X and Y gives only Z. So when X is hydrogenated, it probably breaks down into Z. Similarly, Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z. So Z must be a product that doesn't change further with hydrogenation, which suggests it's a fully saturated alkane.

Let me think about the hydrogenation. For example, if X has an alkyne, which upon hydrogenation would become an alkane. But wait, if X is a mixture, perhaps one is an alkene and the other an alkyne? Or maybe both are alkenes, but different ones.

Wait, but Y is formed by the disproportionation of X. So perhaps the reaction is something like 2 A â†’ B + C, where A, B, C are alkanes, alkenes, etc. But wait, no, because Y is a mixture of two liquids formed from X, which is a mixture of two liquids.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the possible structure of Z. The mass fraction of hydrogen
