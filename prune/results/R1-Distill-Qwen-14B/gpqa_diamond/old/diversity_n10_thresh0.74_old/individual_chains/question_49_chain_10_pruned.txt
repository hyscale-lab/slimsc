Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question has three parts: reactions leading to products A, B, and C, and I need to match them with the options provided. Let's take each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:
1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and heat â†’ A

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. So that structure would be CH3-C(OCH3)2-NH2? Or wait, maybe it's (CH3O)2CHCH2NH2? Wait, no. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is more likely to be OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure would be CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or perhaps it's (OCH2CH3)2NCH2? No, wait, no, the formula is probably (CH3O)2CHNH2. So ethanamine with two methoxy groups on the same carbon.

But wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2CH2-OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is (CH2)2CHOHCH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, but-3-en-2-ol would have a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, but but-3-en-2-ol is impossible because but has four carbons. So positions are 1,2,3,4. So but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Or is it CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, no, the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, but but has only four carbons, so but-3-en would be impossible. Oh wait, no, but-3-en would be between C2 and C3. So but-3-en-2-
