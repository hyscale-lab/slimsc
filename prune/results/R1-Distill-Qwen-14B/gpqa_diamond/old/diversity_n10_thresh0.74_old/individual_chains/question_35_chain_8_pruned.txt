Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, and it's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y and determine which of the statements A to D is correct.

Hmm, okay. So first, I should figure out what matrix A_y looks like. Let's compute it.

The constant c is h/(4π). So A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. The matrix S is:

[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So multiplying each element by c:

A_y = [ [ (h/(4π))*0 , (h/(4π))*(-i) ],
         [ (h/(4π))*i , (h/(4π))*0 ] ]

Which simplifies to:

[ 0      (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)     0   ]

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I got that right. Because the multiplication applies to each element. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, the eigenvalues of A_y can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(A_y - λ I) = 0.

So, let me set up the matrix (A_y - λ I):

[ -λ       (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -λ    ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-λ)(-λ) - [ (i h)/(4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ). Let me compute each part.

Determinant = λ² - [ (i h /4π) * (-i h)/(4π) ) ].

Wait, let me compute the product inside: (i h /4π) * (-i h /4π) equals (i * -i) * (h^2)/( (4π)^2 ) )

i * (-i) = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is (h^2)/( (4π)^2 ) * 1.

So the determinant is λ² - (h²)/( (4π)^2 ) = 0.

So λ² = (h^2)/( (4π)^2 )

Taking square roots, λ = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Because I'm solving for the eigenvalues, which are λ. So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4π) and -h/(4π). Wait, but wait again. Because A_y is a 2x2 matrix, which for spin-1/2 particles, the Y-component angular momentum should have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Wait, because I thought that for spin-1/2 particles, the spin matrices are S_x, S_y, S_z, which have eigenvalues ± ħ
