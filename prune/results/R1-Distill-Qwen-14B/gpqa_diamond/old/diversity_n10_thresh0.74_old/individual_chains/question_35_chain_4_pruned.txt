Okay, so I've got this question about angular momentum operators, specifically the Y-component, Ay. Hmm, I remember that angular momentum in quantum mechanics is often represented by matrices. The question says Ay is equal to c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, and S is given as a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. 

So, the task is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. The question also gives four options, A to D, and I need to determine which statement is correct during the calculation. 

Let me think about how to approach this. First, I should probably construct the matrix Ay. Since Ay = c*S, and c is h/(4π), the matrix Ay would be (h/(4π)) multiplied by S. So let me write out Ay.

S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

Multiply each element by c: 
Ay = [ (h/(4π))*0   (h/(4π))*(-i) ]
      [ (h/(4π))*i   (h/(4π))*0 ]

So Ay simplifies to:
[ 0          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)  0          ]

Wait, but I'm trying to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Ay. So the eigenvalue equation is Ay φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue.

I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0. Let's write that out.

The matrix (Ay - a I) would be:
[ -a          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)   -a        ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ].

So determinant = a² - [ ( (-i)(i) ) (h²)/(16 π²) ) ].

Hmm, (-i)(i) is equal to -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (h²)/(16 π²) * 1.

So the determinant equation is a² - (h²)/(
