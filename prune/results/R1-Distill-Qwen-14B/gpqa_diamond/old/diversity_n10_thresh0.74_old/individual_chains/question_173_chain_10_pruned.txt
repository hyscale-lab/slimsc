Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. The question is about finding the minimum uncertainty in the energy (ΔE) of an electron given the uncertainty in its position (Δx). 

Wait, the electron is moving along the x-direction at speed v = 2e8 m/s. The uncertainty in position is Δx = 0.1 nm, which is 0.1e-9 meters. Right, I think the formula I need is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant. But wait, ħ is h/(2π), and I remember h is about 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ would be around 1.05e-34 J·s.

So, first, I should calculate the minimum uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Using Δx * Δp ≈ ħ/2. So Δp ≈ ħ/(2Δx). Let me plug in the numbers.

Δx is 0.1e-9 m. So 2Δx is 0.2e-9 m. ħ is approximately 1.05e-34 J·s. So Δp ≈ (1.05e-34) / (0.2e-9) = (1.05 / 0.2) * 1e-25. Wait, 1.05 divided by 0.2 is 5.25. So 5.25e-25 kg·m/s. That's the uncertainty in momentum.

Now, the uncertainty in momentum is related to the uncertainty in energy. But wait, energy is related to momentum via the kinetic energy formula. For non-relativistic speeds, which I think applies here because v is 2e8 m/s, which is about 66% the speed of light (since speed of light is ~3e8 m/s). Hmm, wait, 2e8 is 2/3 of 3e8, so relativistic effects might be significant. Oh wait, but for an electron, maybe it's still treated non-relativistically in some contexts. Hmm, but wait, the kinetic energy is given by (p²)/(2m). So if I have Δp, then the uncertainty in kinetic energy ΔK would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

Alternatively, another approach: the uncertainty in energy is the uncertainty in kinetic energy if we assume the electron's potential energy is not varying much. So let's proceed with that.

So, m (mass of electron) is 9.11e-31 kg. So substituting, ΔK ≈ ( (5.25e-25)^2 ) / (2 * 9.11e-31) ). Let me calculate the numerator first: (5.25e-25)^2 = (5.25)^2 = 27.56, so 27.56e-50.

Denominator: 2 *9.11e-31 = 18.22e-31.

So ΔK ≈ 27.56e-50 / 18.22e-31 = (27.56 / 18.22) * 1e-19. Let me compute 27.56 divided by 18.22. Approximately 1.512. So 1.5
