Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that compound X, with the formula C11H12O, undergoes a reaction with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I have to figure out what compound X was.

Wait, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a type of catalyst, maybe for some kind of ring-opening or maybe an elimination reaction. Or wait, isn't that the base used in the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata (CBS) reduction? Or maybe it's related to epoxidation? No, wait, epoxidation is usually done with peracids. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh well, maybe the reaction conditions can give a clue.

But the key here is the NMR data of the product. Let me look at that.

The 1H NMR has these signals:

δ 2.28 (3H, s) – that's a singlet for 3H, probably a methyl group attached to something that doesn't split it, maybe attached to an electronegative atom or in a rigid structure.

δ 2.31 (3H, s) – another singlet for 3H. Hmm, so two methyl groups as singlets. Wait, but that's in 1H NMR. Maybe two different methyl groups. Or perhaps it's a doublet? No, it's a singlet.

Then, the aromatic region:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Wait, that's a pattern of doublets. Let me think. Maybe it's a substituted benzene ring. The splitting suggests some coupling between protons. Let's try to arrange them.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 6.75 (d) – maybe a proton adjacent to substituents.
- 7.08 (d, 2H) – could be a pair of protons on a ring, perhaps para to each other.
- 7.68 (d) – another proton, maybe adjacent to substituents.
- 7.71 (d, 2H) – another pair.

Wait, perhaps this is a structure where the substituents are in the para position, but maybe with some branching. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent causing the protons to split into two doublets.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trans-styryl group. Wait, styryl is like a vinyl group attached to a benzene ring. So, maybe the protons on the double bond are showing as doublets.

Wait, but the 1H NMR shows multiple doublets. Let's think about the coupling.

In the aromatic region, perhaps we have a double bond. For example, in a styrene group (vinyl benzene),
