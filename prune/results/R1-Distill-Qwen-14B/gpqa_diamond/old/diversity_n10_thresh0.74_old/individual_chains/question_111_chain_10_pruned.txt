Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem has two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to determine the major products in each case. Then, I'll match them to the options provided (A, B, C, D) to find the correct answer.

Let's start with Reaction A:
The reactants are 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one and ethyl acrylate, with t-BuOK as the base. Hmm, I remember that t-BuOK is a strong, bulky base, often used in elimination reactions or maybe in some kind of alkylation. Wait, also, when I see a ketone reacting with an acrylate, maybe it's a Claisen or aldol addition? Or perhaps a Michael addition?

Wait, but ethyl acrylate is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. So when you have a ketone and an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, under basic conditions, I think it's a conjugate additionâ€”like a Michael addition. But wait, Michael addition usually involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of the alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. But in this case, the ketone is 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So maybe it's more about the cyclohexanone undergoing some reaction with the acrylate.

Wait, another possibility is that it's an aldol reaction. But the conditions here are with a strong, bulky base. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a nucleophilic attack. Alternatively, maybe it's a ring-opening via some kind of conjugate addition.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the structure of the starting material. 2-ethyl-2,6-dimethylcyclohexan-1-one. So the cyclohexane ring has a ketone at position 1. Positions 2 and 6 have methyl groups, and position 2 also has an ethyl group. So the structure is a substituted cyclohexanone. The substituents on C2 are a methyl and an ethyl,
