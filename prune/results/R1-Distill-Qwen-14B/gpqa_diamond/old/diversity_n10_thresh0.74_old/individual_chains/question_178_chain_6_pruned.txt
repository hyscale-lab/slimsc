Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian given, and I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's think through this step by step because I'm a bit rusty on my QFT.

The Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the action is dimensionless when we include the integral over spacetime (which is dimension 4). So each term in L must have [L]_M = 4.

So, I need to compute the mass dimension of each component in the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's break down each field.

I know that the Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. So [ψ]_M = 3/2. Then ψ̄ (which is ψ† γ^0) has the same dimension as ψ, so that's also 3/2.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for, say, electromagnetism. The field tensor F is made from the partial derivatives of the gauge field A, which has mass dimension 1. Because F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, each derivative is dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

Now, σ_{μν} is made from the commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (since they're just matrices, not operators with derivatives or fields). So σ_{μν} itself doesn't add any mass dimension. So each σ_{μν} has dimension 0.

So putting it all together, let's compute the dimension of the entire term.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ (dimension 3/2), σ_{μν} (dimension 0), ψ (dimension 3/2), and F^{μν} (dimension 2).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, σ_{μν} is part of the spinor indices, so when we write ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ, that's a scalar? Because ψ̄ has indices (maybe I should think in terms of components), but the product ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would involve contraction of spinor indices. So overall, that part is a scalar with dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3. But wait, no, because the σ_{μν} is a tensor with two indices, but when you contract it with the F^{μν}, which is antisymmetric in the same indices, perhaps.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of each term in the product. So the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ multiplied by F^{μν}.

Wait, no, the term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, but let me think about the indices.

Wait, σ_{μν} is a tensor, as is F^{μν}, so when you contract (σ_{μν} F^{μν}), that will give a scalar. So the whole term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ) * F^{μν}.

Wait, but when you write ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ, that's a tensor, because σ_{μν} is a tensor. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would be a vector? Or a tensor? Wait, ψ is a spinor, ψ̄ is another spinor, and σ_{μν} is a tensor. So when you contract the spinor indices, you get a tensor of the same type as σ_{μν}, which is μν antisymmetric.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the dimensions without worrying about the tensor structure. Each part's dimension is additive, so:

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ is 3/2, ψ is 3/2, F^{μν} is 2, and σ_{μν} is 0 (since γ matrices are dimensionless).

So the term [ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}] would have dimension [3/2] + [3/2] + [2] = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. So the entire term is 5. But the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So κ must compensate for that.

So the dimension of the term is [κ] + 5 = 4 → [κ] = 4 -5 = -1. So κ has mass dimension -
