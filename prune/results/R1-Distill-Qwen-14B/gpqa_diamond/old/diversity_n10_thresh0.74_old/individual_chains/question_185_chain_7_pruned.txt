Okay, I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: Consider a system with Hamiltonian operator H = ε σ·n, where n is an arbitrary unit vector, ε is an energy constant, and σ are the Pauli spin matrices. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian.

Hmm, right. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems. The Hamiltonian being the dot product of σ and n probably means it's a spin-½ particle in a magnetic field pointing in the direction of n. Because the energy of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field is proportional to the dot product of the dipole moment and the field.

Wait, so the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ·n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. And since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

I think the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix combination like this can be found by considering the properties of the Pauli matrices. Oh right! The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so the Hamiltonian H is Hermitian as well, which makes sense because observables have Hermitian operators.

Now, for any Hermitian matrix, the eigenvalues are real. And for a 2x2 matrix, the trace is the sum of eigenvalues, and determinant is the product.

Wait, but wait. Let's think of the general form. The operator is H = ε (σ·n). Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination with coefficients n_x, n_y, n_z, what's the eigenvalue?

Wait, no. The Pauli matrices each have eigenvalues ±1 when acting on their respective eigenvectors. But σ·n is a combination of them. Let's think of it as a vector in spin space. The eigenvalues would correspond to the spin component in the direction of n.

I recall that for a spin-½ particle, the spin component in any direction has eigenvalues ±ℏ/2. But wait, in the Hamiltonian, the operator is σ·n, which is proportional to the Pauli matrices. So the eigenvalues of σ·n would be ±1 because each Pauli matrix's eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, let's make this clearer. The Pauli
