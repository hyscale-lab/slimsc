Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and figuring out the energy of the nucleus. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the energy when the speed of the nucleus is 0.96c. The nucleus is Li with 3 neutrons. Wait, Li is lithium, right? So lithium has an atomic number of 3, which means it has 3 protons. If it's Li with 3 neutrons, that would make it lithium-6 (since 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons). So the nucleus is Li-6.

So, the problem is about relativistic energy. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their relativistic mass increases, and their total energy isn't just their rest mass energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = gamma * m0 * c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

First, I need to find gamma. Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 - v²/c²). The speed v is 0.96c, so let's plug that in. Let me compute v²/c²: (0.96)^2 is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is sqrt(0.0784), which is... let's see, 0.28 because 0.28^2 is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 0.28 times 3 is 0.84, 0.28 times 3.5 is 0.98, and 0.28 times 3.57 is about 1.0. So yeah, gamma is approximately 3.5714.

Next, I need to find the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The mass can be found using the periodic table. Wait, but what's the exact mass of Li-6? I think the atomic mass of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but wait, that's the atomic mass for a mole. Oh, right, but for a single nucleus, the mass is the atomic mass divided by Avogadro's number. Alternatively, maybe it's better to look up the exact rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus in atomic mass units (u). Oh, but I might have to convert that to kilograms or use another method.

Alternatively, I remember that the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c², so maybe I can compute the mass of Li-6 as 3 protons and 3 neutrons.

Wait, let's see. So, each proton is approximately 938 MeV/c², and each neutron is around 939.565 MeV/c². So for 3 protons and 3 neutrons:

Protons: 3 * 938 = 2814 MeV/c²
Neutrons: 3 * 939.565 ≈ 2818.695 MeV/c²
Total: 2814 + 2818.695 = 5632.695 MeV/c².

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Because the mass of lithium-6 is actually less than that when considering binding energy. Wait, no, because when you sum the masses of protons and neutrons, you get the mass of the nucleus plus the mass defect (binding energy). Oh wait, actually, the mass of the nucleus is less than the sum of individual nucleons due to the mass defect. So if I'm calculating the rest mass energy of the nucleus, I should use the actual measured mass, not the sum of protons and neutrons. Hmm. Maybe I should look up the exact atomic mass of Li
