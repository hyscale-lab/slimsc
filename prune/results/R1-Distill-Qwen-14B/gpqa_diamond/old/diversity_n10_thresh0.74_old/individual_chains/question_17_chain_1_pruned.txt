Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let's see what it's about. It says something about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Oh right, EDTA is that chelating agent, right? So the question gives me the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex as 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_ca-edta, is 5x10^10. The temperature is 25°C, and the pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that complicating things.

Wait, I remember that when EDTA complexes with a metal ion, it forms a complex which is a 1:1 ratio, right? So the formula is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The K for the formation of this complex is given as 5e10, which is a pretty large number, so the complex is very stable.

The problem is asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Because the complex is formed, the free Ca²+ concentration will be low. So I'm thinking about the K expression here. The formation reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−. The formation constant K is [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

Wait, but wait, in solution, the EDTA exists in various protonated forms. But the problem states that the pH is ideal, so I assume all the EDTA is in the form that can bind Ca²+—probably the deprotonated Y^4− form. Because EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so it has multiple binding sites.

So, the problem gives the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M. Let me denote that as [CaY²−] = 0.02 M.

Since the reaction is 1:1, the total concentration of EDTA and calcium ions would be related. But wait, in this solution, all the Ca²+ is complexed with EDTA, right? Because the K is so large (5e10), it's going to strongly favor the formation of the complex. So the concentration of free Ca²+ will be very low, which is what we need to find.

So, let's break it down. Let's say that initially, before any complexation, we have Ca²+ and
