Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. I need to find the minimum volume of the acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and a precipitate. So when you add a strong acid to it, the acid should protonate the hydroxide ions, right? The reaction should produce Fe^3+ ions and water. Let me write down the reaction.

The chemical equation would be Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions. So Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O. That makes sense because each OH- from Fe(OH)3 would react with an H+ from the acid.

Alright, now I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have. The problem says 0.1 grams. Let me calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed for that. Iron has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85: 0.1/100 is 0.001, but 106.85 is a bit more, so yeah, approximately 0.000936 mol.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 releases 3 moles of OH- ions. So when it reacts with H+, each OH- will take one H+. So for 0.000936 moles Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times that. So 0.000936 * 3 = 0.002808 moles of H+ required.

Now the acid provided is 0.1 M monobasic strong acid. Monobasic means it donates one H+ per molecule, so the concentration of H+ is equal to the concentration of the acid, which is 0.1 M. So to find the volume needed, I can use the formula: moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters).

So volume = moles / Molarity. The moles needed are 0.002808 mol, and the Molarity is 0.1 mol/L. So volume = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and option B is 30.09. Hmm, close but not exact. Maybe I should be more precise in the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar mass. Let me recalculate that. Fe is 55.845 g/mol, each OH is 17.007 g/mol. So 55.845 + 3*(17.007) = 55.845 + 51.021 = 106.866 g/mol. So 0.1 g / 106.866 g/mol is approximately 0.0009357 mol. So 0.0009357 *3 = 0.002807 mol H+.

So volume = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 L → 28.07 cm³. So the closest is option C, which says 28.05 cm³. But wait, wait. I think I might have missed something. Are there any other factors? Oh, wait, the reaction consumes H+ and produces Fe^3+ and water. But what about the volume change? The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so perhaps the solution after adding
