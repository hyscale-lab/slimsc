Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Hmm, let's see. I'll probably need to go through each step of the reaction to understand what's happening.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. That's a norbornene derivative. Norbornene is a bicyclic structure, so maybe the tert-butoxy group is attached at position 7. 

The first reaction is combining this with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Oh wait, sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and with dibromomethyl groups, perhaps this is a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Since there are two equivalents, maybe each of the two dibromomethyl groups will react.

Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene has two dibromomethyl groups on adjacent carbons. So, when this reacts with the norbornene compound, perhaps the iodide is involved in a substitution. Wait, sodium iodide (NaI) would provide iodide ions. So, substitution of Br with I? But wait, the compound has two Br's on each methyl group. So each methyl has two Br's.

Alternatively, maybe it's a coupling reaction. Like a Grignard or similar addition? Or maybe a Diels-Alder reaction? Because norbornene is a diene, and cyclohexadiene is a dienophile? Wait, but the cyclohexadiene has substituents. Hmm.

Wait, norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene) is a diene. The other compound is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups at positions 5 and 6. So maybe a Diels-Alder reaction where the norbornene is the diene and the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile.

Diels-Alder typically forms a six-membered ring with two new sigma bonds. So if we use two equivalents, perhaps two Diels-Alder reactions occur?

Wait, but the other compound is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So each cyclohexadiene has two substituents at 5 and 6 positions. When the Diels-Alder occurs, the dienophile (the cyclohexadiene) would react with the diene (norbornene). But wait, norbornene is a bicyclic diene; perhaps the Diels-Alder would form a bridge or add on to the ring.

Alternatively, wait, the cyclohexadiene is the dienophile. So, the norbornene (dienophile?) is reacting with the cyclohexa-diene. Maybe the reaction is a [4+2] cycloaddition, adding to each end.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclohexadiene has two methyl groups each with two bromines, which are leaving groups. So maybe the norbornene is acting as a nucleophile, attacking the cyclohexadiene's methyl
