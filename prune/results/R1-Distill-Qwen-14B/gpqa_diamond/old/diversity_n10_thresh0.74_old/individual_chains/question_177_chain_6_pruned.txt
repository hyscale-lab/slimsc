Okay, I need to tackle this astronomy problem. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The key details given are their radii, masses, and some spectroscopic data. Hmm.

So, Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. That means R1 = 1.5 R2. And the mass is also 1.5 times larger, M1 = 1.5 M2. Interesting, so both radius and mass increase by the same factor. But I'm not sure how mass plays into this immediately, because the question is about luminosity, which I think relates more to radius and temperature.

The problem states that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh wait, that's the peak wavelength due to blackbody radiation, so that's connected to their temperatures. Because a hotter object emits peak radiation at a shorter wavelength, as per Wien's Law. So if both peak at the same wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. Because according to Wien's displacement law, lambda_max = b / T, where b is Wien's constant. So same lambda_max implies same temperature T. So T1 = T2.

Wait, but how does that affect their luminosities? Oh right, because the luminosity of a star depends on its radius squared and its temperature to the fourth power. The formula is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars have the same temperature, the luminosity ratio would depend only on the ratio of their radii squared.

Wait, but wait a second. Star_1's radius is 1.5 times that of Star_2, so R1 = 1.5 R2. So R1² is (2.25) R2². So L1/L2 would be (R1/R2)² * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, that term is 1. So the ratio is (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. That would mean the answer is ~2.25, which is option A.

But hold on, the question mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has 0, Star_2 has 700 km/s. How would that come into play? Hmm. Oh wait
