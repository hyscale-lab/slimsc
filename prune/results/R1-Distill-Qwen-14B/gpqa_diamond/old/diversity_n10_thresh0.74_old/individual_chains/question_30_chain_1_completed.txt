Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about dyes and the colors they absorb. Hmm, I remember that when something absorbs light, it reflects or emits the complementary color. Oh wait, but wait, the question says the dye emits light with a certain energy. Or does it absorb? Let me read the question again.

The question states: A textile dye containing an extensively conjugated pi-electrons emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound? Oh, okay, so the dye emits light, but I need to find out what color it absorbs. Wait, no. I think I might be getting this mixed up. So, when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths, it reflects others. Like, if it absorbs blue, it reflects red and yellow, so we see it as orange or something. But wait, what's the exact process here.

So the question is about absorption. The dye emits light, but I'm supposed to find out which color it absorbs. Wait, no, maybe I'm confused. Alternatively, when a molecule absorbs light, it's because of the energy gap between molecular orbitals. The energy of the absorbed photon corresponds to that gap. So the wavelength absorbed would be such that E = hc/λ. So if the dye emits light at 2.3393 eV, does that mean that's the energy of the photon it emits, or the energy it absorbs?

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state, and then emits a photon when it relaxes. So the energy of the emitted photon is related to the energy difference between the states. But the question says the dye emits light with that energy. Wait, perhaps what matters here is the absorbed light's energy, which is what determines the color we see (complementary color). Or maybe the dye emits that energy when it's excited, but the question is about what it absorbs.

Wait, no, the question says the compound emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So the emission corresponds to a certain wavelength, which would be the color it emits. But the question is asking what color is absorbed. Hmm, but that doesn't make sense because the absorbed light should be in the same region as the emission, but in terms of energy, maybe they're related.

Wait, perhaps I've got it backwards. The energy of the absorbed photon is what causes the molecule to emit light. So the energy of absorbed light would be higher than the emitted light. Because when the molecule gets excited, it can emit a lower energy photon when it relaxes.

Alternatively, maybe the energy of the emitted photon is the same as the absorbed. No, that might not be the case. Let me think of the classic example: fluorescent lights. They absorb UV light and emit visible light. The emitted light has lower energy than the absorbed. So in that case, if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV, perhaps it absorbed a higher energy photon, like UV.

But wait, the question is about the color of the absorbed light. So the options are all visible colors. So perhaps the question is actually asking which color in the visible spectrum is absorbed, leading to emission of another color? Or maybe it's about the complementary color.

Wait, the question says the dye emits light of energy 2.3393 eV. So first, I need to find what color that is. Then, the absorbed color would be the complementary, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, wait, maybe it's the other way around: the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV. So the question might be phrased incorrectly, but let's proceed.

Wait, the question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so that's the emission. But the question is about the absorbed color. That's confusing because usually, the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted. So the absorbed energy would be higher than 2.3393 eV. Let me think of the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon of energy E_abs, which takes it from ground state to excited state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon of energy E_emit, which is less than E_abs.

So E_emit = E_abs - (other energy losses, like heat). So in this case, E_emit is 2.3393 eV. So E_abs must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon would be of higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Let me calculate what color 2.3393 eV corresponds to.

The energy of a photon is E = hc/λ. The constants: h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / λ = (hc)/λ. Rearranged, λ = hc/(E). Let's compute E in joules: 2.3393 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV = approximately 3.746e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.746e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.746e-19) ≈ 5.31e-7 meters, which is 531 nm. That's in the green part of the spectrum. But wait, 531 nm is actually in the green, but I'm a bit confused because the visible spectrum is roughly 400-700 nm. So 531 is green. So if the dye emits green light, then what color would it absorb?

Wait, but the question is, what color is absorbed? So if the dye emits green (531 nm), which is at about 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed photon must have higher energy. So perhaps blue, violet, or higher. Wait, but since the options are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Wait, but wait. Let me re-examine the calculation. Did I compute the wavelength correctly?

E = 2.3393 eV.

E in J: 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 ≈ 3.746e-19 J.

λ = hc / E = (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / (3.746e-19 J)
= (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (3.746e-19 J)
≈ 5.31e-7 m = 531 nm.

Yes, that's correct. 531 nm is green. But the options don't have green. The options are red (around 650-700 nm), violet (400-440), blue (~450-495), and yellow (~570-590). Hmm, 531 is just a bit into green, which is between blue and yellow. So 531 nm is actually in the green range but closer to blue. So if the dye is emitting green, the absorbed light must be higher energy, meaning shorter wavelength (blue or violet). But the question is asking what color is absorbed.

Wait, but the question is phrased as: the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed? Or perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and it's the absorbed light's energy that's 2.3393 eV.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. The question is about the absorption. The compound emits light, so it must have absorbed light of higher energy. So we're to find the absorbed color, which would have higher energy than 2.3393 eV.

So let's compute the wavelength corresponding to 2.3393 eV. As before, 531 nm, which is green. Since the absorbed photon is higher energy than emitted, so shorter wavelength. The options for absorption are violet (higher energy than green), blue, etc.

Wait, but the options for absorption are A) Red (about 650 nm, lower energy), B) Violet (400 nm, higher energy), C) Blue (450 nm, higher than green), D) Yellow (570 nm, lower than green but in same range).

Wait, no. 570 nm is longer than 531 nm, so yellow is lower energy than green. So the emitted photon is green. Then the absorbed photon must be higher energy (shorter wavelength) than green, so either blue or violet.

So the options for absorption are B and C: Violet and Blue.

So what's the energy difference between green and these options.

Let me compute the energy for each option.

Option B: Violet, wavelength around 400 nm. E = 1240 eV·nm / 400 nm = 3.1 eV.

Option C: Blue, say around 450 nm. E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

The emitted energy is 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed energy must be higher than 2.3393 eV, so for blue (2.756) and violet (3.1) are both higher. So the absorbed photon could be either violet or blue.

Wait, but the question is which color is absorbed. So the compound must be absorbing either blue or violet. So which one is it?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about the energy levels. The molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy than the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted.

So the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that. Let's compute the corresponding wavelengths for 2.3393 eV.

We already have 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon must be of higher energy, so lower wavelength (shorter than 531 nm). So it would be blue or violet.

Wait, but the options don't have both. So what color is it? Let me think about the energy for each option.

If E_abs is 2.3393 eV, that's the emitted energy, but that's not necessarily the absorbed energy. Wait, no. The absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The energy of the emitted photon is the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state. So E_emit = E_excited - E_ground.

The absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_excited - E_ground. Wait, no, because when it absorbs, it's taking energy from the photon to reach a higher state. So E_abs is the energy required to promote the molecule from ground state to the excited state. Then, when it emits, it could emit a photon of lower energy than E_abs. So E_emit = E_abs - something (like other energy losses, but assuming it's a simple transition, maybe E_emit = E_abs).

Wait, but that would imply that E_abs = E_emit, which can't be right because then they'd be the same color, but the dye would not absorb that color.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the color wheel. If a dye emits green, it must absorb the complementary color, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option here. Hmm, maybe it's not about complementary colors but about the energy required for the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon corresponds to the energy gap. So the absorbed photon would have that same energy. But then, if the molecule emits green, it must have absorbed green. But that doesn't make sense because then it would just convert green to green; that's not how fluorescence works.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to relate the energy to wavelength and then determine the color based on that. Let's compute the wavelength for 2.3393 eV.

As before, 531 nm is green. So the emitted light is green. So what color is absorbed? The absorbed photon must be higher energy (shorter wavelength). So options B and C are possible.

But wait, the question is which color is absorbed. So if the dye emits green, what color does it absorb? Well, in terms of the color we see, the dye would appear as the complementary color of green, which is magenta. But magenta isn't an option. The options given are red, violet, blue, yellow.

Hmm. Maybe this is a question about the energy of the absorbed photon determining the color. Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased the other way around, and the emitted color is the complementary of the absorbed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what the energy of 2.3393 eV corresponds to in terms of color. We've got 531 nm, which is green. So the emitted light is green. So the dye must have absorbed a higher energy photon (blue or violet) to get excited and then emit green.

Wait, but the question is, what color is absorbed? So the absorbed color is either violet or blue.

Looking at the options, B is violet and C is blue. So which one is it?

Well, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV. So let's compute the energy for each option.

Option B: Violet, approx 400 nm. E = 1240 / 400 = 3.1 eV. Which is higher than 2.3393.

Option C: Blue, approx 450 nm. E = 1240 /450 ≈ 2.756 eV. Also higher than 2.3393.

So both B and C are possible. How do I decide between them?

Wait, the question says the dye has an extensively conjugated pi-electron system. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, which correspond to longer wavelengths (lower energy). So the energy gap is smaller because of the extended conjugation.

Wait, but in this problem, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. That's a certain energy. So the energy gap would correspond to the energy of the emitted photon. Wait, but earlier I thought that the emitted energy is the energy difference between the ground and excited states. Hmm, maybe I should clarify that.

In fluorescence, a molecule absorbs a higher energy photon (blue or UV), gets excited to a higher state, then emits a lower energy photon (visible, green), and returns to the ground state. So the energy of the emitted photon is less than the absorbed.

So in this case, the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the absorbed photon must be higher than that, say 3 eV or 3.1 eV. Which would correspond to violet or blue.

But the question is about what color is absorbed. So what color would have higher energy than 2.3393 eV?

The energy of 2.3393 eV is 531 nm (green). So the absorbed photon is higher in energy, so shorter wavelength. So either blue (around 450) or violet (400). Let's find which of these options corresponds to an energy higher than 2.3393.

Compute the energy for each:

Violet: E = 1240 / 400 ≈ 3.1 eV.

Blue: E = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.756 eV.

So both are higher than 2.3393 eV. So which is the correct option?

Wait, the question is, what color is absorbed. So either B or C is possible. But the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Wait, but the emitted photon is green, so the absorbed must be either blue or violet.

But how to choose between blue and violet?

Hmm, perhaps the energy 2.3393 eV is somewhere between blue and green.

Wait, the visible spectrum is about 400-700 nm. So 531 is green, 450 is blue, 400 is violet.

But the question is about the color absorbed. So if the dye emits green, it must have absorbed a higher energy photon, either blue or violet.

Wait, but without more information, perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the wavelength and then find the color. Let's recalculate.

E = 2.3393 eV.

Wavelength λ = hc/(E) = (1240 eV·nm) / (2.3393 eV) ≈ 531 nm, which is green. So the emitted light is green.

The absorbed light must be higher energy than this, so shorter wavelength. So either blue or violet.

But the options don't have both; the choices are B and C.

Wait, maybe the question is actually about the energy of the absorbed light being 2.3393 eV, and the emitted is lower. But the question states that the dye emits light of that energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly. Let me read again.

The question says: emits light with energy of 2.3393 eV. So I think that's correct.

So the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed energy must be higher. The options for higher energy are B and C.

So the possible answers are B) Violet or C) Blue.

Wait, but how do I choose between them? Let me see the approximate energies.

If the absorbed wavelength is 450 nm (blue), E=2.756 eV.

If the absorbed wavelength is 400 nm (violet), E=3.1 eV.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is lower than both. So either option B or C is possible.

But the question gives four options, and the correct one has to be either B or C.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the energy of the absorbed light. Wait, no, the question says the dye emits that energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. Then, the emitted photon would have lower energy, like red. But that's just speculation.

Wait, but the question states the opposite: the dye emits the light with 2.3393 eV, so the emitted is green.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the color that the compound absorbs, which would be the complementary color of the emitted.

But the complementary color of green is magenta. But magenta isn't an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply about the energy corresponding to each color, and which color's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV.

So looking at the options:

A) Red: ~1.9 eV (since 650 nm is about 1.9 eV). That's lower than 2.3393, so that can't be the absorbed.

B) Violet: 3.1 eV. Higher. So possible.

C) Blue: ~2.75 eV. Higher. Possible.

D) Yellow: ~2.0 eV (570 nm is ~2.0 eV). Lower.

So the options for absorbed are B and C.

But the question gives four options, and expects one correct answer. So perhaps the correct answer is either B or C.

Wait, but the question is about the compound's absorption. So when the dye emits green, the absorbed color is the one with higher energy, either violet or blue.

Hmm, but without more information, it's hard to choose between B and C.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the energy of 2.3393 eV and then find the wavelength, which is 531 nm (green). Then, the color absorbed would be the one with higher energy, so either blue or violet. Since the question gives both as options, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but why would it be violet? Because 531 is green, so the absorbed would be violet if the E is 3.1 eV.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the energy of the absorbed light being 2.3393 eV. Then the emitted would be lower, which would be in the red or something. But the question says the opposite.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of it differently. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than this, so it's either blue or violet.

The options are B) Violet and C) Blue. So the correct answer is either B or C.

But how to choose?

Wait, maybe the question is actually asking which color is absorbed, which would correspond to the energy gap. So the energy gap (E) is the energy of the emitted photon. So E = 2.3393 eV.

So the absorbed photon's energy is E_abs = E_gap + something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the emitted, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is the same as the energy of the emitted photon, but that would mean the same color, which can't be right because then the dye would emit the same color it absorbed, which is not how fluorescence works.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the energy of the emitted photon and then determine the color it's absorbing, perhaps by knowing that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher. So, for example, if the emitted is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed could be blue (2.75 eV), which is higher.

So the answer would be C) Blue. But wait, another part of me thinks the absorbed could be violet.

Wait, let me think about the energy required for the transition. Extensive conjugation leads to lower energy gaps, so the energy required for the transition (the absorbed photon) is lower. Wait, no: extensive conjugation lowers the energy gap, meaning lower energy (longer wavelength) for the absorbed photon.

Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier. Wait, if the molecule has extensive conjugation, the energy gap between molecular orbitals is smaller. So the energy of the absorbed photon (which corresponds to that gap) is lower.

Wait, wait, that's correct. For conjugated molecules, as the number of conjugated double bonds increases, the energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied (LUMO) decreases. So the required energy for the transition decreases, moving to longer wavelengths (lower energy).

So a smaller energy gap (lower E) corresponds to longer wavelength (red shift). So if a molecule has a large conjugated system, it absorbs lower energy (longer wavelength) light.

Wait, but if the dye emits at 2.3393 eV (green), then the absorbed photon must have higher energy, which would be a shorter wavelength. But if the molecule has extensive conjugation, which would lower the energy required for the transition (so lower E, longer wavelength), but that would suggest that the absorbed photon is lower energy than emitted, which contradicts.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In a conjugated system, the energy difference between the HOMO and LUMO decreases as the conjugation length increases. So the energy required for the electron transition is lower. So the absorbed photon has lower energy (longer wavelength) than a less conjugated system.

Wait, but in this case, the dye emits green, which is higher energy than red, for instance. So if the molecule has extensive conjugation, it absorbs at a longer wavelength (lower energy) than a less conjugated system. But if it's emitting at green, which is higher energy than red, but perhaps the absorbed photon is in the blue or violet range.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach this differently.

The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that, so either blue or violet.

If the molecule has extensive conjugation, which leads to lower energy gaps (so lower E for the absorbed photon), then the absorbed photon's energy would be lower than it would be without the conjugation. But wait, the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than the emitted. So if the molecule has a lower energy gap (because of more conjugation), the absorbed photon would have lower energy than a less conjugated system.

Wait, but that doesn't directly help me decide between blue and violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the absorbed photon has higher energy, so shorter wavelength (blue or violet).

But without the exact energy of the absorbed photon, I can't directly determine the color. So perhaps the question expects me to compute the wavelength of 2.3393 eV and then pick the absorbed color from the options, which are either blue or violet.

Wait, but how? Let me see the options again: B is violet, C is blue.

Hmm. I'm stuck between B and C.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the absorbed energy is 2.3393 eV, and the emitted is lower. But the question says the dye emits that energy, so that can't be.

Another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the wavelength is 531 nm (green). The absorbed photon would have higher energy (shorter wavelength), so E_abs > 2.3393 eV.

Since the options are B (violet, 400 nm, 3.1 eV) and C (blue, 450 nm, 2.756 eV), both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

But without more info, perhaps the question expects me to pick the color with the next higher energy than green, which is blue. But wait, violet is higher in energy than blue.

So the correct answer would be B) Violet.

Wait, but why? Because if the emitted is green (2.3393 eV), the absorbed must be higher. Between B and C, violet has higher energy. So the dye absorbs violet, gets excited, and emits green.

But that would mean the absorbed photon is violet, which is higher energy than green. So the correct answer is B) Violet.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we analyze the energy of the emitted light and its relationship to the absorbed light. The dye emits light with an energy of **2.3393 eV**, which corresponds to a wavelength calculated as:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E} = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{2.3393 \, \text{eV}} \approx 531 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength falls in the green region of the visible spectrum. The absorbed light must have higher energy than the emitted light because the molecule absorbs a photon of higher energy to become excited, then emits a photon of lower energy as it relaxes. Therefore, the absorbed photon must correspond to a shorter wavelength (higher energy) than 531 nm.

The energy of a photon is inversely proportional to its wavelength:

\[
E = \frac{1240 \, \text{eV·nm}}{\lambda}.
\]

For the options provided:

- **A) Red**: Around 650 nm, corresponding to \( E \approx 1.9 \, \text{eV} \) (lower energy than 2.3393 eV, not possible).
- **B) Violet**: Around 400 nm, corresponding to \( E \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV} \) (higher energy than 2.3393 eV, possible).
- **C) Blue**: Around 450 nm, corresponding to \( E \approx 2.756 \, \text{eV} \) (higher energy than 2.3393 eV, possible).
- **D) Yellow**: Around 570 nm, corresponding to \( E \approx 2.0 \, \text{eV} \) (lower energy than 2.3393 eV, not possible).

Both **violet** (B) and **blue** (C) have higher energy than 2.3393 eV. However, since the question specifies that the compound has an extensively conjugated \(\pi\)-electron system, the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO orbitals is smaller, meaning the absorbed photon typically has slightly higher energy than the emitted photon. Among the options, **violet** corresponds to the higher energy (\(3.1 \, \text{eV}\)) and is therefore the most likely absorbed color.

Answer: B
