Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question says I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Hmm, di-substituted means there are two substituents on the ring. The molecule is aromatic, so it's likely a benzene ring with two groups attached. Wait, but the total is 8 carbons. Benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents add up to 2 more carbons. So each substituent must have 1 carbon each, or maybe one substituent has 2 and the other 0? No, wait, di-substituted means two substituents, so each substituent contributes one carbon each. Because 6 (benzene) + 2 (substituents) = 8 total.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So the substituents are likely a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but substituents on benzene can be in various positions. Di-substituted can be para, meta, or ortho. The NMR data will depend on the structure.

So the substituents are probably a -CO- group and a -X (halogen). Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, but the carbonyl group could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, etc. Also, the other substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, etc.

So the molecule would be something like o-, m-, or p-dihalobenzene with a carbonyl group? No, wait, each substituent is a group. For example, one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen.

Wait, but let's think about the substituents. For example, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone, and the other is a halogen. Alternatively, the substituents could be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen, like an acetyl group and a Cl.

Wait, but wait. If the total number of carbons is 8, and benzene has 6, then the two substituents must add up to 2 carbons. So each substituent is 1 carbon each.

Wait, but a substituent like -CO- something would require more carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe one substituent is -OCH3 (methoxy) and the other is a carbonyl group. Wait, no, that would be more than 8. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene ring. The total number of carbons is 8, which includes the benzene (6). So two substituents contribute 2 carbons. So each substituent must have 1 carbon. So each substituent is a single carbon group attached to the ring.

So the substituents could be -COX (like an acyl group) and another group. Wait, but an acyl group has more than one carbon. Wait, maybe each substituent is a single carbon group with a functional group.

Wait, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like a ketone (but that's a single carbon?), no, a ketone would require at least two carbons attached. Wait, maybe it's a formyl group,
