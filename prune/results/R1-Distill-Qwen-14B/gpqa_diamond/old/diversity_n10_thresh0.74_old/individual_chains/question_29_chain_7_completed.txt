Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutations. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is.

So, the scenario is that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and look for changes in the gene sequence to eliminate the compound.

The question is about which mutation would most likely eliminate the compound. The options are mutants 1 to 4, each with a different change in the first exon area.

The intact gene's sequence starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT and ends with TGA. The mutants have variations in this region.

I need to figure out which mutation leads to a non-functional gene product, like a non-sense or frameshift mutation, which would disrupt the protein and possibly disable the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: 
Change from TTTCTCGC to TTCTACGC. Let's compare the original and mutant sequences. The original is TTTCTCGCTGGTACT, and mutant 1 is TTCTACGCTGGTACT. Wait, no, wait: the initial part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

In Mutant 1, the sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA. So the first part is ATG followed by TTTCTC... in the wild type. In mutant 1, it's TTCTACGC. Let me write the original and mutant parts:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
Mutant1: ATG TTCTACGC ... Wait, wait, perhaps I should split the sequences into codons to see if there's a frameshift or a stop codon.

Wait, but first, considering that mutations occur in exons, which are coding regions. So any changes here would directly affect the amino acids.

Wait, but the question says the gene consists of five exons and four introns. So the first exon is part of the coding region.

Looking at the changes:

Mutant 1:
Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, so comparing the two, let's see:

Original starts with TTTCTC, and mutant1 has TTCTAC. So let's look at the exact change.

Wait, perhaps it's a substitution. Let's count the letters.

Original (intact gene): 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC G T…TGA-3’
Mutant1: 5’-ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC G C …TGA-3’
Wait, perhaps I should line them up more carefully. Let me see:

Intact gene first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG...

Mutant1:
ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG...

Wait, so in the intact gene, the third codon is TTT, then CTC, GCT, etc. In mutant1, the third codon is TTC, then TAC, etc. Wait, perhaps I should write the sequences as DNA and then see the amino acids.

Wait, another approach: Each codon is three bases. So perhaps I should break each DNA segment into codons.

Original gene first part:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC G T...

Mutant1:
ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC G C...

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the original and mutant1 sequences around the point of mutation.

Original: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant1: ...TTCTACGCT GGT ACT...

Wait, the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT. So that's:

TTT (codon 2: Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr).

Mutant1's sequence in that area is TTCTACGCT. So let's split into codons:

TTCTACGCT would be T TCT ACG CTG? Wait, no:

Wait, the full sequence for mutant1 is ATG TTCTACGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG... So in terms of codons:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), ATG (start again), etc.

Wait, so in the original, the first few codons after ATG are:
TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), ATG (start), etc.

In mutant1, the first few codons are:
ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), ATG (start), etc.

So it looks like the second codon in mutant1 is TTC (Phe) where in the original it was TTT (Phe). So that's a substitution of the third T to C. So TTT becomes TTC. So the amino acid remains Phe, since TTC is also Phe. So that's a silent mutation.

Wait, but then the next codon in the original was CTC (Leu), but in mutant1 it's TAC. So the original was CTC (Leu), and mutant1 has TAC (Tyr). So that's a substitution from Leu to Tyr. Then the next codon in original was GCT (Ala), but in mutant1 it's GCT as well (since after TAC is GCT). So, the main change is that at position of the second codon (originally CTC, Leu) becomes TAC (Tyr).

So the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. But that's just an amino acid substitution. Not a frameshift or a stop codon. So the protein would still be made, but with a different amino acid. Maybe this doesn't disable the compound.

Moving on to Mutant2:

Mutant2's sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So the change is:

Original has ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACT...
Mutant2: ...TTCTAAGCTGGTACT...

Breaking into codons:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT
Mutant2: TTCTAA GCT GGT ACT

Wait, so the original is TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr).

Mutant2's sequence in that area is TTCTAA GCT GGT ACT.

So breaking into codons:

TTCTAA would be TT CTA A? Wait, no, each codon is three bases. So the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant2's sequence in that area is TTCTAA... Wait, perhaps:

Original: positions 1-3: TTT (Phe), 4-6: CTC (Leu), 7-9: GCT (Ala), 10-12: GGT (Gly), 13-15: ACT (Thr).

Mutant2's first part is TTCTAA GCT GGT ACT.

So the first codon is TTC (Phe), the next is TAA. TAA is a stop codon (amber stop). Oh, wait, if the second codon becomes TAA, which is a stop, then the protein would terminate early.

Wait, but wait, let me check the exact positions.

Wait, in the intact gene, the sequence is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG...

In mutant2: ATG TTCTAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG...

So the first few codons would be:

ATG (start), TTC (Phe), TAA (stop), then GCT (Ala), etc. Wait, but the stop codon would be in the middle. So the mRNA would be read as Phe, then stop. The protein would be truncated, possibly non-functional. So this could disrupt the gene product.

So mutant2 introduces a stop codon early in the sequence, which would result in a truncated protein—maybe non-functional, thus possibly eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

Now, Mutant3:

Mutant3's sequence is ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So the change is in the original:

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3's: ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Looking at the change:

Original sequence: ...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant3: ...TTTTAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT...

Breaking into codons:

Original: TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser).

Mutant3: TTTTAC would be TTT TAC. Wait, perhaps:

Mutant3's first codons after ATG are TTT, TAC, GCT, GGT, GTC, ACT, TCT, etc.

Wait, so the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT.

Mutant3's is TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT.

So the second codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr), the fourth codon from GGT (Gly) to GTC (Val), and the fifth codon from ACT (Thr) to ACT (unchanged). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Wait, perhaps the original is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT.

Mutant3's sequence is TT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTCTGTG...

Wait, perhaps I need to look at the actual DNA sequences.

Original: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant3: ...TTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So the original is:

Positions 1-3: TTT

4-6: CTC

7-9: GCT

10-12: GGT

13-15: ACT

16-18: TCT

Etc.

In Mutant3, positions 1-3: TTT (same)

4-6: TAC (changed from CTC to TAC)

7-9: GCT (same)

10-12: GGT (same)

13-15: GTC (changed from ACT to GTC)

16-18: TCT (same)

So the amino acids change from Leu (CTC) to Tyr (TAC), and from Thr (ACT) to Val (GTC). So two amino acid substitutions. But no stop codon introduced. So the protein is still made, but with two different amino acids. Not sure if this would disrupt the compound.

Lastly, Mutant4:

Mutant4's sequence is ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So in the original, it's ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant4's is ...TTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

So looking at the change:

Original: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Breaking into codons:

Original: TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser).

Mutant4: TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser).

So the second codon changed from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). The fourth codon in the original was GGT (Gly), but in mutant4, it's ACT (Thr) because the DNA sequence changed. Let me see:

The original has GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant4 has GCT ACT.

Wait, in terms of codons:

Original: CTC GCT GGT ACT.

Mutant4's is TAC GCT ACT.

So the original after TTT, CTC (Leu) comes GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr).

Mutant4: after TTT, TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr).

So the second codon is Tyr instead of Leu, and the Gly codon (GGT) is now ACT (Thr). Wait, no— in the mutant4, after TAC is GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). So the fourth codon changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). So the amino acids change from Leu to Tyr, and Gly to Thr.

So again, just substitutions, no stop codons, no frameshifts. The protein is still made, but with different amino acids.

The question is which mutation would eliminate the compound. To eliminate it, the gene product (probably an enzyme) would need to be non-functional. So the best way is if the protein is not made, or is severely truncated.

Looking back, Mutant2 introduces a TAA stop codon in the second codon. So the protein would be much shorter, possibly non-functional. That would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The other mutations cause amino acid substitutions but don't introduce a stop codon, so the protein is made but changed—maybe not fully functional, but perhaps not as likely as a premature stop.

Wait, but let me think. The initial part of the gene is the first exon, which is the start. So a stop codon early on would mean the gene is not translated into a full-length protein, which could mean the compound isn't produced.

So among the options, Mutant2 has a stop codon. So the correct answer is option A) Mutant 2.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the changes in the gene sequences of the mutants compared to the intact gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene product, such as by introducing a stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Intact Gene Sequence (First Exon Area):
```
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT...
```

### Mutant 1:
```
ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GC...
```
- Codon changes:
  - `TTT` → `TTC` (Phe to Phe, silent mutation).
  - `CTC` → `TAC` (Leu to Tyr, amino acid substitution).
- No stop codon introduced. The protein is still produced but with one amino acid changed.

### Mutant 2:
```
ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GC...
```
- Codon changes:
  - `TTT` → `TTC` (Phe to Phe, silent mutation).
  - `CTC` → `TAA` (Leu to stop codon, introduces a premature stop).
- The presence of `TAA` (amber stop codon) truncates the protein early, likely rendering it non-functional. This would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

### Mutant 3:
```
ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT...
```
- Codon changes:
  - `CTC` → `TAC` (Leu to Tyr, amino acid substitution).
  - `GGT` → `GTC` (Gly to Val, amino acid substitution).
- No stop codon introduced. The protein is produced with two amino acid substitutions, but it is still likely functional.

### Mutant 4:
```
ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT...
```
- Codon changes:
  - `CTC` → `TAC` (Leu to Tyr, amino acid substitution).
  - `GGT` → `ACT` (Gly to Thr, amino acid substitution).
- No stop codon introduced. The protein is produced with two amino acid substitutions, but it is still likely functional.

### Conclusion:
Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`), which truncates the protein and likely renders it non-functional. This would most probably eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The other mutants only involve amino acid substitutions without introducing a stop codon, making them less likely to completely disrupt the gene product.
