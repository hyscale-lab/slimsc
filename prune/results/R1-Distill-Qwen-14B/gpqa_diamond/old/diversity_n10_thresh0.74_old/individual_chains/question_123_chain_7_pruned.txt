Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and some ejecta moving towards the galaxy's center. Hmm, I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, first, the problem says that both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. So that means no acceleration involved, right? Gravity is ignored, so no worries about that. Also, rotation and revolution are ignored, so it's a simple case of relative motion.

Wait, the ejecta part is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. From the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta must be moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. Because if in one frame A is moving towards B at speed v, then in B's frame, A moves towards B at speed v. Since both are inertial, the speeds should be the same in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, I'm a bit confused about the reference frames here. Let me clarify: In the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center. In the ejecta's frame, the galaxy is moving at velocity v towards the ejecta. So yes, it's the same speed.

Now, the question is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Hmm. So time passes differently in each
