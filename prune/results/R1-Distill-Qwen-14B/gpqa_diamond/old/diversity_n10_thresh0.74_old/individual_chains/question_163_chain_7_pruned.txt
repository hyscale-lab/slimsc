Alright, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution using a strong monobasic acid. I need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I should start by understanding the reaction involved. Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide, and it's being dissolved in a strong acid. The acid is monobasic, which means it donates one H+ ion per molecule. So the reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (for example) to produce Fe³+ ions and water.

The balanced equation for this reaction would be:
Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O

Wait, but wait. Let me check the stoichiometry. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so it requires three H+ ions (from the acid) to neutralize each OH- and produce water. So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl.

Now, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The mass is 0.1 grams. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Let's calculate that. 

Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH- group is 17 g/mol (16 O + 1 H). So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me compute that accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.00093595 moles. So roughly 9.36e-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed would be 3 * 0.00093595 ≈ 0.00280785 moles.

But wait, the acid solution is 0.1 M. So volume (in liters) = moles / concentration. So volume = 0.00280785 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.0280785 L, which is 28.0785 cm³. Hmm, that's approximately 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.

Wait, but the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. So does the volume of the acid contribute to the total volume? Because when you add the acid, it's added to the solution. So the 100 cm³ is the final volume. Hmm, but when you dissolve the solid in the acid, the volume of the acid added (let's say V cm³) plus the volume of the solution (maybe including some water) equals 100 cm³? Or is the 100 cm³ the total after adding the acid?

Wait, the question says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So I think that the solution made by dissolving the Fe(OH)3 in the acid has a total volume of 100 cm³. So the acid solution's volume (V) plus any water added should sum to 100 cm³, but perhaps the initial solution already has some volume. Wait, the problem says the Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ total volume, but it's the acid solution that's being used. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider.

Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume after mixing the Fe(OH)3 with the acid. So the acid is added in a volume V, and the total is 100 cm³. But wait, when you add solid to a solution, the total volume can change, but for dilute solutions, it's often approximated. But maybe in this problem, the 100 cm³ is the final volume after adding the acid.

But in any case, the moles of HCl needed is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, which we calculated as approximately 0.00280785 moles. The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume would be 0.00280785 / 0.1 = 0.0280785 L = 28.08 cm³. So that's about 28.08 cm³. The closest option is C, which is 28.05 cm³. So that's the volume part.

Now, what about the pH? After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, we'll have a solution of FeCl3. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and a salt of a strong acid and a weak base. So it will hydrolyze in water to form an acidic solution.

The hydrolysis reaction is: Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

Wait, no, more accurately, the Fe³+ ion reacts with water in a stepwise manner, but for the purpose of calculating pH, we can consider the hydrolysis:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

But perhaps it's better to compute the concentration of H+ ions from the hydrolysis of Fe³+.

First, let's find the concentration of Fe³+ in the solution. The total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), and the moles of Fe³+ is same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.00093595 mol. So concentration of Fe³+ is 0.00093595 mol / 0.1 L = 0.0093595 M.

Wait, that's [Fe³+] = 0.0093595 M.

The hydrolysis of Fe³+ can be represented by:

Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+

But since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but in acidic solution, perhaps it's more about the hydrolysis of the Fe³+ ion. The hydrolysis will produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic.

The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, so the pH will be determined by the concentration of H+ from this process.
