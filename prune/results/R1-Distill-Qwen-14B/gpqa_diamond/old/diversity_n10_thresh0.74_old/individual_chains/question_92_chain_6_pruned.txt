Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let's see... the structure must have a couple of double bonds because of the "C=C" parts. But I'm not here for the structure; I need to find the enthalpy of formation.

The given data includes the enthalpy of atomization of carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Then, bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H bonds. So, I remember that the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using bond energies. The formula is something like the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the sum of the bond energies of the products, but wait, isn't it the other way around? Or maybe it's about the atoms coming together.

Wait, no. The standard approach for calculating the enthalpy of formation using bond energies is to consider the reaction where the compound is formed from its constituent elements. So, for a hydrocarbon, it would be from carbon dioxide and water, but maybe that's a different approach. Alternatively, another method is to think in terms of breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the products.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the enthalpy of formation being the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon like
