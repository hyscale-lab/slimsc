Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the universe's parameters. Hmm, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on cosmology, but I'll think it through.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at around 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. And the flux drops significantly below that wavelength. I remember that in quasars, emission lines are prominent, and sometimes the peak could be due to something like the Lyman-alpha emission line, but wait, Lyman-alpha is in the ultraviolet, right? Or maybe it's something else.

Wait, another thought: if the peak is at 790 nm, which is in the near-infrared, that's longer than visible light. But how does that relate to the redshift? Oh right! If the observed wavelength is longer than the emitted wavelength, it's because of redshift due to the expansion of the universe.

So maybe the quasar is emitting light that's been redshifted. Let me think about the Lyman-alpha line. The rest wavelength of Lyman-alpha is about 121 nm, in the far ultraviolet. If we observe it at 790 nm, that's a redshift z where 121*(1+z)=790. Let's calculate z.

So, (1 + z) = 790 / 121 ≈ 6.5289. So z ≈ 5.5289. Wait, that's a pretty high redshift. But wait, quasars can have high redshifts, so that's possible.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the peak is from another line. Like the Balmer series in hydrogen? The Balmer-alpha line is H-alpha at about 656 nm in the rest frame. If that's observed at 790, then (1+z) = 790 / 656 ≈ 1.204, so z≈0.204. That's a lower redshift. Hmm, which one is more likely?

Wait, quasars often have broad emission lines, including Lyman-alpha, but sometimes the Lyman series can be more prominent in the rest frame UV. But when observed, if the quasar is at a high redshift, the Lyman
