Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I remember that when a compound absorbs certain wavelengths of light, it emits others, right? Oh wait, I think this is related to the idea of complementary colors. Like, if something absorbs blue, it might emit yellow or something like that. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so let me think through it step by step.

The question says the dye emits light with an energy of 2.3393 eV. I remember that energy levels of photons correspond to different colors. The higher the energy, the shorter the wavelength, which is towards the violet end of the spectrum. Wait, but wait, emission and absorption are related but different processes. So when a substance emits light, it's because the electrons drop from a higher energy state to a lower one, releasing that energy as a photon.

But the question is about what color is absorbed, not emitted. Oh, right! So the dye absorbs certain wavelengths and emits others. The absorbed light is the one that causes the electrons to get excited in the first place. So the energy of the absorbed photon would be higher than the emitted one, right? Because when the electron gets promoted to a higher energy level, and then drops, it can't emit more energy than it absorbed. So the absorbed photon has higher energy than the emitted one.

So, the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV. Let me think about the energy levels of different colors. I remember that the energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength.
