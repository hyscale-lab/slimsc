Okay, let's try to figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it step by step.

So the question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. But more importantly, the question is asking about two separate parts, A and B, and I need to determine the correct choices for each.

The question has two parts:

A) Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism.
B) Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which one shows optical isomerism.

I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part A: which compound doesn't show tautomerism.

First, what is tautomerism? Tautomerism involves the movement of a hydrogen atom and the shifting of a double bond, leading to different isomeric forms. It's similar to keto-enol tautomerism in carbonyl compounds.

Benzoquinone: What's benzoquinone? I think benzoquinone is a quinone with a benzene ring. Quinones generally have two ketone groups. Benzoquinone would have the structure like O=C-(benzene ring)-C=O. So it's a diketone.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: That's a six-membered ring (cyclohexane) with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So it's O=C-(cyclohexane ring)-CO-CO, but spaced every other carbon.

Tautomerism requires the possibility of a hydrogen moving and a double bond shifting. Let's think about each compound.

Benzoquinone: The structure is O=C6H4-C=O. Each ketone is on adjacent carbons in the ring. Wait, no. Benzoquinone would have two ketone groups on adjacent carbons? Or is it 1,4? Wait, maybe I should clarify. Oh, wait, benzoquinone comes in 1,4 and 1,2 forms, but perhaps in this case, it's 1,4. But regardless, each is a diketone.

In benzoquinone, could there be tautomerism? Tautomerism would require adjacent double bonds or something. Alternatively, perhaps for tautomerism,
