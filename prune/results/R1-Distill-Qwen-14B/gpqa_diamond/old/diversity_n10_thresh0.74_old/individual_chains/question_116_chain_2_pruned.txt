Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and see if I can figure it out.

The question starts by talking about Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting can tell us about neighboring protons. So a triplet means each of those protons is next to two others. The 6H at 0.9 ppm is probably a methyl group, maybe attached to a CH2. And the quartet at 1.3 ppm with 4H suggests something like two adjacent CH2 groups. Wait, maybe it's a di-substituted structure.

I think of diethyl ether as a possibility because the structure is CH2CH3-O-CH2CH3. But wait, in diethyl ether, each CH2CH3 group is a triplet for the CH3 (split by the adjacent CH2) and a quartet for the CH2 (split by the adjacent CH3). So in that structure, the CH3 would be a triplet. But in our NMR, the triplet is for 6H, which could correspond to two CH3 groups each giving 3H, so that adds up to 6H. The quartet is 4H, which would be two CH2 groups each giving 2H, so 4H total. Oh right, diethyl ether's structure is O(CH2CH3)2. So in the NMR, each CH3 would be a triplet, and each CH2 a quartet. So that fits with Compound A being diethyl ether.

So Compound A is diethyl ether. Then, it undergoes monobromination to form Compound B. Monobromination of diethyl etherâ€”how does that happen? Diethyl ether has an oxygen with two ethyl groups. Bromination could be via an SN2 mechanism, but since it's an ether, the leaving group would be on the less substituted carbon because of less steric hindrance. Wait, but diethyl ether has two identical ethyl groups attached to the oxygen. So when it reacts with a bromine, maybe it brominates one of the ethyl groups. Alternatively, it could be via some other mechanism, but monobromination suggests
