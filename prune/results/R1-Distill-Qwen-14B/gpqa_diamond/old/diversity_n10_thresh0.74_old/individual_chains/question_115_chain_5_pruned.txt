Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me think aloud.

The problem is about an electron and a positron colliding and annihilating into two photons. The setup is that the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After they collide, they produce two photons with the same energy. One photon is going upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, they produce photons. Since it's an electron and a positron annihilating, they can produce two photons because of conservation laws—like conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but wait. The electron is moving left to right, and the positron is moving right to left. But wait, the positron is moving from the right, so maybe I should clarify their directions. The electron is moving along the positive x-direction (from left), and the positron is moving along the negative x-direction (from right). So their momenta are opposite in direction.

I think I need to calculate the total momentum and energy before the collision because energy and momentum must be conserved in the process.

So, let's break it down. The electron has a Lorentz factor gamma_e of 4. The positron has gamma_p of 2. Since the positron is moving in the opposite direction, its velocity is opposite, so its momentum will be opposite in sign compared to the electron's.

The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But since gamma is given, maybe I can directly compute the relativistic momentum.

Momentum p is gamma * m * v. But wait, another way to compute p is p = gamma * m * c * beta, where beta is v/c. Alternatively, I can compute the momentum using the relativistic expression: p = gamma * m * v. But it's easier to think in terms of units where c=1 sometimes, but maybe I should just use SI units.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the magnitude of each momentum. The electron and positron have the same rest mass, m_e, which is about 9.1e-31 kg. So for the electron: gamma_e =4, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But I don't know v_e. Alternatively, since beta = v/c, and gamma is 4, I can find beta_e.

Since gamma = 4, then gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta^2) → 16 (1 - beta^2) = 1 → 1 - beta^2 = 1/16 → beta^2 = 15/16 → beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly for the positron, gamma_p =2 → 1/sqrt
