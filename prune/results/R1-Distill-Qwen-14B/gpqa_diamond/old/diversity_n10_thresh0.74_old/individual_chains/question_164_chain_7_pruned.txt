Okay, so I've got this problem about binary star systems and figuring out which one is more massive. Hmm, let's see. I remember that binary stars orbit around a common center of mass, right? The problem gives me some data about two systems, system_1 and system_2.

First, I should probably figure out what each piece of data means. Both systems have eclipses with specific periods. System_1 has a 2-year period, and system_2 has a 1-year period. The period is the time between two primary eclipses, which I think is the orbital period of the binary system. So the period is how long it takes the two stars to orbit each other once.

Then there are radial velocity (RV) variations. Radial velocity is the speed at which the stars are moving towards or away from us. The amplitudes given are for each star's velocity. In system_1, the velocities are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, they're 15 and 10 km/s. I remember that in a binary system, the more massive star will have a smaller orbit. So the star with the smaller velocity amplitude is the more massive one.

Wait, wait. No, actually, the more massive star would have a smaller orbit because it's closer to the center of mass. So its velocity would be lower since it's moving less. Because the center of mass is the balance point. So if one star is more massive, it doesn't need to move as much for the system to balance.

So, the velocity amplitude is inversely related to the mass. So the star with the higher velocity is less massive. So in system_1, the two stars have velocities 10 and 5. So the more massive star is the one with 5 km/s because it's moving less. Similarly, in system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So the more massive star is the one with 10 km/s.

But wait, how does this help me find the mass ratio or the total mass?

I think I should use Kepler's laws here. Specifically, the form of Kepler's third law for binary systems. Kepler's third law relates the orbital period, the sum of the masses, and the size of the orbit. But wait, Kepler's law is usually in terms of the semi-major axis. But I don't have the semi-major axes here. Hmm.

Alternatively, I remember that the ratio of the masses of the two stars in a binary system can be found from the ratio of their radial velocity amplitudes. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity. So the mass ratio (M1/M2) is equal to (v2/v1), where v1 and v2 are the velocity amplitudes of the two stars.

Wait, let me think. The center of mass condition says that M1 * a1 = M2 * a2, where a1 and a2 are the semi-major axes. But velocity is v = 2πa / P. So v1 = (2π a1)/P, v2 = (2π a2)/P. So a1 = (v1 * P)/(2π), a2 =
