Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are a few steps, so I'll need to break them down one by one.

First, the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D undergoes elimination of an inert gas to form compound E.

And there are two hints provided. Let me note them down.

Hint a says that compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorus ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions, which convert aldehydes or ketones into alkenes. So this suggests that compound A might have a carbonyl group because that's a typical starting point for a Wittig reaction.

Hint b tells me about the IR spectra. Compound A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, which is indicative of a carbonyl group (C=O stretch), like a ketone or aldehyde. Compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1, which is a bit lower than 1750. Lower wavenumbers for C=O usually suggest a ketone, maybe with some conjugation or ring strain, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe E is a cyclic ketone with some ring size affecting the stretching frequency.

Now, let's think about the steps:

1. A to B: A reacts with HCN. HCN usually adds to carbonyl groups. So if A is a ketone, B would be a cyanohydrin. So the product of A + HCN is a secondary alcohol with a cyanide group attached. Wait, no, wait. Wait, when a carbonyl reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. So for example, if A is a ketone R2CO, reacting with HCN would give R2C(OH)CN. But wait, HCN adds across the carbonyl, so the product B would have an alcohol and a nitrile group. Alternatively, maybe it's an addition to an aldehyde? Hmm, but let's think about the next step.

2. B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Pd with H2 is a catalyst for hydrogenation. So if B has a nitrile group, hydrogenation would reduce it. Nitriles (RCN) upon hydrogenation (like with H2 and Pd) typically get reduced to amines (RCH2NH2?), wait no, I think nitrile hydrogenation can go all the way to amines, but under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond in the nitrile. Let me think. Nitriles (RCN) reacting with H2 in presence of a catalyst like Pd typically get reduced to primary amines (RCH2NH2), but wait, that's with excess H2 and more vigorous conditions. Alternatively, maybe only the nitrile is hydrogenated to an amine, but perhaps in another way.

Wait, but another thought: if B is a cyanohydrin (from A being a ketone), then B is R2C(OH)CN. Then when you hydrogenate that with H2 and Pd, what happens? The nitrile group (CN) would be reduced. Nitriles can be hydrogenated to amines. So R2C(OH)CN â†’ upon hydrogenation becomes R2CH(OH)CH2NH2? Or perhaps the OH group is also involved. Or wait, perhaps it's better to consider each functional group. The cyanide group (CN) becomes CH2NH
