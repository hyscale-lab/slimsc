Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology and genetic engineering. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure out what's going on.

The scenario is about creating a transgenic mouse model to study the GADD45G protein's role in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The person is trying to overexpress this protein by modifying its coding sequence. They added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. Then they used Lipofectamine to transfect the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. But when they tested the expression, they couldn't overexpress the protein as expected.

Looking at the possible reasons, they provided the plus strand sequence of their construct. The options are A to D, and I need to find which one is the issue.

First, I'll look at the given DNA sequence. Let me try to analyze the sequence for possible issues.

Starting from the beginning, the sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's TAC, which is Tyrosine. Wait, but the hemagglutinin tag is supposed to be at the N-terminus. Oh, wait, the sequence starts with ATG, so the coding starts from there. But the hemagglutinin is supposed to be added as a tag before the native protein. So the first few codons should be the HA tag.

Wait, but the question says the HA determinant is introduced. The HA tag is typically a peptide from the influenza hemagglutinin, like YPYDHHVYAP. The coding sequence for this would be something like TAC TAT CCA TAT GAT TTA TCC GCA... Wait, no, I'm not sure. But the point is, if the HA tag is added at the N-terminus, the start codon (ATG) should be followed by the HA coding sequence, then the GADD45G coding.

Looking at the given sequence, the first part after ATG is TAC, which is Tyrosine. So maybe that's part of the HA tag. Let me think: the HA tag is usually around 11 amino acids. Let me see the given sequence:

The start is ATG TAC C C AT A CGA TGT TCA C
