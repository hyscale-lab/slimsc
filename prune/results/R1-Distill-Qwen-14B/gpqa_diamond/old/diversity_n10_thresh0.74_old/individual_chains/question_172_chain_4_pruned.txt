Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my stellar atmospheres, but let me think this through.

The question says that in star 1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star 2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Right, the Boltzmann distribution relates the population of different energy levels in a system. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( - (E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Oh wait, wait—since the energy difference is given, I think E_i is higher than E_j because it's an excited state. So the ratio would be (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(ΔE)/(k*T) ), where ΔE is E_i - E_j.

But in this problem, the question is about the excitation, so I think we're comparing the populations of two energy levels. Let's say, for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the ground state.

But wait, the problem says the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. So maybe for each star, the ratio of excited to unexcited is twice that of the other? Or perhaps it's the excitation relative to each other. Hmm, I might have to clarify that.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited as in star_2. So maybe the ratio for star_1 is 2 times the ratio for star_2. Let me rephrase: for star_1, the number in the excited state is twice that of star_2 for the same energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the excitation is in terms of the fraction of atoms in that energy level. So for star_1, the fraction is twice that of star_2. Or maybe the number of excited atoms per atom is higher.

Wait, I think the correct interpretation is that the excitation level (the ratio of atoms in the higher energy state to the lower) is twice as much for star_1 as for star_2. So, (n1_upper / n1_lower) = 2 * (n2_upper / n
