Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and then it's reacted through a series of reagents. I need to determine the final product.

First, I'll look at the NMR data. The peaks are as follows:

- 9.72 ppm: triplet, 1H.
- 6.98 ppm: doublet, 2H.
- 6.51 ppm: doublet, 2H.
- 6.27 ppm: broad singlet, 2H.
- 3.66 ppm: doublet, 2H.

Hmm. Let's interpret these. The triplet at 9.72 ppm is probably an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes typically show up around 9-10 ppm, and a triplet suggests coupling with two neighboring protons, maybe in a conjugated system.

Looking at the aromatic protons: the doublet at 6.98 and 6.51 each for 2H. That often indicates a para-substituted benzene ring. For example, in a para-disubstituted ring, you have two doublets, each integrating to 2H, corresponding to the two sets of protons (like ortho and meta positions).

The 6.27 ppm peak is a broad singlet for 2H. Broad signals can be due to exchange, like -OH groups, but here it's 2H. Maybe it's a di-substituted aromatic ring where the protons are equivalent and not split much, or perhaps it's a conjugated diene or a vinyl group.

The 3.66 ppm doublet for 2H likely corresponds to a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2 group or something similar. Or perhaps it's part of a carbonyl group's adjacent structure.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has two para-substituted benzene rings, a carbonyl group, and an OCH2 group. Let me think about the molecular formula: C8H9NO. Let's break it down. 8 carbons, 9 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 1 oxygen.

Wait, the formula can be broken down as (C6H5) groups perhaps. Because each benzene ring is C6H5. So if there are two benzene rings, that's 12 carbons, but our molecule only has 8. So maybe each ring is substituted in a way that doesn't add all six carbons. Alternatively, maybe it's a single benzene ring with substituents.

Wait, let's think differently. The NMR suggests two aromatic regions. The 6.98 and 6.51 are each two H as doublets, so maybe each is a pair of equivalent protons on a benzene ring. Then, the 6.27 could be another pair, perhaps in a different position. Alternatively, maybe it's a
