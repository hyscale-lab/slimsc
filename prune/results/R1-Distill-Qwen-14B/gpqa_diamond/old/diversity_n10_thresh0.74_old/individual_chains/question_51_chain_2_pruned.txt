Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm, the question is about the net potential energy when a charge is placed near a grounded conducting sphere. Alright, let's see what I remember.

So, the setup is a charge q placed at a distance d from the center of a grounded conducting sphere with radius R. I need to find the potential energy of this system. The options are given, but I should probably work it out myself.

Wait, when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor will induce charges on its surface. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges can flow to the ground. Oh right, the induced charges are opposite to the charge q. But wait, I think the sphere gets an induced charge of -q, but actually, no, because when you bring a charge near a conductor, the conductor's free charges redistribute. But since it's grounded, the conductor's potential is zero, so any excess charge would go to the ground.

Wait, no. The sphere is a conductor, so the charges will be on its surface. When you place a charge q outside, the sphere's induced charges will arrange themselves so that the potential on the sphere's surface is the same everywhere. But the sphere is grounded, so its potential is zero (same as the ground). Hmm.

Wait, the potential at any point on a conductor's surface is the same. So, the presence of the external charge q will cause the sphere to have induced charges. Since the sphere is neutral to begin with, placing the charge q nearby will induce an opposite charge on the sphereâ€”the inner surface. But because it's grounded, any
