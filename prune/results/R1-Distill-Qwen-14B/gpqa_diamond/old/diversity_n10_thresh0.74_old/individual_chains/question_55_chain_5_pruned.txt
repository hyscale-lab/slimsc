Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are all different types of propenyl or butenyl acetates, either cis or trans.

Let me start by recalling what these structures look like. Acetates are esters where the acid part is acetic acid. So, for propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. Propenyl groups are CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is the propenyl group attached to the oxygen of the ester?

Wait, no, the structure of an ester is R-O-CO-R', where R and R' are alkyl or aryl groups. So for propenyl acetate, the R would be propenyl (CH2CH2CH2? No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-). So propenyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- attached to the oxygen. So the full structure would be CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No, that can't be. Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as the R group in the ester.

So the structure is CH3COO-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. If it's propenyl, which is CH2=CHCH2-, then the ester is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? Hmm, wait a second. No, the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond, so maybe it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond. Oh wait, no. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester is CH3CO-O-
