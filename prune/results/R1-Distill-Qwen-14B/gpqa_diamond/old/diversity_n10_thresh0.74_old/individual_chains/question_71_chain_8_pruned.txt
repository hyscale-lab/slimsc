Okay, so I have this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember equilibrium temperature is related to how much energy a planet absorbs from its star. The formula is something like T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), where a is the orbital distance. Oh wait, but wait, I think the formula can be simplified when comparing planets around the same star, because the star's luminosity and other constants would cancel out.

Right, the key here is that the equilibrium temperature depends on the square root of the inverse of the orbital period (or distance), but wait, no, no. Wait, no, the distance a is in the denominator inside the square root. Because the flux from the star decreases with the square of the distance. So the equilibrium temperature equation is T = T_eff * ( (1 - abedo)^(1/4) ) * ( L / (16πσ a²) )^(1/4) ). But when all the planets are around the same star, and albedo is the same, the formula simplifies for the ratio of their temperatures.

Since they're all around the same star, L is the same for all. So the ratio of their temperatures would be sqrt( (1 - a)^(1/4) ) times sqrt( a_i^(−0.5) ) for each planet i. Wait, let me think again. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (1 - a)
