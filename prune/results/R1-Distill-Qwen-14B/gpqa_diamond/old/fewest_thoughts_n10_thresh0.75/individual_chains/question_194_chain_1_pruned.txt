Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). Each state has its own energy E, so I need to find all possible energies and how many states correspond to each energy.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so there are 2^3 = 8 possible states for the three spins. I need to evaluate the energy for each of these states.

Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all eight states. Let me think about the structure of the energy. The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So, E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

So E = -J * S. Therefore, for each state, I need to compute S and then find exp(β J S), because E is -J S, so -β E = β J S.

Wait, no: Let me correct that. Because E = -J S, so β E is -β J S. Therefore, the exponential in the partition function is exp( -β E ) = exp( β J S ). So each term in the partition function is exp(β J S), where S depends on the state.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(β J S). But wait, no: The partition function is the sum of exp( -β E ), which is exp( -β (-J S) ) = exp( β J S ). So yes, each term is exp(β J S), where S is the sum for that state.

So the approach is to find all possible values of S and how many states have each S. Then Z would be the sum over each possible S multiplied by the number of states with that S, each multiplied by exp(β J S).

So now, I need to find all possible values of S and
