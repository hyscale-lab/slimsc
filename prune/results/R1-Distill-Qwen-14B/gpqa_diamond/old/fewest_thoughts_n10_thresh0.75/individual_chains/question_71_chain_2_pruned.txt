Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature has to do with the balance between the energy a planet absorbs and the energy it emits. So let me think about what I know.

The question says there are five exoplanets in a system, and they're in orbital resonance. Their orbital periods are in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, then Planet_2 is twice that, and so on. 

The question asks for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Both planets have the same albedo, so albedo won't affect the ratio, which is good because I don't have to worry about that factor.

I remember the formula for equilibrium temperature. The basic idea is that a planet absorbs energy from its star and radiates it as thermal emission. The equilibrium temperature (T) depends on the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula is something like T = T_earth * (L / L_sun) ^ (1/4) * (d / distance_earth) ^ (-0.5). Wait, but since all these planets are in the same system, the star's luminosity (L) and the distance scaling will factor in.

Wait, actually, when comparing two planets in the same system, the T ratio depends on the square root of their orbital distances. Because the equilibrium temperature formula is T proportional to (L)^0.25 * (d)^-0.5. But if the planets are around the same star, L is the same for both. So the ratio T4/T2 would be sqrt(d2/d4), because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d). Wait, no, wait: T is proportional to (1/d)^0.5. So if planet A is closer than planet B, A is hotter. So the ratio of their temperatures would be sqrt(dB / dA), right?

But wait, how do I get the distances from the periods? Because they're in orbital resonance and have circular orbits, Kepler's third law applies. Kepler's law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from star). So (P^2) ∝ (d^3). So d ∝ P^(2/3).

So the distance of each planet is proportional to (period
