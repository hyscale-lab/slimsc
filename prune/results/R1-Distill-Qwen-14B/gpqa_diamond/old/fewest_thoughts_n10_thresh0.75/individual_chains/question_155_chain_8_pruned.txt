Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

The question is about finding the uncertainty of P_z, which is ΔP_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so I guess that means the basis is aligned with the z-axis.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). Since we're looking for ΔP_z, I need to compute ⟨P_z²⟩ and ⟨P_z⟩. But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So I might have to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared with respect to this state.

Wait, but the state is given, so maybe I can compute ⟨P_z⟩ directly. Let me think about how to compute the expectation value of P_z in this state. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is the bra vector multiplied by P_z matrix multiplied by the ket vector. Similarly, ⟨P_z²⟩ would be the same but with P_z squared.

But wait, P_z is already a diagonal matrix, right? Let me look at P_z's matrix again. The matrix for P_z is:

Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So the diagonal entries are ħ, 0, -ħ. And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so each basis vector corresponds to a specific z-component of angular momentum.

The state vector given is a column vector (let me denote it as |ψ⟩):

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2 ]
        [ 1/√2 ]
        [ -1/2 ]

I can compute ⟨P_z⟩ by taking the conjugate transpose of |ψ⟩, multiplying by P_z, then multiplying by |ψ⟩. Let's do that.

First, let's write out the components. Let me denote
