Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and some mutations caused by EMS. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the question says there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. They used EMS to mutate it and found changes in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, meaning the gene product (probably a protein) won't be made anymore.

First, I remember that EMS (ethyl methanesulfonate) is a mutagen that primarily causes point mutations, usually substitutions. These can lead to missense mutations (changing an amino acid) or nonsense (stop codons). Also, sometimes frameshifts? Wait, no, EMS doesn't typically cause frameshifts because it's a base analog that mainly causes point mutations, not insertions or deletions. So the mutations here are likely point mutations.

Looking at the sequences:

The intact gene starts with ATG (the start codon). The target gene's first part is shown, and each mutant has a change in the beginning of the sequence, specifically in the first exon.

So, the task is to find which mutation would likely disrupt the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a critical amino acid change.

Let's look at each mutant:

Mutant 1:
Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Wait, looking at the sequences, positions where they differ. Let's compare.

Original: ...TTCTCGCTGGTACT... 
Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, maybe I should compare the DNA sequences. Let's see:

Original Exon 1: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT

Mutant 1's Exon 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC

Wait, let me parse the differences. Looking at the first part:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it down letter by letter.

Original: Let's see the first part as:

5'-ATG TTT CTC GCG TGG TAC T... (exon 1)

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC T...

Hmm, so in the original, the sequence is CTCGCG. In mutant 1, it's CTACGC.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look at the differences.

Original: ...CTCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1: ...CTACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, I'm seeing that in the original, after ATGTTT, it's CTCGCGTGGTACT...

In Mutant 1, it's CTACGC. Wait, perhaps it's a substitution at the third position in CTCGCG, making it CTACGC.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the DNA level for each mutation.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for a nonsense mutation, which would introduce a stop codon (TGA, TAG, TAA) early in the sequence. If the mutation introduces a stop codon in the reading frame, the protein would be shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: the sequence starts with ATG (start) and then continues. Let's look for any TGA in the middle.

Wait
