Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in such a well, the particles have quantized energy levels. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles, so I think Pauli exclusion principle applies here because they're fermions.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem tells me that E is defined as pi² ħ²/(2mL²), so each particle's energy would be E multiplied by n squared. So E_n = n² E.

But wait, the particles are identical spin-1/2, so their total wavefunction has to be antisymmetric. Since they're in a 1D box, spatial and spin parts. So for each state, the spin part can be either symmetric or antisymmetric. But I think for four particles, each with spin 1/2, the spin state can be a combination of singlet and triplet states, but I'm not entirely sure how that affects the spatial part.

Wait, but maybe I should start by considering the ground state. For four fermions, the lowest energy state would be the one where they occupy the lowest possible energy levels with the correct spin states.

Each particle has two possible spin states: spin-up and spin-down. So for each spatial state, the spin can be paired.

In a 1D box, spatial wavefunctions are symmetric when particles are in the same state. Since the total wavefunction is antisymmetric, if the
