Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. I'm a bit rusty on immunology, but let's break it down step by step.

The question says that GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus were given to mice via oral gavage. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw some fluorescence destroyed by stomach acid or entangled in intestinal mucus. But then they found fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain genes, there was high variability. Hmm.

So, what's happening here? Let me think. Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. So when the rotavirus proteins are delivered orally, they probably get taken up by these patches.

The GFP is on the inner capsid proteins, which suggests that these proteins are the antigens. So, after they're ingested, the immune system should recognize them as foreign, leading to an immune response. The fact that some were destroyed by stomach acid or stuck in mucus means not all of them made it, but some did reach the Peyer patches.

The next part is that they isolated the proliferating cell population from these patches. Proliferating cells in lymphoid tissues are likely B cells that are activated. When B cells are activated, they start dividing, so that makes sense.

Now, when they look at the variable heavy chain genes of these B cells, there's high variability. High variability among the variable regions usually points to some process that diversifies the antibody repertoire. I remember that during B cell development, there's a process called VDJ recombination, which happens early on in the bone marrow to create diverse B cell receptors. But that's during the initial stages, when the B cells are being made.

Then there's somatic hypermutation, which occurs after B cells are activated. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the variable region of the B cell receptor, increasing the diversity of the antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, where B cells proliferate and mutate their receptors to improve binding to antigens.

Wait, but the question is about the process happening when they have already isolated the cells and see high variability in the variable heavy chain. If it's after the cells have been activated and are proliferating, that's probably after they've already undergone some diversification.

So, the options are A) somatic hypermutation, B) complement activation, C) class switching, D) VDJ recombination.

VDJ recombination happens during the generation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow. So if these cells are in the Peyer patches and have already been activated, they might have already gone through VDJ. But the high variability in the variable chains after activation suggests that they're undergoing further diversification, which is somatic hypermutation.

Class switching is about changing the isotype of the antibody, like from IgM to IgG, but that doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, not directly about the genes of the B cells.

So, the process here must be somatic hypermutation. The B cells in the germinal centers undergo this process to further diversify their antibodies after initial antigen recognition. That would explain the high variability in the variable heavy chain genes they observed.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and delivering them to mice via oral gavage. The GFP-tagged proteins are observed to reach the Peyer patches, which are specialized lymphoid tissues in the gut. These patches are responsible for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen and initiating immune responses. The isolated proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches likely consists of activated B cells, as B cells proliferate in response to antigen recognition.

The sequencing of the variable heavy chain genes from these cells reveals high variability. This variability is characteristic of processes that diversify the antibody repertoire. VDJ recombination occurs early in B cell development in the bone marrow to create diverse B cell receptors, but this process has already occurred by the time the B cells reach the Peyer patches. Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, is a process that introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptor after activation, further diversifying the antibody repertoire. This process occurs in germinal centers, where activated B cells proliferate and mutate their receptors to improve antigen binding. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes is consistent with ongoing somatic hypermutation.

Other options, such as complement activation and class switching recombination, do not directly explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes. Complement activation involves the complement system targeting pathogens, while class switching recombination changes the antibody isotype (e.g., from IgM to IgG) without affecting the variability of the variable regions.

Thus, the process taking place is somatic hypermutation.
