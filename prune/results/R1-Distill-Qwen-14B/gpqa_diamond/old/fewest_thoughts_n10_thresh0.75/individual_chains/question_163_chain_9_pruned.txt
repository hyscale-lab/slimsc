Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that when a hydroxide is dissolved in an acid, a neutralization reaction occurs. 

The problem states that we have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 and a total volume of 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to dissolve it and determine the pH of the resulting solution.

First, I think I should figure out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. To do that, I need the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(1 + 16) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. 

So, moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me calculate that more precisely. Wait, 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009356 moles. 

Now, when Fe(OH)3 reacts with a strong acid, like HCl, the reaction should be something like:
Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O. 

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions. Since the acid is monobasic, each mole provides one mole of H+. Therefore, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, we need 3 moles of the acid.

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 * 0.0009356 ≈ 0.002807 mol. 

The acid is 0.1 M, so the volume required is moles / concentration. So volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options don't have exactly 28.07, but option C is 28.05 cm³. That's very close, so maybe that's the volume needed. 

Wait, but the question says the total volume is 100 cm³. Does that affect the calculation? Oh, no, because the volume of acid is part of the total solution volume. So when I add the acid volume to the initial solution (but wait, the initial solution is 100 cm³—does that include the acid? Or is it the total after adding acid? Hmm, perhaps the way I calculated already accounts for the acid's volume being part of the total. So perhaps I'm correct.)

Next, I need to find the pH of the resulting solution. After the reaction, the solution will contain Fe³+ ions. The solution will be acidic because Fe³+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water.

The reaction for the hydrolysis of Fe³+ is:
Fe³+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ 

The concentration of Fe³+ will determine the [H+] in the solution. So first, I need to find the concentration of Fe³+.

The total volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration is moles / volume in liters. Moles of Fe³+ are the same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.0009356 mol.

Concentration (C) = 0.0009356 mol / 0.1 L = 0.009356 M, approximately 9.356e-3 M.

Wait, no, wait: 0.0009356 mol divided by 0.1 L is 0.009356 M. So [Fe³+] = 0.009356 M.

Now, to find the pH, I need the hydrolysis constant for Fe³+. I think Fe³+ is a weak acid, so I might need to use the hydrolysis equation and the K value. Let me recall: for Fe³+ in water, the hydrolysis reaction produces
