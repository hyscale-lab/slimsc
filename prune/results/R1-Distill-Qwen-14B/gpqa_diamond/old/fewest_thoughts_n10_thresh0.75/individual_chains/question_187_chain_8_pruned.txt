Okay, so I have this question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and which stars it can detect. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It says a star is detectable if the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So, ESPRESSO is used with an 8m VLT telescope, and I have to figure out how many of the listed stars meet this condition.

I remember that the S/N ratio depends on several factors: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), the exposure time, the telescope's collecting area, the spectrograph's efficiency, and the noise sources like background. But I'm not too sure about the exact formula. Wait, the formula I think relates S/N with magnitude.

So, the key here is to calculate whether each star's apparent magnitude is bright enough to achieve S/N >=10 in 1 hour with ESPRESSO.

I need to find the apparent magnitude (m) of each star because only that tells us how bright it appears from Earth. Absolute magnitude (M) is given, but that's how bright it would appear at 10 parsecs. So, using the distance modulus, m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where d is distance in parsecs.

Wait, actually, the distance modulus is m - M = 5 log10(d) - 5, so m = M + 5 log10(d) -5 +5? Wait, no, let me get that right. The formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5 log10(d) -5.

Alright, so for each star, I'll compute m.

The stars are options a to f, but let me list them again:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with RA=0, DEC=0, Mv=15, d=10pc
d) Same RA, DEC, Mv=15, d=200pc
e) Same, Mv=15, d=5pc
f) Same, Mv=15, d=50pc

Wait, so options a and b are real stars, and others are based on absolute magnitude and distance.

So first, let me get the apparent magnitudes for each.

Canopus is a very bright star. I think it's about magnitude -0.7 or so. Wait, I think Canopus is the second brightest star, maybe around -0.7 magnitude. Polaris is a bit dimmer, but I'm not sure. Polaris is the North Star, right? I believe it's around magnitude 2, but I'm not certain. Let me think: Sirius is about -1.46, Canopus is next, maybe around -0.7, and Polaris is about 2.0.

Wait, alternatively, I can look up these magnitudes. Well, in a real test, I can't, but for this, I'll go with what I remember.

So,

a) Canopus: m ≈ -0.7

b) Polaris: m ≈ 2.0

c) Mv=15, d=10pc. So m = 15 + 5log10(10) -5. log10(10)=1. So m = 15 +5(1) -5 =15.

Wait, 5 log10(10) is 5 *1 =5. So 15 +5 -5 =15. So m=15.

d) d=200 pc. m=15 +5 log10(200) -5. Log10(200)=2.3010. 5 *2.3010=11.505. So 15 +11.505 -5=21.505.

e) d=5 pc. m=15 +5 log10(5) -5. Log10(5)=0.69897. 5 *0.69897≈3.495. 15 +3.495 -5=13.495.

f) d=50 pc. m=15 +5 log10(50) -5. Log10(50)=1.69897. 5 *1.69897≈8.4949. So m=15+8.4949 -5=18.4949.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) ~ -0.7

b) ~2.0

c) 15

d) ~21.5

e) ~13.5

f) ~18.5

Now, the next part is to figure out which of these stars have S/N >=10.

I remember that the S/N for a star in a spectrograph depends on the star's flux, exposure time, and other factors. The ESPRESSO spectrograph is high-resolution, but for S/N, the formula is often S/N ~ sqrt(N), where N is the number of detected photons.

But wait, more accurately, the S/N per pixel is proportional to the square root of the number of photons collected. The number of photons depends on the star's brightness (flux), the telescope area, exposure time, and the efficiency of the instrument.

The formula for S/N can
