Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of parameters like coupling constants is important because it tells us about the renormalizability of the theory. Let me try to think through this.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], right? So that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, which I think for electromagnetism is like ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ. But wait, this could be a non-abelian gauge theory? Or maybe just QED? Not sure yet.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember, in 4-dimensional spacetime, the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ℏ = c = 1), and the integral is over d^4x which has dimension -4. So each term in the Lagrangian must have dimension 4.

Let me break down each part of the term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

The fields involved are ψ, which is a spinor, and F^{μν}, which is a field strength tensor. Let's consider the dimension of each field.

In 4D, the spinor field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (∫γ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ =0, so ψ must have dimension 3/2. Similarly, the adjoint ψ̄ has the same dimension, right?

What about F^{μν}? F is like ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each A is a gauge field. In QED, A is a vector potential, so its dimension is 1. Because the field strength F would be derivatives of A, so each derivative adds one dimension. So F has dimension 2 (since ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1, so ∂A has dimension 2).

Now, looking at the term σ_{μν}. The σ is made from commutators of gamma matrices. Since gamma matrices are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the commutator [γ_μ, γ_ν] is also dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

Putting it all together: the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ (dimension 3/2) times σ (dimension 0) times ψ (dimension 3/2) times F (dimension 2).

Wait, so let me calculate the dimension of the product ψ̄ σ ψ F. That would be (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) + 2 = 3/2 + 3/2 is 3, plus 2 makes 5. So the entire
