Okay, I'm trying to figure out this NMR problem. So, the question says that there's a mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think about the degrees of unsaturation. Each degree is either a double bond or a ring. For C10H14: the formula is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X and N are zero. So (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2 = 8/2 =4. So four degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (3) and one double bond (but wait, benzene has three double bonds, so maybe just the ring and a methyl group doesn't add anything. Wait, no, the ring itself is three degrees (from three double bonds). Wait, no. Wait, one ring is one degree, each double bond is another. So benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds, which is three degrees, and the ring is one. Wait, no, wait. Actually, each ring or double bond is one degree. So benzene contributes 4 degrees because it's a ring (1) and three double bonds (3), but that's not right. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three double bonds. But each ring counts as one, each double bond as one. So benzene is one ring (1) plus three double bonds (3), making four degrees of unsaturation. So that makes sense because our compound has four degrees. So each compound is a mono-substituted or something else.

Wait, but the compounds given are all tetramethylbenzenes except for option D which has diethyl. So the molecular formula of each compound: Let's see. Benzene is C6H6. Each methyl is CH3, so adding four methyl groups: C6 +4C = C10, H:6 - 2*4 (because each substitution takes away a H and adds CH3) so 6 -8 = -2? Wait, no. Let me compute: Benzene has 6 H. Each substitution (for a methyl group) replaces one H with a CH3. So each substitution adds two H (since CH3 has 3 H, but we lose one H from the ring: 3-1=2 added). So four substitutions would add 4*2=8 H. So total H would be 6 +8=14. So the molecular formula is C10H14, which matches the question. So each of the four options (except D) is C10H14, but let's check option D: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Benzene is C6H6, each ethyl is C2H5, so two ethyls would be C4H10. So total C6+4= C10, H:6 +10 (from two ethyl groups) = 16. But the molecular formula in the question is C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have C10H14? Wait, no. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl group is C2H5. So two ethyl groups would add 2*2=4 C, and 2*(5) =10 H. So benzene plus 2 ethyl: C=6+4=10, H=6 +10 =16. But the problem states each compound is C10H14. So 1,4-diethylbenzene is C10H14? Wait, no, because 6 + (2*2)=10 C, and H is 6 + (2*5) =16 H. So the molecular formula would be C10H1
