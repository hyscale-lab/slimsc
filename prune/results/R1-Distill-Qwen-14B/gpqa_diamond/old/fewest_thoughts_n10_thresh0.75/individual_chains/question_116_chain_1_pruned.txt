Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR and reactions can get tricky. But let's take it step by step.

So the question is about identifying compound D based on a series of reactions. Let me try to outline what's happening.

First, compound A has two signals in the proton NMR. One is a triplet at 0.9 ppm integrating for 6H, and another is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that triplet and quartet splitting often comes from neighboring protons. Let me think about common structures here.

Wait, a triplet for 6H and quartet for 4H. So maybe the 6H are from two equivalent CH3 groups adjacent to a CH2. Like maybe a di-substituted something. For example, if we have a structure like (CH2CH3)2 something. Because each CH2CH3 has two Hs on the CH2, but wait no, wait: each CH2CH3 has 2 H on the CH2, but in a triplet, that would come from coupling with a CH2 group next to it. Or wait, maybe the triplet is from two neighboring CH2 groups.

Wait, the triplet at 0.9 ppm suggests that these are likely CH3 groups attached to something that has two neighboring Hs. Like, maybe they are adjacent to a CH2 group. Because if a CH3 is next to a CH2, each H on the CH3 would have coupling with two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So the triplet makes sense for the CH3.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each of these Hs is next to a group with three Hs. So 3 neighboring Hs. Wait, 4H in quartet. So maybe they are two equivalent CH2 groups. Like, each CH2 is next to a CH3, but wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps a CH2CH2 group where each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2. Wait, but each of those would be a quartet in their own chemical shift.

Wait, maybe the structure is neopentyl? No, wait, neopentyl is (CH3)C-CH2CH2- something. Wait, perhaps it's a di-substituted ethyl group or a gem-dimethyl group.

Wait, let me think about the possible
