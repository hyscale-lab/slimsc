Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong monobasic acid. I need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M acid required and the pH of the resulting solution.

First, let me understand the problem. I have 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3. I need to dissolve it in 100 cm³ of solution. The acid used is a strong monobasic acid, which I assume is like HCl or HNO3, something where one H+ is released and it's a strong acid so it dissociates completely.

The question is asking for two things: the minimum volume of the acid needed, and the pH of the solution after dissolving. The options are given, so I'll need to calculate both to match the options.

I think the first step is to calculate how much Fe(OH)3 I have in moles. Molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 has a formula mass of 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams divided by 106.85 g/mol gives me moles. Let me calculate that. 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Hmm, that's 9.36 × 10^-4 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Fe(OH)3 is a weak base. When it dissolves in a strong acid, it should react. The reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

Wait, because Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups, so it would require three H+ ions to neutralize each OH-.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

From the moles of Fe(OH)3, I can find the moles of H+ needed.

Moles of H+ = 3 × moles of Fe(OH)3 = 3 × 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

But wait, no. Let me think again. The acid is monobasic, so each mole gives one H+. So the acid is HX where X is the anion. So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3HX → Fe^3+ + 3X^- + 3H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HX.

So the moles of acid needed would be 3 × 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

Now, the acid solution is 0.1 M. So to find the volume (in liters) needed, I can use Molarity = moles / volume (L). So volume = moles / Molarity.

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum volume. Hmm, but wait, I'm assuming that the Fe(OH)3 is fully dissolved. But in reality, perhaps I need to account for the excess acid beyond stoichiometric. Because maybe some H+ is needed to bring the pH down enough to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3. Or, wait, no: the stoichiometric amount is the minimum needed to
