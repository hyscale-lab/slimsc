Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says we have two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but their orbital periods are different. Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So if Planet_2 has a period of P, Planet_1 has P/3. Also, both have circular orbits.

The host stars are interesting. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star, but both stars have the same radius. Wait, because the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved but same radiusâ€”so same size but different masses.

I need to figure out which planet has a higher probability of transiting. The probability of transit depends on the planet's orbital distance relative to the star's size. The formula I recall is P = (R_star) / (a * (1 + sqrt(m_planet/m_star))) ), but wait, no, that's the probability itself. Alternatively, the probability is proportional to the ratio (R_star / a) squared? Or maybe it's more like the area of the star compared to the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, no. The transit probability is given by (R_star + R_planet) / a, but since R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it can be approximated as R_star / a. But since the planets are Earth-like, maybe R_planet is similar but for the calculation, it can be ignored. So the probability is roughly proportional to (R_star / a), because for a circular orbit, the probability is (R*/a) multiplied by some factor.

Wait, another angle. The probability that the planet's orbit is aligned edge-on enough for us to see a transit is approximately (R_star / a), where a is the semi-major axis. Since the planets are Earth-like
