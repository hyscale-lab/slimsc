Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric potential energy. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. There are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each charge is 2 times that. Oh, and they're all in an isolated system, so energy considerations should apply.

The setup is that 12 of them are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at P. So, I think point P is where the 13th charge is located, and the other 12 are all at 2 meters away from P.

The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system. Oh, right, in terms of electric potential energy. Because the system is isolated, the potential energy would be the work done to assemble all these charges, I suppose.

Wait, but how do I approach this? I remember that the electric potential energy of a system of point charges is the work required to bring each charge from infinity to their positions, considering the potential created by all the previous charges.

So, for each charge, I have to calculate the potential energy added when bringing it to its position. But since all the other 12 charges are fixed at 2 meters from P, except the 13th which is at P, I need to think about how each charge's potential energy contributes.

Wait, the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, it's like the first charge is at P, and then the other 12 are placed at 2 meters away from P. But wait, the system is made of 13 charges. So, one is at P, and 12 are at 2m from P, but wait, each of the 12 is 2m from P so the distance between any two of the 12 is not given. Hmm, but maybe I can model the 12 as being at a fixed distance from the central charge.

Wait, but to find the potential energy of the system, I need to compute the potential energy between each pair of charges. Because the system's potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair. So maybe I should calculate each pair.

So, the potential energy U between two point charges is given by Coulomb's law: U = (k * q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coul
