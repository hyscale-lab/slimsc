Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and SCN- is 0.1 M. The stability constants (beta) for the complexes are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They’re asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, dithiocyanato means two SCN- ligands. So, the complex in question is [Co(SCN)_2]^{n+}, but which charge? Cobalt II is +2, each SCN is -, so for two SCN, it's [Co(SCN)_2]^0? No, wait. No, wait, because the formula for a complex is [Co(SCN)_n]^{charge}. For Co^2+ and two SCN^- (each -1), the charge would be 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. So the complex is neutral. But the stability constants are given for the formation of complexes, so each β represents the formation step.

The stability constants are β1, β2, β3, β4. I think that βn is the formation constant for the complex with n SCN- ligands. So:

β1 is for [Co(SCN)]
