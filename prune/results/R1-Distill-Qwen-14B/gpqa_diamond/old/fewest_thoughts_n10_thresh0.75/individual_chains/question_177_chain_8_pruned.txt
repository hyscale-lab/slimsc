Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again and break it down.

The problem says there are two stars, Star 1 and Star 2. Star 1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star 2, and the same goes for their masses. But when they looked at the wavelengths where the stars appear brightest, both were the same. Oh wait, that's about black body radiation, right? The peak wavelength depends on the temperature. So if their peak wavelengths are the same, their temperatures must be the same because the peak wavelength of a black body is inversely proportional to its temperature (Wien's Law). So T1 = T2. That makes sense.

Then, they found the radial velocities. Star 1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us. Star 2 is moving at 700 km/s. Hmm, radial velocity affects the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Oh wait, but the question is about luminosity, which is intrinsic brightness, right? So the Doppler shift would affect the observed brightness and the wavelength we see, but for calculating luminosity, which is the intrinsic property, the actual temperature and radius are what matter. So perhaps the radial velocity doesn't directly affect the calculation of luminosity because luminosity is about the star's actual output, not the observed. Or wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think: Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, so it's the same regardless of how fast the star is moving. Because even if a star is moving towards us, it's just brighter in observed terms due to blueshift, but its actual luminosity is determined by its size and temperature.

Wait, but the question says, "they computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than the luminosity of Star_2 by a factor of..." So maybe the radial velocity affects the observed brightness, but perhaps the question is talking about the actual luminosity, so they've factored that in. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me focus on the key factors for luminosity.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: L = 4π R² σ T⁴. So L is proportional to R squared times temperature
