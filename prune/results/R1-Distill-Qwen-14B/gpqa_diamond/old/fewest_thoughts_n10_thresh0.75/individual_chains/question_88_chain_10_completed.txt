Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about rotavirus and the immune response. Let me read it carefully.

So the experiment is about tagging inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and feeding them to mice. Then they observed that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching the secondary lymphoid organs. They identified fluorescent Peyer's patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced their variable heavy chain genes, they found high variability. The question is which process is happening.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer's patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), and they play a role in mucosal immunity. They're specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen.

So the GFP-tagged proteins were probably ingested by the mice. Some were destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because the stomach has a low pH. But some made it through, got into the intestines, and got into the Peyer's patches. The cells in the Peyer's patches that are proliferating probably are B cells that have encountered the antigen.

Wait, when B cells are activated by an antigen, they undergo several processes. The variable regions of their antibodies are highly variable, which is due to the process of VDJ recombination during B cell development in the bone marrow. But wait, that's during the initial stages of B cell development. Or is this about something else?

Oh wait, the question mentions that the variable heavy chain genes show high variability. High variability in the variable regions usually comes from processes that diversify the B cell receptors. Somatic hypermutation is one such process. It introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors after the cells are activated. This increases the diversity and affinity of the antibodies.

So when the B cells are activated upon encountering the antigen, they undergo somatic hypermutation. This process happens in the germinal centers of the lymphoid tissues, like the Peyer's patches. Germinal centers are sites where B cells proliferate and undergo this hypermutation, leading to a diverse population of antibodies. That's why the variable heavy chain genes have high variability—they’ve undergone hypermutation.

Wait, but VDJ recombination is the process that happens during the formation of the B cell receptor in the bone marrow, during the maturation of B cells. It's part of generating the initial diversity of the variable region by recombining V, D, and J segments. But in this case, the B cells are already mature and have their receptors; so the high variability after that is due to somatic hypermutation.

So the process here is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.

Another option is class switching recombination (option C), which changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. Complement activation (B) is about the complement system, which might be involved in processing the antigen but not the variability in the genes. VDJ (D) is the initial recombination, but that's not happening here in the Peyer's patches after antigen exposure.

So the answer should be A) somatic hypermutation.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and feeding them to mice. Some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reached the Peyer's patches, where they were taken up by proliferating cells. Sequencing the variable heavy chain genes of these cells revealed high variability. 

Peyer's patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the gut that play a key role in mucosal immunity. When B cells encounter an antigen in these patches, they become activated and proliferate in germinal centers. During this proliferation, the variable regions of the B cell receptors undergo somatic hypermutation. This process introduces point mutations, increasing the diversity and specificity of the antibodies. The high variability observed in the variable heavy chain genes is consistent with this mechanism.

Other processes, such as VDJ recombination (option D), occur during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establish the initial diversity of the variable regions. However, this question focuses on the variability observed after antigen exposure, which is due to somatic hypermutation rather than VDJ recombination. Class switching recombination (option C) changes the class of antibody but does not directly increase variability in the variable regions. Complement activation (option B) is unrelated to the observed variability in the variable heavy chain genes.

Thus, the process taking place is **somatic hypermutation**.

Answer: A
