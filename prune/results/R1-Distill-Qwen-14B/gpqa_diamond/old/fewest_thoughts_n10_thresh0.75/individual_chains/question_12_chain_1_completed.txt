Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question is about finding the kinetic energy (KE) of the product particles in a decay process. The reaction given is Pi(+) decaying into mu(+) plus a neutrino (nu). Pi(+) is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero.

Wait, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the products must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. Because the total initial momentum is zero, so the total momentum after decay must also be zero. That means the momentum of the muon and the neutrino should be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

But wait, neutrinos are tricky because they are leptons with very small mass, almost treated as massless in these kinds of calculations. So the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's. So maybe I can approximate the neutrino's mass as zero. That might simplify things.

The problem gives the rest masses: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV/c², and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV/c². The neutrino's mass is negligible, so I can probably ignore it. So, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, and the pion's is 139.6.

The first step is to find the energy released in the decay. This would be the difference between the rest energy of the pion and the sum of the rest energies of the decay products. But wait, the neutrino is a product too. Oh, right, but since its rest mass is negligible, maybe we can just subtract the muon's rest mass from the pion's.

So the Q value of the reaction (the total energy released) would be:

Q = m_pi c² - (m_mu c² + m_nu c²) ≈ m_pi c² - m_mu c².

Plugging in the numbers:

Q ≈ 139.6 MeV - 105.7 MeV = 33.9 MeV. So the total energy available is 33.9 MeV.

Wait, but wait a second. In decay processes, the Q value is the total kinetic energy of the products. Because the pion is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy. The muon and neutrino's total energy must sum up to the pion's rest energy, minus the binding energy (if any), but in this case, it's a decay, so the Q is the total kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Q value is the total energy available for the kinetic energies of the decay products. So, yes, Q = 33.9 MeV. So the sum of the KEs of the muon and neutrino is 33.9 MeV.

But because the neutrino's mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is approximately equal to its total energy. So the muon's kinetic energy would be the remaining part after subtracting the neutrino's.

But wait, the muon has a rest mass, so its energy is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy (since m=0, so E=pc).

So, let's denote the muon's kinetic energy as KE_mu and the neutrino's as KE_nu. Since the pion is at rest, the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = p_nu (magnitude-wise), but directions are opposite.

So let's model this. The total energy of the muon is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c². Wait, actually, the units are a bit confusing. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity, since all masses are given in MeV/c² and energies in MeV.

In units where c=1, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 + m_mu^2 ). Similarly, the neutrino's energy E_nu = p_nu, since m_nu ≈ 0.

Since p_mu = p_nu (because they are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to conserve momentum), let's denote p = p_mu = p_nu.

So the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = (sqrt(p² + m_mu²)) + p = m_pi.

Because the pion's rest energy is m_pi c², which in c=1 units is m_pi.

So,

sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So,

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6

Hmm, solving for p. Let me let x = p. Then equation is sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) + x = 139.6.

Let me subtract x from both sides:

sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2 ) = 139.6 - x.

Now square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So,

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

The x² terms cancel:

(105.7)^2 = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Calculate the squares:

105.7^2 = 11171.49 (because 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is about 32.49, and 2*100*5.7=1140, so (100+5.7)^2=100^2 + 2*100*5.7 +5.7^2= 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49. Hmm, rounding might be a bit off, but I'll proceed.)

139.6^2: Let me calculate that. 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140^2 - 2*140*0.4 + (0.4)^2 = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 x.

Rearranging,

279.2 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49

Calculate 19488.16 - 11172.49:

19488.16 - 11172.49 = let's do 19488 - 11172 = 8316, and 0.16 - 0.49 = -0.33. So 8316 -0.33=8315.67.

Wait, wait, no, 19488.16 minus 11172.49:

Take 19488.16 - 11172.49:

= (19488 - 11172) + (0.16 - 0.49)
= 8316 - 0.33
= 8315.67.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67

x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ let's compute that.

Compute 279.2 * 29.7 = ?

Wait, alternatively, let's compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 83.1567 / 2.792 ≈ ?

Hmm, 2.792 * 30 = 83.76. So 30 would give 83.76. But 83.1567 is a bit less than that. So maybe 29.8?

Let me compute 2.792 * 29.8:

2.792 * 30 = 83.76. Subtract 2.792 * 0.2 → 0.5584.

So 83.76 - 0.5584 = 83.2016.

But our numerator is 83.1567, which is a bit less than 83.2016.

So how much less? 83.2016 -83.1567= 0.0449.

So, 0.0449 / 2.792 ≈ approximately 0.016.

So x ≈ 29.8 - 0.016= 29.784.

Wait, but that's x, which is p. So p ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, I think I messed up units. Because when c=1, p is in MeV/c, but in this calculation, since we set c=1, p is in MeV/c. So, p is about 29.78 MeV/c.

So E_nu (neutrino's energy) is equal to p, which is 29.78 MeV.

E_mu is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ) → sqrt( (29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Calculating 29.78^2: approx 886.8.

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So E_mu = sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49 ) = sqrt(12059.29 ) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu is 109.81 MeV, and E_nu is 29.78 MeV.

But wait, the total energy is E_mu + E_nu = 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59 MeV, which matches m_pi (139.6 MeV), so that's correct.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass. So KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu → 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And KE_nu is E_nu → 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculation.

Wait, but let me check my approximation steps. Did I make any assumption that would affect the result? Oh, I approximated the neutrino's mass as zero, which is a correct approach because the neutrino's mass is negligible compared to the muon's. So the calculations should hold.

So the KEs are approximately 4.12 MeV for the muon and 29.8 MeV for the neutrino. So the answer should be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is initially at rest. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Step 1: Energy conservation
The total energy released in the decay, known as the \(Q\)-value, is the difference between the rest energy of the pion and the rest energy of the muon:

\[
Q = m_{\pi^+} c^2 - m_{\mu^+} c^2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
Q = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} - 105.7 \, \text{MeV} = 33.9 \, \text{MeV}
\]

This \(Q\)-value represents the total kinetic energy available for the muon and neutrino.

### Step 2: Momentum conservation
Since the pion is initially at rest, the total momentum of the decay products must be zero. Thus, the magnitudes of the momenta of the muon and neutrino are equal and opposite:

\[
p_{\mu^+} = p_\nu
\]

### Step 3: Energy of the muon and neutrino
The total energy of the muon is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
\]

The energy of the neutrino is equal to its momentum (since \(m_\nu \approx 0\)):

\[
E_\nu = p_\nu = p_{\mu^+}
\]

The total energy of the system is conserved:

\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu = m_{\pi^+}
\]

Substituting \(E_\nu = p_{\mu^+}\) and \(E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}\), we solve for \(p_{\mu^+}\):

\[
\sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p_{\mu^+} = m_{\pi^+}
\]

Let \(x = p_{\mu^+}\). Then:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} + x = 139.6
\]

Subtract \(x\) from both sides:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (105.7)^2} = 139.6 - x
\]

Square both sides:

\[
x^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2
\]

Expand the right-hand side:

\[
x^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2x + x^2
\]

Cancel \(x^2\) and rearrange:

\[
279.2x = 19488.16 - 11172.49
\]

\[
279.2x = 8315.67
\]

\[
x = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c
\]

Thus, \(p_{\mu^+} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\), and \(E_\nu = p_{\mu^+} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Step 4: Kinetic energy of the muon
The total energy of the muon is:

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p_{\mu^+}^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}
\]

Substitute \(p_{\mu^+} = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}/c\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\):

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}
\]

\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} \approx \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}
\]

The kinetic energy of the muon is:

\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 \approx 4.11 \, \text{MeV}
\]

### Step 5: Final result
The kinetic energy of the muon is approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\), and the kinetic energy of the neutrino is approximately \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\). Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**D) 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV**
