Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question gives me some phase shifts and asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, phase shifts... Oh right, I remember that in scattering theory, the partial wave expansion uses these phase shifts. The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by a sum over all these partial waves. The formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) * sum [ (u_l (k) ψ_l (θ)) ], where u_l is the phase shift and ψ_l depends on the Legendre polynomials maybe?

Wait, no, more precisely, the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (u_l + lπ) P_l(cosθ) ), right? Or wait, maybe it's (1/k) times something with u_l and the Legendre polynomials? I'm a little confused. I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ ( (u_l + lπ) P_l(cosθ) ), where u_l is the phase shift.

But wait, the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. The incident beam direction is θ = 0°, because that's where the particles are coming straight in. So cosθ is 1.

Now, the imaginary part comes from the imaginary component
