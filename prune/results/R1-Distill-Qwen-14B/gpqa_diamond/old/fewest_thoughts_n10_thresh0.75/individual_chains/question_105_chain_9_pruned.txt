Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read what the question is asking.

The problem is about a star similar to the Sun. So the star has the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The astronomers are observing this star, and because one hemisphere is spotted, when it rotates, the brightness as seen from Earth (the photometric time series) will vary periodically. This situation can look like an exoplanet causing the variation. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve if the star wasn't spotted?

Hmm. So the key here is to find the planet radius over the star radius (Rpl/Rstar) such that the dip in brightness (caused by the planet blocking the star) is the same as the dip caused by the spots.

First, I need to understand what's happening with the spots. When a star has spots, as it rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since the spots are cooler, when a spot is on the side facing us, the star appears slightly dimmer than when the spot is on the far side. The effect on the light curve is a periodic dip in brightness as the spots rotate into and out of view.

But wait, in this scenario, the star's brightness variation is due to spots, but the question says that the situation can resemble an exoplanet. So the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots is similar to what a planet would cause. So we need to calculate what planet size would cause the same dip.

So, I think the approach is to first calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, and then set that equal to the amplitude caused by a planet blocking part of the star, and solve for the planet's radius.

Let me think about each part.

First, the star's radius is Rstar = R_sun. Let me note down the parameters:

- Rstar = R_sun
- Filling factor (f) = 20% = 0.2
- T_eff of star (Tstar) = 6000 K
- Temperature of spots (Tspot) = Tstar - 1000 K = 5000 K
- The star is observed as it rotates, and the spots cover one hemisphere. Wait, no, the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So the spots occupy 20% of that hemisphere. So perhaps the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of a hemisphere.

Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered in spots. So when the spot hemisphere is facing us, the spots are covering 20% of the observed surface. But when the star rotates, that hemisphere comes into view and then goes away. So the variation in brightness would depend on the difference
