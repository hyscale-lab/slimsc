Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that when charges oscillate, they can radiate energy, right? The question is a bit tricky, but let me break it down.

The setup is an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it should radiate at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and I need to find two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, and the possible form of function f in terms of λ.

Wait, so I think the power radiated in different directions depends on the angle θ. For an oscillating dipole, the radiation pattern is typically a dipole pattern, which I think is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis of oscillation. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think: a dipole's radiation is strongest in the plane perpendicular to the dipole axis. So the dipole's radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees (θ is measured from the z-axis, which is the dipole's axis). So the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the oscillation axis.

So if the maximum power is A, that would occur at θ=90 degrees. But the question is asking what fraction of A is radiated at θ=30 degrees. Hmm.

I remember that the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula for the intensity. The intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (sinθ)^2, or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The radiation from a dipole is given by the dipole antenna pattern. So the intensity in the far field (radiation zone) for a dipole varies as (sinθ)^2. Or wait, maybe not. Wait, no, wait: the radiation pattern for a dipole is sin²θ, but the maximum is when θ=90 degrees, which would be the maximum point. So the intensity as a function of θ is proportional to sin²θ. So the maximum is at θ=90°, which is sin²(90°)=
