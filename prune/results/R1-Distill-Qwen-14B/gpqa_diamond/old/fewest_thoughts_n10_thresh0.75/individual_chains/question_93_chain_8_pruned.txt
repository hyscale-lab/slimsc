Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR and calibration curves. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on qPCR, but I'll think through it.

So, the scientist made a calibration curve using a positive control with known copy numbers. He diluted it serially and ran qPCR on three technical replicates each. The efficiency is 100%, which is perfect, right? Because qPCR efficiency ideally is around there. The RÂ² is 1, meaning a perfect fit, so the data should lie exactly on the line. The slope is -3.3. Wait, I thought the slope in qPCR is usually around -3.32 for a 100% efficient reaction. Oh, right, because the formula for the slope is ln(10) divided by efficiency, and with efficiency at 1, ln(10) is about 2.3026, wait no, wait. Let me think. Efficiency (E) is the fraction amplified each cycle, so when E is 1, each cycle doubles the product. The formula for the slope is ( -log10(E) ) * (1 / ln(2) ), or something like that. Oh, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, I remember that the slope of a standard qPCR curve is usually about -3.32 because each tenfold dilution corresponds to a change of about 3.3 cycles. So a slope of -3.3 makes sense because it's close to -3.32. So that's correct.

Now looking at the Ct values. For each concentration, there are three technical replicates. Let me look at the data:

At 100,000 copies, the Ct values are 33.9, 34.2, 34.5. The average is around 34.2, maybe.

At 10,000 copies: 30.6, 30.9, 31.2. Average about 30.9.

1000 copies: 27.3, 27.6, 27.9. Average 27.6.

100 copies: 24, 24.3, 24.6. Average 24.3.

10 copies: 20.7, 21, 21.3. Average 21.

So each tenfold dilution leads to a decrease in Ct by about 3.3. Because 33.9 minus 30.6 is roughly 3.3. Similarly, 30.6 to 27.3 is about 3.3. And so on. So each tenfold lower concentration is about 3.3 cycles higher Ct. That matches the slope of -3.3, which suggests that the data fits the expected curve.

But wait, the question is about the discrepancies in his results. So looking at the options:

Option A: qPCR can't quantify nucleic acids. No,
