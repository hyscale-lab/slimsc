Okay, so I've got this problem about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that the interplanar distance formula involves the lattice parameters and the Miller indices. 

Wait, the crystal is rhombohedral, right? So in a rhombohedral system, all the edges are of the same length, a, and all the angles between them are equal, here given as 30 degrees each. Oh right, so α = β = γ = 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, which I think refers to 'a', the lattice parameter. So a = 10 Å.

The formula for interplanar distance d_hkl in a crystal is given by 1/d² equals the sum of (h² + k² + l²) divided by (a²) multiplied by some factors involving the angles. But wait, in a cubic system, the formula is simpler, but rhombohedral is more complex. Oh right, in a general rhombohedral system, the formula is:

1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²) [1 + 2 cos α (cos β cos γ - (1/3)(cos α + cos β + cos γ)))] 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing that up. Alternatively, I think the formula can be represented using the unit cell volume. Another approach I remember is considering the structure factor and the reciprocal lattice. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for d is given by:

d_{hkl} = sqrt( (a² (h² + k² + l²) + 2a² (hk cos γ + hl cos β + kl cos α )) ) ) / ( (h + k + l)² )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach: In a rhombohedral system, the lattice is a special case where a = b = c, and α = β = γ, which is different from a cubic system. So the unit cell is called a rhombohedron.

The formula I think is based on the general formula for interplanar spacing.
