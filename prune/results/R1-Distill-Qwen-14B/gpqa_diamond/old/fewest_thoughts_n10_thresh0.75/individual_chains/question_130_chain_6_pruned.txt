Okay, so I've got this question about Lyman alpha absorption and redshift. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is around 1216 Angstrom. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Wait, but quasars emit a lot of UV light, right? So when this light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, it gets absorbed at that specific wavelength.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Oh wait, ground-based telescopes can't see UV because the atmosphere absorbs it. So, if the Lyman alpha absorption is in the UV, how can ground-based telescopes detect it?

Redshift comes into play here. When a quasar's light is redshifted because of the expansion of the universe, the wavelength stretches. The absorbed Lyman alpha line would then appear at a longer wavelength. So, if the absorption is at 1216 Angstrom in the quasar's frame, in our frame it would be 1216*(1+z), where z is the redshift.

But since we're using optical telescopes, the observed wavelength needs to be in the optical range. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nm, or 4000 to 7000 Angstrom. So the redshifted Ly
