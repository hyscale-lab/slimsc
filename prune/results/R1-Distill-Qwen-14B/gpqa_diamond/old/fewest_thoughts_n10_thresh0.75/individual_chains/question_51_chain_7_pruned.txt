Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about calculating the net potential energy when a charge q is placed a certain distance away from a grounded conducting sphere. Alright, I've learned a bit about electrostatics, so let me think.

First, the setup: there's a conducting sphere of radius R that's grounded. Then, a point charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of this sphere. I need to find the potential energy of this system.

Hmm, potential energy in electrostatics often involves the work done to bring charges together. But in this case, the conducting sphere is grounded, which means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge on it would go to the ground. Wait, but if the sphere is conducting, charges can move freely on its surface. So when I place charge q nearby, it'll induce charges on the sphere.

Right, when a charge is placed near a conductor, the conductor's free charges redistribute. Since the sphere is grounded, charges can flow in or out. For a conducting sphere, the induced charges will be such that the inner surface has an opposite charge to q, and the outer surface would have the same charge as q. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, no, for a conducting sphere, the induced charges are such that the inner surface has a charge opposite to q, and the outer surface has zero net charge if the sphere is neutral. But wait, in this case, the sphere is grounded, so I think any induced charges on the sphere would come from the ground.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify. A conducting sphere has charges that can move. When you place a charge q near it, the charges in the conductor will rearrange. The induced charges on the sphere will be such that the inner surface has charge -q (if q is positive), and the outer surface will have charge +q. But wait, no, that's if the sphere is uncharged. But in this case, the sphere is grounded. So the conductor can exchange charges with the Earth.

Wait, no, when a charge q is placed near a conducting sphere, the induced charges on the sphere's surface are such that the induced dipole (or whatever) creates an electric field that cancels the external field inside the conductor. But since it's a conductor, the charges will arrange so that the electric field inside is zero.

Wait, let's think about the image charge method. For a grounded conducting sphere, the potential on the surface of the sphere is
