Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, which probably means we can focus on their orbital angular momentum only. The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>, where l1 and l2 are the orbital quantum numbers for each electron. So each electron is in a p orbital, which makes sense because p orbitals have l=1.

The problem is asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to have eigenvalues of -ħ. That is, when we measure each electron's Lz, we get -ħ for both.

Wait, so each electron's Lz has possible eigenvalues from -lħ to +lħ in steps of ħ. Since l=1 for each, their possible m values are -1, 0, +1. So L1z can be -ħ, 0, or +ħ, same for L2z.

The combined state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So the total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and the m is -1. 

But wait, how does that relate to the individual m values? Oh right, the total m is the sum of the individual m's. So m = m1 + m2. 

In our case, the total m is -1. So m1 + m2 = -1. 

We're looking for the probability that m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Because that would make L1z = -ħ and L2z = -ħ, each. 

But wait, for two electrons, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a coupled state. So the individual states are coupled into a total angular momentum state. To find the probability, we need to see what possible combinations of m1 and m2 contribute to this state.

I think I need to find how the state |1,1,2,-1> is expressed in terms of the product states |m1, m2>. Each product state would have m1 + m2 = -1. But specifically, the combined state is a linear combination of these product
