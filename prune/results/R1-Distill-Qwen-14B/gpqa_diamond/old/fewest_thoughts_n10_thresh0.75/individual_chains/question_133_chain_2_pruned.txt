Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about.

Alright, the question says that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. It contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. I need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (HPO4^2-) in this solution. The temperature is 25°C, and the Ka values for H3PO4 are given as Ka1=7.5e-3, Ka2=6.2e-8, and Ka3=1.8e-12.

Hmm, I remember that phosphate can exist in different forms depending on the pH. Since we have KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is HPO4^2-), this looks like a buffer solution. The two components will help in determining the pH, which in turn affects the concentration of orthophosphate.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate, which is HPO4^2-. So, I need to find [HPO4^2-]. How does that work?

I think when you mix H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, they form a buffer. The pH will be determined by the pKa2 since the H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2-. Oh right, because H2PO4^- is the acid (since it can donate H+) and HPO4^2- is the conjugate base.

So the buffer equation, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, should apply here. The equation is pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]).

Wait, but first, I need to calculate the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution. The solution's volume is 200 cm³, which is 0.2 liters.

Let me find the molar amounts of each component.

Starting with KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. We have 1.00 g, so the moles are 1.00 g / 136
