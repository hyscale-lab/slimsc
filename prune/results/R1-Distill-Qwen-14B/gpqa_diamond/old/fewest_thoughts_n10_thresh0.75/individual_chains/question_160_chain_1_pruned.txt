Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an aperture that's shaped like an N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. When a monochromatic light of wavelength λ falls on it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N is infinitely large. Oh, and we can use the small angle approximation, tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, okay. Let me think. I remember that when light passes through an aperture, it diffracts, and the pattern observed is called the diffraction pattern. The far field region would be the Fraunhofer diffraction, I think. For a circular aperture, the first minima occur at angles given by something like sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, no, that's the first minimum for a single slit. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the single slit formula is a sinθ = mλ, with m being the order. But for the first minimum, m is 1, so sinθ = λ/(a). But wait, wait, no, that's for the single slit. What about other shapes?

Wait, but the question says the aperture is an N-sided polygon with all apothems of length 'a'. When N is very large, the polygon approaches a circle, right? Because as N increases, a regular polygon becomes a circle. So when N is infinitely large, the shape is a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the angular distance between the first two minima for a circular aperture.

Wait
