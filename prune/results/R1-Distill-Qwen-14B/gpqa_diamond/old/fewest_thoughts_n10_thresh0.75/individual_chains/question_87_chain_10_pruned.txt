Okay, so I've got this question about organic chemistry, specifically about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a certain compound. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The question says that the compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, wait, a benzene ring is 6 carbons, but the compound has 8 carbons total. So the substituents must account for the extra two carbons. Hmm, because the benzene has six, so substituents add two more carbons. So each substituent would have one carbon each, but since it's di-substituted, maybe each is an -OCH3 or something like that. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group, like an ester or ketone.

Wait, the FTIR shows a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (like Ar-X). So the substituents are probably a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait, how many carbons? The aromatic ring is 6, and the substituents add two more. So each substituent is one carbon. So the substituents are, for example, a carbonyl group and a halogen. So, maybe the substituents are -COOH and -X (like Cl or Br?), but that would add more than two carbons if it's -COOR. Alternatively, perhaps a ketone substituent like -CO- something.

Wait, another approach: the total carbons are 8. So benzene (6) + substituents (2 carbons). So substituents could be like -X (which is one atom, but no carbons) and a carbonyl group that has one carbon. Wait, but that wouldn't add the necessary carbons.

Wait, no, perhaps substituents are like -OCH3 and another group. But that would add more than two carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think again. The molecule is a di-substituted benzene with 8 carbons in total. Benzene is 6, so substituents contribute 2 more. So substituents are two groups each with one carbon, or perhaps a group with two carbons and another with zero.

Wait, but wait: the FTIR indicates a carbony
