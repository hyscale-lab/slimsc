Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right answers for each of the three reactions. Let me think through each part step by step.

The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction. In these reactions, a pi bond moves along with a sigma bond. Cope and Claisen rearrangements are examples, but this problem has three different reactions, so maybe each is a different type of rearrangement.

Let's tackle each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm. The starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol, with acid and heat. I'm trying to think what kind of reaction this is. Maybe an acid-catalyzed rearrangement?

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. But that's a bit unusual. Maybe it's a structure like OMe2CH-NH2? Or wait, ethan-1-amine would be CH2CH2NH2, but 1,1-dimethoxy would have two OMe groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure would be NH2-C(OCH3)2.

But but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CHCH2-OH? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? Wait, no, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4, but counting from the other end. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CHCH2-OH? Wait, but that's but-2-en-2-ol. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

But-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CHOHCH3? No, maybe it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2? Wait, perhaps it's CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would have the double bond between carbons 3 and 4, but with four carbons in total. So it's CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, that doesn't make sense because but-3-en-2-ol would have the structure CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3? Wait, but that would be but-3-en-2-ol. So the structure is CH2=CHCH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but when you have an alcohol and an amine in the presence of acid, perhaps they form an imine or something else. But in this case, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is more likely a good leaving group scenario. Wait,
