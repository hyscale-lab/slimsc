Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound among four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

First, I need to look at the NMR data given. The 1H NMR shows peaks at:

- 7.0 ppm, integrating to 1H as a doublet with J=16.0 Hz.
- 5.5 ppm, 1H as a doublet of quadruplets.
- 2.1 ppm, 3H as a singlet.
- 1.6 ppm, 3H as a doublet.

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down. The singlet at 2.1 ppm, integrating to 3H, is probably an acetate group. Because in acetates, the methyl group (like OAc-) is usually a singlet around 2 ppm. So the compound is likely an ester, maybe something like CH2CH2-O-CO-R or similar.

Looking at the other peaks. The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with a large coupling constant, J=16 Hz. That's a big coupling, which suggests that this proton is adjacent to another proton that's split into a doublet. Wait, 16 Hz is a pretty large J value. In NMR, such large couplings are often between protons on adjacent carbons in a trans configuration, especially in alkenes. So maybe this is a trans double bond situation.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. A doublet of quartets suggests that this proton is coupled to two sets of protons. Let me think. If there's a trans double bond, the protons on either end (like in an E configuration) would each couple with each other, and possibly with other adjacent protons. Alternatively, maybe it's a vinyl group with neighboring substituents.

Wait, the other peaks. The 1.6 ppm is 3H as a doublet. That's probably a methyl group attached to something, maybe the double bond. So like CH2-CH2 or CH2-... Hmm, maybe it's a propenyl or butenyl group.

Let me sketch possible structures. The options are either propenyl or butenyl acetates, in cis or trans configurations.

Let's think about propenyl acetate. Propenyl would be CH2CHCH2-OAc or similar? Wait, no, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So propenyl acetate would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, the options are between propenyl and butenyl. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-butenyl acetate.

So the structures would be:

- For propenyl (3 carbons in the chain, double bond at position 1 or 2?), and for butenyl (4 carbons, double bond between carbons
