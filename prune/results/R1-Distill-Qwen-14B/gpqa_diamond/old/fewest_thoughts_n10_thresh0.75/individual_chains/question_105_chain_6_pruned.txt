Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The question is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. Half of its surface (one hemisphere) is covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere is covered by spots. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are 1000K cooler. Because the star is rotating, as it spins, the spots come into and go out of view, causing brightness variations that look like those caused by an exoplanet transit. So the task is to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation (amplitude) as the spots do.

Hmm, okay. So, the key here is to calculate the relative change in brightness when either a planet transits the star or when spots rotate into and out of view.

Let me think about the two scenarios separately.

First, when a planet transits the star, the change in brightness (the dip) is given by the formula (Rp/Rstar)^2. Because when the planet passes in front, it blocks a part of the star's light proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. Since area is proportional to the square of the radius, that's where the (Rp/Rstar)^2 comes from.

Now, the other scenario is the star with spots. The star's brightness varies as spots rotate. But wait, the spots are cooler, so when they are on the visible side, they make the star appear dimmer. So the change in brightness is due to the difference in flux from the spots compared to the rest of the star.

Wait, but how does the rotational modulation affect the observed brightness? The star's brightness is modulated as it rotates because more or less of the spotted area comes into view. So the maximum variation in brightness would depend on the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots and the temperature difference between the spots and the rest.

Let me try to model this.

The star has radius R = R_sun. The spots cover a filling factor of 20% in one hemisphere. So, the total spotted area is 0.2 * (4π R² / 2), because one hemisphere. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R²), because the area of a hemisphere is 2π R². So total spotted area is 0.4 π R².

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere. So if the filling factor is 20%, then the area covered by spots in one hemisphere is 0.2 * (hemisphere area). Hemisphere area is 2π R². So spot area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

But wait
