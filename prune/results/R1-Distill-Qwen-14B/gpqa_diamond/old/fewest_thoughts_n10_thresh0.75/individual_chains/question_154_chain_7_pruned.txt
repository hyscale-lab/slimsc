Okay, I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. So, a chemist found a white solid, and we need to identify it based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds.

The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100%, and there's another peak at 158 with 32%. Hmm, the molecular ion is typically the molecular weight. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156. Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156, and the 158 peak is maybe a fragment or an isotope? Or could it be a doublet due to chlorine isotopes? Chlorine has a significant natural abundance for its isotopes. So a molecule with Cl would have M and M+2 peaks. 

Looking at the options, all the options except C) have Cl. Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is C6H5COCl. Let me calculate the molecular weight for each option.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's compute: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Total is 84+5+35.5+32=156.5. Hmm, but the molecular ion is at 156. That's close. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, molecular weight of Cl is about 35.5, but in exact terms, Cl is 35.45. So for option A: 7*12=84, 5 H=5, 35.45 Cl, 2*16=32. Sum is 84+5=89, 89+35.45=124.45, 124.45+32=156.45. So the molecular weight would be approximately 156.45. So the molecular ion is at 156, which matches. Then the M+2 peak at 158 would be due to the Cl isotope (Cl has about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl), so the M peak is at 156, and the M+2 at around 158 with 25% abundance (since it's 37Cl which is about 24% natural abundance). But the question says the 158 peak is 32%, which is a bit higher than the 25% expected for Cl. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, 35Cl is ~75%, 37Cl is ~25%. So the M peak would be 156 (from 35Cl), and M+2 would be 158 (from 37Cl). The ratio between M and M+2 would be 75% :25% which is 3:1. In the data, the M is 100%, and M+2 is 32%. So 32 is roughly (25/75)*100 = 33.3%, which is close. So that fits. So the presence of a Cl in the molecule is likely.

Now the IR data: a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. Alcohols, phenols, or maybe carboxylic acids. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm-1 is probably a carbonyl group. For carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is around 1700, but if it's an ester or aldehyde, it could be higher. Wait, an acid would have a broad O-H around 2500-3500 and a strong peak around
