Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. Hmm, let's see what the question says. I'll try to break it down step by step.

The problem states that there's a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. It contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The molecular weights are given: 136.09 g/mol for KH₂PO₄ and 177.99 g/mol for the sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate. The temperature is 25°C, which I think is standard, so I might not need to adjust for temperature effects here.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions, which I think is HPO₄^3- or maybe PO₄^3-? Wait, no, orthophosphate is PO₄^3-, right? But wait, when you have HPO4^2-, that's hydrogen phosphate. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, so PO4^3-.

Wait, but the solution contains both KH₂PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So these are two different phosphate species. Let me think about their dissociation.

KH₂PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate. Its formula is K(HPO4). So in solution, it dissociates into K+ and HPO4^2- ions. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that: KH₂PO4 is actually H2PO4^- when it dissociates. Because the formula is H2PO4^- with K+ as the counterion.

Wait, no. Wait, the formula of KH₂PO4 is K(H2PO4), so when it dissolves, it dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Right, because the structure is K+ [H2PO4^-].

On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. Because the formula is Na2(HPO4), so each unit gives two Na+ and one HPO4^2-.

So in the solution, we have both H2PO4^- and
