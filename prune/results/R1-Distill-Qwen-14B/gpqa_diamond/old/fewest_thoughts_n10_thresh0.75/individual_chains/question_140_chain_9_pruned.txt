Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the details, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. Also, when a certain keto acid reacts with X, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, especially a substance similar to X.

Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out what X is. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the reaction of X with liquid Y gives gas W. W has equal numbers of neutrons and protons. So, what gas has that? Well, the simplest possibilities are H2O (but that's H and O, which don't have the same protons and neutrons), maybe CO2? Wait, CO2 has 1 carbon (protons 6, neutrons maybe 6 if it's C-12, and O has 8 each. Wait, but the molecule as a whole? Wait, W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So, the molecular formula.

Wait, maybe W is CO2. Let's see: CO2 has 1 C and 2 O. C has 6 protons, 6 neutrons (if C-12), O has 8 each. So CO2 would have protons: 6 + 2*8=22. Neutrons: 6 + 2*8=22. Oh wait, that's 22 each. So the molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is CO2.

But wait, another possibility is NH3. Let's see: N has 7 protons, H has 1 each. So NH3 has 7+3=10 protons. Neutrons: N is 7, I think usually N-14 (7 neutrons), so each H has 0. So total neutrons would be 7 + 3*0 =7. But that doesn't match 10 protons. So that wouldn't work.

Alternatively, maybe H2O?
