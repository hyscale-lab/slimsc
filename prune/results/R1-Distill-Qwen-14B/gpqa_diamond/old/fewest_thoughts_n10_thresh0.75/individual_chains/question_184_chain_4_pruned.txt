Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. The question is about the synthesis of 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. I've got four options to choose from, each with a series of reactions. Hmm, I need to think about the correct order of reactions to get the desired product.

First, let me draw the target molecule. It's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (-OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group (t-Bu), and position 3 has a nitro group (-NO2). So, substituents are at 1, 2, and 3. Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering could be different, but I think in the given structure, the substituents are meta and para relative to each other. Let me clarify: positions 1, 2, and 3 are adjacent in a way that they form a meta arrangement? No, wait, 1 is ortho to 2, and 2 is ortho to 3. So, all three substituents are adjacent in a ring. That means it's a para arrangement? No, wait, maybe it's 1,2,3-trisubstituted. So the substituents are at adjacent positions, which is a bit tricky because of steric hindrance. But maybe the synthesis steps will clarify.

I remember that when introducing substituents onto a benzene ring, the order of reactions matters because each substituent directs the incoming groups. Electrophilic substitution reactions are influenced by the existing substituents. So, the directing effects of each group will determine where the next substituent attaches.

Let me think about the substituents:

- Ethoxy group (-OEt): This is a strong activating, ortho/para-directing group.
- tert-Butyl group: This is an activating (since it's an alkyl group) and ortho/para-directing group.
- Nitro group (-NO2): This is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group.

Wait, but wait: the nitro group is meta-directing. So, if a nitro group is present on the ring, the next substitution will occur at the meta position relative to it.

But the target molecule has nitro at position 3. How do the substituents get added?

So, the plan is to add substituents in an order where each new group is added in a position that is directed by the existing groups. But the substituents have different directing effects, so the order of addition will affect the final structure.

Let me think about the possible steps.

The target molecule has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about when each is added.

Option A: The steps are t-Bu Cl with AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts), then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), then SO3/H2SO4 (sulfonation?), then NaNO2/HCl (nitrous acid?), dilute H2SO4, H3O+
