Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley and some gene mutations. Let me try to think this through step by step. Alright, the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis, which I remember is a chemical mutagen that typically causes point mutations, often leading to changes in amino acids.

The goal is to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, they’re looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, probably by causing a premature stop codon or a significant change in the protein structure.

Looking at the options, let me look at each mutant:

The wild-type gene starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’. Let's break down each mutant.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild-type, the first part is ATGTTTCT... becomes ATGTTCTA... Wait, let me look. The wild-type first exons have ATGTTTCTC..., while Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTAC. So, the third and fourth nucleotides are changing. Wait, let me count. Wild-type: positions 1-10 maybe? Maybe I should line them up.

Wild-type first part: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So, looking at the first exon, I see a change at the 4th or 5th position. Wild-type has TTT CTC, and mutant has TTC TAC. Let me see the exact positions. Hmm, maybe it's a substitution in one of the codons.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Same as Mutant 1 up until some point. Oh, wait, their first exons are similar. Wait, the wild-type is CT CGC, and Mutant 2 is CT AAG. So in the first exon, perhaps a few changes. Wait, maybe a substitution from CGC to AGC, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reading frame is changed.

Mutant 3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Here, I see that in the wild-type, the sequence after ATGTTT is CTC GCT GGT ACTTCTG... In Mutant 3, it's TTA CGC TGG TGT C... Wait, the third codon in the mutant is TTACG instead of TTCTC. Wait, let me count:

Wild-type starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... So maybe the first few codons are Met, Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, etc.

Mutant 3's sequence is ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG TGA ... So, the third codon in the wild-type is CTC (Leu) but in mutant 3, it's TAC, which is Tyr. So that changes the amino acid from Leu to Tyr, but not a stop codon. Then, looking further, there's a change in the next part: ACT to GTC. ACT is Thr, GTC is Val. So that's another substitution. Not a frameshift, just point mutations. So, this mutant might just alter some amino acids, but not necessarily lead to a nonfunctional protein.

Mutant 4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Looking at this, the first part is ATGTTTTACGCTAC... Wild-type has CTG GGT ACT etc. So, the fourth codon in wild-type is GCT (Ala), and in mutant 4, it's TAC. Hmm, but wait, looking more precisely: Wild-type after ATG is TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), etc. In mutant 4, after TTT, it's TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), but wait, the next part is ACT becomes TCT? Let me see: Wild-type is ACT TCT GTG... Mutant 4 is ACT TCT GTG? Wait, no, looking again: Wild-type after ACT is TCT, while mutant 4 has TCT as well? Hmm, not sure. Maybe a larger deletion. Wait, the sequence for mutant 4 is ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT... So, perhaps the first few codons are changed, including a possible frameshift.

Wait, let me double-check the structures. Another approach is to see if any of the mutations cause a frameshift. Frameshifts would change all downstream codons, possibly leading to a premature stop codon.

Looking at the wild-type and each mutant:

Wild-type starts with ATG (start codon, Met), then TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
So, the first part is ATG, then TTT becomes TTC (Phe to Phe?), no, wait: Wild-type is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA...

Mutant 1's sequence in first exon: ATG TT C TAC GCT GGT ACT... So, let's see:

Wild-type: positions 1-20 (hypothetically)
1: ATG
2: TTT
3: CTC
4: GCT
5: GGT
6: ACT
7: TCT
8: GTG
... etc.

Mutant 1: ATG TT C TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...
So, the third codon (3rd) is CTC -> TAC. So instead of CTC (Leu), it's TAC (Tyr). So a point mutation, changing amino acid. Then the next codons are the same as wild-type. So no frameshift, just substitution. So the protein would have a different amino acid there, but not a premature stop.

Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...
Hmm, perhaps in the same region. Let me see where the changes are. Wild-type has CTC GCT GGT ACT... So in mutant 2, perhaps the GCT (Ala) becomes AGC (Ser), or maybe a different substitution. Wait, looking at the sequences:

Wild-type: ...GCT GGT ACT...
Mutant 2: ...GCT AGC TGG... Wait, no, perhaps the fourth codon is altered. Wild-type is GCT (Ala), maybe mutant 2 has AGC (Ser). So substitution again, not a frameshift. So the protein will have a different amino acid, but not a stop.

Mutant 3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGAT...
Ah, here, looking at the fifth codon. Wild-type fifth codon is GGT (Gly). In mutant 3, it's GTC (Val). So substitution again. Also, further down, the seventh codon in wild-type is TCT (Ser), but in mutant 3, it's TCA (Ser still, same amino acid). Wait, but another part: ACT becomes TCA? Let me see. Or perhaps earlier, after the first few codons, the sequence changes. No, I think it's just substitutions, not a frameshift.

Mutant 4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Hmm, looking at this, after the start codon, let's see. Wild-type's third codon is CTC (Leu), and in mutant 4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr). Then the fourth codon in wild-type is GCT (Ala), but in mutant 4, the next codon is TAC, which is Tyr. Wait, no, maybe the sequence is different. Let me count the nucleotides.

Wild-type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... (positions 1-20)
Mutant 4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... 

Wait, so the third codon in wild-type is CTC (Leu), and in mutant 4, it's TAC (Tyr). So a substitution. Fourth codon in wild-type is GCT (Ala), and in mutant 4, it's ACT (Thr). Fifth codon wild-type is GGT (Gly), and in mutant 4, it's TCT (Ser). Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the wild-type is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG TGA ... So, the first six codons are:

1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: CTC (Leu)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: GGT (Gly)
6: ACT (Thr)
7: TCT (Ser)
8: GTG (Val)
9: TGA (Stop)

Wait, but the TGA is the stop codon at the end. So the wild-type's coding sequence ends with TGA as a stop.

In Mutant 4: The first few codons are ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG TGA.

So:

1: ATG (Met)
2: TTT (Phe)
3: TAC (Tyr)
4: GCT (Ala)
5: ACT (Thr)
6: TCT (Ser)
7: GTG (Val)
8: TGA (Stop)

Wait a minute, so in the wild-type, the stop codon is at the end of the mRNA, so perhaps in the middle of the gene? Because the gene structure is five exons and four introns. So the stop codon is probably in the last exon.

Wait, but in Mutant 4, the stop codon is TGA, which is earlier. Let me check: the wild-type sequence includes ...TGA-3’ at the end. So in the wild-type, the stop codon is the last codon. But in Mutant 4, perhaps the same stop codon is present earlier.

Wait, in Mutant 4's sequence, after GTG comes TGA. So the fifth codon is ACT (Thr), sixth is TCT (Ser), seventh is GTG (Val), eighth is TGA (stop). So the stop codon is earlier in the sequence. That would mean a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. So the protein would be shorter, possibly nonfunctional.

So, which mutant introduces a premature stop? Let's check each.

Mutant 1: No stop codon introduced early. It's substitution, so the protein is longer but with different amino acids.

Mutant 2: Similar, substitution, no early stop.

Mutant 3: Changes some codons but doesn't introduce a stop, I think. The sequence continues beyond.

Mutant 4: The stop codon occurs earlier, leading to a truncated protein. So this would likely disrupt the protein's function, perhaps making the anti-nutritional compound not be synthesized.

So the correct answer would be Mutant 4. But wait, let me double-check. The wild-type ends with TGA. In Mutant 4, does the TGA appear earlier?

Yes. So, the gene in the wild-type is longer, but in mutant 4, the stop is earlier. So the protein would be shorter, which often leads to loss of function because the protein is missing important regions.

Therefore, the mutation that causes a premature stop codon would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the impact of each mutation on the gene's function. The anti-nutritional compound is likely encoded by the gene, so disrupting its synthesis would require a mutation that significantly alters or truncates the protein product. The mutations are evaluated for changes in the coding sequence, particularly whether they introduce a premature stop codon or cause a frameshift.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Wild-Type Sequence**:
   - The wild-type sequence starts with `ATG` (start codon, Met) and ends with `TGA` (stop codon). The sequence includes several codons that encode amino acids.

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - The sequence shows substitutions in the first exon, such as `CTC` (Leu) changing to `TAC` (Tyr) and `GCT` (Ala) changing to `GCG` (Ala). These are point mutations that alter amino acids but do not introduce a premature stop codon. The reading frame remains intact.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - Similar to Mutant 1, there are substitutions in the first exon, such as `GCT` (Ala) changing to `AAG` (Lys). These are also point mutations that change amino acids without causing a frameshift or introducing a premature stop codon.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - Substitutions occur in the first exon, such as `CTC` (Leu) changing to `TAC` (Tyr) and `ACT` (Thr) changing to `GTC` (Val). These are point mutations that alter amino acids, but the reading frame remains intact, and no premature stop codon is introduced.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - Substitutions in the first exon include `CTC` (Leu) changing to `TAC` (Tyr) and `GCT` (Ala) changing to `ACT` (Thr). Notably, the stop codon `TGA` appears earlier in the sequence, leading to a premature termination of translation. This results in a truncated protein, which is likely nonfunctional and would disrupt the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

### Conclusion:
The mutation in **Mutant 4** introduces a premature stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. This is the most likely mutation to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound by rendering the protein nonfunctional.
