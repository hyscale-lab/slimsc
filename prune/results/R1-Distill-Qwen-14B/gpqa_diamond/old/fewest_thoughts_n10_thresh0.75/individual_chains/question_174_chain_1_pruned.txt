Okay, so I have this physics problem here about atomic nucleus fission. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. So the nucleus is initially at rest with a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission and splits into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other, and the sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M.

Wait, so the initial mass is M, and after fission, the two fragments have rest masses m1 and m2, where m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Oh, but wait, the problem says one fragment is twice as massive as the other. So if m2 is the more massive one, m2 = 2 m1. Or wait, no, the wording says "one fragment is 2 times more massive than the other", which I think means m2 = 2 m1. Let me confirm that: so m2 is twice m1.

So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Substituting m2 as 2 m1, we get m1 + 2 m1 = 3 m1 = 0.99 M. So m1 = 0.99 M /3 = 0.33 M. Then m2 is 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. So the rest masses are 0.33 M and 0.66 M. But wait, the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. So M is the rest mass, so E_initial = M c^2 = 300 GeV.

Wait, but what about the rest masses of the fragments? Their sum is 0.99 M, so perhaps there's some mass defect here, leading to energy released as kinetic energy. Because in fission, mass is converted into energy. That energy is the kinetic energy of the fragments.

So, the initial rest mass is M c² = 300 GeV. The two fragments have rest masses m1 c² and m2 c². So their sum is (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV. So the mass difference is 300 - 297 = 3 GeV. So that's 3 GeV of energy that's released as the kinetic energy of the two fragments.

Wait, but wait a second. No, because in reality, in fission, the binding energy comes from the mass defect. So the initial nucleus has mass M, and when it splits into two nuclei, their combined mass is less than M, so the difference is the energy released.

Wait, but the problem says the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So the sum is 0.99 M. So the mass defect is M - (0.99 M) = 0.01 M. So that 0.01 M c² is the energy released, which would be distributed as kinetic energy of the two fragments and any other
