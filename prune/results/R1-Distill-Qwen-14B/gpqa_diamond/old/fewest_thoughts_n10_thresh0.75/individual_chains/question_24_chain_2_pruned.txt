Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So the question is about a mixture X that's equimolar of two liquids. When X is treated with platinum and heated, it forms mixture Y, which is also equimolar but made from two other liquids due to a disproportionation reaction. Importantly, Y doesn't decolorize bromine water, which suggests that Y doesn't have double bonds anymore because alkenes can decolorize bromine water. 

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. Z is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Z is part of Y and is widely used as a solvent. Also, Z doesn't react further with hydrogen, so it's likely a saturated compound, maybe an alkane. 

Another point is that X has no conjugated multiple bonds. So the starting materials in X are probably alkenes or something without conjugation, but maybe not conjugated dienes or something like that.

Let me try to outline what each part means.

First, X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So X must have substances that can react with bromine, like alkenes. When X is heated with Pt, a catalyst, it undergoes a disproportionation, which is a reaction where one species is both oxidized and reduced. So for example, something like 2 A â†’ B + C, where A is both oxidized and reduced.

The result is Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y must not have any double bonds, or if it does, they are not reactive enough for bromine. But wait, Y is formed from a disproportionation of X. So X's components could be something that can split into more than one product. 

Wait, let me think about possible compounds. Maybe X is a di-substituted alkene, which upon hydrogenation might form different products depending on where the hydrogen adds. But wait, hydrogenation typically adds across double bonds. But here, the treatment is with Pt and heat, which might lead to more complex reactions.

Wait, but the product Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so Y must not have any double bonds. So if X had alkenes, and Y does not, then Y must have been hydrogenated. But wait, hydrogenation usually adds H2 across double bonds. But in the problem, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it's a disproportionation. So perhaps X's components are such that they can split into products with different structures.

Alternatively, maybe X contains a compound that can disproportionate via a different mechanism, like a cyclic diene or something else.

Wait, another angle: X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which upon reaction with Pt and heat undergoes a reaction, perhaps dehydrohalogenation or something else, leading to a different structure. But I'm not sure. Let me think about the hydrogenation part.

When X and Y are hydrogenated, they give Z, which is a hydrocarbon. Z has hydrogen mass fraction 14.28%. Let's calculate the molecular
