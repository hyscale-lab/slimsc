Okay, so I have this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'll need to think about the factors that determine a planet's equilibrium temperature and how that relates to its orbital period.

The question gives me some data about three planets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember is transit timing variations. But I don't think the method affects this problem directly; maybe it's just context.

The key data points are:

- The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4, which means Planet1 is hotter.
- The ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3, so T2/T3 = 2.3. So Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, and Planet3 is the coldest among them.

Wait, wait. Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and its albedo. Oh, right, the formula is something like Te = [ ( L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * d²) ]^(1/4), where L is luminosity, a is albedo, and d is the distance. Since all planets have the same albedo (0.3), that part cancels out in the ratios.

So the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance. Because if you rearrange the formula, d is proportional to (L^(1/4) * (1/(1-a))^(1/4)) / Te^(1/2), but wait, actually, for the ratio of temperatures, the formula simplifies. Let me think: If planet A and B have equilibrium temps TA and TB, then TA/TB = sqrt( (d_B)/(d_A) ) )^(1/2) no, wait.

Wait, equilibrium temperature (Te) is proportional to (L / (16πσd²))^(1/4) * (1/(1-a))^(1/4). Since all have the same albedo, we can ignore that term. So Te ∝ (L)^(1/4) / (d)^(1/2). Wait, no, Te is proportional to (L)^(1/4) / (d)^(1/2), because the denominator is d squared, so when you take the fourth root, it's d^(1/2).

Wait, no: the formula is Te = [ ( L (1-a) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4). So Te ∝ sqrt( sqrt( L / d² ) ). So sqrt( (L/d²)^(1/2) ) ) = (L/d²)^(1/4) ) = L^(1/4) / d^(1/2). Yes, so Te ∝ (L)^(1/4) / d^(1/2).

Wait, but if L is the same for all planets (assuming they orbit the same star), then Te is inversely proportional to d^(1/2). So if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, its distance must be smaller. Because if d increases, Te decreases.

So, what's the ratio between the equilibrium temperatures? For Planet1 and Planet2, T1/T2 = 1.4. Since Te is proportional to 1/(d^(1/2)), then T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ). Because T1 = k / sqrt(d1), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ). So 1.4 = sqrt(d2/d1). Squaring both sides, 1.96 = d2/d1 → d2 = 1.96 * d1.

Wait, but wait! Because T1 is larger, then Planet1 must be closer to the star. So d1 < d2.

Wait, let me double-check that. If a planet is closer (smaller d), it's hotter. So if T1 is hotter than T2, d1 < d2. So when I set up the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 ), and since d2 > d1, the ratio is >1, which matches T1/T2=1.4.

So from the first ratio, T1/T2 = 1.4 → sqrt(d2/d1) = 1.4 → d2 = d1*(1.4)^2 = 1.96 d1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3=2.3. Using the same logic, T2/T3 = sqrt( d3/d2 ). So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2 ) → (2.3)^2 = d3/d2 → 5.29 = d3/d2 → d3=5.29 * d2.

But since d2 is 1.96 d1, d3=5.29 * 1.96 d1. Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ let me compute 5 *1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96≈0.5684. So total ≈ 10.3684. So d3 ≈10.3684 d1.

So the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

But the question isn't about distance directly—it's about the orbital period. So how does the distance relate to the period?

Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period (P) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (d) divided by the mass of the star (M). But in most cases, when the mass of the star is much larger than the planet, we can approximate it as P² ∝ d³. So P is proportional to d^(3/2).

But wait, the question gives us the masses of the planets. Hmm, that's interesting. The mass ratios are: Planet1/Planet2 ≈1.15, and Planet2/Planet3≈1.35.

Wait, does the planet's mass affect the orbital period? I think in the case of a planet orbiting a star, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass, so the period depends mainly on the distance and the star's mass. But wait, the problem states that the TTV method was used, which measures variations in the planet's orbital periods due to gravitational interactions with other planets. So in this problem, perhaps the masses of the planets are relevant for the TTV method but not directly for Kepler's law, which relates the period of a planet to the star's mass and the semi-major axis.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital period of each planet around the same star. So for each planet, the period P is determined by Kepler's third law, which is P² = (4π²/G(M)) * d³, where M is the mass of the star. So if all three planets orbit the same star, M is the same for all, so P² is proportional to d³ → P ∝ d^(3/2).

So the period of each planet is proportional to the cube root of d squared. Wait, no: P² is proportional to d³. So P is proportional to d^(3/2).

So the orbital period of Planet3 is P3 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) * P1. Because d3 = 10.3684 d1.

So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

Let me compute 10.3684^(3/2). Let's break it down: 10.3684 is approximately 10.37. The square root of 10.37 is about 3.22. Then, 3.22 cubed is about 3.22 * 3.22 = 10.3684, then 10.3684 * 3.22 ≈ approximately 33.36.

So P3 is about 33.36 times P1. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes with exponents.

Another approach: to compute 10.3684^(3/2).

10.3684 is approximately (10.3684)^(1/2) ≈ sqrt(10.3684). Let me compute sqrt(10) is 3.1623, sqrt(10.24) is 3.2 (since 3.2^2=10.24), so 10.3684 is a bit more than 3.2. Let's compute 3.2^2=10.24. 3.22^2: 3.22 *3.22 = (3 + 0.22)^2 = 9 + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484 = 10.3684. Oh! So sqrt(10.3684) is exactly 3.22. So that's where I got that from.

So 10.3684^(3/2) = (sqrt(10.3684))^3 = (3.22)^3. Let's compute that.

3.22 *3.22 = 10.3684 as before.

3.22 *10.3684 = ?

3 *10.3684 = 31.1052

0.22 *10.3684 ≈ 2.2809 (since 0.2*10.3684 is 2.07368, and 0.02*10.3684 is ~0.20737, sum is ~2.2809)

So 31.1052 + 2.2809 = 33.3861.

So (3.22)^3 ≈ 33.386 ≈33.4.

So the ratio P3/P1 is approximately 33.4. Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4. So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, I assumed that the semi-major axis (d) is the same as the orbital distance. But in reality, for Kepler's law, d is the semi-major axis, which for a circular orbit is the same as the radius. So that's fine.

Also, I considered that all planets orbit the same star, so the mass of the star M is the same, and thus the period is only a function of d.

But wait, the problem gives the mass ratios of the planets. Planet1/Planet2 is 1.15, Planet2/Planet3 is 1.35. So Planet1 is 1.15 times the mass of Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3's mass. So Planet1 is 1.15 * 1.35 = 1.5525 times the mass of Planet3.

But wait, in Kepler's law, the period depends on the planet's orbital parameters, not the planet's mass. Because the planet is much less massive than the star, its mass doesn't significantly affect the period. So the mass ratios given in the problem probably don't affect the orbital period of the planets. They might be relevant for the TTV method (transit timing variations) because more massive planets have stronger gravitational interactions, causing more noticeable TTVs. But for the purpose of calculating the period based on distance, the planet's mass doesn't matter.

So my initial approach was correct; the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \)
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \)
   - Since equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to \( d^{1/2} \) (where \( d \) is the orbital distance), we use the relationship:
     \[
     \frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}}
     \]
     From \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \), we find:
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{d_2}{d_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies d_2 = 1.96 d_1
     \]
   - Similarly, for \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \):
     \[
     \sqrt{\frac{d_3}{d_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{d_3}{d_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies d_3 = 5.29 d_2
     \]
   - Substituting \( d_2 = 1.96 d_1 \) into \( d_3 = 5.29 d_2 \):
     \[
     d_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 d_1 \approx 10.37 d_1
     \]

2. **Orbital Period and Distance Relationship**:
   - According to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to \( d^{3/2} \):
     \[
     P \propto d^{3/2}
     \]
   - The ratio of the orbital periods is:
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}
     \]
   - Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 \approx 10.37 \):
     \[
     \frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
     \]
   - First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.37} \approx 3.22 \). Then, cube this result:
     \[
     (3.22)^3 \approx 33.4
     \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
