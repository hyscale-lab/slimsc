Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about substituents on a benzene ring and how they direct incoming electrophiles. The substituents determine where the bromine will add—either ortho, meta, or para to them. But wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So I need to figure out for each substituent, how much para product is formed when bromine is added in excess.

The six substances are all benzene rings with different groups attached. Let me list them again:

1) C6H5-CH3 (toluene)
2) C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 (benzoyloxyethylbenzene? Wait, no, wait, wait. The formula is C6H5-COOC2H5. Oh, that's benzene with a carbonyloxyethyl group. Wait, no, wait: C6H5-CO-O-C2H5 is benzene with a group that's an ester. So, it's a benzene ring with a COOEt group (where Et is ethyl). So that's a benzoyloxyethyl group—no, wait, wait. Wait, the structure is C6H5-CO-O-C2H5. Oh, that's a benzoyloxyethyl group? Or wait, no. Wait, the substituent is O-CO-OEt? No, wait, the substituent is COOEt attached directly to the benzene. So that's an ester group, like a phenyl acetate or something. So the substituent is an ester.

3) C6H5-Cl (chlorobenzene)
4) C6H5-NO2 (nitrobenzene)
5) C6H5-C2H5 (ethylbenzene)
6) C6H5-COOH (benzoic acid)

So each of these is a benzene ring with a substituent. The reaction is bromination with excess Br2. Since it's an electrophilic substitution, the substituents will direct the incoming Br+.

Wait, for each substituent, I need to know if it's activating or deactivating, and whether it's meta or para-directing.

So, let's think about each substituent:

1) CH3: the methyl group is an activating group (since it's an electron-donating alkyl group). It is ortho/para-directing. So, when bromine adds, the major product would be para and ortho. But, since the substituent is activating, the position where the bromine adds will be influenced by the directing effect.

2) COOEt (ester group): Esters are deactivating because the carbonyl is electron-withdrawing. But wait, the ester group is an electron-withdrawing group, but it's an activating group? Wait, no, esters are meta directors. Wait, no. Wait, substituents that are deactivating can be either meta or para/ortho directors. For example, nitro groups are meta directors and deactivating. Esters are similar but wait, let me think.

Wait, the substituent is O-CO-OEt? No, the substituent is COOEt attached directly to the benzene. So, it's an ester group (like in phenyl acetate). Ester groups are deactivating because the electron-withdrawing effect of the carbonyl. They are meta directors. So, when bromine is added, the major product would be meta to the ester group.

But wait, in some cases, the ester group can be ortho/para-directing if the substituent is activating. Wait, no, I think esters are deactivating because of the carbonyl group which is EWG. So, ester groups are meta directors, deactivating.

3) Cl: Chlorine is an interesting substituent. It's an deactivating group (because of the electronegativity, but the inductive effect is stronger than the resonance effect). Wait, but Cl is ortho/para-directing. Even though it's deactivating, because of the resonance effect. The lone pairs on Cl can donate electrons through resonance, but the inductive effect is stronger, making it deactivating. So Cl is a meta director or ortho/para? Wait, wait. Chlorine is a deactivating group but ortho/para-directing. Because when the Cl donates electrons through resonance, it directs the incoming electrophile to ortho and para positions, even though overall it's deactivating. So, Cl is meta director? No, wait. No, I think for Cl, the inductive effect is stronger (which is deactivating) and resonance is weaker (activating), so overall it's deactivating but still ortho/para-directing. So in bromination, the major product would be ortho and para to Cl.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me confirm. Cl is a deactivating group because of its electronegativity, making the ring less reactive. But it's ortho/para-directing because the lone pairs can participate in resonance, pushing electrons into the ring. So, the substituent directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

But wait, when a substituent is deactivating and ortho/para-directing, the para product is more favored than ortho because of steric hindrance? Or because of the substituent's own directing effect.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think Cl is an ortho/para director, but it's deactivating, so substitution occurs less readily than benzene.

4) NO2: Nitro groups are strong deactivating and meta-directing. So, when Br adds, it's meta to the nitro group. So the major product is meta.

5) C2H5: Ethyl group, which is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. So, the substituent directs the Br to ortho and para positions.

6) COOH: Carboxylic acid group. This is deactivating because the COOH is a strong EWG. It's meta-directing. So, the major product is meta to the COOH group.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the carboxylic acid. So, the substituent is -COOH. It's a strong deactivating group (EWG), so meta-directing. So bromine will add meta to the COOH group.

Now, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent, what's the percentage of para product.

Wait, but for some substituents, the para product is not the major one. For example, nitro groups (substance 4) are meta directors, so the product is meta, so no para product. Wait, no. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, when a substituent is a meta director, the incoming electrophile adds meta to it. So, in that case, the para product would be minor or zero? Or, wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, the substituent's position directs where the electrophile comes in. So if the substituent is in a certain position, the Br adds para or meta to it.

Wait, no. Let me correct this: The substituent is at a certain position on the benzene ring, and the electrophile adds either ortho, meta, or para with respect to that substituent.

Wait, but in the case where a substituent is para directing, like methyl, the product can be either ortho or para to the substituent. So, for substituents that are ortho/para directing, you can get a mixture of ortho and para products (and maybe some meta, but less). For meta directing groups, the product is mainly meta to the substituent.

Wait, but in the case of Cl (substance 3), which is ortho/para directing, but deactivating, so the ring is less reactive but the substitution occurs at ortho and para. So, the product distribution would have more para and some ortho.

But wait, when the substituent is strong activating, like -OCH3 or -CH3, the para product is usually more than the ortho because of steric hindrance. So, for example, toluene (methyl benzene) would have more para substitution.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let's try to think about each substituent and their major products.

So for each substance:

1) C6H5-CH3: activating, o/p-directing. So, major products are para and ortho. But due to steric hindrance, the para is major.

2) C6H5-COOEt: deactivating, meta-directing. So, the major product is meta. So, the para product is minimal or none. Wait, but wait. The substituent is an ester, which is deactivating and meta-directing. So the Br would add meta to the substituent. So in this case, the para product would not be a major product. So the weight fraction of para would be low.

3) C6H5-Cl: deactivating, o/p-directing. So, the Br adds ortho and para to Cl. But since Cl is a deactivating group, the para product is more favored because the ortho position is less accessible due to steric hindrance. Or maybe because of the directing effect. So, the para product is the major one.

Wait, but I remember that chlorobenzene upon bromination gives a mixture of ortho and para products, but the para is more due to steric reasons. So, for Cl, the major product is para. So the weight fraction of para would be higher than meta, but wait, the substituent itself is Cl, which is o/p-directing.

Wait, but substituent 3 is Cl, so the bromine adds o and p to Cl. So the major product is p-chlorobromobenzene. So the para product is major.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this confused. Let me clarify. The substituent is Cl. The incoming Br will add at o and p positions relative to Cl. So the products are o-chlorobromobenzene and p-chlorobromobenzene. The ratio depends on the substituent's directing effect and steric factors. For Cl, the para product is usually more than ortho because of steric hindrance. So in substance 3, the para isomer is major.

4) C6H5-NO2: deactivating, meta-directing. So the Br adds meta to NO2. So no para product. So the para product's weight fraction is zero.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group, activating, o/p-directing. So, the Br adds o and p to the ethyl group. So, the para product is major because of steric reasons, similar to toluene.

6) C6H5-COOH: deactivating, meta-directing. So, the Br adds meta to COOH. So the para product is minimal or zero.

Wait, but for each substituent, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for each substituent, how much para product is formed.

So, let's make a list of each substituent and the amount of para product.

Substance 1: CH3 (toluene) → para is major. So high para yield.

Substance 2: COOEt (ester) → meta directing. So para product is minor or zero. So low para.

Substance 3: Cl → para is major. High para.

Substance 4: NO2 → meta director. So para product is zero. So para fraction is 0%.

Substance 5: C2H5 (ethyl) → para is major. High para.

Substance 6: COOH → meta director. So para product is zero. So 0%.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about each substituent.

Wait, for a meta-directing substituent, the major product is meta to the substituent. So the para product is a minor product. But in some cases, especially when there are multiple substituents or the substituent is bulky, but in this case, each substituent is a single group.

Wait, but for deactivating, meta-directing groups, the substitution occurs at meta, so the para product is not formed. Or maybe some minor amount?

Wait, perhaps substituents that are meta directors lead to the majority of products being meta, so the para product is a minor fraction. But sometimes when the substituent is in a certain position, it could allow para substitution. Hmm, getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the substituent directing the incoming electrophile. For substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is major. For meta directors, the para product is zero because the substitution is at meta.

Wait, no. Wait, if the substituent is at position 1, and the incoming electrophile adds at position 4 (para) or position 3 (meta). So, for meta directors, the product is at meta. So the para product isn't formed. So for substituents that are meta directors, the para product is zero or negligible.

So, let's list each:

1) CH3: o/p director → major product is para. So, high para fraction.

2) COOEt: meta director → para fraction is low, maybe negligible.

3) Cl: o/p director → major is para.

4) NO2: meta director → para fraction is zero.

5) C2H5: o/p director → major is para.

6) COOH: meta director → para fraction is zero.

Wait, but for substituent 2, the COOEt is an ester group which is deactivating and meta director. So, the major product is meta. So the para product would be minor. But how much? If the group is strong meta director, perhaps the para product is very low, but not zero.

So, for each substituent, the para fraction's order from lowest to highest.

Let me write down the estimated para fractions:

1) CH3: high (major product is para)

2) COOEt: low (para is minor)

3) Cl: high (para is major)

4) NO2: 0 (para is not formed)

5) C2H5: high (para is major)

6) COOH: 0 (para not formed)

So, the order of increasing para fraction would start from those with 0, then the ones with low, then the ones with high.

So, looking at substituents:

Substance 4: 0% (para)

Substance 6: 0% (para)

Substance 2: low, perhaps 10-20%

Substance 1: high, maybe around 60% para

Substance 5: high, similar to 1.

Substance 3: high, maybe even higher than 1 and 5.

Wait, but wait. Wait, all o/p directors will have their para products, but their activating or deactivating nature affects the overall reactivity.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So for the o/p directors, their para products are major, so higher fractions.

But for the meta directors, the para fractions would be low or zero.

So, let's arrange from lowest para fraction to highest.

The lowest para fractions are the meta directors (substances 4 and 6, 0% each), then the ester (substance 2, which is meta and perhaps some para?), then the o/p directors.

Wait, but perhaps even for the ester (substance 2), the para product is negligible, but if the substituent is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so even less para product.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about each substituent's para product:

Substance 1: CH3 is activating, o/p-directing. So, major products are para, so high para fraction.

Substance 2: COOEt is deactivating, meta-directing. So, para product is minimal.

Substance 3: Cl is deactivating, o/p-directing. So, para is major.

Substance 4: NO2: meta-directing, no para product.

Substance 5: C2H5: activating, o/p-directing, so para is major.

Substance 6: COOH: meta-directing, no para product.

So, the para fractions:

Substance 4: 0%

Substance 6: 0%

Substance2: low (say, 20%)

Substance1: high (say, 70%)

Substance3: high (say, 80%)

Substance5: high (say, 60%)

Wait, but this is just an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups have more para product, but I'm not sure about exact percentages.

Wait, but the order of para fractions is:

Substance 4 and 6 have 0% (the lowest).

Then, substance 2 has low.

Then, the others (1,3,5) have high.

But the question is about the order of increasing weight fraction. So from lowest to highest.

So, the order would be:

4 (0) < 6 (0) < 2 (low) <1,5,3 (high)

But wait, what about the activating groups (1 and 5)? Which has a higher para fraction? Or do they have similar levels?

Wait, perhaps the substituent's size affects the para versus ortho.

For toluene (substance1), the methyl group is small, so para is major.

For ethylbenzene (substance5), the ethyl group is larger, so steric hindrance may cause para to be even more favored, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the exact position of the substituent (ortho, meta, para) depends more on the directing effect. So, for o/p directors, the major products are para and some ortho, but the para is more due to steric reasons.

But the exact order of the para fractions for 1,3,5 is the question. Are they all similar, or is one higher than the others?

Alternatively, perhaps for the substituents that are strong activating, like -OCH3 or -NH2, the para product is even more favored. But in our case, the substituents are methyl, ethyl, Cl.

So, methyl is less bulky than ethyl, so perhaps in toluene, the para product is a bit higher than ethylbenzene.

Alternatively, maybe the para product is similar for 1 and 5.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to make a table.

Substance | Substituent Type | Para Fraction
--- | --- | ---
4 | NO2 (meta) | 0%
6 | COOH (meta) | 0%
2 | COOEt (meta) | low (say, 10%)
1 | CH3 (activating, o/p) | high (say, 70%)
5 | C2H5 (activating, o/p) | high (say, 65%)
3 | Cl (deactivating, o/p) | high (say, 80%)

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact order between 1,3,5.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is that the activating groups have higher para fractions than the deactivating o/p directors. Because activating groups make the ring more reactive, so more substitution. But the substituent's o/p-directing nature leads to para being major.

Wait, but Cl is deactivating but o/p-directing, so the ring is less reactive, but substitution still occurs at o and p. So, the para fraction for Cl would be higher than that of the meta directors but lower than the activating o/p directors.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relative strengths.

Let me think: substituents that are activating (like alkyl groups) are o/p directors and the para product is major. So, for 1,5, which are activating, the para fraction is higher than 3, which is deactivating but o/p-directing.

Wait, but that contradicts my previous assumption. Because in the case of Cl, which is deactivating, the ring is less reactive, so perhaps the para product isn't as major as in activating groups. Hmm, but no—Cl is an o/p director regardless of being deactivating, so substitution occurs at o and p.

But the reactivity is lower, so substitution is less, but the para is still major.

So, perhaps the order of para fractions is:

Substance 4 (0) < 6 (0) < 2 (low) < 1 (activating o/p) < 5 (activating o/p) < 3 (deactivating o/p) ?

Wait, but 3 is Cl, which is deactivating o/p. So, its para product is major but less than the activating ones because the ring is less reactive. Wait, but the question is about the fraction, not the amount of product. So even if the ring is less reactive, the substituent directs to para.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should think about the overall activating/deactivating and o/p or meta directors.

Wait, the question is about the weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, for each substituent:

- If the substituent is meta-directing (like COOEt, NO2, COOH), the para product is negligible or zero. So, their para fraction is zero or very low.

- For substituents that are o/p-directing, the para product is a major part.

So, the para fractions for:

1: high (activating o/p)

2: low (meta)

3: high (deactivating o/p)

4: 0

5: high (activating o/p)

6: 0

Now, the order from least to most para fraction:

4 (0) < 6 (0) < 2 (low) <1 (high) <5 (high) <3 (high)

Wait, but what about the order between 1,5,3?

If the substituent is deactivating o/p (like Cl), the para product is still major, but the ring is less reactive. So, the fraction would be high but perhaps less than the activating substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the activating groups lead to more para product because the ring is more reactive, so more substitution occurs, but the para fraction is higher.

Wait, perhaps the para fraction is only about the position, not the reactivity. So, regardless of activating or deactivating, if the substituent directs to para, the fraction is high.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the para fraction is 100% for meta directors. No, wait, meta directors don't direct to para, so the para product is zero.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another approach.

The question is about the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. So, the substances are to be arranged from the lowest para fraction to the highest.

Let me list the substituents and their para fractions:

1) CH3 → o/p-directing, activating → para is major. So, high.

2) COOEt → meta-directing, deactivating → para is negligible. So, low.

3) Cl → o/p-directing, deactivating → para is major. High.

4) NO2 → meta-directing, deactivating → para is negligible. So, low.

5) C2H5 → o/p-directing, activating → para is major. High.

6) COOH → meta-directing, deactivating → para is negligible. So, low.

So, the para fractions are:

Substance 4: 0

Substance 6: 0

Substance 2: low (say 10%)

Substance 1: high (say 70%)

Substance 5: high (say 65%)

Substance 3: high (say 80%)

But wait, another possibility is that for the deactivating o/p directors (like Cl), the para fraction is lower than the activating ones because the ring is less reactive. So, the para product is, say, 60% for Cl, which is less than 70% for CH3.

So, the order of para fractions would be:

4 (0) <6 (0) <2 (10%) <1 (70%) <5 (65%) <3 (60%). Wait, but that doesn't make sense because 5 and 3 would come after 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is:

4 <6 <2 <5 <1 <3

Wait, but that depends on where 5 and 1 stand.

Wait, considering that activating groups (1 and 5) have higher para fractions than deactivating o/p directors (3), but that's not correct because Cl is a deactivating o/p director, but still directs to para.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each substituent's directing effect and the major product.

So, the substituents and their major bromination product:

1) CH3: para is major → high.

2) COOEt: meta is major → low para.

3) Cl: para is major → high.

4) NO2: meta is major → low.

5) C2H5: para is major → high.

6) COOH: meta is major → low.

Now, we need to arrange them from least para to most.

So, the order would be:

4 (0) <6 (0) <2 (low) <1 (high) <5 (high) <3 (high)

Wait, but if 1,5 are similar, then the order between them is unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's activating strength affects the para fraction. So, toluene (1) is more activating than ethylbenzene (5)? No, ethyl is a larger group, so it's a stronger activator.

Wait, ethyl is a stronger activating group than methyl, so maybe in ethylbenzene (5), the para product is even more dominant. So, the para fraction for 5 is higher than 1.

But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the para fractions are similar, so the order would have 2 next, then 4 and 6, then 1,5,3.

But the options given in the problem are:

Options:
A) 4<2<6<3<1<5
B)6<2<4<5<1<3
C)4<6<2<1<5<3
D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, looking at option C: 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

So, 4 and 6 are first (0), then 2 (low), then 1, then 5, then 3 (highest).

But if 3 has the highest para fraction, then option C would end with 3. So, 4 <6 <2 <1 <5 <3.

But I thought 3 is a deactivating o/p director, so the para product is high but less than the activating groups. So maybe 1 and 5 have higher para fractions than 3.

Wait, but I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of the substituents again:

Substance 3 is Cl (deactivating, o/p-directing). Because Cl is ortho/para, the para product is the major, but the ring is less reactive.

Substance 1 is CH3 (activating, o/p). So, the para product is the major.

Substance 5 is C2H5 (activating, o/p). So, para product is major.

So, perhaps the para fractions are:

3 (Cl): high (maybe 60%)

1 (CH3): higher, say 70%

5 (C2H5): higher than 1, say 80%

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction order is:

4 (0) <6 (0) <2 <1 <3 <5.

But I'm not finding a clear way to proceed. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Another approach is to remember that for substituents that are meta directors, the para product isn't formed, so their para fraction is zero.

For o/p directors, the para product is formed. The more activating the substituent, the more the ring is reactive, but the para fraction is already determined by the directing effect.

Wait, but wait, for substituents that are ortho/para directors, the para product is usually a larger fraction because of steric hindrance. So, the para product is major.

So, the order of para fractions would be:

Substituents that are meta directors: 0% → 4,6,2.

Among o/p directors:

Cl (3): high.

CH3 (1): high.

C2H5 (5): high.

But which of these has the highest para fraction?

Wait, perhaps the order is that the stronger activating groups have higher para fractions because the ring is more reactive, leading to more para substitution. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's own bulk affects the para product. For example, bulky substituents may favor para substitution more, as the ortho positions are hindered.

So, ethyl is bulkier than methyl, so in ethylbenzene (5), the para product is more than in toluene (1). So, perhaps the order is 1 <5 <3.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps all o/p directors have similar para fractions, but perhaps the deactivating ones have lower percentages.

Wait, perhaps the para fractions from lowest to highest are:

4<6<2<1<5<3.

Which matches option C.

But looking at the options, option C is 4<6<2<1<5<3.

So, the order would be 4 (0), 6 (0), 2 (low), 1 (high), 5 (higher), 3 (highest).

So, the correct order would be 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Which is option C.


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer for the given substances undergoing electrophilic bromination, we analyze the substituents' electronic effects and directing behaviors:

1. **C6H5-CH3 (Toluene)**: The methyl group is an **activating, ortho/para-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the para position due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Thus, the para-isomer is major.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester)**: The ester group is a **deactivating, meta-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, resulting in a negligible para-isomer.

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorobenzene)**: The chlorine atom is a **deactivating, ortho/para-directing group**. Bromination occurs at both ortho and para positions, with the para-isomer being the major product due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitrobenzene)**: The nitro group is a **strongly deactivating, meta-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, resulting in a negligible para-isomer.

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethylbenzene)**: The ethyl group is an **activating, ortho/para-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the para position due to steric hindrance at the ortho positions. Thus, the para-isomer is major.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Benzoic Acid)**: The carboxylic acid group is a **deactivating, meta-directing group**. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta position, resulting in a negligible para-isomer.

### Weight Fraction of the Para-Isomer
- **Substances 4 (NO2) and 6 (COOH)**: Both are meta-directing, so their para-isomer fractions are **0%**.
- **Substance 2 (COOEt)**: A meta-directing group, so the para-isomer fraction is **low** (~10%).
- **Substances 1 (CH3) and 5 (C2H5)**: Both are activating, ortho/para-directing groups, so the para-isomer is major. Ethylbenzene (5) likely has a slightly higher para-isomer fraction than toluene (1) due to the bulkier ethyl group favoring para substitution.
- **Substance 3 (Cl)**: A deactivating, ortho/para-directing group, so the para-isomer is major, likely the highest among the o/p-directing groups.

### Final Order of Increasing Para-Isomer Fraction
From lowest to highest:  
**4 (0%) < 6 (0%) < 2 (low) < 1 (high) < 5 (high) < 3 (highest)**.

This corresponds to **Option C**: 4 < 6 < 2 < 1 < 5 < 3.

ANSWER: C
