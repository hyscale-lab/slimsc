Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry of product 3. Let me break it down step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is about a series of reactions starting with toluene. Let's outline what's happening in each step.

First step: Toluene is treated with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. From what I remember, nitric acid is a nitrating agent, and when toluene reacts with it, it undergoes nitration. The nitronium ion (from nitric and sulfuric acids) acts as the electrophile. Toluene's methyl group is activating, so the nitro group will substitute into the ring. Since toluene is symmetric, the nitration should occur in the para position. Wait, but wait, toluene has a methyl group which is an activating group, so the nitration is directed to the ortho, meta positions as well, but which is more favored? Oh right, for nitration, the para is the major product because of steric hindrance in the ortho position. So product 1 is para-nitrotoluene.

Second step: Product 1 is treated with MnO2 and H2SO4. MnO2 is a strong oxidizing agent, especially in acidic conditions. I think this would oxidize the methyl group attached to the benzene ring. Wait, para-nitrotoluene has a methyl group attached. When oxidized, the methyl (CH3) becomes COOH. So the product 2 should be para-nitrobenzoic acid. Because the oxidation of toluene's CH3 to COOH would happen under strong acid conditions with MnO2, right?

Third step: Product 2 is treated with acetone and aqueous sodium hydroxide. Acetone is a ketone, and in basic conditions, it might undergo some kind of nucleophilic addition. Wait, but product 2 is a nitrobenzoic acid. Could this be a case for the benzoin condensation? Hmm, benzoin condensation usually involves the base and a ketone or aldehyde to form a new carbon-carbon bond.

Wait, but wait. Benzoin condensation requires a strong base and a ketone or aldehyde. The benzoin condensation leads to the formation of a Î²-hydroxy ketone or something
