Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again and think through each part carefully.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Let me break down each step to understand what's happening.

First, 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH at 240°C, producing a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum has a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which probably indicates a carbonyl group (C=O). The ¹H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), and 1.94 (2H). 

Hmm, the reaction conditions with KOH and heating make me think of elimination or dehydrohalogenation. Since it's dibrominated, maybe it's an E2 elimination. But wait, if it's a vicinal dihalide, elimination would form an alkene. But the IR shows a carbonyl, which suggests maybe a ketone or an ester or something else with a carbonyl.

Wait, when dibromides react with strong bases like KOH, another possibility is that they undergo dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes, but maybe under these conditions, something else happens. Oh, wait! Maybe it's a double elimination. If the two bromines are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form a double bond, but since it's 1,3-dibromoadamantane, the two Br are on carbons 1 and 3. So elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C3? Wait, no, wait. If it's 1,3-dibromo, then the two Brs are on carbons 1 and 3 of adamantane. So when KOH is added, maybe each Br leaves, but since it's a dihalide, perhaps two elimination steps happen.

Wait, but I think the more likely scenario is that each Br is eliminated, but perhaps with the same base. Wait, another thought: when vicinal dihalides (like 1,2-dibromo) react with KOH, they eliminate to form alkenes. But 1,3-dibromoadamantane isn't vicinal. So
