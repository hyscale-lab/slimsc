Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to understand what's going on. 

The question is about a star with some spots on it, and how those spots affect the star's brightness as observed from Earth. Then, the question is asking what size of an exoplanet would cause the same brightness variation if it were transiting the star instead. 

Alright, let's break down the details. The star has a radius equal to the Sun's, so R_star is same as R_sun. The star's effective temperature is 6000K. Now, one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%. The spots are cooler, I suppose, since they're dark. The temperature difference between the spots and the rest is 1000K. So, if the star's Teff is 6000K, the spots must be at 5000K.

When the star rotates, the spots come into and go out of view from our perspective. This causes the observed brightness to vary because the spots are darker, so when more of them are visible, the star appears dimmer. The problem says this situation can resemble an exoplanet causing a dip in brightness when it transits the star. 

The question is asking, if instead of spots, there was a planet transiting, what would the planet's radius have to be to produce the same amplitude in the light curve. So, we're comparing the brightness variation caused by the spots to that of a planet transit.

First, I need to figure out the brightness change due to the spots. Then, I'll compare that to the brightness change a planet would cause during transit.

Let me think: the brightness variation (amplitude) is the difference in flux when the spots are visible. Since the spots are cooler, when they're on the side facing us, the total flux goes down.

The key here is the concept of the "filling factor," which is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. The filling factor here is 20%, or 0.2. But wait, the problem says only one hemisphere is covered. Hmm, does that mean the spots are only on a hemisphere, so the total area is 0.5 (the hemisphere) multiplied by the filling factor? Or is the filling factor already considering the entire star? Let me read that again. 

Wait, the problem says, "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." So the entire hemisphere is covered, but the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. Or wait, maybe the filling factor is 20% of the entire star's surface. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The star's surface area is 4πR². A hemisphere is 2πR². If the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Alternatively, if the filling factor
