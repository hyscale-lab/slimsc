Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you need to consider neutralization reactions. Also, strong acids and bases will completely dissociate, right?

Let me list out what each solution contributes. CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. So it won't fully dissociate. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base—barium hydroxide. It should completely dissociate into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions.

Wait, but when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I think I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- ions from each solution, then see if they neutralize each other.

Let me start by finding the moles for each component.

First, CH3COOH: volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Molarity is 0.1 M, so moles = 0.5 L * 0.1 mol/L = 0.05 mol. Since it's a weak acid, it will only donate some H+ ions, but maybe I can account for that later after neutralization.

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M, so moles = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 mol HCl. Because HCl is strong, each mole gives one mole H+.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M, so moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two OH- ions, so moles of OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Wait, but wait—that's the OH- contribution. So total H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, and OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol. Let's see if these can neutralize each other before considering the acetic acid.

So the H+ from HCl will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2. The neutralization reaction would be H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ available: 0.08 mol. Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol. So H+ will completely neutralize some of the OH-.

H+ will neutralize 0.08 mol OH-, leaving OH- as 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

But wait, what about the acetic acid? Acetic acid is a weak acid, CH3COOH. It's a source of H+ too, but because it's weak, it doesn't release as much as a strong acid. So I need to calculate how much it contributes.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about whether the strong acid and strong base will completely neutralize each other, and then what's left will determine the pH based on the remaining H+ or OH-.

Wait, let me rephrase. The HCl (strong acid) will donate 0.08 mol H+. The Ba(OH)2 (strong base) will donate 0.18 mol OH-.

So when they mix, they react: H+ + OH- → H2O.

So moles of H+ available: 0.08
