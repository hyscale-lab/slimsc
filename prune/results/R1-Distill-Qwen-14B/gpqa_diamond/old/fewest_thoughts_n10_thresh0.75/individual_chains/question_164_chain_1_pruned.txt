Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting around a common center of mass, right? The question is about figuring out which system is more massive and by what factor.

So let's see. The problem gives me two systems, system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. I remember that the orbital period is the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other once. So the period here is the same as the orbital period of the binary system.

Then, there are radial velocity (RV) observations. Radial velocity variations are when we see the stars moving towards and away from us, causing a Doppler shift in their spectral lines. The amplitude of these variations gives us information about the masses of the stars. Oh right, the more massive a star is, the smaller its velocity because it's closer to the center of mass. So the less massive star moves more.

In system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. So one star has a bigger velocity (10) and the other smaller (5). Similarly, system_2 has 15 and 10. So the velocities are higher for system_2.

Wait, but how does this relate to mass? I think the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the ratio of the masses. So if one star's velocity is twice the other, then the masses are in the inverse ratio. So m1/m2 = v2/v1.

But wait, in a binary system, the two stars orbit with velocities v1 and v2. The mass ratio q is m2/m1 = v1/v2. Because the more massive star moves slower. So the sum of the velocities gives the total, but the individual masses are determined by the velocity ratio.

Also, I remember that the total mass of the system depends on the velocities and the orbital period. The formula for the mass function might come into play here because we're dealing with RVs. The mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 ), but without knowing the inclination angle (i), which is the angle of the orbit relative to our line of sight, we can't directly get the masses. Wait, but if both systems are eclipsing, that usually means that the inclination is
