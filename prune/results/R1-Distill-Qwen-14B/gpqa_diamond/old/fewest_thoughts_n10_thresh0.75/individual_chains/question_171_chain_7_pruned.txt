Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrophilic substitution reactions. But let me try to break it down.

The question is about the para-isomer yields in an electrophilic substitution reaction with bromine. There are six substances listed, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups. I need to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that the substituents on the benzene ring can direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions—ortho, meta, or para. Also, some substituents are more deactivating than others, which affects where the substitution occurs.

Let me list what I know about each substituent:

1) Substance 1: C6H5-CH3. The group is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl group. Activating groups direct the incoming electrophile to the ortho and para positions. Since it's a monobromo reaction, only one substitution occurs.

2) Substance 2: C6H5-COOC2H5. That's an ethyl ester group (COOEt). The carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, so it's a deactivating group. Esters are meta directors because they deactivating, but wait, wait. Wait, esters have a carbonyl which is electron-withdrawing, so they are meta directors. So the bromine will add in the meta position, meaning the para isomer might be less favored, or maybe not? Wait, no. If it's a meta director, the substitution is more in meta, so the para would have a lower yield. Wait, but wait, in some cases, substituents can have more than one effect. Let me think again. The ester group (like COOR) is electron-withdrawing by the carbonyl, which makes the ring less reactive—so it's a deactivating group. And because it's an electron-withdrawing group, it's a meta director. So the bromine would add more in the meta positions, so the para isomer would have a lower yield than, say, if it was a para director? Wait, but the question is about the para-isomer's weight fraction in the product. So if the substituent is meta-directing, the para position isn't the main spot for substitution. So the para product would be less in that case.

3) Substance 3: C6H5-Cl. Chlorine is attached. Chlorine is a halogen. Wait, halogens are a bit tricky. They have an inductive effect (which is electron-withdrawing, deactivating) and resonance (which is donating, activating). But overall, since the inductive effect is stronger, Cl is a deactivating group but is ortho/para directing. So when Cl is attached, the incoming electrophile goes to ortho and para positions. So substitution can occur at both, but which is more favored? I think for Cl, the para position is more favored than ortho in some cases, but I'm not exactly sure. Wait, no. For halogens, the para isomer is usually the major one because the ortho positions are hindered
