Alright, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, okay, let me think. Let's break it down step by step.

The question says there are two planets, Planet1 and Planet2, orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 solar radii, and effective temperature 6300 K. The planets have their own masses and radii too. The key here is finding the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature—right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5. And since both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term is the same for both, so it'll cancel out in the ratio.

But wait, how do I find the distance of each planet from the star? Oh, right, the RV method gives the mass and the orbit's effect on the star's velocity, which relates to the planet's orbital period and distance. But wait, the question provides some shifts in the forbidden line [OI], which I think is used to detect the planets. So the RV method measures the Doppler shift. Let me think about how that relates to the mass and the orbital period.

Wait, the RV method gives the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which depends on the planet's mass and the inclination of the orbit. But for this problem, I might not need the actual distance, but perhaps the ratio of their distances based on the RV shifts they cause.

Wait, the problem states that Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. Oh, because the RV method's Doppler shift is proportional to the mass of the planet and inversely proportional to the orbital distance. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact relation. Let me recall: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = (v) something involving the planet's mass and the star's mass and the orbital period. Hmm, the exact formula might be a bit tricky, but maybe I don't need the exact distances, just the ratio.

Alternatively, maybe the shifts given can be used to find the ratio of the masses, but wait, the problem states the masses already: Planet1 is 7 Earth masses, Planet2 is 5. Hmm, but wait, the RV method is more sensitive to the mass and the planet's orbital period. Oh, but in this case, since both planets are detected via RV, perhaps the Doppler shifts can be used to find the ratio of their semi-major axes, which would affect their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the distance from the star because T_eq is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So the closer a planet is to the star, the higher its equilibrium temperature.

So, T_eq ∝ T_star * sqrt(R_star/(a)). Because the star's temperature is given, and R_star is given, the only variable is a, the distance.

So, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2a) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) ), but same albedo so that term is same. So, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2 / a1 ) because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a). So T_ratio = sqrt( a2 / a1 ).

So I need to find the ratio a2/a1 to compute T_ratio.

But how do I find a1 and a2? Since both are in circular orbits, and detected via RV method, which tells us the semi-amplitude of velocity. The Doppler shift relates to the star's velocity towards and away from us. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * P) / (2π c) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3) )

Wait, that might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of Kepler's third law. For a planet orbiting a star, the period P is related to the semi-major axis a and the star's mass M. The formula is P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³.

So, rearranging, a³ = (G M_star P²) / (4 π² )

But wait, I don't have the periods of the planets. Hmm, but the RV method gives the semi-amplitude K, which is related to the velocity of the star. So K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity, which is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / (M_star + M_p ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ) * ( sin i )

Assuming circular orbits, e=0, so the term is 1. Also, since both planets are detected, their sin i is approximately 1 (edge-on, so sin i ≈1), so that term is 1.

So K = ( G M_p / (M_star) )^(1/3) * ( 1 ) * (1/(2π)) * ( 1/(a^{2/3} )) )

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relation between K, M_p, and a.

Wait, another formula I remember is K = (v) = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / a )^(1/3) * ( 1/(2π) ) ) * (sin i) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the ratio K1/K2. Since the Doppler shifts are given, which I think are the semi-amplitudes K.

So, K is the star's velocity. The shifts are given as 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. But wait, the same line is observed for both, so the shifts would be proportional to the velocity semi-amplitudes.

So, K1 = 0.03 Å, K2 = 0.04 Å.

Wait, but 1 Å is 1e-10 meters. So the actual velocities are K = (λ Δλ / λ0 ) * c, where Δλ is the shift. Wait, no, the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ0 = v/c, so the velocity v is c * (Δλ/λ0).

So for each planet, the velocity is K = c * (Δλ / λ0 )

For Planet1: K1 = c * (0.03 Å / 6300 Å )

Similarly, K2 = c * (0.04 Å / 6300 Å )

But since c is the same for both, the ratio K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So K1/K2 = 3/4.

Now, K is related to the planet's mass and the orbital distance. The formula for K can be written as:

K = ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) * (a)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, let's get the exact formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P )/(2π c) ) ]^(1/3) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 ) )

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, I can use the formula that relates K to the planet's mass and the distance a.

Another approach: the relation between K and a is derived from the fact that the star and planet orbit their common center of mass. The star's velocity is K, and the planet's velocity is (M_star / M_p) * K. The orbital period P is the same for both.

Using Kepler's third law in the form:

P² = (4 π² a³) / ( G (M_star + M_p) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (since M_star is 1.5 solar masses, and planets are Earth-sized, so M_p is negligible compared to M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

So,

P² ≈ (4 π² a³) / ( G M_star )

From this, a^3 ∝ P² M_star / (4 π² )

But I'm not sure that's helpful yet. Let's think about the RV semi-amplitude K.

The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * M_p) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) ]^(1/3) * ( 1 / a )^(1/3) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so:

K ≈ [ (G M_p) / M_star )^(1/3) ] * (1/a)^(1/3 )

So, K = ( G M_p / ( M_star a ) )^(1/3 )

Taking the cube of both sides: K^3 = G M_p / ( M_star a )

Rearranging, a = G M_p / ( M_star K^3 ) * (1/(G)) )

Wait, perhaps better to write a in terms of K, M_p, M_star.

From K^3 = G M_p / ( M_star a ), solving for a:

a = G M_p / ( M_star K^3 )

Wait, no, wait: K^3 = (G M_p) / ( M_star a ) ), so rearranged:

a = ( G M_p ) / ( M_star K^3 )

Wait, but let's think about this again. Let's write the equation:

K = [ (G M_p) / (M_star a ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

K^3 = (G M_p) / (M_star a )

So,

a = (G M_p) / ( M_star K^3 )

But I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check the units. G has units of m³/(kg s²), M_p in kg, M_star in kg, K in m/s, so G M_p has units m³/s². M_star K^3 has units kg (m/s)^3 = kg m³/s³.

So, [G M_p]/[M_star K^3] would be (m³/s²)/(kg m³/s³) ) = (1/kg) * s. Hmm, that doesn't make sense for a, which should be meters. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the correct expression for K. Let me look it up in notes: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e²) ) ]^ (1/3) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 + M_p/M_star )^(1/3) a )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here, perhaps another approach is better.

Another approach: For a circular orbit, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / a^(1/3) )

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I can think about the ratio of K1 and K2.

K ∝ (M_p) / a^(1/3)

Wait, because K is proportional to (M_p)^(1/3) * (G)^(1/3) * (something else). Hmm, perhaps using the relation:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / a )^(1/3 )

Wait, perhaps another way. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_star) * a ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (2 π) )^(1/3) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But since e=0, it's 1. So,

K = ( (G M_p ) / (M_star a ) )^(1/3 ) * (1/(2π) )^(1/3 )

Hmm, but perhaps I can take the ratio of K1 and K2.

K1 / K2 = [ (M_p1 / a1 ) / (M_p2 / a2 ) ]^(1/3 )

So,

(K1/K2)^3 = (M_p1 * a2 ) / (M_p2 * a1 )

So,

a2 / a1 = [ (K1/K2)^3 * (M_p2 / M_p1) ) ]

Wait, because:

(K1/K2)^3 = ( (M_p1 a2 ) / ( M_p2 a1 ) )

So,

a2 / a1 = (K1^3 / K2^3) * (M_p2 / M_p1 )

So,

a2/a1 = ( (K1/K2)^3 ) * ( M_p2 / M_p1 )

Given that K1/K2 is 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4.

So,

a2/a1 = ( (3/4)^3 ) * (5 /7 )

Compute that:

(3/4)^3 = 27/64 ≈ 0.421875

5/7 ≈ 0.714286

Multiply them: 0.421875 * 0.714286 ≈ let's see, 0.421875 * 0.714 ≈ 0.421875 * (0.7 + 0.014) ) = 0.421875 *0.7 = 0.2953125, plus 0.421875 *0.014≈ 0.00590625, so total ≈ 0.2953125 +0.0059≈ 0.3012.

So a2/a1 ≈ 0.3012.

Wait, but that would mean that a2 is about 0.3 times a1. So Planet2 is orbiting much closer to the star than Planet1.

Wait, but then the equilibrium temperature ratio T1/T2 is sqrt(a2/a1) because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(a).

Wait, no, wait: T_eq ∝ sqrt(R_star) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) ) * T_star / sqrt(a)

Wait, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5.

But since albedo is same, and R_star is same, the ratio T1/T2 is sqrt( a2/(a1) ) * ( T1_star / T2_star ), but here T_star is same for both. So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So, with a2/a1 ≈ 0.3012, sqrt(0.3012) ≈ 0.549.

So T1 is about 0.55 times T2, so the ratio of T1 to T2 is ~0.55.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close to this estimate. So the answer would be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_{\text{star}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{2a}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \text{albedo}}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out in the ratio. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital distance \(a\), so:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

To find \(a_1\) and \(a_2\), we use the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude \(K\), which is proportional to the planet's mass \(M_p\) and inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital distance \(a\). The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}}
\]

For the ratio of the distances, we have:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{M_{p2}}{M_{p1}}
\]

The RV shifts are given as \(K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å}\) and \(K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å}\), so:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Substituting the masses of the planets (\(M_{p1} = 7 \, M_{\text{Earth}}, M_{p2} = 5 \, M_{\text{Earth}}\)):

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 \cdot \frac{5}{7}
\]

First, calculate \(\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{64} \approx 0.421875
\]

Next, calculate \(\frac{5}{7}\):

\[
\frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714286
\]

Multiply these results:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} = 0.421875 \cdot 0.714286 \approx 0.3012
\]

Now, compute the ratio of equilibrium temperatures:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.3012} \approx 0.549
\]

This value is closest to option C, which is approximately \(0.53\). Therefore, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is:

**Answer: C**
