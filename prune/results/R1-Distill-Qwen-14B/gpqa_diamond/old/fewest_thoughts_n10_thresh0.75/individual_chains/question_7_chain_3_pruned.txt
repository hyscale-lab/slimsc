Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the annihilation of high-energy gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. Hmm, I remember that the CMB is this radiation leftover from the Big Bang, and it has a certain energy. The question is about the energy of gamma-rays whose lifetime in the universe is limited by this annihilation process.

The reaction given is gamma-gamma → e+ e-. So, high-energy gamma-rays are annihilating with CMB photons to produce electron-positron pairs. The question is asking at what gamma energy this process becomes significant enough to limit their lifetime.

I remember that when particles interact, their interaction rate depends on the cross-section and the density of the target particles. So, for a gamma-ray to annihilate, it needs to interact with a CMB photon. The average photon energy of the CMB is given as 1e-3 eV. Wait, that's pretty low. CMB photons are usually in the microwave range, around a few hundred microkelvin, which is about 1e-4 eV. Oh wait, the question says 1e-3 eV, which is higher than I thought. Maybe it's an approximate value.

So, for the gamma and photon to annihilate, their combined energy needs to be enough to create the electron-positron pair. The threshold energy for pair production is when the invariant mass squared s is equal to (2m_e c²)^2, where m_e is the electron mass. Because the electron mass is about 0.511 MeV, so s would be (2 * 0.511 MeV)^2 = (1.022 MeV)^2.

Wait, but in the center-of-momentum frame, the sum of their energies should be at least twice the electron rest mass. Or wait, in the lab frame, perhaps the condition is a bit different. I think the invariant quantity here is the square of the total four-momentum. So, the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1c + p2c)^2, but since the photons are traveling in opposite directions, their momenta might subtract, but wait, no—wait, if the gamma and CMB photon are moving in opposite directions, their momenta vectors would point in opposite directions. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for the threshold energy is when the product of the photon energies in the center-of-momentum frame is equal to (m_e c^2)^2. So, for two photons with energies E1 and E2, the condition for pair production is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c - p2 c)^2 = (2m_e c^2)^2, because if they are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite, so the spatial part would be (p1 - p2) c squared. Wait, but if E1 is the gamma energy and E2 the CMB photon, which is much smaller, then in the lab frame where the CMB is isotropic, maybe the gamma is moving in a direction where the CMB photon is moving towards it. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to use the condition in terms of invariant mass.

So the invariant s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since photons have E = p c, so s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (E1 + E2)^2 cos(theta), where theta is the angle between their directions. Wait, no, that's for when they are moving in arbitrary directions. Wait, but in the case where you're considering a collision, like a head-on collision, theta is 180 degrees, so cos(theta) is -1.

Wait, in the case where the photons are moving in opposite directions, their momenta are opposite. So, the spatial part would be (p1 c - p2 c) but in opposite directions. Let me think again. If the gamma is moving in direction +x and the CMB photon is moving in -x, then their momenta vectors
