Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about arranging six different benzene derivatives in order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer when they undergo bromination with excess bromine. Each of these substances (1-6) has a substituent on the benzene ring, and I need to figure out which substituent directs the incoming bromine more towards the para position. 

First, I remember that substituents on a benzene ring can be either activating or deactivating. Activating groups (like -NH2, -OH, -OCH3) are electron-donating, which make the ring more reactive and direct incoming electrophiles to certain positions. Deactivating groups (like -NO2, -COOH, -Cl) are electron-withdrawing and make the ring less reactive, but they still can direct the electrophile depending on their nature.

The position of substitution (ortho, meta, para) depends on the substituent. Some groups are strong activating and direct incoming groups to para, especially if they're bulky because they can't fit in the ortho positions. Others, like deactivating groups, may direct to meta positions because they're electron-withdrawing.

Let me list each substituent and think about their directing effects:

1) C6H5-CH3: The substituent is a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group, electron-donating through sigma bonds. It's an ortho/para director. So bromine can add to ortho or para positions. But since the substituent is a bulky group (methyl isn't too bulky, though), it might favor para more than ortho. Wait, no, actually in case of substituents that are activating and can fit ortho, the ortho position is possible but sometimes the para is more favored because of steric hindrance when the substituent is bulky. Wait, methyl is not that bulky. So for methyl, both ortho and para are possible, but which is more major? For example, in toluene, the para isomer is major because the methyl is activating but when the substituent is in the ortho position, it's more crowded, so the para gets more product. So for substitution, the para is major. Wait, but wait, I think that for methyl groups, the major product is para because when you have a substituent that's a good activating group, the para position is more favored when possible. Or is it the case that in toluene bromination, the major product is para? I think for toluene, the para product is the major one because the methyl is an activating group, so the ring is activated, and the para position is more favored. So methyl is ortho/para, but in case of competition, para is the major product.

Wait, but sometimes when the substituent is bulky, the para isomer is favored because ortho would be too crowded. But methyl is not so bulky. So I think in toluene, the para is the major product, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should look up the trend. Oh, right, I remember that in toluene, the para isomer is more than ortho. So when substituents
