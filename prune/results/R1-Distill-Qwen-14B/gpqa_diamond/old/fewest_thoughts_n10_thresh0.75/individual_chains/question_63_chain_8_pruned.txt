Okay, so I've got this physics problem to solve, and I'm kinda new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem is about a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I remember that diatomic molecules have two atoms bonded together, like O2 or HCl. The model here is the non-rigid rotor model, which I think is different from the rigid rotor because it allows for some stretching, right? So the molecule can vibrate as it rotates.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that, when absorbed, would take the molecule to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Oh, right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. So the next state after that would be the first excited state.

The given data: Mx is 20 amu (atomic mass units), My is 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, the energy levels for rotation and vibration are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the total energy is the sum of rotational and vibrational energies. But the question says the model is the rotation-vibration model, so perhaps it's considering both aspects together.

But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest state. So what's the next state? I think the molecule can either increase its rotational energy, vibrational energy, or both. But the question says "lowest possible energy" next state, so maybe it's the next state overall, which would be the lowest possible higher energy state. That would probably be a change in the vibrational state, because the vibrational energy levels are spaced further apart than rotational ones. Or wait, depends on the specific values.

Wait, no, wait. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (n=0) but the lowest rotational state (J=0). So the next state would be either increasing the rotational quantum number or increasing the vibrational quantum number. But which transition requires less energy? Because the photon's energy must match the energy difference.

So, first, I need to compute the energies for the
