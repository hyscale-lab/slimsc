Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read through the question again to understand the reactions involved.

The first reaction is solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form product C, which is bright red. Then, C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous. Next, C reacts with water to reform A and two different acids F and G, where F is strong and G is weak. Lastly, gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent.

I think I should start by figuring out what the substances A, B, C, D, etc., could be.

Let me think about the first reaction: A + 8 B → C. Since B is a gas and reacts in an 8-equivalent ratio, maybe B is something like O2 or Cl2, which are diatomic gases. But 8 equivalents is a lot. Wait, 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of B per mole of A if it's a 1:8 ratio. Hmm, maybe B is a diatomic molecule because 8 is a multiple of 2, but I'm not sure yet.

The product C is bright red. Bright red solids are often things like iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) or maybe some transition metal compounds. Alternatively, maybe the red color is indicative of something like permanganate ions, but those are usually in solution. Wait, another possibility is that C could be a metal sulfide, but those are often black. Hmm, maybe C is something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a product involving sulfur.

Wait, considering the reactions, let's think about the other clues. C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. F is a strong acid, G a weak acid. So when C is hydrolyzed, it produces two acids. One strong, one weak.

Strong acids include HCl, H2SO4, HNO3, etc. Weak acids include things like acetic acid, H3PO4 (which is moderately weak), or maybe something like H2S (but that's a weak acid but not that strong). Hmm.

So C reacts with water to form A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). Let me think about the possibilities.

Another reaction is D + B → H, which is a solvent. Since B is a gas and D also is a gas, perhaps B is O2 and D is something like Cl2 or another diatomic gas. Or maybe B is Cl2 and D is O2? Or perhaps B is H2 and D is O2, but then H would be H2O, which is a solvent.

Wait, D and B reacting in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If H is H2O, then B and D could be H2 and O2. Because 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But the ratio here is 1:1 for D and B, so maybe D2 + B2 → 2 H? No, wait, if D and B are both diatomic, then their reaction would be D2 + B2 → 2 H something. Hmm, but H is a solvent, like H2O.

Wait, perhaps D is Cl2 and B is
