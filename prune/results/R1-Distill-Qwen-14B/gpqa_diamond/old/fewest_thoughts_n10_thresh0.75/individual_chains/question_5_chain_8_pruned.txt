Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my QM, but I'll think this through.

The problem says we're looking at the operator P, which is a vector operator along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue we're interested in is +ħ/2. The operator P has components P_x, P_y, and P_z, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right. The operator P is a vector operator, so it's like P = P_x x + P_y y + P_z z, where x, y, z are the direction unit vectors. But n is in the x-z plane, so n would have components (nx, 0, nz), because it's in the x-z plane, so the y-component is zero. And since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

But wait, the operator we need is P along the direction n. So, the operator in question is P·n, right? Because the operator along an arbitrary direction is the dot product of the vector operator P with the unit vector n. So, the operator is P·n = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So the operator simplifies to P·n = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

The eigenvalue equation is then (P·n) |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>. Because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So, the first thing I need to do is construct the matrix for P·n. Let me figure out each component matrix.

Given:
P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, each component is scaled by ħ/2.

Therefore, P·n = ħ/2 [n_x * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute the matrix:

The matrix would be:

[ [ (ħ/2) n_z * 1 , (ħ/2) n_x * 1 ] 
, [ (ħ/2) n_x * 1 , (ħ/2) n_z (-1) ] ]

Wait, let me see. Matrix for P_x: when n_x is multiplied, it's (0 1; 1 0) scaled by ħ/2. Similarly, P_z is diagonal with 1 and -1 scaled by ħ/2. So adding the two scaled by n_x and n_z:

The (1,1) element is (ħ/2)(n_z * 1).
The (1,2) element is (ħ/2)(n_x * 1).
The (2,1) element is same as (1,2) because P
