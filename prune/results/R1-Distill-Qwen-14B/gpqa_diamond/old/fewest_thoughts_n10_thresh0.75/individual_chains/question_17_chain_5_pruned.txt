Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see what it's about. It's about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution with a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Hmm, I think I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it forms complexes with metal ions like calcium.

The problem says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. The pH is ideal, which probably means that the EDTA is in its active form, so I don't have to worry about the protonation states. The temperature is 25°C, which I think might affect EDTA's stability, but maybe that's already accounted for in the given formation constant.

The formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is given as 5x10^10. Wait, formation constants are the equilibrium constants for the formation of the complex. So the reaction is Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2- (I think that's the complex). The K for this reaction is 5e10, which is a large number, meaning the complex is quite stable. So the reaction favors the formation of the complex.

But the question is about the concentration of free calcium ions in solution. Oh right, because when you have a complex like this, the concentration of the free metal ions is very low because most of the Ca²+ is tied up in the complex with EDTA.

So let's think about the relationship between the concentrations. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant K is equal to [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But wait, since the problem is giving the concentration of the complex as 0.02 M, that's the concentration of CaEDTA^2-.

Wait, but wait. The initial concentration is 0.02 M of the complex. Let's assume that the solution is prepared by dissolving the complex, so the initial [CaEDTA^2-] is 0.02 M. Then, it dissociates a little bit into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

But wait, EDTA is a hexadentate ligand, so it's usually in a form that can bind multiple protons. Oh, but the problem states the pH is ideal, which I think would mean that EDTA is in the Y^4- form, so the active form. So
