Okay, so I have this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking for the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are four different distances in meters.

Wait, I remember that the mean lifetime of a particle is related to its width. Oh right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ is ħ divided by Γ. But wait, what's ħ? Oh, the reduced Planck constant, which is about 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s.

So first, I need to compute the lifetime τ. But Γ is given in MeV, and ħ is in GeV. Let me convert Γ to GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV. So τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = let me calculate that. 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32 is approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. Let me double-check that calculation: 6.582 / 0.32 is about 20.56875, so yes
