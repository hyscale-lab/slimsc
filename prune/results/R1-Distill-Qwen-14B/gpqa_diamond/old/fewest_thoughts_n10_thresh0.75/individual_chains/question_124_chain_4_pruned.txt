Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is.

So, the problem is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly but travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector's radius is 30 meters. Now, the question asks what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, the key here is figuring out how the Lorentz factor affects the distance the particles travel before decaying. Because if a higher fraction reach the detector walls, it must mean that they're traveling further before decaying, right?

I remember that the proper lifetime of a particle is the lifetime measured in its rest frame. But when it's moving at relativistic speeds, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame (the detector's frame) is longer due to time dilation. The time dilation factor is the Lorentz factor gamma. So, the observed lifetime is gamma times the proper lifetime.

The distance a particle travels before decaying is velocity multiplied by the time it lives. Since the particles are moving at ultra-relativistic velocities, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So, the distance L is v * t, and since v ≈ c, L ≈ c * gamma * tau, where tau is the proper lifetime.

Wait, but in this problem, the fraction of particles reaching the detector walls depends on the distance they travel. So, the detector has a radius R (30 meters). So, for a particle to reach the wall, the distance it travels (L) must be at least R. But I think it's more about the decay probability. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a certain distance is related to the mean decay length.

Wait, another approach: the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that a particle decays before traveling a distance x is 1 - exp(-x/(c tau)). So, the fraction that reach the detector walls is exp(-R/(c tau)), because that's the probability they haven't decayed after traveling R meters.

But wait, let me confirm. The decay length is c tau, the average distance a particle travels before decaying. The probability that
