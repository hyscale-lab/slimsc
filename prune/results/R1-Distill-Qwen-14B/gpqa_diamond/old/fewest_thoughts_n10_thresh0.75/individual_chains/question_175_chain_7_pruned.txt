Okay, so I've got this physics problem about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism classes that oscillating charges emit electromagnetic radiation. The question is about the power radiated in the radiation zone, specifically about the fraction of the maximum power at a certain angle and the form of the function f.

Let me try to break this down. The setup says it's a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. So, I'm picturing something like a prolate spheroid, which is kinda like a stretched sphere. Because it's oscillating, it should emit radiation, and the wavelength of this radiation is lambda.

The problem states that in the radiation zone, the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta (with the z-axis). The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, as well as the form of f.

I think the key here is the radiation pattern of an oscillating dipole. Since the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating along the z-axis, it probably behaves similarly to a dipole radiator. Dipoles have specific radiation patterns in the far field.

From what I remember, the electric field of a dipole in the far zone depends on the angle theta. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum along the equator (theta=90 degrees) and decreases as you move towards the poles (theta=0 and 180 degrees). Wait, no, actually, wait. For a dipole, the radiation is maximum at theta=90 degrees, and it falls off as (1 + cos^2(theta)) in the far field. So the intensity, which is proportional to the square of the electric field, would have a maximum at theta=90.

But wait, wait, I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The dipole's radiation pattern: the intensity in the far field is proportional to sin^2(theta). Because the dipole's radiation is strongest perpendicular to its axis. So yes, maximum at theta=90 degrees, and it's zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180). So the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta). That means when theta is 30 degrees, sin(theta) is 0.5, so sin^2(theta) is 0.25.

Wait, but the question says the maximum power is A. So the function f would be the power per unit solid angle. The solid angle element is dÎ© = sin(theta) dtheta dphi. So the radiation pattern's dependence on theta is given by the angular part of the far field.

Wait, but the function f is power per unit solid angle, so f(theta) would be proportional to sin^2(theta). Because the power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to the intensity, which for a dipole is proportional to sin^2(theta).

So the maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees, where sin^2(theta) is 1. At theta=30 degrees, sin^2(theta) is (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So the fraction of A radiated at theta=30 degrees is 1/4.

Wait, but wait. Is the function f equal to
