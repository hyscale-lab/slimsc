Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see what I remember. The question says it's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it oscillates, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and the angle θ from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ = 30 degrees and the form of f.

Alright, so I think this relates to antenna radiation patterns and how power is distributed in different directions. Oh right, for a dipole antenna, the radiation pattern is a function of θ. I remember that the radiated power per unit solid angle for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but wait, is that the case here? Or is it different because the charge distribution is oscillating?

Wait, but the problem says it's an oscillating charge distribution, so maybe it's similar to a dipole's radiation. Oh, right, a dipole antenna's radiation is based on oscillating charges. So the radiation pattern should be similar.

The power per unit solid angle (which is the intensity) for a dipole is given by I proportional to ( sin²θ )/( something ). Wait, no, wait: I think the intensity pattern for a dipole is actually proportional to (1 + cos²θ). Or maybe it's sin^2 θ? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the radiation pattern for a dipole is that the intensity is maximum at the equator, at θ = 90 degrees, and zero at the poles (θ=0 and 180). Wait, no, wait: no, wait a second. No, the dipole's radiation pattern peaks at θ=90 degrees because that's where the magnetic field is strongest, but the intensity, which is the power per unit area per unit solid angle, actually depends on sin²θ because the area elements on a sphere are dΩ = sinθ dθ dφ. So maybe the intensity is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The dipole radiation's electric field is given by E proportional to (1/r) * sinθ e^{i(kr - ωt)} times some function. The intensity, which is the time-averaged Poynting vector, for a dipole is proportional to sin²θ. So the intensity I(θ) is proportional to sin²θ.

Wait, but the question says that f(λ,θ) is the function for the radiated power per unit solid angle. So in that case, if f is proportional to sin²θ, then the maximum would be at θ=90 degrees, where sinθ is 1, so f is maximum.

But wait, wait, the problem states that the maximum power is A. So the maximum of f would be A, but I think the function f is the intensity, so the maximum is at θ=90 degrees, and the value is A. So at θ=30 degrees, what's the fraction of A?

Wait, let's think. If
