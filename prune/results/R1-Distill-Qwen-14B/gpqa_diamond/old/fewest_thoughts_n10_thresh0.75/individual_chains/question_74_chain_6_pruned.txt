Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about an atomic nucleus that hasn't decayed yet. We're told that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. Now, after 50 minutes have passed and the atom is still intact, we need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, actually, the next 150 minutes after what? Oh, probably after the initial 50 minutes have passed, so the total time from the start is 200 minutes. Or does it mean the next 150 minutes from now, which is just 150 minutes left?

Wait, the question says, "the next 150 minutes." So the remaining time we're considering is 150 minutes. But the initial decay probability given is for 100 minutes. I think this is a case of conditional probability, because we're given that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, and we need to find the probability it decays in the next 150.

I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law. The decay probability over time t is modeled by the equation P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But wait, the probability given is for 100 minutes, which is 32%. So I can probably find λ from that.

Wait, but the decay probability within 100 minutes is 32%, which is P(100) = 0.32. Let me write that down: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). So that equation can help me find λ.

Let me solve for λ. Rearranging: e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking natural logs on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

Let me compute that. Ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) which is about -0.4055, but wait, 0.68 is less than 1, so ln(0.68) is negative. Let me calculate it properly. I remember that ln(0.7) is around -0.3567, and ln(0.68) is a bit lower. Let me approximate ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.

So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

But wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can do without calculating it numerically if possible.

Wait, but perhaps another approach would be better. Since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in a certain time period depends only on the current time, not on how long it's been since the atom was created. So, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the subsequent 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero, multiplied by the survival probability up to 50 minutes.

Wait, no. Because the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next T minutes given that it hasn't decayed yet is the same as the probability it decays in T minutes starting fresh. So, perhaps I can model it as the probability to decay in 150 minutes, given that it's been 50 minutes already.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the total probability is over 150 minutes, but after 50 minutes have passed. So the remaining time is 150 minutes.

Wait, but the decay process is memoryless, so the conditional probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes, given it hasn't decayed in the first 50, is the same as the probability it would decay in 150
