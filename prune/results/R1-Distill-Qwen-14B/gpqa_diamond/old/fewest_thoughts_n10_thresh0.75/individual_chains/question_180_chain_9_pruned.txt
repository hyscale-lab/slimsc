Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with electrostatics, but let's give it a shot. Let me read the question again.

The problem says there's an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, right? So each has a charge of 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs? I think so. Then, it says 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P, and the 13th charge is fixed at P. We need to find the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimals. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, so I'm thinking that the system's electrostatic potential energy arises from the interactions between these charges. Since the 13th charge is fixed at point P, the other 12 are each at a distance of 2 meters from P. So each of the 12 charges is at a distance of 2 meters from the 13th charge.

Wait, but what about the interactions between the 12 charges themselves? Because they are all at a distance of 2 meters from P, but how are they arranged around P? Like, are they all on a sphere or something? I suppose the problem is assuming that each of the 12 is at a fixed distance from P, so the distance between any two of the 12 charges would depend on their positions. But wait, the problem says they are constrained to stay at 2 m from P. Hmm. So each of the 12 is at 2 m from P, but how are they arranged? Are they equally spaced around P, perhaps on a sphere, but their mutual distances aren't specified. Wait, but for the purpose of calculating potential energy, we need to consider all pairwise interactions.

Wait a minute, the problem says "the minimum energy" of the system. So, in that case, I think the configuration that gives the minimum potential energy is when the charges are as close as possible to each other as possible. Because when like charges are placed closer together, the potential energy would be lower. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, noâ€”wait, wait. Actually, when like charges are placed closer, the potential energy is higher because they repel each other. Because if you bring them closer, you have to do work against their repulsion. Wait, but in this case, the 12 charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from P. So their positions are fixed at that radius? So their mutual positions are fixed. So I can't move them closer together to minimize potential energy. Hmm, so maybe the setup is that the 12 charges are fixed on a spherical shell of radius 2 meters around P, each at a point on the sphere. But their exact arrangement isn't given, so perhaps we can model this as each of the 12 charges being at a fixed distance from each other? Or wait, no, that's not possible because each is on the sphere.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is considering only the interactions between the 13th charge and the 12 charges. Because the other interactions (among the 12) would contribute to the potential energy as well. But the question says "minimum energy of this system
