Okay, so I've come across this astronomy problem, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. Through spectroscopy, they found that the wavelengths at which both stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, wait, the peak wavelengths are the same. That's interesting. Also, their radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. But I'm not sure how that affects the problem yet.

The astronomers assume the stars radiate as black bodies and computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. The options are A to D, with those numbers.

Hmm, okay, so the question is about the luminosity ratio between the two stars. Let me think about what I know about black body radiation and luminosity.

Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, here's a catch: the peak wavelengths are the same for both stars. Oh, right, the peak wavelength is related to the temperature by Wien's law, which is λ_max * T = constant. So if the peak wavelengths are the same, then the temperatures must be the same. Because λ_max is proportional to 1/T. So if λ_max1 = λ_max2, then T1 = T2.

Wait, that's a key point. So both stars have the same temperature. So T1 = T2 = T.

So, Luminosity would then be proportional to R² T⁴. But since T is the same, L is proportional to R². So the ratio of L1/L2 would be (R1² T1⁴) / (R2² T2⁴) = (R1/R2)^2 * (T1/T2)^4. But since T1 = T2, the (T1/T2)^4 term is 1. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2.

Given that R1 is 1.5 times R2, R1/R2 = 1.5. So (1.5)^2 is 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. So the factor is 2.25. Looking at the options, option A is ~2.25. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Wait, the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s, and Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. How would that affect the observed wavelength? Oh, right, because of the Doppler effect. But wait, the question says they found the same wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So the observed λ_max is the same. But does that mean the intrinsic λ_max is the
