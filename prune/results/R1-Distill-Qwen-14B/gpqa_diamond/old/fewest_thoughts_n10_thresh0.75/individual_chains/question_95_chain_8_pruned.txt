Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The first part is about treating 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one with meta-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA). I remember that mCPBA is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, especially for epoxidation of alkenes. So, I think the starting material probably has a double bond that will react.

Wait, the structure is 3,3,6-trimethylhepta-1,5-dien-4-one. Let me draw that out. Hept means seven carbons, with double bonds at positions 1 and 5, and a ketone at position 4. So the structure would look something like this:

CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)2?

Wait, maybe I should count the carbons. Hepta is seven carbons. Position 1 is the first carbon, so the double bonds are between carbons 1-2 and 5-6. The ketone is on carbon 4. Let me write the structure more accurately.

Carbon 1: CH2=
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: C(CH3)2
Carbon 4: C=O
Carbon 5: CH2
Carbon 6: CH(CH3)
Carbon 7: CH3?

Wait, no. Let me try again. The positions are 1,5-dien, so the double bonds are at 1-2 and 5-6. So the structure would be:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: C(CH3)2-
4: C=O
5: CH2-
6: CH(CH3)-
7: CH3

So the molecule is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CO-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3.

So, that's the starting material. Now, mCPBA is added. I think mCPBA would epoxidize a double bond. But wait, the molecule has two double bonds. Oh wait, no, the first part is hepta-1,5-dien, which means two double bonds: at 1-2 and 5-6 positions. So the molecule has conjugated dienes.

But wait, mCPBA is more selective for less substituted double bonds or more substituted? I think it tends to epoxidize the more substituted double bond, but sometimes, if there are two, it might form different epoxides. Alternatively, maybe the dienone could undergo some other reaction, but I think the main reaction here is epoxidation of each double bond, but wait, wait, the question says that two different products are formed in approximately a 1:1 ratio. Hmm, that suggests that there are two possible epoxidation sites.

Wait, but looking at the structure, which double bonds are more reactive? Or perhaps there's some possibility of endo vs exo transition states, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule can epoxidize at either of the two double bonds, but perhaps one is more reactive.

Wait, the molecule is
