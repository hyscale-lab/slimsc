Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. So, a chemist did two reactions using two different reducing agents on two unknown compounds, A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one respectively. Wait, no, actually the problem says that A is treated with LiBH4 and H+ to give (R)-4-ethyl... and B is treated with BH3 and H+ to give (S)-4-ethyl... Wait, no, the question is about the starting materials, right? So A and B are different, and the reducing agents are different, so the same product enantiomers are formed from different starting materials.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me re-read. So when compound A is treated with LiBH4 and H+, it gives the R enantiomer. When compound B is treated with BH3 and H+, it gives the S enantiomer. So the same product but different enantiomers from different starting materials. So I need to figure out what A and B are.

The options give different starting materials. All options are about 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different stereochemistry. So either R or S configuration.

Wait, the product is a tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, which is a cyclic hemiacetal, I think. So maybe the starting materials are related to the formation of this via a reduction.

Wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. BH3 is also a reducing agent, but I think it's typically used in the formation of alkenes via hydroboration. Wait, no, in this context, maybe it's part of a different reaction. Or perhaps it's about reducing ketones to alcohols. Hmm, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, it can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. BH3 is generally used in hydroboration reactions, but in certain conditions, it can also be a reducing agent. Oh wait, another thought: maybe these reducing agents are being used to reduce esters or acids into alcohols. But wait, the starting material is an acid, looking at the options.

Wait, the starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy
