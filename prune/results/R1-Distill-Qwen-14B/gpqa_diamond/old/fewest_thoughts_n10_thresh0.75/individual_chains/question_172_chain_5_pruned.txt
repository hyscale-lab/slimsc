Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that in star_1, iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the energy levels is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which I remember stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, each region of the star's photosphere behaves like a blackbody emitter in equilibrium.

I think this has to do with the Boltzmann distribution. Right, the Boltzmann factor tells us the population of different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations of two states is equal to the exponential of negative the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature.

So, the ratio of excited to ground state (or lower state) in star_1 would be (n1) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)), and similarly for star_2, (n2) = (g1/g2) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)). Wait, but the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, n1/n2 = 2.

Wait, actually, the problem says the excitation is twice as much, so maybe the ratio is n_upper_1 / n_upper_2 = 2. Or perhaps the ratio is n_upper_1 / n_lower_1 = twice that of star_2? I think I need to clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of atoms in the excited state in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So, for each star, the fraction f is given by f = (g_upper/g_lower) * exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Let's call this f1 for star_1 and f2 for star_2. So, f1/f2 = 2.

Let me write down the equations. For star_1: f1 = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)). For star_2: f2 = (g1/g2) exp(-ΔE/(k*T2)). So, f1/f2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2))] = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1)) ). Because when you divide exponents, you subtract the exponents. So, -ΔE/(k T1) minus (-ΔE/(k T2)) is ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1).

Wait, wait, no: Let me redo that. The exponents are -ΔE/(k T1) and -ΔE/(k T2). So when you take the ratio f1/f2, it's exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ]) ) = exp(ΔE/(k)(1/T2 - 1/T1)).

Hmm, but f1/f2 is supposed to be 2. So, 2 = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T
