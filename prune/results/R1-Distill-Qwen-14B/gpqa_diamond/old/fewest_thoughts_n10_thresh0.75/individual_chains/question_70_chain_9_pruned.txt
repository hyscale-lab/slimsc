Okay, let's try to solve this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's about some reactions and determining the molecular symmetry group of a product. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll think through it step by step.

So, the problem describes several reactions. Let me write them out to keep track.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce product E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids, F and G. F is a strong acid, G is weak.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

And the question is about the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

I remember that symmetry groups are about the shape and structure of molecules. Common molecules have certain symmetry groups. For example, water has C2v symmetry, CO2 is linear with D∞h, something like that.

Let me think about each reaction and see if I can identify the compounds.

Starting with reaction 1: A + 8 B → C. Solid A reacting with gas B to make a red product. 8 equivalents suggest a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. What reactions form a bright red product? I'm thinking maybe sulfur-related? Or perhaps a transition metal complex.

Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium (Na), B is chlorine (Cl2), and C is NaCl. But NaCl is a white solid, not red. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Or perhaps A is another metal.

Wait, another possibility: Reaction of a metal with a gas to form a compound. For example, maybe A is sulfur and B is oxygen, but that would form SO3, which isn't red. Or maybe A is copper and B is some gas. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe A is a metal oxide. Oh wait, perhaps it's a reaction involving nitrates or sulfates. Wait, when a metal reacts with a diatomic gas, like Cl2, it forms a chloride. But I'm not making progress with that.

Let me look at reaction 3: C reacts with water to form A plus two acids. So, C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So C is a compound that
