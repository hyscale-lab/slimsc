Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The problem says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds, both with the molecular formula C10H14. Their 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio, and three singlets around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. The options are four different tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

Hmm, so each compound is a substituted benzene with four methyl groups. The molecular formula is C10H14. Let me think, benzene has six carbons, so four substituents would add four carbons, each with a methyl (so each substituent is a CH3). Wait, benzene (C6H6) plus four CH3 groups would be C10H14? Let's check: each CH3 adds one carbon and three hydrogens. So four CH3 groups add 4 carbons and 12 hydrogens. Benzene is C6H6, so the total is C10H18. Wait, but the molecular formula is C10H14. Oh wait, maybe each substituent is a methyl group, but if they are attached in such a way that some are adjacent, perhaps leading to some hydrogen loss? Or maybe the diethyl is an option.

Wait, the options include 1,4-diethylbenzene. Diethyl would be two ethyl groups. So benzene (C6) plus two ethyl (C2 each) gives C10. Each ethyl has 5 hydrogens (since each is -CH2CH3). Wait, no, each ethyl is two carbons, so each has 5 hydrogens? Wait, the ethyl group is -CH2CH3, which has 2+3=5 hydrogens. Two ethyl groups would add 10 hydrogens. Benzene has 6, so total is 6 + 10 =16. But the molecular formula is C10H14. So that can't be right because 1,4-diethylbenzene would be C8H14 (because C6 + 2*(C2H5) = C6 + C4H10 → C10H16. Wait, no. Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each ethyl is C2H5. So two ethyl groups would be C4H10. So the molecular formula is C6 + C4H10 → C10H16. But the question says it's C10H14. So that can't be right. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait. Let me compute the molecular formula for each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Each is C6H5(CH3)4, which is C10H14. So that fits.

Option B: 1,2
