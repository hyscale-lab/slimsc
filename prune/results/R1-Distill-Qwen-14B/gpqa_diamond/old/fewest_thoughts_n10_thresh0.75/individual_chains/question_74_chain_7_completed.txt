Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential law, right? So the probability of a decay isn't just a linear thing. Let's try to unpack this.

The question says that the decay probability of the atom is 32% within 100 minutes. Wait, so that means if we have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed. Oh wait, but in reality, the decay is a continuous process, so I think the decay constant is what's important here.

So I remember the formula for radioactive decay is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant, t is time. The probability that the atom hasn't decayed by time t is e^(-λt), so the probability it has decayed is 1 - e^(-λt).

Wait, but the problem gives us the probability of decay within 100 minutes as 32%, so that's 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me rearrange that. e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural log of both sides: ln(0.68) = -100λ. So λ would be -ln(0.68)/100. Let me compute that.

Wait, ln(0.68) is approximately... I think ln(1)=0, ln(e^-0.4)= about -0.4, since e^-0.4 is roughly 0.67, which is close to 0.68. Wait, e^0.4 is about 1.4918, so e^-0.4 is about 0.6703, which is a bit less than 0.68. So ln(0.6703)= -0.4 → Wait, wait, actually, more accurately, ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ = 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question says that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So we're looking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, wait, but that's a bit ambiguous. The next 150 minutes from now, so total time would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. Or is it 150 minutes from now, regardless of the previous 50? I think it's the first: the total time elapsed from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes.

Wait, no, the question asks: after 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what is the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the next 150 is the time from now, so the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200. But wait, no, maybe the 150 is just the time from now, so the time elapsed would be 150 minutes after the current 50. So the time from the start is 50 +150 = 200. So the probability of decay by 200 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *200).

But wait, another approach: the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes affects the probability. Oh right, because radioactive decay is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next t minutes, given that it hasn't decayed yet, is the same as the probability of decaying in t minutes from now, regardless of how long it's been since it started.

Wait, so the memoryless property of the exponential distribution says that the probability of decay in the next t minutes is the same regardless of how much time has already passed. So the probability it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as if it's a new atom. So I can compute the probability for 150 minutes, using the same λ.

Wait, no. The way the question is phrased: we have 50 minutes passed, and it hasn't decayed. So the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes (i.e., between time 50 and 200) is equal to 1 - e^(-λ * (200)) minus 1 - e^(-λ *50), because it's the probability that it decays by 200 minutes minus the probability it decayed by 50 minutes.

Alternatively, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ*150)).

Wait, let me think again. The survival probability by time t is P(t) = e^(-λ t). So the probability of decaying between t1 and t2 is P(t2) - P(t1). So in this case, t1 is 50, t2 is 200. So the probability is P(200) - P(50) = e^(-λ*200) - e^(-λ*50).

Alternatively, since the decay process is memoryless, the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes given it hasn't decayed yet is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes starting from time zero. So that would be 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but that's only if the process is memoryless. Let me think: yes, the exponential distribution has the memoryless property, which says that the probability of an event happening in the next t units of time is the same regardless of how much time has already passed without the event. So in this case, the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So maybe I don't need to consider the time passed, because the probability is just for the next 150 minutes. But wait, the given data is the 32% decay in 100 minutes, which I used to find λ. So I need to compute 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute both approaches.

First approach: using the memoryless property. So after 50 minutes, the probability it decays in the next 150 is same as the probability it decays in 150 minutes from now. So compute 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Second approach: compute the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes, then in the next 150, given it hasn't decayed yet.

Wait, but that's the same as the memoryless approach. Because the conditional probability P(decay in next 150 | hasn't decayed in 50) = P(decay in 150) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So I can proceed either way. Let me compute λ using the initial data.

We have P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ *100). So e^(-100 λ) = 0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100 → ln(1/0.68) is ln(1.470588) which is approximately 0.3856, so λ ≈ 0.003856 per minute.

Now, compute P(decay in next 150 minutes) = 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 1 - e^(-0.003856 *150).

Calculate 0.003856 *150 = 0.5784.

e^(-0.5784) ≈ Let me compute this. I know that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. 0.5784 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

We can approximate e^x for x in that range. Let me do a Taylor expansion or use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(2) is about 0.6931. Hmm, 0.5784 is about 0.83 of ln(2), since 0.5784 * (1/0.6931) ≈ 0.834.

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, we can compute e^-0.5784.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use exact numbers.

Wait, 0.5784 is approximately 0.5784. So e^(-0.5784) is approximately, let's see:

We can write 0.5784 as (0.5 + 0.0784). So e^-0.5 is 0.6065. Then, e^-(0.0784) ≈ 1 - 0.0784 + (0.0784)^2/2 - ... . Let's approximate it.

Wait, e^(-x) ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 for small x.

So x = 0.0784 → x² = 0.006146 → x²/2 = 0.003073.

So e^(-0.0784) ≈ 1 - 0.0784 + 0.003073 = 0.924673.

So e^(-0.5784) ≈ e^(-0.5) * e^(-0.0784) ≈ 0.6065 * 0.924673.

Compute that: 0.6065 * 0.924673 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92 is about 0.558, but more accurately:

0.6065 * 0.924673 = 

Let me compute 0.6 * 0.924673 = 0.5548038.

0.0065 * 0.924673 ≈ 0.006009.

Adding them: 0.5548038 + 0.006009 ≈ 0.5608128.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can just compute 0.5784 using a calculator approach.

But perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator for e^-0.5784.

Alternatively, I can use logarithm tables or known values.

Wait, another approach: We know that e^(-0.5784) is approximately the same as e^(ln(0.56) ), since ln(0.56) is about -0.5798. Let me check:

ln(0.56) = ?

Well, ln(0.5)= -0.6931, ln(0.56) is higher than that (since 0.56 >0.5). Let me compute ln(0.56):

We can use Taylor series around x=0.5. Hmm, maybe it's easier to use a calculator approximation.

Let me just compute e^(-0.5784) ≈ 0.561.

So 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is approximately 43.9%, so 44% which is option A.

Wait, but I'm approximating, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, using the exact value of λ:

We have λ = ln(1/0.68)/100 ≈ ln(1.470588)/100 ≈ 0.38566 per 100 minutes, so 0.0038566 per minute.

So λ * 150 = 0.0038566 *150 = 0.57849.

Now, e^-0.57849 ≈ Let me calculate it more accurately.

We can think that 0.57849 is about 0.5785.

Looking for e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, using a calculator approximation:

We know that e^-0.5785 ≈ ?

Well, e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.5785 is less than that.

Wait, 0.5785 is about 0.5 + 0.0785.

We can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.5.

But perhaps another approach: using a calculator.

Wait, maybe I can use a known value. For example, e^-0.5785 = ?

I can use the fact that ln(0.56) ≈ -0.5798, so e^-0.5798 ≈ 0.56 → e^-0.5785 is slightly higher than 0.56.

Because 0.5798 is slightly larger than 0.5785.

So e^-0.5785 is ≈ 0.56 * e^(0.0013) ≈ 0.56 * (1 + 0.0013) ≈ 0.56 * 1.0013 ≈ 0.5607.

Hmm, so e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5607. Therefore, the probability is 1 - 0.5607 = 0.4393, which is approximately 43.9% → 44%, so option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 44%, so that's the answer. But wait, I thought the options didn't have 44%. Let me check the options again.

Wait the options are:

A) 44%

B) 40%

C) 52%

D)48%

Yes, A is 44%.

But wait, another thing: maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using a better approximation for e^-0.5785.

Alternatively, using the exact calculation.

Let me compute e^-0.5785.

We can write 0.5785 =  (5785/10000) = 0.5785.

Using a Taylor series expansion for e^x around x=0. Let me use x = -0.5785.

e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x^4/4! + ... 

But x is negative, so let's compute up to a few terms.

x = -0.5785.

e^-0.5785 = 1 + (-0.5785) + ( (-0.5785)^2 )/2 + ( (-0.5785)^3 )/6 + ( (-0.5785)^4 )/24 + ...

Compute each term:

Term 0: 1

Term1: -0.5785 → sum so far: 0.4215

Term2: (0.5785^2)/2 → (0.33466) /2 ≈ 0.16733 → sum 0.4215 + 0.16733 = 0.58883

Term3: (-0.5785^3)/6 → (-0.200078)/6 ≈ -0.033346 → sum 0.58883 -0.033346 ≈ 0.555484

Term4: (0.5785^4)/24 → (0.11665) /24 ≈ 0.00486 → sum 0.555484 +0.00486=0.560344

Term5: (-0.5785^5)/120 → (-0.06733)/120 ≈ -0.000561 → sum 0.560344 -0.000561=0.559783

Term6: (0.5785^6)/720 → (0.03907)/720 ≈ 0.0000542 → sum 0.559783 +0.0000542=0.559837

Term7: (-0.5785^7)/5040 → (-0.02253)/5040 ≈ -0.00000447 → sum ~0.559837 -0.00000447=0.559833

So up to term7, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5598.

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier approximation where I thought e^-0.5785 was about 0.5607. Hmmm, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier approximation.

Wait, in this calculation, using the Taylor series, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5598. So 1 - 0.5598 = 0.4402, which is 44.02%, so 44%.

So that would point to option A.

Wait, but why the discrepancy between the two methods? Because when I used the ln(0.56)= -0.5798, I thought e^-0.5785 is about 0.5607, but the Taylor series gives me 0.5598. Hmm, perhaps the ln(0.56) approach is not accurate enough.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation using more precise methods would be better.

But given that the Taylor series up to 7 terms gives me e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5598, which makes the probability 44%, so the answer is A.

Wait, but another way: perhaps I made a miscalculation in the Taylor series.

Let me compute each term more accurately.

Compute each term for x=-0.5785.

x = -0.5785

x² = (0.5785)^2 = 0.33467.

x^3 = x² * x = 0.33467 * (-0.5785) ≈ -0.1933.

x^4 = x^3 * x = (-0.1933)*(-0.5785) ≈ 0.1123.

x^5 = x^4 * x = 0.1123 * (-0.5785) ≈ -0.0647.

x^6 = x^5 * x = (-0.0647)*(-0.5785) ≈ 0.0374.

x^7 = x^6 * x = 0.0374 * (-0.5785) ≈ -0.0216.

x^8 = x^7 * x ≈ (-0.0216)*(-0.5785) ≈ 0.01247.

x^9 ≈ 0.01247 * (-0.5785) ≈ -0.00723.

Now, compute each term:

Term 0: 1 → sum=1.

Term1: x = -0.5785 → sum=1 -0.5785=0.4215.

Term2: x²/(2!) = 0.33467 /2 →0.167335 → sum=0.4215 +0.167335≈0.588835.

Term3: x^3/(3!) = (-0.1933)/(6)= -0.032217 → sum=0.588835 -0.032217≈0.556618.

Term4: x^4/(4!)= 0.1123/(24)=0.004679 → sum=0.556618 +0.004679≈0.561297.

Term5: x^5/(5!)= (-0.0647)/(120)= -0.000539 → sum=0.561297 -0.000539≈0.560758.

Term6: x^6/(6!)=0.0374/(720)=0.0000519 → sum=0.560758 +0.0000519≈0.560810.

Term7: x^7/(7!)= (-0.0216)/(5040)= -0.00000429 → sum=0.560810 -0.00000429≈0.560806.

Term8: x^8/(8!)=0.01247/(40320)= approx 0.000000309 → sum≈0.560806 +0.000000309≈0.5608063.

Term9: x^9/(9!)= (-0.00723)/(362880)= approx -0.0000000199 → sum≈0.5608063 -0.0000000199≈0.5608063.

So after 9 terms, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5608063.

So 1 - 0.5608063 ≈ 0.4391937 → 43.919%, which is approximately 44%, so option A.

But wait, the initial approach with the memoryless property gives 44%, but looking back, the options don't have 44% as a possible option except option A. Hmm, no, option A is 44%, so that's the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial data was that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so λ is determined such that 1 - e^(-λ*100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ)=0.68 → λ = (ln(1/0.68))/100 ≈ (0.38566)/100 → 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, when computing the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, we can compute 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 *150) → 1 - e^(-0.57849).

From earlier, we found that e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5608 → 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392 → 43.92%, which is 44%, option A.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A is 44%, so that's the correct choice.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the probability that it will decay within 150 minutes starting from now (i.e., between 50 and 200 minutes), which would be the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, which is the same as 1 - e^(-λ *150) due to the memoryless property. So 44% is correct.

Wait, but let me think about the alternative approach where we compute the probability of decay between t=50 and t=200.

So the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50 minutes is e^(-λ*50), and the probability it hasn't decayed by 200 minutes is e^(-λ*200). So the probability it decays between 50 and 200 is e^(-λ*50) [1 - e^(-λ*150)].

But wait, then the probability would be e^(-λ*50) * (1 - e^(-λ *150)).

Let me compute that.

Compute λ = 0.0038566 per min.

Compute e^(-50 * λ) = e^(-50 * 0.0038566) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ ?

e^-0.19283 → let's compute this.

We can approximate e^-0.19283.

We know that e^-0.2 ≈ 0.8187. So e^-0.19283 is a bit higher than that.

Let me compute more accurately.

0.19283 is about 0.1928.

Approximating e^-0.1928:

Using the Taylor series around x=0.

e^x = 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 + x^4/24 + x^5/120.

x = -0.1928.

e^-0.1928 = 1 - 0.1928 + (0.1928^2)/2 - (0.1928^3)/6 + (0.1928^4)/24 - (0.1928^5)/120.

Calculate each term:

Term 0: 1

Term1: -0.1928 → sum: 0.8072.

Term2: (0.1928^2)/2 → (0.03718)/2 = 0.01859 → sum: 0.8072 +0.01859= 0.82579.

Term3: -(0.1928^3)/6 → -(0.007182)/6 ≈ -0.001197 → sum: 0.82579 -0.001197≈0.824593.

Term4: (0.1928^4)/24 → (0.001383)/24 ≈ 0.0000576 → sum: 0.824593 +0.0000576≈0.8246506.

Term5: -(0.1928^5)/120 → -(0.0002667)/120 ≈ -0.00000222 → sum≈0.8246506 -0.00000222≈0.824648.

So e^-0.1928 ≈ 0.824648.

Now, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is e^(-50 λ) * (1 - e^(-150 λ)).

We have e^(-50 λ)≈0.8246.

1 - e^(-150 λ) = 1 - e^(-0.57849) ≈ 1 - 0.5608 ≈ 0.4392.

So the product is 0.8246 * 0.4392 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.8 * 0.4392 = 0.35136.

0.0246 *0.4392 ≈ 0.01083.

Adding: 0.35136 +0.01083 ≈ 0.36219.

So about 36.2%, which is not one of the options. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, that can't be right. What's going on?

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Because the question asks for the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. That is, the conditional probability.

So the formula for conditional probability is:

P(decay in next 150 | no decay in first 50) = P(decay between 50 and 200) / P(no decay in first 50).

But wait, no. The correct formula is:

P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B).

In this case, event A is decay in next 150 (so between 50 and 200).

Event B is no decay in first 50.

So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B).

But A and B is the same as B followed by A, so it's decay between 50 and 200, given that no decay happened before 50.

Which is the same as P(decay between 50 and 200) / P(no decay in first 50) → which is [e^(-50λ) (1 - e^(-150λ))] / e^(-50λ) ) ] → simplifies to (1 - e^(-150λ)).

So that brings us back to the memoryless approach, where P(A|B)=1 - e^(-150λ)= 43.92% → 44%, option A.

So the alternative approach where I computed the product of e^(-50λ) and (1 - e^(-150λ)) was incorrect because that's the joint probability. But when considering conditional probability, the e^(-50λ) cancels out.

So the correct answer is option A, 44%.


To solve the problem, we use the principles of radioactive decay, which follows an exponential law. The decay probability of an atom within a given time can be described using the decay constant \( \lambda \), which is related to the half-life of the isotope. The survival probability \( P(t) \) of an atom at time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = e^{-\lambda t}
\]

The decay probability by time \( t \) is then:

\[
1 - P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

### Step 1: Determine \( \lambda \) from the given data
The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, or \( 0.32 \). Using the decay formula:

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.38566 \):

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.38566}{100} \approx 0.0038566 \, \text{per minute.}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes
The question asks for the probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed without decay. Due to the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on \( \lambda \) and the time elapsed (150 minutes), not on the previous 50 minutes.

The probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is:

\[
P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substitute \( \lambda \approx 0.0038566 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.0038566 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57849
\]

\[
P_{\text{decay}} = 1 - e^{-0.57849}
\]

Using approximations for \( e^{-0.57849} \), we find:

\[
e^{-0.57849} \approx 0.5608
\]

\[
P_{\text{decay}} \approx 1 - 0.5608 = 0.4392
\]

Thus, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately \( 43.92\% \), which rounds to \( 44\% \).

### Step 3: Verify the result
The memoryless property ensures that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the previous 50 minutes. Therefore, the calculation is consistent with the principles of radioactive decay. The result aligns with the given options.

### Final Answer:
The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is **44%**.
