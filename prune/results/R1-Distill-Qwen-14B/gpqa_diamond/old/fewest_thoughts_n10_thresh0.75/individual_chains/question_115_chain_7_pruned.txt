Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let me read it again.

The setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. Then they collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured— one is upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons' directions.

Hmm, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. And because energy and momentum must be conserved, the photons' energies and directions must balance that.

Wait, Lorentz factors. The Lorentz factor γ is equal to 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So higher γ means the particle is moving at a speed closer to the speed of light.

But in this problem, the electron and positron are moving towards each other— because the electron is moving left to right (from the left) and the positron is moving right to left (from the right), but they're moving along the same horizontal axis. So when they meet, they annihilate into photons.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial setup says the electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left, and the positron is moving along the same axis but from the right. So that means they're moving towards each other. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

So, in the lab frame, the electron has velocity v_e (to the right), and the positron has velocity v_p (to the left). Or wait, no. The positron is moving from the right, so it's going to the left. So their velocities are opposite directions.

But wait, because the problem says they collide and annihilate. So I need to consider their momenta.

The problem is about the angle between the two photons. Let's think about conservation of momentum and energy.

Wait, but when a particle and its antiparticle annihilate, the typical case is that they produce two photons moving in opposite directions. But in this case, both photons are moving to the right, one upper-right and the other lower-right. Hmm, that's a bit
