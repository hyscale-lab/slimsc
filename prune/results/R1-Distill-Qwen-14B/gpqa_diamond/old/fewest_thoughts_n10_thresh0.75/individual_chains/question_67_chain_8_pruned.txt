Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about two electrons in p orbitals, so their orbital angular momentum quantum numbers are each l=1. The state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. They're asking about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z as -ħ.

Wait, so each electron is in a p orbital, which means l1 = l2 =1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2 because 1+1=2. And m is -1 here. So the state is |1,1,2,-1>.

I remember that when dealing with coupled angular momentum states, the total state is a combination of the individual states. Each L1z eigenstate is |l1,m1> and similarly for L2z. The coupled state is |l1, l2, L, M>, where M = m1 + m2.

So the given coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>. Let me see, what are the possible m1 and m2 values that can add up to M= -1.

m1 can range from -1 to +1, same for m2. So possible pairs (m1, m2):

( -1, 0 ) → sum is -1.

( 0, -1 ) → sum is -1.

Wait, but the total M is -1. So these are the possible combinations
