Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. And N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2 alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

I remember that non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. The relative entropy measure here is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the reference Gaussian state. What's the reference here? Oh, right, for cat states, the Gaussian states are usually coherent states. So maybe tau is a coherent state or perhaps a thermal state? Or maybe it's the closest Gaussian approximation to the given state. Hmm.

But wait, the problem says "tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state." So perhaps the reference is the Gaussian state that best approximates rho? Or is it the cat state itself when phi is such that it's Gaussian? Because for certain phi, the state might become Gaussian, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the state when the non-Gaussian parameters are set to zero. Let me think about the structure of the state.

The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. For phi = 0, it would be |alpha> multiplied by 1/N, so that would be a coherent state, hence Gaussian. Similarly, if phi is pi/2, it's the same as a state with a different amplitude.

Wait, but our phi is -pi/4. Let me compute sin(2*phi) for that. 2*phi is -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2 phi) = -1.

So N = sqrt( 1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2) ). Let's calculate that. exp(-2*(0.25)) = exp(-0.5) ≈
