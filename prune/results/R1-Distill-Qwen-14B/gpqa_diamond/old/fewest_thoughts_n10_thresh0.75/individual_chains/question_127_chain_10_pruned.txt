Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. I remember that heating can cause certain reactions, maybe elimination or something like that. 

Let me first try to draw the structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. The name is a bit complicated. So, nona means nine carbons. The diene part indicates two double bonds. The positions of the double bonds are at 2 and 6. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but wait, that's not right because the substituent is butyl at position 5. Oh wait, wait, the substituent is butyl on the 5th carbon.

Wait, 5-butylnona-2,6-diene would have the structure where the ninth carbon is the end, and the substituents are at the fifth position. Let me think. The main chain is nine carbons. The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, so like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But wait, no, because the substituent is butyl. So the fifth carbon (counting from the start) has a butyl group attached. Wait, let me number the main chain. Starting from the left end, the first double bond is between C2 and C3, and the second is between C6 and C7. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Wait, no, butyl is four carbons, and it's a substituent on the fifth carbon. So the structure is:

Positions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

So the main chain is nine carbons. The substituent is on C5, which is a butyl group. So C5 has a CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached? Wait, but butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but more accurately, it's a four-carbon chain. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-C(CH2CH2CH2CH3
