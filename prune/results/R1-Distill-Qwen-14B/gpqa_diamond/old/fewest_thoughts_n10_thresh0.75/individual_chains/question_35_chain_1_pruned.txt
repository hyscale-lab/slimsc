Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix operator Ay. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by S, where c is h/(4π). And the matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So let me write down what S looks like.

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

Hmm, wait, that looks familiar. Oh right, this is the Pauli Y matrix, but scaled maybe. The Pauli matrices are usually denoted as σx, σy, σz, and σy is indeed [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S must be the Pauli Y matrix. 

But wait, in some conventions, the Pauli matrices have a different scaling? No, I think the Pauli matrices are just 2x2 with these entries. So S is σy.

So, Ay = c * S = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Eigenvalues of a matrix operator are found by solving the characteristic equation det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix.

But wait, S itself is a matrix, so let me compute the eigenvalues of S first, then scale them by c to get the eigenvalues of Ay.

The matrix S is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues of S can be found by solving the characteristic equation:

det(S - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[ [ -λ , -i ],
  [ i  , -λ ] ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (i)(-i) = λ² - (i * -i). Wait, i times -i is -i² which is -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - 1 = 0.

So, λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, that's the eigenvalues of S. So S has eigenvalues 1 and -1. Therefore, since Ay = c * S, the eigenvalues of Ay would be c * 1 and c * (-
