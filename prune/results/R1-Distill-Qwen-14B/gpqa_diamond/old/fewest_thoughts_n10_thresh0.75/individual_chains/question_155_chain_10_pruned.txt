Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about uncertainty in the P_z operator. Hmm. Okay, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Oh wait, that's the state vector |ψ> for the system.

So the first thing I should probably do is compute ⟨P_z⟩, which is the expectation value of P_z. Then compute ⟨P_z²⟩, and use those to find the uncertainty.

The matrix for P_z is given as:
P_z = [ [ħ, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Wait, no. Wait, looking again, the matrix for P_z is:
Row 1: (ħ, 0, 0)
Row 2: (0, 0, 0)
Row 3: (0, 0, -ħ)

So in matrix form, it's a diagonal matrix with entries ħ, 0, -ħ on the diagonal.

Since the state is given as a column vector (let's call it |ψ>), let me write that out:

|ψ> = [ -1/2,
          1/√2,
         -1/2 ]

Wait, I should check the dimensions. Since P_z is 3x3, the state is a 3-element column vector.

Now, the expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ is ψ† P_z ψ. Let me compute that.

So first, I need to compute ψ† P_z. Since P_z is diagonal, this multiplication should be straightforward.

Wait, first, ψ† is the conjugate transpose. So looking at the components of ψ: the first element is -1/2, which is real, so its conjugate is the same. The second element is 1/√2, which is real, so its conjugate is same. Third is -1/2, same.

So ψ† is [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]

Multiply this with P_z:

ψ† P_z = [ (-1/2)*ħ, (1/√2)*0, (-1/2)*(-ħ) ]

So that's [ (-ħ/2), 0, (ħ/2) ]

Then, multiply this by |ψ>:

⟨P_z⟩ = ( (-ħ/2) * (-1/2) ) + (0 * (1/√2) ) + ( (ħ/2) * (-1/2) )

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-ħ/2) * (-1/2) = (ħ/2)*(1/2) = ħ/4.

Second term: 0 * anything is 0.

Third term:
