Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's take it step by step. 

The question is about sigmatropic rearrangements, specifically Cope and Claisen rearrangements. I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a pi bond along with a sigma bond. These reactions are pericyclic, meaning they involve cyclic transition states, often through concerted mechanisms.

There are three reactions given, each leading to a product labeled A, B, or C. I need to match the products to the options provided.

First, let's look at each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Hmm, so the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine and but-3-en-2-ol. The conditions are H+ (acid) and heat. I'm thinking this might be a Claisen rearrangement because Claisen typically involves allyl vinyl ethers. Wait, but wait, the Claisen rearrangement is when an allyl vinyl ether rearranges to a gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl. But here, the starting material is an amine, not a carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's a variation of the Claisen or another sigmatropic rearrangement.

Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine is (CH3O)2CH-NH2. When you add but-3-en-2-ol (which is CH2CH2COHCH2? No, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=C(CH2OH)CH2 or maybe I should draw it: the structure is CH2CH(CH2OH)CH2. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2=CH-CH2-OH? No, wait, but-3-en-2-ol would be CH2CH2CH(OH)CH2? No, wait. Structure of but-3-en-2-ol: the double bond is between carb
