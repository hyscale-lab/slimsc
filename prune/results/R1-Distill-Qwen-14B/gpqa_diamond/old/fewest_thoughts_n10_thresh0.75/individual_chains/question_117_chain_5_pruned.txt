Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which of these organic compounds exhibit optical isomerism. I remember that optical isomerism is when a compound has chiral centers, meaning they aren't superimposable on their mirror images. Chiral centers have four different substituents. So, I need to look at each of the given compounds and see if they have any chiral centers.

The question lists four compounds:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate
2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate
3. benzophenone
4. dimethyl fumarate

I'll go through them one by one.

Starting with number 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Hmm. The structure is a biphenyl group with substituents. Let me imagine the structure. The biphenyl has two phenyl rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions. Then, at positions 2 and 2', there are carboxylate ester groups (since it's the dimethyl ester). Also, at 6 and 6' positions, there are nitro groups. Now, a biphenyl can have a certain kind of isomerism if there's a plane of symmetry. Wait, but for optical isomerism, it needs a chiral center, not just geometric isomerism. So looking for chiral centers here.

Wait, perhaps the biphenyl itself isn't necessarily chiral. Let me think about the substituents. Each phenyl ring has nitro and two ester groups. Are the substituents arranged in a way that creates a chiral center? Well, each substituent is on a benzene ring, which is flat. Maybe the central structure, the biphenyl, could have a certain configuration. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents are symmetric, then maybe the molecule isn't chiral. But wait, the positions are 2,2' and 6,6'. So, the carboxylate groups are on carbons 2 and 2', and nitro on 6 and 6'. Let's visualize the structure. If the two phenyl rings are connected, then substit
