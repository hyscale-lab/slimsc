Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base, typically measured per mole of H+ or OH- ions involved.

Wait, but first, I should probably figure out how much H+ and OH- each solution contributes. Because when they mix, the H+ from the acids will react with OH- from the base.

Let's break it down:

1. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+.

2. H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each molecule can donate two H+ ions. But wait, I think in dilute solutions, the second dissociation is not complete, but for the sake of this problem, maybe we can assume complete dissociation, especially since it's a strong acid. So 0.3 M H2SO4 would give 2 * 0.3 = 0.6 M H+.

3. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Each formula unit releases two OH- ions because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH-.

Now, let's calculate the moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

Starting with HCl:

Volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.2 M, so moles = M * V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. Since each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+, that's 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4:

Volume is 300 mL → 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles of H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since each gives two H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from acids is 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2:

Volume is 200 mL → 0.2 L. Molarity 0.5 M. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

Wait, but wait a minute. The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the total H+ is 0.28 moles and OH- is 0.2 moles. Which one is the limiting reagent?

Since H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2, the OH- will run out first. So all the OH- (0.2 moles) will react with 0.2 moles of H+. The remaining H+ would be 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles, but that doesn't react because there's no more OH-.

Wait, but wait again. No, wait. The
