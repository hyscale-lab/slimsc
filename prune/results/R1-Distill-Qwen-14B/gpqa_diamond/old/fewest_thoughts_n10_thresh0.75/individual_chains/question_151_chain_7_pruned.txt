Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Oh wait, wait, that's probably a vector in three dimensions. So the state vector is a column vector with components -1, 2, and 1. But wait, in quantum mechanics, state vectors are usually unit vectors, right? So the length squared should be 1. Let me check that.

The length squared would be (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, that's 6, but that's not 1. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the state representation. Wait, maybe the vector is normalized. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps the state vector is not a unit vector. That's possible, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should have a norm (squared length) of 1. So perhaps the given vector is just a vector, and we have to normalize it. Because if I compute the magnitude squared, it's 6, so the state vector should be divided by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector. So the actual state vector |Ïˆ> is ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

Wait, the question says the state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1), but perhaps that's the actual vector, regardless of normalization. Oh, but when computing probabilities, we need to normalize the state because probabilities depend on |amplitudes|^2, and the sum should be 1. So maybe the state vector is already normalized? Let me check the sum again. Oh, sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6), so the state isn't normalized. So perhaps the user forgot to normalize it, or maybe I'm supposed to proceed without normalizing, but that wouldn't make sense for quantum mechanics.

Wait, the problem is about finding the probability of measuring a particular value of an observable. So for that, I need the
