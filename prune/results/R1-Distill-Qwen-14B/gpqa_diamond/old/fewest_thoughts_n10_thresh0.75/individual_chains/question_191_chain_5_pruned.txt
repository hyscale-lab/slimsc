Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The compound given is 3-(hydroxymethyl)-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohexan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me visualize the structure. Cyclohexanone with substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a hydroxymethyl group (that's -CH2OH), and position 5 has a prop-1-en-2-yl group. Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is like the group CH2-C(CH2)2? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So prop-1-en-2-yl would be the group CH2-C(=CH2)-CH3? Or wait, maybe it's CH2=C(CH3)-, but the position might be different. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-C(CH2)-, but I think I should draw this properly.

Wait, prop-1-en-2-yl would be CH2=C-CH2, but where is the substituent? Oh, wait, the substituent is at position 5, so the cyclohexanone has a substituent at 5 that's a prop-1-en-2-yl group. That would be CH2-C(CH2) because propenyl groups can have different structures. Alternatively, maybe it's isopropenyl? Or perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to a methyl. No, wait, prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CH-CH2-? No, wait, that can't be. Let me clarify: the structure of prop-1-en-2-yl is CH2=CHCH2-? No, wait, propenyl groups are CH2=CHCH2–. But prop-1-en-2-yl would be the substituent on the second carbon of propene. So propene is CH2=CH2CH3, but if it's prop-1-en-2-yl, the substituent is on carbon 2. So the structure is CH2-C(=CH2)-something? Hmm, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, maybe it's (CH2)2C=CH–. No
