Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a specific compound based on given information.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. Hmm, wait, a benzene ring is 6-membered, right? So if it's di-substituted, there are two substituents attached. And the total number of carbons is 8. Oh wait, benzene has 6 carbons, so the two substituents add two more carbons. That means each substituent contributes one carbon? Or maybe one substituent is a two-carbon group and the other is a single carbon?

But wait, wait. The question also mentions that the FTIR shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituents must include a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, etc.) and a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). Let me think.

So the di-substituted benzene has two groups: one is a carbonyl-containing group, and the other is a halogen. So possible substituents are something like a ketone (like COCH3) and a halogen (like Cl), or maybe a carbonyl group that's part of another structure.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. Benzene (6 C) plus substituents (2 C) â€” so each substituent is one carbon
