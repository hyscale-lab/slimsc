Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum optics and quantum information because they're more complex than Gaussian states, which include coherent states, squeezed states, etc.

The state given is |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. Oh wait, N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha²)). Right, because when you have a state like that, the normalization comes from the inner product of the state with itself.

The non-Gaussianity is given by del_b, which is the relative entropy between the state's density matrix and a reference Gaussian state's density matrix. So the formula is trace(rho ln rho) minus trace(tau ln tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, I think I remember that for Gaussian states, the relative entropy of entanglement or something similar might come into play, but here it's non-Gaussianity. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

The specific parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So we need to compute del_b for these values.

First, let's think about the state when phi is -pi/4. Let's compute sin(2phi) because that's in the normalization. 2phi would be -pi/2, so sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2phi) is -1.

So N becomes sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*alpha²)). Alpha is 0.5, so alpha squared is 0.25. Then 2*0.25 is 0.5, so exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 - (0.6065)) = sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that. 0.3935 is about 0.627^2, so sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.627.

Wait, but N is the normalization, so rho is |psi><psi|. Let me write that out.

The state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. So cos(-pi/4) is cos(pi/4), which is sqrt(2)/2. Similarly, sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2. So the state becomes (sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ) / N.

So |psi> can be written as [ |alpha> - | - alpha> ] / sqrt(2) * N^{-1} ? Wait, because sqrt(2)/2 is 1/sqrt(2), so yeah, [ |alpha> - | - alpha> ] / sqrt(2) * 1/N.

Wait wait, N is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)) which we found to be sqrt(1 - exp(-1)). Because
