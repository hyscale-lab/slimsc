Okay, so I've got this question about stellar abundances and figuring out the ratio of silicon atoms in two stars. Hmm, I remember that the notation [X/Y] means the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y compared to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log10(nX/nY) - log10(nX/nY)_sun. 

Wait, the question gives me some values. Let's list them out. 

Star_1 has [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex. And [Fe/H]_1 is 0. Oh, so that means Fe abundance relative to H is the same as the Sun. Because [Fe/H] = 0 implies n(Fe)/n(H) is same as solar. 

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3. And [Mg/H]_2 is 0, so Mg is same as the Sun relative to H. 

The Sun's photospheric composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log10(nFe/nH) is 7.5 -12 = -4.5. Wait, but wait, wait. Oh no, wait, 12 + log... So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5? Wait no, maybe I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 → which is -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5). Similarly for Mg, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log10(nMg/nH) =7-12 =-5. So nMg/nH =10^-5.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 and Star_2. So I need to find [Si/Star_1] divided by [Si/Star_2] or the actual number ratio?

Wait, no. The question wants the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1's photosphere to Star_2's. So n_Si1 / n_Si2.

Hmm. Let's think step by step.

Starting with Star_1:

We know [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So log10(n_Si1/n_Fe1) = 0.3 + [Fe/H]_1. But [Fe/H]_1 is 0. So [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So:

log10(n_Si1 / n_Fe1) = 0.3 → n_Si1 = n_Fe1 * 10
