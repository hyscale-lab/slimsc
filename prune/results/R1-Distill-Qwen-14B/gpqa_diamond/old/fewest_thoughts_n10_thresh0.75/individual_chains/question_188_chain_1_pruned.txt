Okay, I need to find the interplanar distance of the (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Let me think about what I remember regarding crystallography and interplanar distances.

So, the question gives me a rhombohedral crystal. I recall that a rhombohedral structure has all sides equal and all angles equal, which is the case here—alpha, beta, gamma are all 30 degrees. The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between atoms, but in this context, for a simple cubic structure, the lattice parameter 'a' is the same as the interatomic distance. So I think a = 10 Angstroms here.

The interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. For a given set of Miller indices (hkl), the formula for the interplanar distance d is given by d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) - √2 hk - √2 hl - √2 kl ). Or wait, is that correct? Alternatively, I think there's another formula. Oh right, the general formula for interplanar spacing in a rhombohedral system is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - hk√(cos α) + ... wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the general formula for a crystal with a basis.

Wait, maybe the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) -
