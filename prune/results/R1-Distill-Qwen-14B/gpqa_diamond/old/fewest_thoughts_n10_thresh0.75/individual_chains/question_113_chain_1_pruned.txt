Okay, so I've got this problem here about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me see if I can figure this out step by step. 

Alright, the question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. I need to determine the chemical formula from the options provided. The options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, or C6H12O. Hmm, so the molecular formulas all have 6 carbons, but varying hydrogens and oxygen counts.

Let me start by breaking down each technique's data.

FTIR first. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretches. Like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. The broadness suggests maybe hydrogen bonding, which is common in carboxylic acids where the -OH is more acidic and forms stronger hydrogen bonds. Alternatively, maybe an alcohol, but the broadness might point towards something more like a carbonyl group with an OH, like an acid. 

Then, there are two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. 1700 is a classic carbonyl (C=O) stretch, often seen in esters, ketones, maybe aldehydes. The 1650 could be another carbonyl, perhaps an conjugated carbonyl or maybe an aromatic ring with substitution. Wait, or maybe it's an absorption from something else. Oh, wait, another possibility: the 1650 could be a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Or maybe it's a carbonyl in an aromatic ring, like in an aromatic ester or something.

Now, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, so like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. So the structure must have a double bond somewhere.

Mass Spec data: a fragment peak at m/z=45. I'm trying to think about what fragments would give that. 45 is a key mass. Let me think, 45 could be (CH3)2O (which is 45: 12+3*1 +
