Okay, so I've got this problem about the entropy of a supermassive black hole. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the question gives me the angular size of the event horizon, θ, which is 1e-17 degrees, and the distance d is 1e10 parsecs. I need to find the order of magnitude of the entropy of the black hole.

Wait, entropy of a black hole... I remember that the entropy is related to the area of the event horizon. Something like the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. Oh right, the formula is S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area, and the constants are involved.

So first, I need to find the radius of the event horizon, right? Because once I have the radius, I can find the area. But how do I get the radius from the angular size and distance?

Oh, right! The angular size θ in radians is approximately equal to the ratio of the size of the object (the radius, R) to the distance (d). So θ ≈ R / d. But wait, θ is given in degrees, so I'll need to convert that to radians first.

Let me jot that down. θ (in radians) = θ_deg * (π/180). So θ_deg is 1e-17. So θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180.

Once I have θ in radians, R = θ_rad * d. Because R = d * tanθ, and for small angles, tanθ ≈ θ.

But wait, the distance is given in parsecs. I should convert that to meters because all the constants in the formula are in SI units. How many meters is 1 parsec? I think 1 parsec is about 3.086e16 meters. So d = 1e10 parsecs is 1e10 * 3.086e16 = 3.086e26 meters.

Wait, 1e10 parsecs is 10^10 * 3.086e16 m. Let me calculate that: 10^10 is 1e10, multiplied by 3.086e
