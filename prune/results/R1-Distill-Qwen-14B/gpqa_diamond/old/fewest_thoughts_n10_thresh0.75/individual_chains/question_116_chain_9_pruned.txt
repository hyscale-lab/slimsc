Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow. 

The question starts with Compound A, which shows two signals in the proton NMR. The first is a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H, and the second is a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, splitting patterns can give clues about neighboring protons. A triplet usually comes from coupling with two neighboring protons. And a quartet is from coupling with three, I think.

Wait, so the triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H—0.9 is a low ppm, so that's probably CH3 groups attached to something that doesn't have many protons. Like maybe a CH2 group. Because if each CH3 is next to a CH2 with two protons, that would split into a triplet. But wait, 6H as a triplet—so maybe two sets of equivalent CH3 groups.

Similarly, the quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. That's also a CH2 group perhaps, since 4H. If each of these protons is adjacent to a CH2 with three H, like maybe a CH2CH2 group? Wait, no—quartet from coupling with three H? Wait, no, the splitting depends on the number of neighboring H. So a quartet would come from a neighboring group with three H, like a CH3 group.

Wait, putting it together. The triplet (6H) would be two CH3 groups, each next to a CH2. Because each CH3 would have two neighboring H from the CH2, so triplet. And the quartet (4H) would be a CH2 group next to a CH2CH3, perhaps. Oh wait, maybe it's a diethyl group or something similar.

Wait, so for the triplet at 0.9 ppm (6H): that's two CH3 groups, each attached to a CH2. So maybe it's something like CH2CH3, but wait, no, because two CH2CH3 groups would give more H's. Alternatively, maybe it's a diethyl group but as part of a larger structure.

Wait, but let's think about what compound could give such an NMR. The triplet and quartet suggest maybe an ethyl group attached to another ethyl group. Or perhaps a cyclo
