Okay, so I have this question here about quorum-sensing peptides and their effects on yeast. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The question is a bit complex, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, so the setup is that someone identified a new quorum-sensing peptide in Lactobacillus acidophilus. They're interested in whether this peptide's role in intercellular communication is conserved in eukaryotes. They treated yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, with this peptide and observed the formation of the shmoo. Now, they want to study the proteome of the active chromatin in the shmoo using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by mass spectrometry. The question is about which protein complex's proteins will be least observed in their assay. The options are A to D.

First, I need to understand what each part means. Quorum-sensing peptides are involved in communication within bacterial communities. The fact that adding this peptide to yeast caused the formation of a shmoo suggests that the peptide is signaling yeast cells to change their shape or behavior. Shmoo formation in yeast is typically associated with the mating response, right? So the peptide might be acting like a pheromone or a signaling molecule that induces this response.

Now, the main goal is to look at the active chromatin in the shmoo. Active chromatin regions are usually associated with transcriptionally active genes. In such regions, chromatin is more open, allowing transcription factors and other proteins to access the DNA. The method used here is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), which is a technique to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. So, they're probably looking for proteins that bind to active regions of chromatin during the shmoo formation.

The question is about which complex's proteins are least likely to show up in this assay. The options are four different protein complexes.

Let me think about each option:

Option A: Nucleosome histone complex. Nucleosomes are the basic units of chromatin, made up of histone proteins around which DNA wraps. Active chromatin regions are still nucleosome-based, but the structure is more open. So, nucleosomes would definitely be present in active chromatin. So proteins from this complex would be found in the assay.

Option B: Pre-replication complex. This complex assembles during the G1 phase of the cell cycle to license DNA for replication in the S phase. It includes proteins like Cdc6, Cdt1, and the origin recognition complex (ORC). The pre-replication complex is involved in DNA replication, not directly in transcription or chromatin activity. So, would this complex be involved in active chromatin? Probably not, because active chromatin is about transcription, not replication. Unless the yeast are in a phase where they're preparing to replicate DNA, but the question is about the active chromatin in the shmoo, which is a response to a pheromone, likely influencing mating, not cell division. So maybe this complex isn't present in active chromatin regions, making their proteins less likely to be found in the assay.

Option C: Pre-initiation complex. This complex is involved in the initiation of transcription. It includes RNA polymerase II, the general transcription factors (like TFII D, A, B, etc.), and other initiation factors. These proteins are found at the promoters of genes that are being transcribed, which are regions of active chromatin. So their proteins would definitely be present in the assay.

Option D: Enhancer protein complex. Enhancers are regions of DNA that are distant from the promoter but can increase the transcription of genes. Proteins like transcription factors bound to enhancers would be part of the active chromatin. So their proteins would be present in the assay as well.

So, the least likely to be present would be the pre-replication complex (Option B) because their role is in DNA replication, not transcription or chromatin activation. The assay is looking for active chromatin proteins involved in transcription, so the pre-replication complex proteins (like ORC, Cdc6, etc.) wouldn't be found there.

Wait, but yeast cells do have cell cycles, so during which phase are they when they form the shmoo? Shmoo formation is part of the mating response, which is usually under nutrient stress, leading cells to enter the G1 phase, perhaps. If they're in G1, the pre-replication complex is active. But wait, the assay is about the active chromatin in theshmoo. The pre-replication complex is associated with origins of replication, which are regions of the chromatin. But origins are more silent regions, so maybe not part of active chromatin regions being studied here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pre-replication complex is not involved in transcriptional regulation, so their proteins wouldn't be found in the active transcription regions. The other complexes (nucleosome, pre-initiation, enhancer) are more directly involved in transcription or chromatin structure, so their proteins would be found.

So the least observed would be the pre-replication complex, so the answer is B.


The question involves studying the proteome of active chromatin in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae after treatment with a quorum-sensing peptide that induces shmoo formation. The goal is to determine which protein complex's proteins are least likely to be observed in a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay targeting active chromatin regions.

1. **Nucleosome histone complex (Option A):** Nucleosomes are fundamental components of chromatin, and active chromatin regions still contain histones. These proteins are integral to chromatin structure and would be present in the assay.

2. **Pre-replication complex (Option B):** This complex is involved in DNA replication, assembling during the G1 phase to license DNA for replication. It includes proteins like ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1. Since the assay focuses on transcriptionally active chromatin, which is unrelated to DNA replication, proteins from this complex are unlikely to be observed.

3. **Pre-initiation complex (Option C):** This complex is directly involved in transcription initiation, including RNA polymerase II and general transcription factors. These proteins are found at transcriptionally active promoters and would be present in the assay.

4. **Enhancer protein complex (Option D):** Enhancers are regions of DNA that regulate transcription, often binding transcription factors. Proteins associated with enhancers would be part of active chromatin and would be observed in the assay.

The pre-replication complex (Option B) is least likely to be observed because its role in DNA replication is unrelated to transcriptional activity or active chromatin regions. The other complexes are directly involved in transcription or chromatin structure, making their proteins more likely to be detected.

Answer: B
