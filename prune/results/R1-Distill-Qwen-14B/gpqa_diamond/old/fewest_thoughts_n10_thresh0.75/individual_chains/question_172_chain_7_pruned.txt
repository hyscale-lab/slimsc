Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with the excitation of atoms in a star's photosphere, it's related to the thermal energy. The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. Wait, does that mean the excitation here refers to their energy levels? I think so.

The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, 1.38 is close to the Boltzmann constant, which is about 1.38e-23 J/K. So the energy difference ΔE is k*T, maybe? Wait, no, the Boltzmann factor comes into play when considering the probability of atoms being in a certain energy state.

In LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the number of atoms in an excited state compared to the ground state is given by the Boltzmann equation. The ratio is (n_upper / n_lower) = exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). But wait, here it's about the atoms being "excited" in a specific level. So perhaps the excitation here refers to the ratio of the excited state to the lower state.

So, if star_1 has twice as excited atoms as star_2, that ratio is 2 for star_1 and 1 for star_2. Or wait, let me think. The question says the excitation is twice as excited. So for star_1, the ratio n_upper/n_lower is 2 times that of star_2.

Wait, the problem states that in star_1, the excited state is twice as excited as in star_2. So the excitation level is higher, meaning more atoms are in that excited state. So the ratio for star_1 would be 2 times the ratio for star_2.

So the ratio R is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k*T)). Let's write that down.

For star_1: R1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1))
For star_2: R2 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T2))

But according to the problem, R1 = 2 * R2.

So, 2 = R1/R2 = [exp(-ΔE/(k T1))] / [exp(-ΔE/(k T2)))] 

Simplify that: exp( ΔE/(k) [1/(T2) - 1/(T1)] ) = 2.

Taking natural logarithm on both sides: (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2).

Wait, let me do the math again. Because when you divide the exponents, the exponents subtract. So the exponent is [ (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) ] = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) ) ) = ln(2).

So, (ΔE/(k)) ( (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) ) = ln(2)

Wait, wait, let me double-check. Let me re-derive this.

R1 = exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )
R2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )
R1 = 2 R2 → R
