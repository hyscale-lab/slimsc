Okay, so I've got this Lagrangian given: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^{μν}. And I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants. If the coupling has a mass dimension less than or equal to zero, then the interaction term is renormalizable. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, I think it's the other way around. Or maybe I should think in terms of the term's dimension.

Wait, the Lagrangian should have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over d^4x, so each term in the Lagrangian density must have dimension 4. So the entire Lagrangian term, including the coupling constant, must have dimension 4.

So looking at the term κ ψ̄ σ_μν ψ F^{μν}, each field has their own mass dimension. Let me think about each field's dimension. The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2 because in 4D, each field in the Dirac Lagrangian has to make the term dimension 4. So ψ's dimension is 3/2 because (3/2)*2 (since ψ̄ and ψ are each 3/2) plus the derivative terms in the kinetic term gives the right dimension. Wait, no, the kinetic term is something like i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, which has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) + 1 = 4. So yes, ψ is [3/2].

What about F^{μν}? F is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, right? It's the derivative of the vector potential A. So F^{μν} would have dimensions of [mass]^2 because each derivative is [mass], and F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each A has dimension 1 (since ∂ A has dimension 2, and A is [A] =1).

So F^{μν} has [mass]^2 dimension.

Now, sigma_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, gamma_nu]. The gamma matrices
