Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

So, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z when the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is given by the standard deviation of the measurement outcomes, which involves the expectation values of the operator and its square.

First, let me recall the formula for uncertainty. I think it's ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²), where A is the operator. So here, A is P_z. So I need to find ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but the state given is an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. Oh right, but the uncertainty in P_z would involve how this state behaves under P_z. Because the state is not an eigenstate of P_z, the expectation values won't just be the eigenvalues.

The state given is a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me note that down. So the state ψ is a 3-component vector, which probably corresponds to a spin-1 system since the matrices are 3x3.

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. So the basis states are |m=1>, |m=0>, |m=-1>, right? Because P_z has eigenvalues ℏ, 0, -ℏ. So P_z |m> = mℏ |m>, I think.

Wait, but the given state ψ is expressed in terms of these basis vectors. So the components of ψ are the coefficients in this basis.

So, the state ψ is:

ψ = [ -1/2 ] |m=1> + [ 1/√2 ] |m=0> + [ -1/2 ] |m=-1>.

Now, to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate the expectation value of P_z in this state.

Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is just the sum over the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues.

Wait, let me think about that. The expectation value ⟨P_z⟩ = ⟨ψ| P_z |ψ⟩.

Since P_z is diagonal, each term in the
