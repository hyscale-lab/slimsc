Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about the elemental abundances in two stars. Hmm, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, we have two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. The question gives me some abundance ratios determined using the Equivalent Width (EW) method, which I think is a method used to determine the abundance of elements in a star's atmosphere by measuring the strength of spectral lines.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the solar photosphere has:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So, I think I need to find [Si/Star1]/[Si/Star2] or something like that. Wait, no, wait. The ratio of silicon in Star_1 to Star_2, right.

Let me think about what these abundance notations mean. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of the number density of element X to Y, relative to the Sun. So [X/Y]_star = log10(nX/nY in star) - log10(nX/nY in Sun) = log10( (nX/nY in star) / (nX/nY in Sun) )

So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1 is 0. That means [Fe/H]_1 = log10(nFe,n1 / nH,n1) - log10(nFe,sun / nH,sun) ) = 0. So nFe,n1 / nH,n1 = nFe,sun / nH,sun. So the ratio [Fe/H] is 0, meaning Star_1 has the same iron to hydrogen ratio as the Sun.

Similarly, Star_2's [Mg/H] is 0, so nMg,n2 / nH,n2 = nMg,sun / nH,sun. So Mg to H is same as Sun.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the ratio of silicon in the two stars. So I need [Si]_1 and [Si]_2, then compute their ratio.

Let me break it down.

First, let's find [Si/H] for each star. Because [Si/Fe] is given for Star_1, and [Mg/Si] is given for Star_2, but I need to find [Si/H] for each.

Starting with Star_1:
[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. So [Si/Fe]_1 = log10(nSi,n1 / nFe,n1) - log10(nSi,sun /nFe,sun) ) = 0.3

We can rearrange this as log10( (nSi,n1 / nFe,n1) / (nSi,sun / nFe,sun) ) ) = 0.3

Which implies (nSi,n1 / nFe,n1 ) = (nSi,sun /nFe,sun) * 10^0.3

But wait, I also know that [Fe/H]_1 is 0, so nFe,n1 / nH,n1 = nFe,sun / nH,sun.

Let me denote n
