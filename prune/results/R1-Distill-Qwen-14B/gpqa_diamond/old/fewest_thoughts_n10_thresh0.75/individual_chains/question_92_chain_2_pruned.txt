Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But wait, how exactly do I approach this?

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to count the number of atoms in this molecule. Wait, maybe I should first figure out the structure. It looks like a diene with some substituents. But maybe the exact structure isn't as important as the number of each type of bond in the molecule.

The problem gives me some bond energies: H-H is 100 kJ/mol, C-C is 200, C=C is 300, and C-H is 400. Oh, and the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element and turn it into gaseous atoms. For carbon, that's 1000 kJ/mol.

So, to find the enthalpy of formation, I need to calculate the total bond energies in the compound and compare it to the bonds in the elements (which are in their standard states here). Oh right, the general formula is:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies in the compound) - (sum of bond energies in the elements)

But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy. Oh no, wait, the correct formula is the opposite. Because when forming the molecule, you're breaking bonds in the reactants (elements) and forming bonds in the product. So the enthalpy of formation is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants minus the bond energies of the product.

Wait, no, wait. No, I think it's the other way around. The bond energies are the energies required to break bonds. So, when you form a molecule, you have to break the bonds in the reactants, which requires energy, and then form the bonds in the product, which releases energy. The formation enthalpy would be the energy required to break the reactants minus the energy released when forming the product bonds. So the formula would be:
