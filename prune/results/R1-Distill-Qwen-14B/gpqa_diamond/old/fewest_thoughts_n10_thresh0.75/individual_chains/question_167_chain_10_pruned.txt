Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a SchrÃ¶dinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think it through step by step.

First, I remember that Gaussian states are states whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions. They include coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states. Non-Gaussian states, on the other hand, don't have this property, and they're important in quantum optics and quantum computing because certain operations are easier with Gaussian states, but some tasks require non-Gaussian ones.

The problem gives a specific state |Ïˆ> which is a superposition of two coherent states: |alpha> and |-alpha>. The state is written as (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N, where N is the normalization constant. The normalization N is given as the square root of (1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2 alpha squared)). 

The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. So I need to plug these into the formula to find N first, maybe.

Wait, but the question is about calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure. The formula for del_b is given as the difference between the traces of rho ln rho and tau ln tau. So del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). I think this is the relative entropy between rho and tau, where tau is a Gaussian state. Since rho is non-Gaussian, this should give a positive value, I suppose.

But wait, how exactly is the relative entropy used here? Oh, right, the relative entropy (also called Kullback-Leibler divergence) measures how different rho is from tau. So if rho is non-Gaussian and tau is Gaussian, the nG is this difference.

But wait, let's think about Gaussian states. Coherent states are Gaussian. So the state |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states. But when you take a superposition of two coherent states, the resulting state is non-Gaussian, right? Because the Wigner function of a coherent state is a Gaussian, but a superposition would have a Wigner function with interference terms, making it non-Gaussian.

So the state given here is a non-Gaussian state because it's a superposition of two coherent states. Therefore, the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

But wait, the options include option D) 0. How could that be? Maybe if the state is Gaussian. Hmm. When would that happen? I remember that if phi is zero or pi/2, the state becomes a single coherent state, which is Gaussian. So for phi=0, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. But in our case, phi is -pi/4.

Wait, let me calculate sin(2 phi) first with phi = -pi/4. So 2 phi would be -pi/2, and sin(-pi/2) is -1. So sin(2 phi) is -1.

Now, the normalization N is given by sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)). Plugging in sin(2 phi)=-1 and alpha=0.5, we get N = sqrt(1 + (-1) * exp(-2*(0.5)^2)).

Calculating exp(-2 * 0.25) is exp(-0.5) which is approximately 0.6065. So sin(2 phi) * exp(...) is -0.6065. So 1 + (-0.6065) is 0.3935. Then sqrt(0.3935) is approximately 0.6275. So N is about 0.6275.

But wait, let's try to compute it more accurately. Maybe I'll just keep it symbolic for now, but perhaps exact values are needed for calculation.

Wait, but perhaps I don't need the exact N for calculating the non-Gaussianity. Because the question is about the relative entropy, which depends on the state rho and the reference Gaussian state tau.

The problem is asking for the non-Gaussianity, which is the relative entropy between rho and tau. But what is the reference Gaussian state tau? The problem says "the reference Gaussian state". Hmm. I think in some cases, the reference Gaussian state is taken as the closest Gaussian state to rho in some sense, perhaps the one that minimizes the relative entropy. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the state you'd get if you "collapse" the superposition into a coherent state or something.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the one that is the "average" of the two coherent states in the superposition. For example, in the case of a two-mode squeezed state, perhaps the reference is a coherent state with some amplitude. Alternatively, maybe the reference is a coherent state |beta>, where beta is the average of
