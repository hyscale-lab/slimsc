Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about nuclear fission and relativistic effects. Hmm, let me try to break it down. 

The question says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. So, wait, I need to find the difference between the actual kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the classical approximation of it.

Wait, okay, let's start by figuring out the masses of the two fragments. The initial mass is M, and the sum of the two fragments' rest masses is 0.99M. Also, one is twice as massive as the other. Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m, so the heavier one is 2m. So m + 2m = 3m = 0.99M. Therefore, m = (0.99M)/3, which is 0.33M. So the lighter fragment is 0.33M and the heavier is 0.66M. 

Wait, but that's the rest masses. So the initial nucleus has rest mass M, and after fission, the two fragments have rest masses 0.33M and 0.66M. So the initial rest mass energy is 300 GeV. Therefore, the initial rest mass M is 300 GeV / c², but since we're dealing with energies in GeV, maybe we can ignore the c² as it's a constant factor. Or perhaps it's better to just work in units where c=1, so energy and mass are directly related.

Now, the nucleus is initially at rest, so the total momentum before fission is zero. By conservation of momentum, the total momentum after fission must also be zero. So the two fragments must move in opposite directions with momenta of equal magnitude. 

Let me think about their velocities. Since they're moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, relativistic effects are important. So, we can't use classical mechanics; that's why the question is asking about
