Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability has to do with the mass dimensions of the coupling constants. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, that's the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices, which is related to the spinor representation of the field strength tensor.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should determine the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. Remember, in natural units, the Lagrangian has mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless, and the integral is over four dimensions (so each term in L must have dimension 4).

So, let's look at the structure of the term. The term is ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Let me write down each field's mass dimension:

- Fermion ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for Dirac spinors, [ψ]_M = 3/2.
- The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from a gauge field A, which has dimension 1. F is the field strength, which is the derivative of A plus terms with A squared. So each derivative is dimension 1, and A is dimension 1. So F would have dimension 2, because the derivative (dim 1) of A (dim 1) is dim 2. Alternatively, F^{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ + ..., so each A has dim 1, and the derivatives add 1, so F has dim 2.

Now, the term ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν} is the product of ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

Wait, ψ̄ is the adjoint spinor, which has the same dimension as ψ, so 3/2.

σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices. Each gamma matrix is dimensionless, I think. Because in natural units, the gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is (i/2) [γ_μ, γ_ν], which would also be dimensionless. So when you contract with ψ̄ and ψ, you're just doing a matrix product, not affecting dimensions.

So now, breaking down each part's dimension:

ψ̄: 3/2
σ_{μν}: 0
ψ: 3/2
F^{μν}: 2

Multiply all these together: (3/2) * (0) * (3/2) * 2 = but wait, no, that's not the way. Wait, the product is (ψ̄) * (σ_{μν}) * (ψ) * (F^{μν}). So each term's dimension is additive when multiplied.

Wait, no
