Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. Hmm, right, I remember from my notes that the potential is V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r², which is the same as a three-dimensional harmonic oscillator. So the setup is in spherical coordinates, and the particle is moving under a Hooke's law force.

The question asks for two things: the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with that energy. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to recall how the energy levels work in a 3D harmonic oscillator. Oh right, in three dimensions, the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. Wait, wait, no, more accurately, the energy depends on the principal quantum number. Or is it? Let me think.

Wait, in three dimensions, the energy levels are given by E = ħω(n + l + 3/2), where n is the number of quanta, but wait no, perhaps I'm mixing this up. Oh, right, no. Wait, in 3D, the energy levels are actually E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. But another way to think about it is that the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction. So each direction contributes a quantum number: n_x, n_y, n_z. So n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

But wait, no, wait a second. Oh wait, I think in 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized as E = ħω (N + 3/2), where N is the total number of quanta, N = n_x + n_y + n_z. So each N corresponds to an energy level. And each level with a certain N has a certain number of states, corresponding to the different ways n_x, n_y, n_z can add up to N.

So the energy levels are equally spaced, with each level having a certain degeneracy. Now, what's the ground state? The ground state is the lowest energy, which would be when N=0, so E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2
