Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct sequence of reactions to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize it better. The compound is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Position 3 has a bromine, and position 5 has a nitro group. Additionally, the ethanone group (which is a ketone) is connected to the benzene at position 1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO-, so the ketone is connected to the benzene as a substituent. So the benzene ring has three substituents: Br at position 3, nitro at 5, and the acetyl group (from ethan-1-one) at position 1. Or wait, wait, the numbering might be different. Let me think: the substituents on the benzene would be in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the acetyl group. So, the acetyl is at position 1, bromo at 3, and nitro at 5. So the benzene has three substituents: acetyl (position 1), Br (3), nitro (5). So the substituents are in the meta positions relative to each other. Wait, no, 1,3,5 are all meta positions. So the benzene is heavily substituted.

Now, to get this from benzene, I need to add these substituents. Since benzene is symmetric, the order in which I add substituents can affect the positions where they attach. Also, the directing effects of the substituents will influence where subsequent groups attach.

Let me think about the substituents. Nitro groups are meta directors, bromine can be ortho/para but can be deactivating, and the acetyl group (as a ketone) is a meta director as well. Wait, the acetyl group is an electron-withdrawing group, so it's meta directing.

So, the strategy is to add the substituents in a way that allows each new group
