Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, spin states are usually represented as column vectors, right? So probably this is a two-component vector, like [3i, 4] transposed into a column. So ψ would be |ψ> = [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula <S_y> = <ψ| S_y |ψ>, where S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. Oh wait, but wait, S_y is related to the Pauli matrices. I remember the Pauli matrices σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and the spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ.

So the spin operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times the σ_y matrix. Let me write that down. The σ_y matrix is given as:

[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

Now, to compute the expectation value, I need to calculate ψ† S_y ψ. Let me clarify the steps. First, I'll write down the ψ vector. Since ψ is (3i, 4), the conjugate transpose ψ† would be [ -3, 4i ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3, and 4 is real, so the conjugate is 4. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. The conjugate of 3i is indeed -3i's conjugate is -3i? Wait, no. Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, no. The complex conjugate of 3i is 3i's conjugate. Oh wait, no. The complex conjugate of a complex number a + ib is a - ib. So 3i is 0 + 3i, so its conjugate is -3i. So, ψ† is the row vector [ -3i, 4 ]? No, wait, no. Wait, actually, the original state is [3i; 4], so ψ† would be [3i*,
