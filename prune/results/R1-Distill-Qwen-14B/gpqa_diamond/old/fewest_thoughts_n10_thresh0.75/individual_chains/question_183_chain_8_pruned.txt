Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a certain reaction. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the degrees of unsaturation. Oh right, each ring or double bond counts as one degree. So the index is the total number of rings plus double bonds plus triple bonds, etc.

The compound given is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. The main structure is a cyclohexene ring, which already has one double bond. Let me draw this out mentally. So cyclohexene has a six-membered ring with one double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

At position 2, there's a formyl group. Formyl is a CHO group. And at position 5, there's a vinyl group. Vinyl is CHâ‚‚=CH-, right? So the structure is a cyclohexene ring: positions 1, 2, 3, etc. So 2 is the formyl, 5 is the vinyl, and the ring has a double bond at position 3. So the ring structure would be cyclohex-3-ene.

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Oh, and the carboxylic acid group is at position... where? Let me think about the numbering. The main chain is the cyclohexene ring. The substituents are numbered in a way that gives the lowest numbers. So the carboxylic acid (COOH) would probably be at position 1, but let me confirm.

Wait, the main substituents are the formyl, vinyl, and the carboxylic acid. Let's think about the numbering. In cyclohexane derivatives, the substituents are numbered in such a way that they get the lowest possible numbers. So the double bond is at position 3, and the substituents at 2 and 5. The carboxylic acid is another substituent. Wait, is the carboxylic acid part of the same numbering?

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the parent is cyclohex-
