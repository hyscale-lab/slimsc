Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and cosmology. Hmm, let me think. The question says that a quasar is observed, and in the near infrared and optical spectrum, there's a peak at about 790 nm. At shorter wavelengths (<790 nm), the flux drops significantly. 

Wait, I remember that in quasars, emission lines can be broad and sometimes have a prominent peak. But I'm a bit rusty on the specifics. Oh wait, maybe this peak is part of the Lyman-alpha forest or something related to the Lyman series? Or perhaps it's the Lyman-alpha emission line itself. Lyman-alpha is at about 121 nm in the rest frame, right? But if the observed wavelength is 790 nm, that's much longer. So that suggests a redshift.

Redshift z is calculated using the formula z = (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So let's compute that. The rest wavelength for Lyman-alpha is 121.6 nm. Observed is 790 nm. So z = (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me do that calculation. 790 divided by 121.6 is approximately... 790 / 120 is about 6.58, so 6.58 minus 1 is about 5.58. So z is roughly 5.58. 

Wait, but the question says that for wavelengths shorter than 790, the flux drops. Hmm, why? Oh right, because in the rest frame of the quasar, the emission line is at 121.6 nm. So if the quasar is at redshift z, then the rest frame UV emission would be observed at (1 + z)*121.6 nm. But the flux drops at wavelengths below that because the intergalactic medium (like the IGM) absorbs those wavelengths. So anything bluer than the peak would be absorbed, meaning that the peak is the Lyman-alpha emission line, and the drop-off is the so-called 'Lyman break'. So this tells us the quasar's redshift is z â‰ˆ 5.58.

Now the question is about the comoving distance to this quasar. The universe is described by the Lambda-CDM model with H0=70 km/s/Mpc, matter density Omega_m=0.3, dark energy Omega_lambda=0.7, and flat (so Omega_total=1). We need to compute the comoving distance at a=1, which is the current scale factor, meaning we're looking for the comoving distance today, which is the same as the proper distance at z=5.58.

Wait, no. Wait, no: the comoving distance is the distance that would be measured by a hypothetical observer if the expansion rate were such that the scale factor a increases in a way that the comoving coordinates remain fixed. The comoving distance is D_C = (1+z) * the integral from 0 to z of c/(H0 * E(x)) dx, where E(x) = sqrt(Omega_m*(1+x)^3 + Omega_lambda). 

Wait, actually, the proper distance is D = a(t) * comoving distance. But comoving distance
