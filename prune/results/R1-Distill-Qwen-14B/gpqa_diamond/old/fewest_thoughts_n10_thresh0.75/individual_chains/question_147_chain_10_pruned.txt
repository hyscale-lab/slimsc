Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation, and I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the problem says.

The process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton are annihilating into two particles each of A⁺ and A⁻. Hmm, right, I remember that when particles annihilate, they convert into other particles, often with some energy considerations.

The antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe we can consider it as a low-energy approximation. The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. Wait, but what's the mass of the proton? Oh right, the proton mass is about 938 MeV/c². So m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV. But the problem probably expects me to use the given m_A, which is 300 MeV. 

So the antiproton is moving slowly. Since it's an annihilation process, the initial kinetic energy is probably low, but the specifics might require using conservation laws. Wait, but the antiproton is moving, so the initial total energy isn't just the rest mass of the proton and antiproton. Oh, but wait, the antiproton is moving, but the problem says it's "slowly moving"—so maybe its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. So perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as the sum of the rest energies, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, another thought. Since
