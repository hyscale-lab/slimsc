Okay, I need to find the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. Hmm, this seems a bit tricky, but I think I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, right? And HCl is a strong acid. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a hydroxide of an alkali earth metal. So, I think the reaction between the acids and the base will involve neutralization, but I need to figure out the stoichiometry.

Let me think about the steps. I should calculate the moles of each substance first because the volume and concentration are given. Then, determine which acids and bases will react, and in what proportions. 

So, let's calculate the moles for each solution:

1. CH3COOH solution: 500 mL (which is 0.5 L) of 0.1 M.
Moles = Molarity × Volume = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

2. HCl solution: 400 mL (0.4 L) of 0.2 M.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

3. Ba(OH)2 solution: 300 mL (0.3 L) of 0.3 M.
Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Now, I need to consider the reaction between these substances. First, HCl and Ba(OH)2 will react because both are strong. Then, any excess of acid will react with the weak acid CH3COOH, but wait, actually, I think I should first find the net acid or base after all reactions.

Wait, no. The Ba(OH)2 will react with both HCl and CH3COOH, but since HCl is a stronger acid, perhaps it will react first. Or maybe, since HCl is a strong acid, it will completely dissociate, and Ba(OH)2, a strong base, will also completely dissociate. So their reaction will proceed until one is consumed or they neutralize each other.

Let me write down the possible reactions.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when it reacts with HCl (strong acid), the reaction would be:

Ba(OH)2 + 2 HCl → BaCl2 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of Ba(OH)2 reacts with 2 moles of HCl.

Similarly, Ba(OH)2 can also react with CH3COOH (weak acid), but since HCl is a strong acid, maybe the HCl will react first with the Ba(OH)2, and any remaining Ba(OH)2 will then react with the acetic acid.

Wait, but the initial step is to calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- from each solution, because when you mix, the H+ and OH- will react.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of all the H+ ions from the acids and all the OH- ions from the base, then see which one is in excess.

But wait, each solution is mixed, so the total volume is 500 + 400 +300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

But let me calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, the sources of H+ are HCl and CH3COOH.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives 1 mole of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, and it doesn't dissociate completely. So the moles of H+ from CH3COOH would be less than 0.05, but I think in this case, the initial neutralization would first consume the H+ from the strong acid, then from the weak
