Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as vectors in a Hilbert space, right? So I'm assuming this is a vector in a three-dimensional space since it's a column vector with three elements. Oh wait, but wait a secondâ€”those elements are (-1, 2, 1). Are those supposed to be probabilities or amplitudes? Hmm, actually, in quantum states, the components should be complex numbers, but here they're real. So maybe it's just a normalized state or not? Let me check the sum of squares: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. Oh, so the vector's norm is sqrt(6). So that's not a unit vector. But perhaps the state is not normalized, or maybe it's just given in some arbitrary form, and we'll have to normalize it if needed for probabilities.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be a unit vector because the probabilities have to sum to 1. So maybe I should first normalize this state. So the normalization factor would be 1/sqrt(6), because the norm is sqrt(6). So the actual state vector would be ( (-1)/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

But I'm not sure if the problem expects me to normalize it. The question is about measuring P and then Q, and the probabilities, so maybe I need to proceed without normalizing, but I'm a bit confused.

Next, the operators for P and Q are given. Let's see, the matrix for P has elements in the first row as 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0; second row as 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2); third row as 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0. Hmm. And the matrix for Q is diagonal: first row [1,0,0], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,-1]. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So the possible outcomes when measuring Q are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q. We're to find the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, but wait, the measurement of P and then Q. So I think the process is that after measuring P, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that new state.

But wait, alternatively, perhaps when you measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P, and then the state for Q's measurement is that same eigenstate, so the probabilities are the product of the probabilities for P and Q.

Wait, but maybe I should approach this step by step.

First, let's find the possible outcomes of P and the corresponding eigenvectors.

The operator P's matrix is:
