Okay, so I have this physics problem about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed can be found using energy conservation. But since this is relativistic, I need to think about how relativity affects things.

The problem states it's a 1D oscillator with mass m and maximum amplitude A. The force is F = -kx, which is Hooke's law. I need to find the maximum speed v_max.

In the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed is given by (kA²)/m. But wait, that's option C. But the question is relativistic, so I can't just use that. Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, c.

So, in relativity, the energy of the oscillator is not just the classical kinetic and potential energy. The total energy E in relativity for a moving object is gamma times mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, in a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx² as usual, but the kinetic energy is not (1/2)mv²; it's (gamma - 1)mc².

Wait, but in the oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA² at maximum displacement because x = A. At the equilibrium point (x=0), all energy is kinetic. So I can set the total energy (which is conserved) equal to the sum of the potential and kinetic energies.

At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest momentarily, so velocity is zero. So the total energy E is (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, no—that's the non-relativistic case. In the relativistic case, the potential energy is still (1/2)kA², but the kinetic energy when the oscillator is moving is different.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The potential energy is (1/2)kx². At x = A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc². At maximum displacement, the velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero, so the total energy is (1/2)kA². At the equilibrium point (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is the kinetic energy, which is (gamma - 1)mc². Therefore, setting these equal: (1
