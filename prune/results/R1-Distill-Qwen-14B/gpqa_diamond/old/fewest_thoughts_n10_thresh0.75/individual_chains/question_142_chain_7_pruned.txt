Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. So, this ρ must be a mixed state since it's a statistical mixture of |0> and |1>.

Wait, what's the structure of a qubit's density matrix? Oh right, a qubit is a two-level system, so the density matrix is 2x2. The general form is ρ = [[a, b],[c, d]], where a, b, c, d are elements. Since this is a density matrix, it must be Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and have trace equal to 1.

Looking at the given ρ, it's (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute that. |0><0| is a matrix [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then, multiplying by 1/2, we get (1/2)I, so the matrix ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. 

Wait, that looks familiar. That's the maximally mixed state for a qubit. The maximally mixed state has equal probabilities for both states, so it's completely uncertain whether the qubit is 0 or 1. 

But the question is about the geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I think qubit space can be visualized in a Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside. 

The Bloch vector representation comes into play here. For a qubit, the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector (r_x, r_y, r_z) as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, let's compare that to our ρ.

Our ρ is (I)/2, because (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|) equals (I)/2. So, using the formula, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That implies that r·σ must be zero. 

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, r·σ = r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z. For this to be zero, each component must be zero. So, r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. Thus, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the center of the Bloch sphere.

Wait, but wait a minute. The maximally mixed state is represented at the origin in the Bloch sphere. Because it's completely mixed, it's as if the qubit is in a classical mixture of |0> and |1>, with no quantum coherence or direction. So yes, the Bloch vector is zero.

Looking back at the options, option C is r=(0,0
