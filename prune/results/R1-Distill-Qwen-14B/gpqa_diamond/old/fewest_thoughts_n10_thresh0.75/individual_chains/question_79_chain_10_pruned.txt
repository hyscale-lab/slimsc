Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about identifying compound X based on the NMR data of the product after a reaction. 

First, the reaction details: Compound X is treated with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. I'm not exactly sure what that reagent does. Wait, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane sounds familiar. Oh right, that's a type of amine, maybe it's used in some kind of ring-opening or addition reaction. Or perhaps it's a base? Alternatively, I remember that in some cases, such as the Sharpless epoxidation, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, 1,4-diazabicyclo... Oh wait, that's a crown ether structure, but more importantly, I think it's used in the formation of epoxides from alkenes. Oh wait, no, another thought—maybe it's a catalyst or a base in some elimination reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the product's NMR data is given. The reaction probably involves some transformation of compound X into a product, perhaps an epoxide or something else. Let's look at the NMR data.

The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first two are singlets: δ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). So two methyl groups, each as singlets. That suggests they are perhaps attached to something deshielded, maybe adjacent to an oxygen or in a conjugated system. Wait, but in the 13C NMR, the carbons at 21.3 and 28.4 are both singlets. So each of these is a single carbon. So maybe two separate methyl groups.

Next, the aromatic region: 6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d). So four signals in the aromatic region. Let me think about how that integrates. So two doublets of 2H each and two doublets of 1H each. Maybe that's a para-substituted benzene ring with some substituents causing splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a styrene-type structure, with substituents on the benzene.

Wait, looking at the coupling: The 7.71 (2H, d) and 7.08 (2H, d) might be a pair of para-substituted protons, or perhaps part of a conjugated diene. Wait, but in the 1H NMR, each of these is a doublet. So maybe a coupling between two sets of two protons each. Like in a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents that each have two protons, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, maybe it's a para-substituted ring where each substituent is a -CH2- group or something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the aromatic region represents
