Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here. Let me see what it's about. Oh right, Grubbs catalyst and racemic 3-methylpent-1-ene. Hmm, I remember Grubbs is used for olefin metathesis reactions. So, the question is about how many possible products are formed when this compound reacts with Grubbs catalyst, excluding ethene.

Wait, racemic means it's a 50-50 mixture of enantiomers. So the starting material must have a chiral center. Let me draw the structure of 3-methylpent-1-ene. Pent-1-ene has five carbons, double bond between C1 and C2. The 3-methyl would be on C3. So the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH2CH3)- something? Wait, no, wait. Let's think again. For 3-methylpent-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The structure would be CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, pentane means five carbons. So, 3-methylpent-1-ene would be CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH2CH3)- something? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, let's count. Pent-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3. Now, 3-methyl would be a methyl group on carbon 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it 3-methylpent-1-ene. Wait, but that would be 3-methylpent-1-ene: CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, wait: the formula for pentene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-ene would have the formula C6H12? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait: pentene is C5H10. 3-methylpent-1-
