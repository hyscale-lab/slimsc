Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's take it step by step. The question is about a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone and ending up with product 4. We need to determine how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. Hmm, okay, let me think about each step.

First reaction: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2), forming product 1. I remember that cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When a ketone reacts with bromine, it probably undergoes a bromination. Wait, but cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh right, bromine can add to the carbonyl group in a ketone. So adding Br2 to cyclohexanone would lead to the formation of a dibromide. I think the carbonyl group (C=O) is attacked by Br, so the product would be 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? No, wait, wait. When a ketone reacts with excess bromine, it typically forms a geminal dibromide. So cyclohexanone (which is (CH2)5C-O) would become (CH2)5CBr2, making product 1 as 1,1-dibromocyclohexane maybe? Or is it 1,2? Wait, no. The carbonyl is at one position, so adding Br across the carbonyl would mean adding two Brs to the same carbon, making it a geminal dibromide. So product 1 is 1,1-dibromocyclohexane. 

Second reaction: Product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), forming product 2. Heating a dibromide with NaOH... Oh, that sounds like an elimination reaction. So if product 1 is 1,1-dibromocyclohexane, heating with NaOH would likely eliminate HBr. Since both Brs are on the same carbon, elimination would form a double bond. So the product would be cyclohexene. Because when you have geminal dihalides and eliminate, you lose two equivalents of HX (here, HBr) and form a double bond. So product 2 is cyclohexene.

Third reaction: Product 2 is treated with thionyl chloride (SOCl2) and pyridine, forming product 3. Thionyl chloride is commonly used to convert alcohols to chlorides, but wait, product
