Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question starts with cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. The first step is treating it with bromine. Hmm, what happens when a ketone reacts with bromine? Oh right, when ketones are treated with bromine (Br2), it usually leads to a dibromination. Wait, no—wait, I think it's an addition reaction. Oh wait, bromine adds to the carbonyl group in a ketone. So cyclohexanone, which has a carbonyl group, would react with Br2. The mechanism would form a bromonium ion intermediate, right? So the carbonyl oxygen would attack the Br2, leading to the opening and adding two bromine atoms across the carbonyl. So cyclohexanone would become 1,2-dibromocyclohexane? Or wait, maybe 1,2-dibromocyclohexane as product 1.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, when a ketone reacts with bromine, it forms an epoxide. No, wait, that's when it's under specific conditions, like with peracids or something. Oh no, wait—I think I got that mixed up. Epoxidation is with peracids, like mCPBA. Bromine addition to ketones is different. Oh right, the bromine adds across the carbonyl group. So the product would be a vicinal dihalide. So cyclohexanone would add Br2 to become 1,2-dibromocyclohexane. So product 1 is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane.

Next step, product 1 is heated with sodium hydroxide, forming product 2. Sodium hydroxide is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So with a dihalide, heating with NaOH would likely lead to an elimination reaction, probably forming an alkene. Since the dihalide is vicinal (two adjacent Br atoms), elimination (like dehydrohalogenation) would occur. So when 1,2-dibromocyclohexane is treated with NaOH, especially under heat, it would undergo elimination to form cyclohexene. Wait, but wait—the positions matter. The starting material is 1,2-dibromocyclohexane, so heating
