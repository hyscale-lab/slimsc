Okay, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem. Hmm, it's about oscillating charges and radiation. Let me think. So the question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. 

The main point is about the radiated power per unit solid angle in the radiation zone. The function f depends on lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also figure out the possible form of f, whether it's lambda^-4 or something else.

I remember that when a charge oscillates, it emits electromagnetic radiation. The dipole radiation is a common example. The power radiated by a dipole antenna depends on the angle theta. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is such that the power is maximum along the equator, i.e., at theta = 90 degrees, and it falls off as you go towards the poles (theta = 0 and 180).

Wait, the formula for the radiation pattern of a dipole... I think the power per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) varies with theta as sin(theta)^2. So at theta = 90 degrees, sin(theta) is 1, so the intensity is maximum. At theta = 0, it's zero. So the intensity pattern is symmetric around the equator.

But wait, the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees. So first, I need to find what fraction the power at 30 degrees is compared to the maximum at 90 degrees.

Wait, but the maximum power is A. The question says, 'the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle theta = 30 degrees.' So if A is the maximum, then the power at 30 degrees is A multiplied by some factor.

So for the dipole case, the intensity (power per unit solid angle) is proportional to sin(theta)^2. So the maximum intensity is when sin(theta)=1, which is at theta=90 degrees. So the intensity at theta is I(theta) = I_max * sin(theta)^2.

But the total power is the integral of I(theta) over all solid
