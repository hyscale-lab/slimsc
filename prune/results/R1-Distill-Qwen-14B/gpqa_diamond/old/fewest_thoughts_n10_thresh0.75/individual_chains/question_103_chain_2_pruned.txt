Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis reactions can be tricky. But let's take it step by step. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. I need to choose the correct sequence of reactions from the given options A to D.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule to visualize it better. The molecule is a phenyl group substituted with a ketone (ethan-1-one, which is an acetophenone group), a bromine, and a nitro group. The substituents are at positions 3 and 5 on the benzene ring. Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering it, the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. Or wait, maybe I have to think about how the substituents are arranged. Wait, the structure is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl attached to a ketone. So phenyl group with substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the ketone is at position 1.

So the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone, Br, and NO2. So their positions are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Alternatively, in the benzene ring, the substituents are at positions 1,3,5, but wait noâ€”wait, the substituents are at positions 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. Or wait, the substituents are on the benzene ring: the ketone is at position 1, bromine at 3, nitro at 5. So the ring has a meta arrangement between Br and NO2, and the ketone is in the position 1, which is adjacent to both. Hmm, wait, how does that arrangement work? Because on a benzene ring, positions 1,3,5 are all meta to each other. So the substituents would be in such a way that the ketone is at 1, bromine at 3, and nitro at 5.

So the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the benz
