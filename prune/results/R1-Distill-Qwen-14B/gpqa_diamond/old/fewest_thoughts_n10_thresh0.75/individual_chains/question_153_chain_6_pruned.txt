Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. Let me think about the steps involved.

The problem has three different reactions, labeled A, B, and C, each with different reactants and conditions. I need to figure out the major products for each and match them to the options provided.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate reacting with methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. I think NaOEt is a base, maybe acting as a catalyst or deprotonating something. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a saponified ester, so the enolate would form easily. The other reactant is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester, which is the Michael acceptor.

In the Michael addition, the enolate (from dimethyl malonate) attacks the beta carbon of the acrylate. Wait, the acrylate is (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. So the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with a p-tolyl group on the CH2 part? Or wait, the (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituents on either side of the double bond are arranged in an E configuration. Wait no, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2-C(C6H4-4Me)=CH2? No, wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the p-tolyl group on the third carbon? No, that can't be right. Oh, wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-CO-OCH3 but with a p-tolyl group attached to the CH2. So the structure is CH2(p-tolyl)-CH2-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, I think I need to get the
