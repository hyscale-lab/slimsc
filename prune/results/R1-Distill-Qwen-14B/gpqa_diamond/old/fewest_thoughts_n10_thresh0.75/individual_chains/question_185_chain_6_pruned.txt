Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator and eigenvalues. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me think through it.

The Hamiltonian given is H = εσ·n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices and n is a unit vector. So σ·n would be the dot product of the Pauli matrices with the direction vector n. Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ·n would be n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

Eigenvalues of a matrix are found by solving the equation H|ψ> = E|ψ>, where E is the eigenvalue and |ψ> is the eigenvector. For a spin-½ system, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. The eigenvalues of each Pauli matrix are ±1, right? But when you take a linear combination like σ·n, what happens?

Oh, wait, I think σ·n is a matrix whose eigenvalues are determined by the magnitude of the vector n in the Pauli matrix space. Since n is a unit vector, the magnitude of the vector in the σ space would be sqrt(n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) = 1. So the operator σ·n would have eigenvalues ±1 multiplied by ε?

Wait, let me think. The general form for the eigenvalues of a spin operator in a direction n is ± ħ/2 times something. Wait, no, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So when you multiply σ·n by ε, the eigenvalues would be ε times the eigenvalues of σ·n.

Wait, what's the trace and determinant of σ·n? The trace of σ·n is n_x Tr(σ_x) + n_y Tr(σ_y) + n_z Tr(σ_z). But each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero. So the trace of H is zero, which makes sense because the eigenvalues should add up to zero.

The determinant would be (ε σ·n) determinant. The determinant of a 2x2 matrix (a b; c d) is ad - bc. For each Pauli matrix, the determinant is -1. But when you combine them, I'm not sure. Alternatively, the eigenvalues of a matrix satisfy the equation (E - λ1)(E - λ2) = 0, where λ1 and λ2 are the eigenvalues
