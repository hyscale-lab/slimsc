Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to walk through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are different types of propenyl and butenyl acetates, specifically whether they're cis or trans. So the compounds are either Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate.

Hmm, first, I need to figure out what each of these structures looks like. Acetate esters usually have an acetyl group (OAc) attached to an oxygen, which is connected to an alkyl group. In the case of propenyl or butenyl acetates, the alkyl chain will have a double bond.

Wait, let me think about the structures. For propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2CH2OAc, but wait no, propenyl is CH2CHCH2, but wait no, propenyl is actually CH2=CHCH2- as the group. Oh wait, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or is it CH2CH2OAc where the double bond is elsewhere. Hmm, maybe I should think of it as CH2=CH-OAc. No, wait, acetate is OAc-, so the structure would be something like CH2CH2-OAc, but with a double bond. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. Let's break it down. For propenyl acetate, the propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. Wait, but actually, the correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CH2CH2-OAc? No, wait, perhaps it's CH2=CH-OCH2COOCH3? No, wait, no, wait. Maybe it's more accurate to think that the propenyl group is the substituent on the ester oxygen. So the general formula is R-OAc, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Similarly, butenyl would be a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

But wait, the butenyl group could be either cis or trans, depending on the position of the substituents around the double bond. Same with propenyl. Wait, but propenyl has three carbons, so if it's propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-.

Wait, but wait, the options given are Cis-propenyl acetate and Trans-propenyl acetate. Wait, but propenyl has only one double bond, so how can it be cis or trans? Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Because propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2. So in that case, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be CH2-OAc and CH3 (wait, no, wait). Wait, let's draw the structure.

Propenyl group: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the double bond is between C1 and C2. The groups attached to C1 are CH3 (since it's CH2=CHCH2... wait no, wait. Let me number the carbons. The propenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc? No, wait. No, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between the first and second carbons, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the two substituents on the double bond are a CH3 group (on the third carbon) and a CH2-OAc group. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-. So the ester would be CH2=CHCH2OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the substituents on the double bond are C1: CH2-OAc and C2: CH3? Because on C1, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 is connected to a CH2-OAc group and a CH group (double bond). Similarly, C2 has a CH group (double bond) and a CH2 group leading to the next carbon, which is CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the NMR data given.

The NMR data is:

7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz)
5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
2.1 ppm (3H, s)
1.6 ppm (3H, d)

So I need to analyze these signals.

First, the 2.1 ppm singlet for 3H. That's probably the methyl group of the acetate. Because in acetate esters, the methyl group is usually around 2.0-2.2 ppm and is a singlet because it's attached to an oxygen and has no neighboring H's. So that's likely the OAc group.

The 1.6 ppm triplet with 3H is a bit tricky. Maybe a methyl group adjacent to a CH2 group. Or perhaps a methyl group next to a double bond?

Wait, maybe it's a CH2 group next to a double bond. So perhaps something like CH2-CH2. But wait, 1.6 ppm is a d (doublet), so each of those H's has one neighboring H.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a d, so that's a doublet, integrating to 3H. Hmm, 3H as a doublet. So maybe a methyl group attached to a CH, which is then attached to another CH?

Wait, perhaps it's a CH2 group next to a double bond. For example, in a structure like CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond. Alternatively, in a structure where the methyl is attached to a CH which is part of a double bond.

Wait, let me think about the coupling in the NMR. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which is typical for a trans coupling in a double bond. So, if there's a double bond, the protons on each end would couple with each other. The coupling constant J is around 16 Hz, which is typical for trans coupling in an alkene.

So, we have a proton at 7.0 ppm as a doublet. Then, another proton at 5.5 ppm as a doublet of quadruplets (dq), which means it's split by two different coupling partners.

So, perhaps the structure has a double bond with two protons on one side and one on the other. Let me think.

Wait, maybe it's a vinyl group. For example, in a structure like CH2=CH-OAc, but that's ethyl acetate. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think about the structure.

Wait, let's consider each option's structure.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. So, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The double bond is between the first and second carbons. So the substituents on the double bond are CH2-OAc and CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps the substituents are CH2-OAc and CH2- (but that doesn't make sense because it's a double bond). Wait, perhaps I should draw it out.

Alternatively, for propenyl groups, maybe the structure is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond somewhere. Wait, perhaps the propenyl group is CH2=CH-OAc, but that would be acryloxy something. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the propenyl group is CH2CHCH2, with a double bond. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has a CH2-OAc group and a CH2 group attached to C2. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me number the carbons properly.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2=CH-OAc? But wait, that would make it an acrylate, like CH2=CHCOOAc. No, wait, that's not right. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should consider the structure more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the NMR signals and see how they fit.

So, the signals are:

- 7.0 ppm (1H, d): perhaps a proton on a double bond coupled to another proton with J=16 Hz.

- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq): another proton on the same or adjacent double bond, coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, let me think about an allylic system. For example, in an acetate ester with a double bond adjacent to the oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2OAc. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and then C3 is connected to the OAc group.

In that case, the protons on C1 and C2 would be on the double bond. Let me think about their NMR signals.

The C2 proton would be adjacent to the OAc group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, so it would deshield the proton, causing it to appear upfield. Wait, but wait, double bonds cause the protons to be deshielded and appear downfield. So, protons on a double bond typically appear between 4.5 and 7.5 ppm.

In the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests a proton on a double bond coupled to another proton. The J=16 Hz indicates that it's a trans coupling, as the coupling between protons on opposite sides of the double bond (trans) is larger than cis (which is around 10-12 Hz). So, a J of 16 Hz suggests a trans configuration.

So, the 7.0 ppm proton is on a double bond and is coupled to another proton on the same double bond, trans to it. So, the structure would have a trans configuration across the double bond.

Then, the 5.5 ppm signal is a dq, which means it's coupled to two different sets of protons. So, perhaps this proton is adjacent to two different types of protons. Or maybe it's coupled to two different groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2OAc, but the CH2OAc is at the end. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the C2 is connected to C3, which is connected to OAc.

In that case, the C1 has a CH2 group, but wait, no, C1 would be the end of the double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. So, the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OAc
|
CH2-CH2-CH2?

No, that's not right. Let me try again. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The C1 would have a CH2 group, but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me number the carbons:

1: CH2-
2: CH-
3: CH2-OAc

Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond between C1 and C2, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, the correct IUPAC name for propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is connected to the OAc group.

So, C1 (CH2), C2 (CH), C3 (CH2OAc). So, the double bond is between C1 and C2. The protons on C1 are CH2, and C2 is CH, but wait, the structure would actually be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the double bond is between C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH), so the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but CH2=CHCH2-OAc would be 3-propenoxypropanoic acid? No, wait, no, it's an ester. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, which is prop-1-en-3-yl acetate.

But wait, let me think about the NMR signals in this structure. The protons on the double bond would be at C1 and C2. So, the C1 is CH2, but that's not possible because the double bond is between C1 and C2, so C1 must be CH2, but then C2 would be CH. Wait, no, no, wait. The structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, C1 is CH2 with a double bond to C2, which is CH connected to C3, which is CH2-OAc.

Wait, so the protons on C1 (CH2) would be adjacent to the double bond. But in that case, the C1 protons would be allylic, not on the double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it CH2CH2=CH-OAc. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider the possible structures for each option.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Butenyl is four carbons with a double bond. So, butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc? Or butenyl as CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Wait, the position of the double bond matters.

Wait, butenyl can be 1-, 2-, or 3- depending on where the double bond is. But typically, butenyl refers to 1-butene or similar. Wait, but for the ester, the butenyl group is attached to the oxygen, so it's OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that's butyl. But butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's 1-butenyl.

Alternatively, the butenyl could be 2-butenyl: CH3CH=CHCH2-OAc. But that would have a different structure.

Wait, but perhaps it's more straightforward to think that the butenyl group is CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc, making it a trans or cis configuration.

Wait, but the question is about whether the configuration is cis or trans in the double bond. So, for butenyl acetate, the double bond is between C2 and C3, I think. So the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the substituents on either side of the double bond (C2 and C3) would determine the cis or trans.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structures. Let me get back to the NMR.

The 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. So, that's a trans coupling. That means that the two protons on the double bond are trans to each other. So, the structure must have a trans double bond.

Wait, wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on C1 and C2 are such that they are trans, the coupling would be large (J=16 Hz). So, that would suggest a trans configuration.

Now, the 5.5 ppm signal is a dq, which is a doublet of quadruplets. Hmm, or perhaps it's a doublet of doublets, but the notation is dq, which could mean doublet of quadruplets, but perhaps it's more likely a doublet of doublets (each split into two by two different J values).

So, the proton at 5.5 ppm is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with a different J value.

Wait, let me think. Suppose the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but that's propenyl acetate. In that case, the protons on the double bond would be on C1 and C2.

Wait, in propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is CH2-OAc. So, the protons on C1 (CH2) are adjacent to the double bond, and the protons on C2 (CH) are part of the double bond.

Wait, but then the protons on C1 would be allylic, not directly on the double bond. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the protons on C1 are CH2, but wait, no, wait. If the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then C1 is CH2, C2 is CH connected to C3 (CH2-OAc). So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C1 is CH2, which is not possible because a double bond can't be between C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH) because that would require the double bond to have two CH2 groups, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. No, wait, that's not correct. Let me think again. The correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2OAc. So, the ester oxygen is attached to the CH2 group. So, the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are CH2 and CH, respectively. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because that would require a CH2=CH group with a CH2 attached to the ester oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is attached to the oxygen. So, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In that case, the protons on C1 would be on the double bond, but wait, C1 is CH2, which isn't possible because a double bond requires each carbon to have at least one substituent. Oh, wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's more like CH2=CH-O-Ac, which would be CH2=CH-OAc. But that's ethenyl acetate, which is an ethylene group attached to the ester. So, the structure would be CH2=CH-OAc, which would make the double bond between C1 and C2, with C2 attached to the oxygen.

In that case, the protons on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH-OAc) would be on the double bond.

So, the protons on C1 would be CH2, but wait, CH2 can't be connected to a double bond because that would require each carbon in the double bond to have two substituents. So, perhaps the structure is actually CH2=CH-OAc, but that's not possible because that would be a vinyl group attached to oxygen, which is more like an acrylate ester.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the NMR signals again.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a proton that's trans to another proton on a double bond. Let's say that proton is on C2, and the other is on C1. So, the trans coupling would be between these two protons.

Then, the 5.5 ppm is a dq. That proton could be on C3, adjacent to the double bond. Or perhaps on the same double bond.

Wait, another possibility: the structure is CH2-CH2-OAc, but with a double bond. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-CH=CH-OAc. Wait, that would be allyl acetate. But that's not one of the options. So maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Z) or (E) 2-propenyl acetate, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl acetates, with cis or trans configurations.

Wait, propenyl has three carbons, butenyl has four. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (propenyl) or CH2CH=CHCH2OAc (butenyl).

But in that case, the NMR would differ based on the structure.

Let's think about the NMR for propenyl acetate (cis and trans).

Wait, wait, but propenyl has a double bond between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In this case, the protons on the double bond would be CH2 and CH. Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

So, C1: CH2, C2: CH, C3: CH2-OAc.

Wait, but then the double bond is between C1 and C2. So, the C1 is CH2, which can't be part of a double bond unless it's CH2=CH-. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

Now, in that structure, the protons on C2 would be on the double bond, and the protons on C1 would be adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, so if the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, the protons on C2 (the CH group) would be on the double bond, and the protons on C1 (CH2) would be adjacent but not on the double bond.

So, the protons on C2 would be part of the double bond and would have coupling with each other. Let's say the two protons on C2 are trans to each other. But wait, in a double bond, each carbon has one substituent. So, the C2 would have one H and be connected to C1 (CH2) and C3 (CH2OAc).

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 is connected to C3 (CH2OAc). So, the structure would look like:

O
||
O-C-OAc
|
CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Let me try to imagine the structure correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the ester group as OAc attached to a propenyl group. The propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So, the protons on C1 (CH2) are adjacent to the double bond, and the protons on C2 (CH) are on the double bond.

Wait, but a CH2 group can't have a double bond. Oh wait, no, the CH2 is the C1, which is connected via a double bond to C2 (CH). So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In this case, the protons on C2 (CH) would be on the double bond. So, there's only one proton on C2 because it's CH, not CH2. So, the C2 has one proton.

Wait, but then the NMR would show a singlet for that proton because there are no other protons on the same carbon. But in the data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests coupling with another proton. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH=CH-OAc, but that's propenyl group with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but propenyl is three carbons, so CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think of the possible NMR signals for each option.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. So, if the propenyl group is trans, that would mean the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite. But in propenyl, the substituents are CH2-OAc and CH3.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the NMR data:

The 7.0 ppm doublet (J=16) suggests a proton on a trans double bond, coupled with another proton.

The 5.5 ppm dq could be a proton adjacent to the double bond, perhaps a CH group next to a double bond and another group.

The 2.1 ppm s is the OAc methyl.

The 1.6 ppm d (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond or adjacent to it.

So, let's think of a structure where there's a double bond, and a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to the double bond.

For example, consider the structure CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. Wait, that would be isopropenyl acetate. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In that case, the protons on C2 (double bond) would be a single proton (since it's CH), but that doesn't make sense because each carbon in a double bond needs two substituents. Oh wait, wait, in CH2=CHCH2OAc, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, which is connected via double bond to C2 (CH), which is connected to C3 (CH2OAc). But then C1 would have a CH2 group, which can't support a double bond because it would have only one substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc. But that's not possible because the oxygen can't be directly attached to the double bond unless it's an acrylate.

Wait, another thought: the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) could be a methyl group attached to a CH which is adjacent to a double bond. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. But that's isopropenyl acetate, which might not be the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)-OAc, but that's a different substituent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, as propenyl acetate. In this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2OAc.

So, the protons on C2 (CH) would be on the double bond. Since it's a CH, there's only one proton on C2. This proton would couple with the adjacent protons on C1 (CH2) and perhaps with any other protons on the same double bond. Wait, but in a double bond, each carbon has two substituents. So, the structure must be such that each carbon in the double bond has two substituents.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, where C1 is CH2, C2 is CH, and C3 is CH2OAc. But in this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, which would require that C1 is CH2, which isn't possible because double bonds require each carbon to have at least one substituent other than the adjacent carbon. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2OAc with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CH-OAc. But that would be acryloxy acetate, which I'm not sure about.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the number of signals. The NMR shows four signals. The 7.0 ppm (1H, d), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d). So, total of 1+1+3+3=8 H's. But the formula would be C5H8O2. Wait, but the acetate is OAc, which is O(CO)OCH3. So, the molecular formula would be C5H8O2.

Wait, but let me check: propenyl acetate would be C3H5O2 (propenyl is C3H5, OAc is C2H3O2?), no, wait, OAc is O-CO-OCH3, which is C2H3O2. So, propenyl acetate would be C3H5O2 plus C2H3O2? Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, propenyl is C3H5, and acetate is C2H3O2. So, propenyl acetate would be C5H8O2. Yes, that's correct.

Now, the NMR shows 8 protons. Let's see:

7.0 (1H)
5.5 (1H)
2.1 (3H)
1.6 (3H)
Total: 8 H.

So, the structure must have 8 H's.

Now, let's think about the possible structures again.

If the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc (propenyl acetate), then the H's would be:

- C1 (CH2): 2 H's
- C2 (CH): 1 H (on double bond)
- C3 (CH2OAc): 2 H's
- OAc methyl: 3 H's

Wait, but that's 2+1+2+3=8 H's, which matches the NMR data. So, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc.

In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2.

So, the protons on C1 (CH2) are adjacent to the double bond, and the proton on C2 (CH) is on the double bond.

So, the C2 proton would be the one at 7.0 ppm, as it's on the double bond and coupled to the C1 protons.

But wait, the C1 is CH2, so each H on C1 would be adjacent to the double bond. So, the C1 protons would be allylic and appear around 5-6 ppm. The C2 proton would be on the double bond and appear around 5-7 ppm.

Looking at the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a trans coupling. So, the C2 proton is coupled to another proton with a trans configuration.

Wait, but in propenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2OAc), the C2 (CH) proton would be on the double bond. The C1 (CH2) would be adjacent. So, the C2 proton would be coupled to the C1 protons. But since C1 is CH2, each of its protons would be coupled to the C2 proton.

Wait, but the C2 proton is a single proton. So, the C2 proton would be a triplet, split by the two protons on C1. But in the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, not a triplet. Hmm, perhaps that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the doublet at 7.0 ppm is from the C2 proton, which is coupled to the C3 proton. But that doesn't make sense because C3 is CH2OAc, which is a CH2 group, so its protons wouldn't couple in the same way.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

In the structure CH2=CHCH2OAc, the C2 proton is on the double bond. It would couple with the two protons on C1 (CH2), leading to a triplet. But in the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests only one coupling partner. So, maybe this isn't the correct structure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH=CH-OAc. But that's allyl acetate, which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH=CH-OAc, which would be propenyl acetate with the double bond between C2 and C3. So, the structure would be CH2-CH=CH-OAc.

In that case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The C2 would have a CH2 group, and C3 would have a CH group attached to OAc.

Wait, but that structure would be CH2-CH=CH-OAc. So, the C2 is CH, C3 is CH-OAc.

In this case, the C2 and C3 protons are on the double bond, each with one proton. So, the C2 proton would be a doublet, as it's coupled with the C3 proton. The C3 proton would also be a doublet, coupled with C2.

But in the NMR data, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz, which would correspond to the trans coupling between C2 and C3.

Then, the 5.5 ppm dq would be another proton, perhaps from the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, in this structure, the C1 is CH2, which is adjacent to the double bond. So, the C1 protons would be allylic and appear around 5.5 ppm. Each of these protons would be coupled to the C2 proton on the double bond, leading to a triplet. But the NMR data shows a dq, not a triplet.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Another approach: let's consider the integration of the signals.

The 7.0 ppm is 1H, 5.5 is 1H, 2.1 is 3H, 1.6 is 3H.

So, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H. That suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH. Because a methyl group (CH3) attached to a CH would have a proton that's split into a doublet. But wait, CH3 would have three protons, so perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to another CH.

Wait, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a CH2 group attached to a CH which is part of a double bond. So, the structure would have a CH2-CH- group where the CH is part of a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a double bond. For example, in a structure like CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the options given are propenyl and butenyl acetates, either cis or trans. So, perhaps the structure is butenyl acetate, either cis or trans.

Let me consider the structure of butenyl acetate.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. So, the butenyl group is four carbons with a double bond. Let's say it's 2-butenyl. So, the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc.

In the cis configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond would be on the same side. So, the groups on C2 and C3 would be cis.

In this structure, the protons on C2 and C3 would be on the same side. Now, the NMR would show coupling between these protons.

The proton on C2 would be next to the double bond and would couple with the C3 proton. Similarly, the C3 proton would couple with C2 and perhaps others.

But I'm not sure how this would translate to the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc. In that case, the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the rest are CH2 groups. The protons on C2 would be adjacent to the double bond.

But I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should look for the correct answer by process of elimination.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

We have a signal at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz, which suggests a trans coupling, so the double bond must be trans. So the compound must be either trans-propenyl or trans-butenyl acetate.

So, options B and D are possible.

Now, the 5.5 ppm signal is a dq. Let's think about each.

Trans-propenyl acetate: the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc, but with a trans configuration. Wait, propenyl doesn't have a cis or trans configuration because it's a three-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, perhaps the configuration refers to the substituents around the double bond.

Wait, no, propenyl can't have a cis or trans configuration because it's a three-carbon chain with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So, the substituents on either side of the double bond are CH2-OAc on C2 and CH3 on C1. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, which is ethenyl acetate. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure for trans-propenyl acetate is CH2=CHCH2OAc, with the substituents on either side of the double bond being on opposite sides (trans). But I'm not sure how that would affect the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH=CH-OAc, which would have a double bond between C2 and C3, making it a trans configuration.

In that case, the protons on C2 and C3 would be trans, leading to a J of around 16 Hz.

The proton on C2 would be a doublet at 7.0 ppm, and the proton on C3 would be a doublet at a lower ppm, perhaps around 5.5, but that's just a guess.

Then, the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond would have protons that are split into a dq.

Wait, in this structure, the C1 is CH3, C2 is CH=, C3 is CH-OAc.

So, the protons on C2 (CH) would be on the double bond. The C3 proton would be adjacent to the double bond and perhaps coupled with the C2 proton and another group.

But I'm not entirely sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm signal is the proton from the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond, which is coupled with both the double bond protons and another group, leading to a dq.

In any case, since the J=16 Hz indicates a trans configuration, the compound must be either option B (Trans-propenyl acetate) or D (Trans-butenyl acetate).

Now, considering the integration:

In trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the structure would be CH2=CHCH2OAc with a trans configuration. So, the protons on C2 would be a doublet with J=16 Hz, appearing around 7.0 ppm. The C1 protons would be CH2 adjacent to the double bond, and their protons would be split into a triplet due to coupling with the C2 proton. But in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm is a dq, not a triplet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is butenyl acetate, where the double bond is between C2 and C3, allowing for more coupling possibilities.

In trans-butenyl acetate (option D), the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2OAc with a trans configuration across the double bond. So, the protons on C2 and C3 would be trans to each other, leading to a large J value (around 16 Hz).

In this structure, the C2 proton would be adjacent to the double bond and coupled with the C3 proton and perhaps the C1 protons. Similarly, the C3 proton would be coupled with C2 and C4 protons.

But I'm not entirely sure how this would translate into the NMR signals.

Alternatively, the 5.5 ppm could be a proton from a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond, which is coupled with two different sets of protons, leading to a dq.

Given that the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), it could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a double bond. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc. But that's not one of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to think of the coupling patterns.

The 7.0 ppm (d, J=16) is a proton coupled to another proton with a trans configuration. The 5.5 ppm (dq) is a proton coupled to two different sets of protons.

In the case of butenyl acetate, perhaps the structure is CH2CH=CHCH2OAc (trans configuration). Then, the protons on C2 and C3 would be trans, leading to a J of around 16 Hz. The C2 proton would be coupled to C3, and perhaps to the C1 protons. Similarly, the C3 proton would be coupled to C2 and C4 protons.

Wait, but the 5.5 ppm is a dq, which suggests two different coupling constants. So, maybe the proton at 5.5 is coupled to both C2 and C4 protons, each with a different J.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the C1 proton, which is coupled to the C2 proton (J=16 Hz) and another group, leading to a dq.

But I'm not entirely sure. 

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the J value and the structure options.

The trans configuration gives a larger J value, so the correct compound must have a trans double bond. So, the options are B (Trans-propenyl) and D (Trans-butenyl).

Now, looking at the NMR data, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which could be a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to a double bond. That's more likely in a butenyl structure, where there's a CH2-CH2 arrangement.

Alternatively, in a propenyl structure, the CH2 groups are smaller.

Wait, in CH2=CHCH2OAc (propenyl), the CH2 groups would have protons that are adjacent to the double bond. The C1 (CH2) protons would be adjacent to the double bond, so their chemical shift would be around 5-6 ppm. So, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is from the C1 protons.

In that case, the C1 (CH2) protons would be split by the C2 proton (on the double bond), leading to a triplet. But in the data, it's a dq, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is the C2 proton, which is coupled to the C1 and C3 protons, leading to a doublet of doublets.

Wait, if the C2 proton is coupled to C1 (J1) and C3 (J2), then it would appear as a doublet of doublets, which matches the 'dq' notation. So, this could fit.

So, the C2 proton would be at 7.0 ppm as a doublet (coupled to C1), and the C2 proton would also be at 5.5 ppm as a dq (coupled to C1 and C3). But that doesn't make sense because a single proton can't appear in two different places.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc, and the C1 protons are at 5.5 ppm as a triplet (coupled to C2). But the data shows a dq, so that's not matching.

Given all this, I'm starting to think that the correct answer is option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Because the presence of a 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is more likely in a butenyl structure. In a butenyl structure, such as CH2CH=CHCH2OAc, the C4 (CH2OAc) would have a CH2 group, and the C3 (CH) would have a proton that's coupled to C2 and C4, leading to a dq.

So, putting it all together:

- 7.0 ppm (d, J=16): C2 proton, trans coupled to C3.
- 5.5 ppm (dq): C3 proton, coupled to C2 and C4.
- 2.1 ppm (s): OAc methyl.
- 1.6 ppm (d): C4 CH2 group, perhaps split by coupling to C3.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet of 3H, which suggests a CH3 group. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH3)OAc, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2OAc, which is 1-pentenyl acetate, but that's not an option.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate: double bond with substituents on the same side.

B) Trans-propenyl acetate: double bond trans.

C) Cis-propenyl acetate: double bond cis.

D) Trans-butenyl acetate: double bond trans.

Since the J=16 Hz suggests a trans configuration, the correct answer must be either B or D.

Now, propenyl has three carbons, butenyl has four. The NMR data includes a 1.6 ppm doublet of 3H, which could correspond to a methyl group in the butenyl structure.

So, if the structure is butenyl acetate, then the 1.6 ppm would be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of the double bond.

But I'm not entirely sure. However, given the options, and the fact that the J=16 Hz suggests a trans configuration, and the 1.6 ppm suggests a methyl group adjacent to a double bond, I think the correct answer is option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Analysis:
1. **The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (-OAc), which is typically deshielded and appears as a singlet due to no neighboring protons.

2. **The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** suggests a methyl group attached to a CH group, likely adjacent to a double bond. This is more consistent with a butenyl structure than a propenyl structure.

3. **The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** indicates a proton on a double bond with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), characteristic of a trans configuration across the double bond.

4. **The 5.5 ppm doublet of quadruplets (1H, dq)** suggests a proton adjacent to the double bond, coupled to two different sets of protons, consistent with a trans configuration.

### Elimination of Options:
- **Cis-butenyl acetate (Option A):** A cis configuration would result in a smaller coupling constant (J ≈ 10–12 Hz), not the observed J = 16 Hz. This eliminates Option A.

- **Cis-propenyl acetate (Option C):** Similar to cis-butenyl acetate, a cis configuration would yield a smaller coupling constant, inconsistent with the J = 16 Hz observed in the NMR data. This eliminates Option C.

- **Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B):** While trans configurations exhibit large coupling constants (J ≈ 16 Hz), the structure of trans-propenyl acetate (CH2=CHCH2OAc) does not account for the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H), which suggests a methyl group adjacent to a double bond. This is more consistent with a butenyl structure. Thus, Option B is unlikely.

- **Trans-butenyl acetate (Option D):** The trans configuration explains the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). Additionally, the 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) aligns with a methyl group attached to a CH group in the butenyl structure. This matches the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-butenyl acetate**, as it explains the trans coupling (J = 16 Hz), the doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm, and the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.
