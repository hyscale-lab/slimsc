Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The reaction involves 3-methylpyrrolidine reacting with compound A in the presence of a catalyst B, under heat and some solvent. The product is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, the product structure is 1-(cyclohexylidenemethyl)-3-methylpyrrolidine. So, the original pyrrolidine has a methyl group at position 3. The product has a substituent at position 1 which is cyclohexylidenemethyl. Wait, cyclohexylidene suggests a cyclohexene ring attached via a double bond. So, that substituent is probably an exocyclic double bond.

Let me draw this out mentally. Pyrrolidine is a five-membered amine ring. At position 1, there's a CH group attached to a cyclohexene ring. So, the substitution is CH-cyclohexene. How did that happen?

The starting material is 3-methylpyrrolidine. So, when reacting with compound A under acid catalysis, what kind of reaction would form that substituent?

Wait, acid-catalyzed reactions involving amines often lead to things like imine formation, or maybe some kind of alkylation. Alternatively, maybe it's an enamine formation? Because enamine synthesis usually involves a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine.

Enamine synthesis typically has two steps: first, the amine reacts with a carbonyl to form a Schiff base, then that's reduced or loses water to form the enamine. Oh wait, but in acid catalysis, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, the product has a cyclohexene ring attached. So the substituent is CH2 connected to a cyclohexene? Or CH connected to a cyclohexene ring. Let me think again. The substituent is cyclohexylidenemethyl, which would be a methylene group attached to a cyclohexene. So, the structure is CH2-CH2-cyclohexene? No, wait, cyclohexylidene is a substituent where the cyclo
