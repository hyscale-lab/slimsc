Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice orally. Then, through in vivo imaging, they saw that some fluorescence was destroyed by stomach acid, and some got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated the proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, there was high variability. So, the question is asking which process is taking place.

Hmm, I remember that Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are specialized for sampling antigens from the intestinal lumen. They're where immune responses to enteric pathogens like rotavirus start, right?

The GFP-tagged proteins were given via oral gavage. The fact that some were destroyed by stomach acid makes sense because the stomach has a lot of acid which can break down proteins. But others must have survived and made their way to the Peyer patches. Intestinal mucus can trap things, but the ones that got through probably were taken up by antigen-presenting cells in the Peyer patches.

Once inside the Peyer patches, the immune cells process the antigen. The variable heavy chain gene sequencing showing high variability suggests that each cell's receptor is different. High variability in the variable regions is something I associate with B cells during an immune response. Because each B cell has a unique receptor due to VDJ recombination or somatic hypermutation.

Wait, but when is VDJ recombination happening? VDJ occurs during the generation of B and T cell receptors in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively. So that's during the development of the immune cells. But if they're already in the Peyer patches and proliferating, maybe the process happening now is not VDJ.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs after the initial B cell receptor is made. It's a process where the variable regions of the heavy and light chains are mutated, leading to higher affinity antibodies. This happens in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, like the Peyer patches. So if the cells isolated are proliferating and have variable heavy chains, that suggests somatic hypermutation is taking place.

Another option is class switching recombination, which changes the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG), but that doesn't directly cause high variability in the variable regions. It's more about the class and doesn't change the antigen specificity as much.

Complement activation is about the complement system, which helps in opsonizing pathogens or causing lysis. But that's more about the innate immune response and wouldn't explain the variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains.

So putting it all together, the process that leads to high variability in the variable heavy chain gene sequences among the proliferating cells is likely somatic hypermutation. This process happens in the germinal centers to diversify and improve the antibody response.


The experiment involves tagging the inner capsid proteins of rotavirus with GFP and administering them to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is lost due to stomach acid, while other tagged proteins reach the Peyer patches, where they are taken up by immune cells. These cells are isolated, and sequencing of their variable heavy chain genes reveals high variability. 

Peyer patches are specialized lymphoid tissues in the gut that sample antigens from the intestinal lumen and initiate immune responses. The high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences suggests a process that diversifies antibody specificity. VDJ recombination occurs during the development of B and T cells in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively, and is not relevant here since the cells are already mature and proliferating in the Peyer patches. Complement activation and class switching recombination do not directly explain the observed variability in the variable regions of the heavy chains. 

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, occurs in the germinal centers of lymphoid tissues, including Peyer patches, and is responsible for introducing mutations in the variable regions of B cell receptors, leading to increased diversity and affinity. This process aligns with the observed high variability in the variable heavy chain sequences among the proliferating cells.

Answer: A
