Okay, so I have this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. The question gives a density matrix and asks about its geometrical position in qubit space. The options are various coordinate points, so I'm guessing this has something to do with the Bloch sphere or maybe the vector representation of qubits.

The density matrix given is ρ = 1/2 (|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, I remember that for a single qubit, the density matrix can represent a mixed state. In this case, it's a mixture of |0> and |1>, each with equal probability, right? So this should be a completely mixed state, not a pure state.

Wait, pure states are like when the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|. But here, ρ is ½(|0><0| + |1><1|), which is a diagonal matrix with ½ on the diagonal. So ρ is a maximally mixed state because it has no coherence terms and equal probabilities for both basis states.

Now, the Bloch sphere represents pure states as points on the surface, with the vector from the origin to the point representing the state. But for a mixed state, like this one, the density matrix isn't a pure state. So where does it lie in the Bloch sphere representation?

I think the Bloch vector for a density matrix is given by a vector r such that ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So if I can write ρ in that form, I can find r.

Let me compute ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let me write out |0><0|: that's [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], but then dividing by 2 gives [[½, 0], [0, ½]]. So ρ is the 2x2 identity matrix multiplied by ½.

So ρ = (I)/2. Now, according to the Bloch vector formula: (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2 = ρ. So substituting, (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. That would imply that r·σ must be zero, because adding it to I and dividing by 2 gives I/2. So r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z = 0.

But the Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. If the sum of their products with r_x, r_y, r_z is zero, then each coefficient must be zero. Because the Pauli matrices are linearly independent. So r_x = 0, r_y = 0, r_z = 0. So the Bloch vector r is (0, 0, 0), which is the
