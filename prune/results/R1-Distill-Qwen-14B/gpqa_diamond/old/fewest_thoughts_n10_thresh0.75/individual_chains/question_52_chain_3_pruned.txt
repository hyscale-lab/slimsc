Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Alright, let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about stars with dark spots and their effect on the ratio of neutral Titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

So, the star has certain parameters: 1.5 solar radius, 1.1 solar masses. But I don't think those numbers are directly relevant to the problem. The key points are about the effective temperature and the spots.

When the surface isn't covered by spots, the Teff is 6000 K. But when 40% is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the Teff when spots are present is 5500 K. Wait, no, the question says when the surface is not covered by spots, Teff is 6000K. When 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So the star's overall brightness temp changes when spots are present.

Now, the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. So, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when the star has spots. What's the factor by which this ratio changes when no spots are present compared to when spots are present?

The transition corresponds to 1448 Å, which is in the ultraviolet, I think. Okay, but why does the ratio change when the star has spots?

Wait, in LTE (Local Thermal Equilibrium), the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation: N2/N1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). So, the ratio depends on the temperature and the statistical weights.

Wait, but in the problem, the ratio N1/N2 decreases when spots are present. That means N1 is lower relative to N2 when spots are there. So when spots are present, the ratio (N1/N2) is lower. So when spots are present, the ratio is lower than when not present.

Wait, but the question is asking for the factor by which the ratio changes. So if spots are present, the ratio is lower, so the factor is (N1/N2)_no_spots / (N1/N2)_has_spots.

Alternatively, wait, the ratio is N1/N2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So when the star is spotted, N1/N2 is lower than when it's unspotted.

So the factor by which the ratio changes is (N1/N2)_unspotted divided by (N1/N2)_spotted.

So, what's the formula for N1/N2?

From Boltzmann, N2/N1 = (g2/g1) exp( -(ΔE)/(k T) )

So N1/N2 = (g1/g2) exp( (ΔE)/(k T) )

So the ratio N1/N2 is proportional to exp( (ΔE)/(k T) ) multiplied by (g1/g2). Assuming g1 and g2 are constants (since we're comparing the same transition), the ratio depends on exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but T is the effective temperature of the star. But wait, wait. If the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower. But where are these spots? Are they cooler regions?

Yes, dark spots on a star are cooler than the surrounding photosphere. So when the spots are present, the average temperature of the photosphere is lower. But wait, the problem says that when 40% is covered, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 55
