Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here about reactions with mCPBA and what products form, then how they'd look on HPLC. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, the question says a chemist does two reactions. Both involve mCPBA, which I remember is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. It's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. So, mCPBA adds an epoxide group across the double bond.

Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 is with (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion.

Wait, what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid? Oh right, acid-catalyzed ring opening of epoxides. The mechanism is that the acid protonates the oxygen, making the adjacent carbons more electrophilic. Then water (or another nucleophile) attacks. Since it's acid, water is likely the nucleophile.

For epoxide ring opening, the stereochemistry depends on several factors. The type of epoxide and the conditions. If the epoxide is from a trans or cis diene, that might influence the product.

Wait, but in the case of acid-catalyzed epoxide ring opening, the ring opens with nucleophilic attack. The nucleophile can attack either the less substituted or more substituted carbon, depending on the conditions. Wait, actually, under acidic conditions, the nucleophile usually attacks the more substituted carbon because it's more stabilized when it forms the carbocation (or similar transition state). Because more substituted carbocations are more stable, right?

So for each reaction, the starting alkene is either E or Z. Let's think about each.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. Structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 but where double bond is between C4 and C5. Wait, no, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, more accurately, oct-4
