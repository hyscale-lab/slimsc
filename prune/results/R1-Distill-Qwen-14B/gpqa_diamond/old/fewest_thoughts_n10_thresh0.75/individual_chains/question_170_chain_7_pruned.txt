Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve some matrix operations, but let me think through this step by step.

The problem states that the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4), which I guess is a two-component spinor. So the state can be written as χ = [3i, 4]^T. I need to find the expectation value of S_y. 

Wait, S_y is the spin operator along the y-axis. Oh right, the spin operators are related to the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and each spin operator S is (ħ/2) times the corresponding Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

The σ_y matrix given is:
[0, -i;
i, 0]

So, the expectation value of S_y is given by the formula:
⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩

But since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, I can write this as:
⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) ⟨χ| σ_y |χ⟩

So I need to compute χ† σ_y χ, then multiply by ħ/2.

Wait, let me clarify. The expectation value is the conjugate transpose of χ multiplied by σ_y, then multiplied by χ. So let me compute that.

The state χ is [3i, 4]^T. So the conjugate transpose χ† would be [ -3, 4* ] because the first component was 3i; its conjugate is -3 (since (3i)* is -3i, but wait, no, wait: (3i)* is -3i? Wait no, (a + ib)* is a - ib. So 3i is 0 + i3, so conjugate is 0 - i3, which is -3i. Oh wait, no, the components are [3i, 4]. The conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no, 3i is 3 multiplied by i, so the conjugate is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no. Let me think again. The original vector is [3i, 4]. So when taking the conjugate transpose, each element's complex conjugate is taken. So 3i becomes -3i (since (i)* is -i, right?), and 4 is real, so stays 4. So χ† is a row vector: [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, let's compute χ† σ_y χ.

So the matrix multiplication steps:

First, compute σ_y multiplied by χ. Let's write that out.

σ_y is:
[0, -i]
[i, 0]

Multiplying σ_y (2x2) by χ (2x1) gives a 2x1 vector.

Let me compute each component:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) + 0 = 3i². Since i² is -1, this becomes 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y χ is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, multiply χ† (which is [ -3i, 4 ]) with this result.

So χ† (σ_y χ) = (-3i)*(-4i) + (4)*(-3).

Let me calculate each term.

First term: (-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

Adding both terms: -12 + (-12) = -24.

But wait, that's the value of χ† σ_y χ. So then ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-
