Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about rhombohedral crystals. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral structures have all sides equal and all angles the same. The question is asking about the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. 

Wait, interplanar distance... Oh right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I think the formula for interplanar distance d is given by d = a / (sqrt(l² + m² + n² + 2lm cos α + 2ln cos β + 2mn cos γ)), but wait, is that right? Or maybe I'm mixing it up with something else.

Wait, no, I think the formula is d = a / sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) )) ? No, wait, perhaps that's for something else. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Oh wait, I remember the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal. For a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles α, β, γ, the interplanar distance for a plane (hkl) is given by:

d = [ (a² + b² + c² - 2ab cos γ - 2ac cos β - 2bc cos α) ]^(-1/2) * sqrt( ... wait, no, that's probably not it. Maybe the general formula is more complicated because rhombohedral is a specific case.

Wait, rhombohedral is a special case where a = b = c, and all the angles are equal. So maybe the formula simplifies in this case. Let me try to recall. For a cubic system (where a=b=c and angles are 90 degrees), the interplanar distance d is a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). But here, the angles aren't 90 degrees, so that formula doesn't apply directly.

Right, so the general formula when the crystal is not cubic is:

d = (a² (h² + k² + l² + 2hk cos α + 2hl cos β + 2kl cos γ)) )^(-1/2)

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think again. The correct formula for interplanar distance d is:

d = a / sqrt( (h²
