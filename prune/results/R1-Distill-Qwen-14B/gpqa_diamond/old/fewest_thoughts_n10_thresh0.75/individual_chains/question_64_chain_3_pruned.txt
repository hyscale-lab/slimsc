Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break down the information given and see what I can deduce.

The problem says that we have an equimolar mixture of salts A and B, weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. Then, the gases formed are passed through some tubes. The results are that tube 1 (with Mg(ClO4)2) gains 3.60 g, tube 3 (with red-hot copper) gains 0.80 g, and tube 2 (Ca(OH)2 solution) doesn't change. Finally, 2.24 liters of gas C are left at standard temperature and pressure.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about what each of these tubes does. Tube 1 is Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant and can absorb water vapor. So when the gases pass through it, any water vapor would be trapped, increasing the tube's weight by the mass of water. So the 3.60 g increase is probably the mass of H2O formed.

Tube 2 is a Ca(OH)2 solution. If the gas is CO2, it would react with Ca(OH)2 to form CaCO3 and water. But since the weight of tube 2 didn't change, that suggests there's no CO2 in the gas mixture. So the gas isn't carbon dioxide, or maybe another component isn't reacting here.

Tube 3 has red-hot copper. I remember that CO (carbon monoxide) reacts with copper at high temperatures to form CO2. The reaction is 2CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So the increase in tube 3's weight is due to the production of CuO. The 0.80 g gain would be the mass of CuO formed.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says that CuO is formed. So the reaction is that CO is being oxidized to CO2. So the mass gain in tube 3 is the mass of CuO, which equals the mass of CO that passed through.

Now, let's calculate the moles involved. Let me start with tube 1: 3.60 g of H2O. The molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So moles of H2O = 3.60 / 18 = 0.2 mol.

In tube 3: 0.80 g of CuO. Molar mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (63.55 for Cu and 16 for O). So moles of CuO = 0.80 / 80 = 0.01 mol. But the reaction produces one mole of CuO per mole of CO. So moles of CO that passed through tube 3 is 0.01 mol. Wait, but actually, the reaction is 2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. So for each mole of CuO, two moles of CO are consumed. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The balanced equation is 2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2. Wait no, actually, the reaction is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

Wait, let's balance that. Let me see: On the left, 2 C, 4 O. On the right: 1 C, 3 O (from CuO and CO2). Hmm, wait, maybe I should write it correctly.

Wait, the actual reaction when CO is passed over hot Cu is:

2 CO + Cu → CuO + CO2.

Wait, does that balance? Let me check:

Left: 2 CO → 2 C and 2 O. Plus Cu → Cu
