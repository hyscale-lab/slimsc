Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, let me see if I can figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. We need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. And the speed of light in vacuum is given as c=1.

Wait, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam? Oh wait, no, the light is moving through the glass, which is moving toward the observer. Wait, so the light is going through the glass that's itself moving towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize this. Imagine the lab is a room. The glass is movingâ€”so it's a moving medium. The light is inside this moving glass. But the light is propagating through the glass, so in the glass's frame, the light's speed is c/n, since in a medium with index of refraction n, the speed is c/n. But here, the glass is moving relative to the lab frame.

So we need to find the speed of light in the lab frame. That sounds like a problem involving the addition of velocities, maybe using the relativistic velocity addition formula since we're dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light.

Wait, but wait. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement. Or wait, the light is propagating through the glass in the same direction as the glass is moving toward the observer. Hmm, maybe I should clarify.

Wait, the problem says the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. Wait, no, let me read that again. "The glass is moving at constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in laboratory." Oh, so the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's movement towards the observer. So the glass is moving toward the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction the glass is moving. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving toward me, and the light is moving in that direction too.

Wait, no. If the glass is moving toward the observer in the
