Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on spectral data. The options are four different compounds, each with some kind of substituents on a benzene ring.

First, let's look at the mass spectrometry data. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, which is 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at m/z 158, which is 32%. Hmm, I remember that sometimes in mass spec, you can get isotopic peaks. Chlorine has a significant isotopic abundance. For example, Cl has a mass of about 35 and 37, so if the molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion could show a 35Cl and 37Cl peak, which would be 75% and 25% typically. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156, and the other is 158. Oh wait, 158 is 2 higher than 156. So that suggests maybe a Cl is present. Because Cl has two main isotopes, 35 (75%) and 37 (25%), so if the molecular weight is 156 with Cl, then the isotopic pattern would be 156 (M), 158 (M+2). The abundance here is 32%, which is roughly a quarter, which fits with 37Cl (24.2% abundance). So the presence of a Cl atom is likely.

Next, looking at the IR data. There's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually indicates an -OH group, because O-H stretching in alcohols or carboxylic acids tends to be broad. But wait, another possibility is an amide or something else with N-H, but the options don't seem to have amines. The other peak is a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. 1720 is a bit on the higher side, so maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or an acid? Or maybe an ester or something else. Wait, in carboxylic acids, the carbonyl is usually around 1700, but can be a bit lower. For an ester, maybe higher. Wait, but if the compound is a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad and maybe even show a peak around 2500-3300 as a very broad O-H stretch. But the IR in the question says a broad peak in that region, which could fit a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but aldehydes have a sharp peak around 2820 and 2720 for the C-H stretch, but the broad peak here is from 3500-2700, which is a big range. Wait, maybe it's a hydroxyl group. So combining that with
