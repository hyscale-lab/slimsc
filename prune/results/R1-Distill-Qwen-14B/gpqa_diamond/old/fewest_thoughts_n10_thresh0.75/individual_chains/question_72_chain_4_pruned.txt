Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with a compound called 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's reacted with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature, forming product 1. Then, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to form product 2. Next, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150Â°C to form the final product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are there on product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm. Okay, I need to break this down. Let's start by understanding each reaction step.

First, the initial compound is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. I'm a bit rusty on my bicyclic compounds, but I remember that bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is a norbornane structure. It's a bridged bicyclic compound with two rings. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7.

The first reaction is with two equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide (NaI) is often used in elimination or substitution reactions. The presence of dibromomethyl groups suggests that perhaps a substitution might occur.

Wait, but considering the structure of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, that's a cyclohexadiene (1,3-diene) ring with two substituents at positions 5 and 6. Each substituent is a dibromomethyl group, meaning each has two bromine atoms attached to a methyl group. So, the structure would be like Br2C-CH2- attached at positions 5 and 6.

When this reacts with the starting compound in the presence of NaI and heat, it's probably undergoing some kind of coupling or substitution. Wait, but the NaI is a source of iodide ions. So perhaps an elimination or a nucleophilic substitution is happening.

Wait, another possibility is that the starting bicyclo compound is undergoing some Diels-Alder reaction. Because the starting compound is a diene (hepta-2,5-diene), which can act as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. The other compound has two dienophiles, perhaps?

Wait, the other molecule is cyclohexa-1,3-diene with two dibromomethyl groups. Hmm, but Di
