Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Then, it's reacted with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature to form product 1. After that, product 1 is treated with aqueous sulfuric acid to make product 2. Then, product 2 is treated with SO3 and pyridine in DMSO to form product 3. Finally, product 3 is heated at 150°C to give product 4. The question is asking how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in product 4. The options are A)8, B)4, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, that's a lot of steps. Let me try to break this down.

First, I'll think about each reaction step and what transformations are happening. I remember that when dealing with such problems, it's crucial to figure out the structures at each step.

Starting with the first reaction: 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (let's call this compound A) is reacting with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene (compound B) and NaI at elevated temp. NaI is a good nucleophile, and often in such conditions, elimination or substitution reactions can occur.

Wait, but compound B has two dibromomethyl groups on the cyclohexadiene. The structure of B is 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So, each of the two CH2Br2 groups is attached to carbons 5 and 6 of the cyclohexene ring.

When NaI is present, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps a substitution. Alternatively, the presence of a diene in compound A and another diene in B might suggest some kind of cycloaddition, like a Diels-Alder reaction. But wait, the reaction is with NaI, which is an ionic compound, so maybe it's more likely a substitution.

Wait, another thought—when you have a diene and another diene, sometimes they can undergo a [4+2] cycloaddition. But I'm not sure if that's the case here. Alternatively, the presence of dienes and dienophiles could be involved in some way.

Wait, let me think about the structure of compound A. 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptadiene is a norbornene structure. The substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, structure-wise, norbornene with an O-t-Bu group.

Now, when this reacts with B, which is a cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups, perhaps the reaction is a conjugate addition, or perhaps the diene is undergoing some kind of ring-opening or [2+4] addition.

Wait, another approach: the reaction is between a diene and another diene. But the presence of sodium iodide might be a hint. Iodide is a good nucleophile. Maybe the diene in A is acting as a dienophile, and the diene in B is acting as a diene? Or vice versa.

Wait, but in Diels-Alder reactions, the diene (conjugated double bonds) reacts with a dienophile (like a carbonyl). So, perhaps the norbornene is acting as a di
