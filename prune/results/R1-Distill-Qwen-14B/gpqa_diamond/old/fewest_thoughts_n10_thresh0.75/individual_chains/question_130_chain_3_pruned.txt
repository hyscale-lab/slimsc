Okay, so I've got this question about neutral hydrogen clouds and redshift. Hmm, I remember that redshift has to do with how the wavelength of light stretches as objects move away from us. The question mentions Lyman alpha wavelength, which I think is a specific emission line in hydrogen. Wait, Lyman alpha is around 1216 Angstroms. Oh right, that's in the ultraviolet range.

The clouds of neutral hydrogen absorb this light from background quasars. So, the quasars' light gets absorbed at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But when the cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe, this wavelength gets redshifted. So the observed wavelength would be longer than 1216 Angstroms.

The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift such that these objects can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because Earth's atmosphere blocks it. So the absorbed light must shift into the optical range for us to detect it.

Let me think about the formula for redshift. Redshift z is given by (observed wavelength)/(emitted wavelength) - 1. So z = λ_obs / λ_emit - 1.

We need the Lyman alpha absorption line to be in the optical range. Let's see, what's the threshold for optical telescopes? I think optical wavelengths are roughly from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). But wait, 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm, which is in the UV. We need to find the redshift where 1216 Angstroms is shifted into the optical, say, at least 400 nm, I suppose.

Wait, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. The optical range starts around 400 nm (which is 4000 Angstroms). So the observed wavelength λ_obs must be at least 4000 Angstroms for it to be in the optical.

So setting λ_obs = 4000 Angstroms, the emitted is 1216. So z = 4000/1216 - 1.

Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216. Let's see, 1216 * 3 is 3648, which is less than 4000. 1216*3.3 is 4012.8 (because 1216 * 3 = 3648, 1216 *0.3= 364.8; sum to 3648+364.8=4012.8). So 3.3 would give 4012.8, which is a bit over 4000. So z is approximately 3.3 -1 = 2.3.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the lower limit. So the minimum z where the Lyman alpha line enters the optical. So when z is such that λ_obs = 4000 Angstroms. So
