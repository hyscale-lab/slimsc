Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember that in hydrogen atoms, the energy levels are quantized. The transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two energy levels, right? And they gave the wavelength λ as 0.4861 μm. Oh wait, that's the wavelength of the emitted photon when an electron transitions between levels. I think that corresponds to the Balmer series, maybe the H-alpha line.

So, the problem is about whether the paramagnetic coupling term, which is probably the Zeeman effect, is much bigger, smaller, or about the same as the transition energy.

Wait, what's the paramagnetic coupling term? Oh right, the Zeeman effect is when an atom is placed in a magnetic field, causing the energy levels to split. The paramagnetic term here is the interaction energy between the magnetic moment of the electron and the external magnetic field.

The setup is for a magnetic field B parallel to the Oz axis. Small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. B is 1 Tesla. So, I need to calculate or estimate the magnitude of the Zeeman term and compare it with ΔE.

First, I should find the transition energy ΔE using the given wavelength. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ. Let me jot that down.

h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3 x 10^8 m/s. λ is 0.4861 μm, which is 0.4861 x 10^-6 meters.

So plugging in the numbers: E = (6.626e-34 J·s)(3e8 m/s) / (0.4861e-6 m) 

Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 0.4861e-6 m gives (1.9878e-25) / (0.4861e-6) = approximately 4.088e-19 J.

Wait, but in terms of electron volts, I think hydrogen transition energies are usually expressed. Let me check the conversion: 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.088e-19 J is roughly 4.088 / 1.602 ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the Balmer series has lower energy transitions. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.

Wait, 0.4861 μm is the wavelength for the Balmer-alpha line, which is about 1.9 eV? Or wait, let me think again. The Rydberg constant is about 13.6 eV for the ground state, but transitions from higher levels would have lower energy. Wait, maybe I should calculate it more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Rydberg formula for hydrogen. The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R (1/n1² - 1/n2²). For Balmer series, n1 is 2, and n2 is higher. Let's say it's the transition from n=3 to n=2, which is the Balmer-alpha line.

Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m^-1. So 1/λ = 1.097e4 (1/4 - 1/9) = 1.097e4 (5/36) = 1.097e4 * (0.1389) ≈ 1.53e3 m^-1.

So λ ≈ 1 / 1.53e3 ≈ 6.53e-4 m? Wait, no, that can't be right because the given λ is 0.4861e-6 m, which is 486 nm, corresponding to about 2.55 eV as I calculated before. Wait, but when I use the Rydberg formula, how does that fit?

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with E=hc/λ. Let me compute that again correctly.

Calculating E: h*c = 6.626e-34 Js * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m. λ is 0.4861e-6 m. So E = 1.9878e-25 / 0.4861e-6 = 4
