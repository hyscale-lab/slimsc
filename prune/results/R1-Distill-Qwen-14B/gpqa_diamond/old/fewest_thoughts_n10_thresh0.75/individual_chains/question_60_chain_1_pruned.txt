Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics classes that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's due to Einstein's theory of relativity, right? So, the astronaut's own time, which is the proper time, will be less than the time observed from Earth because of the high speed.

The problem states that the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super close to c. The astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long the trip will take from their perspective. The options are various years, and option A says the astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

Wait, but the question is about the astronaut's experienced time, right? So I don't need to worry about the Earth's perspective, just the astronaut's own time, which is the proper time. Proper time is the shortest time measured by someone moving relative to the event, so it's the astronaut's own clock.

So first, I need to calculate the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Oh wait, I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. Let me confirm that. Yeah, I remember that the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

So the distance is 163,000 light-years. The speed is 0.99999987c. So the time taken from Earth's frame of reference would be distance divided by speed. Let me calculate that.

Time in Earth's frame: t = distance/speed = 163,000 light-years / 0.99999987c. Since one light-year is the distance light travels in a year, and speed is in terms of c, the units should work out. So t ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 / ~1 (since 0.99999987 is almost 1) ≈ 163,000 years. But wait, no, that can't be right because the speed is almost c, so the time should be about the same as the distance in light-years divided by the speed fraction. Wait no,
