Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a chemist found an unnamed bottle with a white solid. He used some spectral data to try to identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to figure out which one matches the spectral data given.

First, let's look at the data provided:

Mass Spec:
- Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)
- A peak at m/z = 158 (32%)

IR:
- Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1
- Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1

1H NMR:
- 11.0 ppm (singlet, 1H)
- 8.02 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 7.72 ppm (doublet, 2H)

Hmm, okay. Let me break this down.

Starting with the mass spec. The molecular ion is at 156. So the molecular formula must have a molecular weight of 156 g/mol. The other peak at 158 is at 32%, which is close to the molecular ion. That suggests a possible isotope peak, but why is it 158? Let's think about the molecular formula. If the molecular weight is 156, adding 2 would get to 158. Maybe that's a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has two main isotopes: about 75% Cl-35 and 25% Cl-37. So if the molecule has a Cl atom, the molecular ion would have a 35Cl peak at 156 and a 37Cl peak at 158. But wait, the molecular ion at 156 is the most abundant, which is 100%, and the 158 is 32%. Hmm, that doesn't quite fit because usually the Cl isotope pattern would have a 75:25 ratio. So maybe the molecular formula has a chlorine and another element with a different isotope? Or perhaps it's not a chlorine isotope. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula includes something else. Wait, maybe the molecular weight is 156, but the other peak is due to something else. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular ion is at 156, but the molecular formula could have a substituent that causes a fragment at 158. Hmm, not sure yet. Let's move on to the IR.

IR shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. That usually indicates an -OH group, since O-H stretches are broad. The strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1 could be a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. Or maybe an ester or acid chloride. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the NMR:

11.0 ppm singlet: that's a strong indicator. High chemical shift, around 11 ppm, which is typical for an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. But aldehydes are also around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic -OH, but that's more like 5 ppm or so. Another possibility is an acidic proton, like an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Looking at the other NMR peaks: 8.02 ppm doublet (2H) and 7.72 ppm doublet (2H). That looks like two doublets with similar integration, which suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the substituent would be a doublet, and the two pairs would be sym
