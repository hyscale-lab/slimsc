Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about identifying Compound X, which has the formula C11H12O. It's reacted with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in a nonpolar solvent at 403 K for a day. Then, the product's NMR spectra are given, and I need to figure out what Compound X was from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Wait, isn't it a common base used in the formation of enolates? Oh right, it's called DBU (1,8-diazabicycloundec-7-ene), but wait, no, the structure here is [2.2.2], so that must be another base. Maybe it's used for similar purposes, like in elimination or epoxide ring-opening reactions.

Wait, wait. Oh, right! When an epoxide ring is opened under certain conditions, it can form a carbonyl compound. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here. Let me think.

Compound X is the starting material. After reaction with DBU-like base, it forms a product whose NMR is given. So, perhaps Compound X is an epoxide, and upon reaction, it undergoes some kind of ring-opening or rearrangement.

Looking at the product's NMR data. Let's analyze the 1H NMR first.

The 1H NMR shows:
- Î´ 2.28 (3H, s) and 2.31 (3H, s). These are two singlet peaks for 3H each. They could be methyl groups attached to something deshielded, maybe carbonyls or electronegative atoms. Wait, but in the 13C, the carbons attached to these would be around 20-30 ppm. The 13C NMR shows a peak at 21.3 and 28.4, each for a single carbon. These are probably two methyl groups, maybe attached to a carbonyl or oxygen.

Wait, but methyl groups adjacent to carbonyls are usually around 20-30 ppm. So, in the 13C NMR, the 21.3 (s) and 28.4 (s) are likely two methyl groups attached to carbonyl carbons or perhaps to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Looking at the 1H NMR, the two singlets are close together, but not the same. So maybe two different methyl groups, each attached to different parts of the molecule. Maybe one is a ketone and the other is an ester, but I'm not sure yet.

The next part of the 1H NMR is more aromatic. Let's see:

6.75 (1H, d), 7.08 (2H, d), 7.68 (1H, d), 7.71 (2H, d).

Hmm, that's
