Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transitions between energy states. Hmm, I remember from my notes that when an electron transitions between energy levels, it emits or absorbs a photon, and the selection rules determine which transitions are allowed.

The question is about the |3,0,0⟩ state decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. Wait, dipole transitions... Oh right, dipole transitions are electric dipole transitions, which have specific selection rules. 

The selection rules for electric dipole transitions in hydrogen are: 
- Δl = ±1 (the change in angular momentum is ±1)
- Δm = 0, ±1 (the magnetic quantum number changes by 0 or ±1)
- And for the principal quantum number n, it must satisfy Δn ≥ 1, but since the atom is non-relativistic, the transition is from a higher to a lower energy state, so Δn is negative here.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The final state is |1,0,0⟩. So n starts at 3 and goes down to 1, which means it's a two-step transition because 3→1 would require a change of 2 in n, which can't happen in a single dipole transition. Hence, it must go through an intermediate state.

What's the first step? From n=3, l must change by ±1. So l starts at 0, so possible l after transition is 1. So first transition could be 3,0,0 → 2,1, m where m can be 0, ±1.

Wait, no, because n can decrease by any amount as long as it's not zero. Wait, no, no. Wait, the selection rules for n in dipole transitions are that Δn can be ±1, but wait, I think that might not be correct. I'm a bit confused. 

Wait, no—wait, I might be mixing things up. The selection rules for hydrogen are: Δn is not restricted, meaning n can go from any higher to lower, but l must change by ±1. So for example, a transition from n=3, l=0 can go to n=2, l=1, because l changes by +1. Or could it go to n=1, l=1? No, because n must decrease. Wait, no, if n=3→1, but that's a change of 2, which is allowed if l changes by ±1 each time.

Wait, no, the transition in the question is via two dipole transitions, so it's a two-step process. So from |3,0,0⟩, first transition to some intermediate state, then to |1,0,0⟩.

So the first step must go from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 (since l can only change by ±1). So the initial state is n=3, l=0, m=0. After first transition, l becomes 1. So the possible m values would be m=0 ±1, so possible m for intermediate state are -1, 0, +1. So the intermediate state is |2,1,m⟩, where m is -1, 0, or +1.

Then the second transition must go from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the selection rules for that step. For the second transition, l changes from 1 to 0 (so Δl = -1, which is allowed since it's ±1). Also, m must change by 0 or ±1. So from m in the intermediate state, let's see:

The final m is 0. So the second transition must have m change from, say, m1 to 0. So m1 can be 0, ±1. Because if m1 is 1, then Δm would be -1 (from 1→0). If m1 is 0, Δm is 0. If m1 is -1, Δm is +1. All allowed.

So possible intermediate states are |2,1, -1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, |2,1,1⟩.

Now, the question is which of these transitions are allowed and what the probabilities are.

Wait, but the options given have specific transition routes. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0,0. Probability 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option D: It seems like the first part is cut off, but I think it's supposed to be 3,0,0 →2,1,0 →1,0
