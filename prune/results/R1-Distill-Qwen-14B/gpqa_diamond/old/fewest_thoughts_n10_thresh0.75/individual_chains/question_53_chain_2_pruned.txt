Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read through the question carefully.

The problem says that there's a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound. Hmm, di-substituted means two substituents attached to the benzene ring. The FTIR shows an ester group, so that's a clue—ester groups have specific IR absorptions, especially around the carbonyl region. I remember esters have a strong absorption around 1740 cm⁻¹, so that's probably what's happening here.

Now looking at the 1H NMR spectrum. It has six signals. Let me break them down. Two signals for aromatic Hs. Wait, the aromatic ring is di-substituted, so the symmetry might play a role. If it's para-substituted, the aromatic protons would be equivalent, giving a singlet. But if it's ortho or meta, they'd be different. But wait, the NMR shows two signals. So maybe there are two sets of aromatic protons. Oh, maybe the substituents are in a position that causes two different types of aromatic Hs.

Then, two signals for vinyl-Hs. One is a doublet and the other a doublet of quartets. Vinyl protons are typically on double bonds. So perhaps there's an ester group attached, like maybe an acrylate or something similar. Wait, esters can have substituents with double bonds.

The other two signals are for -CH3 groups. And there are no -CH2 signals. So the structure must have two methyl groups, but no methylene groups. So maybe each substituent has a methyl. Like, an ester group where the R group is a methyl, and another substituent with a methyl group.

Wait, let's think about the substituents. Since the aromatic ring is di-substituted, the substituents could be an ester group and another group. Or perhaps each substituent is an ester? No, wait, the ester is a group like O-CO-O, but actually, more accurately, an ester is R-O-CO-R'. So the molecule likely has an ester substituent and another substituent which might have a double bond.

Putting this together: the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is an ester group, which would be something like -O-CO-R, and the other substituent might be a vinyl group, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are both ester groups, but that seems less likely given the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR has two signals for vinyl-H. Vinyl implies a double bond adjacent to the substituent. So maybe there's an ester group with a vinyl group attached. Like maybe the substituent is an ester with a double bond, such as an acrylate group. For example, -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that wouldn't have a vinyl proton. Oh wait, acrylate would be something like -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, maybe I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester, and the other is a vinyl group attached to something else. Or, perhaps the substituents are both ester groups but in such a way that each has a vinyl proton.

Wait, the NMR shows two vinyl protons: one as a doublet and the other as a doublet of quartets. So maybe each is part of a coupling system. Let me think about a structure where there are two sets of vinyl protons. Maybe a di-substituted ring with two vinyl groups or one vinyl group with some coupling.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is an ester and another is a group with two vinyl protons. Wait, but the NMR shows two signals for vinyl-H, each with different multiplicity. So perhaps the substituent has a structure where two different sets of vinyl protons are present.

Another thought: Maybe the substituent is a methacrylate group. Let me think: methacrylate is -O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, methacrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So attached as an ester, that would be O-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, no. Let's correct: the structure of methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCOOCH3. So the substituent would be O
