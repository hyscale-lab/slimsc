Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving through the galaxy. Hmm, the question is about figuring out how far the ejecta travels in the galaxy's frame of reference when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially when one is moving relative to the other, time dilation and length contraction come into play. But wait, the problem says both the ejecta and the galaxy are inertial frames. Oh right, inertial frames don't accelerate, so special relativity applies here.

Wait, the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So in the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, 60,000 km/s? Because velocities reverse when you switch frames, right?

But wait, no, not exactly. Because in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. You have to use the velocity addition formula. Oh, but wait, the problem says both are inertial frames, so perhaps we can assume that the speed is the same in magnitude but opposite in direction. Because then, from the galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center, and vice versa.

Wait, but the question is about the distance traveled in the galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So I think we
