Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory. 

Let me first understand the problem. The key points are the brightness limits of each spectrograph. The ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 mag in V, while HIRES can observe up to 16 mag. So, any star that is brighter than 17 mag can't be detected by ESPRESSO, but if a star is brighter than 16 mag, HIRES can see it. Wait, no, actually, because the magnitude scale is a bit counterintuitive. Lower magnitudes are brighter. So, if a star has an apparent magnitude V (m_v) less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can detect it. Similarly, HIRES can detect stars with m_v <=16. So, the star needs to be bright enough for both, which means it has to be as bright as the higher limit. Wait no, because if a star is brighter than 16 mag, then it's also brighter than 17, so both can see it. But if it's between 16 and 17, then only ESPRESSO can see it.

Wait, no, the way the question is phrased: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" for ESPRESSO, which means m_v <17. Similarly, for HIRES, m_v <16. So, a star that's brighter than 16 mag (so m_v <16) can be seen by both. If a star is between 16 and 17 (inclusive?), it can be seen by ESPRESSO but not HIRES. So, the star has to have an apparent V magnitude less than 16 to be detected by both.

So, the correct stars must have apparent V magnitude less than 16.

Now I need to compute the apparent magnitude for each star.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Starting with Star1:
Star1 has an absolute V magnitude (M_v) of
