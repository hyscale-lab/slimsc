Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again and try to break it down.

The problem says a chemist does two reactions with (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is used in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with an oxidizing agent to form an epoxide. So, each of these alkenes is going to form an epoxide.

Wait, but wait. The starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. For each, when mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The configuration of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on either end of the double bond are opposite each other, and for (Z), theyâ€™re the same side.

So, when (E)-oct-4-ene reacts, the epoxidation would form an trans-dihydroxy epoxide. No, wait, no. Wait, actually, mCPBA forms an epoxide via an electrophilic addition. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes forms an epoxide where the oxygen comes from the peracid. The endo transition state is involved. 

Wait, in the epoxidation, the two new oxygen atoms are added across the double bond in a specific way. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the stereochemistry of the epoxide. For an (E) double bond, the substituents are opposite, so when the epoxide forms, the two new oxygen atoms will be on opposite sides? Or same?

Wait, let me think. The double bond is planar. For (E) configuration, groups on each end are opposite. When mCPBA adds, it adds an oxygen from the same face (since it's a peracid and adds with syn addition). So, for (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents on either side are
