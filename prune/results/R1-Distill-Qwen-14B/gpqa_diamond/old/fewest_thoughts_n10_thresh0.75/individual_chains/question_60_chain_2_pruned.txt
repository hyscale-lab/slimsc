Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Let's try to break it down step by step.

So the setup is that there's an alien civilization in the Large Magellanic Cloud who's building a super-fast spaceship. Their spacecraft can go at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's really, really close to the speed of light! The aliens live about 150 years on average, but the astronaut is 22 years old. They want to come to Earth, and we need to figure out how long the trip will take from the astronaut's perspective.

Hmm, I remember that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. Time dilation is a concept from Einstein's theory of relativity. From the perspective of someone on the spaceship, less time would pass compared to someone watching from Earth. Wait, no, wait. Actually, it's the other way around. No, wait, no. Let me think again.

Oh right, the spaceship's crew experiences less time due to time dilation because of their high speed relative to Earth. So from Earth's frame, the trip takes a certain amount of time, but from the astronaut's perspective, it's less.

Wait, but the question is asking for the time from the astronaut's point of view. So we have to calculate the proper time experienced by the astronaut.

But wait, the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is a factor here. How far is that? Oh, right, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away from Earth. Wait, no, wait—that's actually the distance to the Andromeda galaxy. Let me think. Oh, the Large Magellanic Cloud is much closer. I think it's about 160,000 light-years, but wait, no, no, I'm confusing it with other galaxies. Wait, actually, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. Or is it less? Hmm. Maybe I should look that up, but since I can't right now, I'll proceed with that assumption.

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let's think about the problem again. The question is about the astronaut's experienced time, so we need to calculate the proper time, which is the shortest time according to the spaceship's frame.

The formula for time dilation in special relativity is T = gamma * t', where T is the time measured in the Earth frame, and t' is the proper time (the astronaut's time). Wait, no, wait. Actually, the proper time is the shortest time between two events (leaving and arriving) in the spaceship's frame. So from Earth's perspective, the trip would take longer due to the spaceship's speed.

Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let's think in terms of the spaceship's frame. In their frame, the Earth is moving towards them at a high speed, so the distance is contracted. So the distance they have to cover is less.

Ah, right. The distance is contracted in the direction of motion. So from the spaceship's perspective, the distance is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame distance), and v is the spaceship's speed.

Wait, but we don't know the distance.
