Okay, let's try to figure this out. So we have three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They're using the TTV method, which I remember stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here, maybe it's just context.

The question is about the orbital periods of these planets. We're told the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures, and the ratios of their masses. And all have the same albedo, 0.3, like Earth. We need to find by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1.

Hmm. I think equilibrium temperature relates to the distance from the star and the star's luminosity. The formula for equilibrium temperature is:

T = [ ( L * (1 - a) ) / (16 * π * σ * D²) ]^(1/4)

Wait, but wait, another version I remember is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 ), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is radius, and D is the distance (semi-major axis). But I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Alternatively, the simplified version when the star's parameters are the same for all planets, the equilibrium temperature T is proportional to (L/(D²))^(1/4), but considering albedo a.

Wait, but in this problem, the albedo is the same for all three. So the ratio of T between the planets depends only on the square root of their distances (since T ∝ sqrt(L/(D²)), but wait no, let me think.

Wait, equilibrium temperature T_eq is given by T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) / (1 + e) )^(1/4 ), assuming a circular orbit (e=0), so it's (1 - a)^(1/4). Since albedo a is the same, (1 - a) is same for all. So T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), because sqrt(R/(2D)) is multiplied by T_star, but I think in the problem, we can assume the star is the same for all three planets, so R_star and T_star are same. So T_eq ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

So, given that, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4. So T1/T2 = 1.4, which implies D1/D2 = (T2/T1)^2 = (1/1.4)^2 ≈ (0.714)^2 ≈ 0.51. So D1 is about 0.51 times D2, meaning Planet1 is closer to the star than Planet2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then T1 = k / sqrt(D1), T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(D2/D1). So T_ratio = sqrt(D2/D1). So D2 = (T_ratio)^2 * D1.

Given that T1 to T2 ratio is 1.4, so T1 = 1.4 T2. Then T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) → 1.4 = sqrt(D2/D1). Squaring both sides, 1.96 = D2/D1 → D2 = 1.96 D1. So Planet2 is further away than Planet1. So D2 is about twice D1.

Similarly, between Planet2 and Planet3, the temperature ratio is 2.3. So T2/T3 = 2.3 → T2 = 2.3 T3.

Using the same formula: T2/T3 = sqrt(D3/D2). So 2.3 = sqrt(D3/D2). Squaring: 5.29 = D3/D2 → D3 = 5.29 D2.

So putting it together. D2 =1.96 D1, D3=5.29 D2=5.29 * 1.96 D1.

Let me compute that: 5.29 * 1.96. Well, 5 * 2 is 10, so 5.29 * 1.96 is around 10.3684. So D3 ≈10.368 D1.

Wait, just to be exact: 5.29 * 1.96. Let's compute:

5.29 * 1
