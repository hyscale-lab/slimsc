Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to the concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about isomers and tautomerism and optical isomerism. Hmm, I remember that isomers are compounds with the same molecular formula but different structures. They can be constitutional or stereoisomers. Constitutional isomers have different connectivity of atoms, while stereoisomers have the same connectivity but differ in spatial arrangement, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which doesn't show tautomerism.

Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair, leading to different structural isomers. For example, in ketones and aldehydes, tautomerism isn't common because the carbonyl group is already in a stable form. But wait, wait, waitâ€”I think tautomerism is more about keto-enol tautomerism, which usually involves compounds with adjacent carbonyl groups.

Wait, wait, benzoquinone is an aromatic compound. I think there are different types of quinones. Benzoquinone, for instance, has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Or wait, benzoquinone is a benzene ring with two ketone groups attached. So, maybe it's 1,2-benzoquinone or 1,4-benzoquinone. But regardless, what about tautomerism?

Tautomerism typically requires the possibility of conjugation. For example, in a diketone, like in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which has three ketone groups in a six-membered ring. Wait, no, 1,3,5-trione would have ketone groups at positions 1,3,5, so three of them in the ring? Or maybe that's a typo and it's a cyclohexanone with three ketone groups in a row?

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione would have three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5, which are opposite each other in a chair conformation. Hmm. So each ketone is on a carbon connected by
