Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about isomers, specifically constitutional and stereoisomers. The question has two parts: part A and part B. I need to determine which compound doesn't show tautomerism (A) and which compound shows optical isomerism (B). Then, looking at the options, I have to pick the correct combination.

Let me break it down. First, the compounds involved are benzoquinone, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, and dimethyl fumarate.

Part A: Which of the given compounds does not show tautomerism?

Tautomerism is when a molecule can shift between different structures, usually involving the movement of a hydrogen atom and a shift in double bonds. For example, in compounds with adjacent double bonds and hydroxyl groups or enols and ketones, tautomerism can occur. So, I need to check each compound for the possibility of tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I think benzoquinone has two ketone groups. Wait, benzoquinone is a cyclic compound with two ketone groups. Structure-wise, it's a benzene ring with two oxygen atoms in the 1 and 4 positions, each in a carbonyl group. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Does this allow for tautomerism? Well, tautomerism often involves the shifting of a hydrogen from an oxygen to an adjacent carbon, but in benzoquinone, each carbonyl group is adjacent to a ring. Are there any alpha hydrogens available for tautomerism? Let me think. The carbonyl groups are attached to the benzene ring, which doesn't have hydrogens on the same carbon as the carbonyl. So, the structure is O=C6H4=O. Wait, the carbons attached to O are all part of the ring. So, are there any alpha hydrogens? Alpha to the carbonyl would be the adjacent carbons, but those are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogen on the same carbon as the carbonyl. So, maybe benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens, which are necessary for tautomerism. So, if there's no alpha hydrogen, tautomerism isn't possible. Therefore, benzoquinone might not show tautomerism.

Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione: The structure is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at positions 1,3,5. So, it's like O=C-C-O-C-C-O around the ring. Now, each of these ketones would be at every other carbon. Each ketone would have adjacent (alpha) carbons. Wait, but in a six-membered ring with three ketones, each ketone is separated by one carbon. So, the carbonyl groups are on 1,3,5. So, the carbons next to them (positions 2,4,6) would each have two substituents (
