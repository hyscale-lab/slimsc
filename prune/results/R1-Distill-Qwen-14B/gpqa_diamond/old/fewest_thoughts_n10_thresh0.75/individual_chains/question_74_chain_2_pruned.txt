Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The question says that the probability of decay is 32% within 100 minutes. But wait, so far 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed yet. Now, they're asking for the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. 

Wait, let me think. Radioactive decay follows an exponential decay model, I think. The key formula is N(t) = N0 * e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant. But wait, maybe I should think in terms of probabilities here.

So, if the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, that means the probability of not decaying in 100 minutes is 68% (since 100% - 32% = 68%). 

The probability of not decaying is e^(-λt). So for t=100 minutes, e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Hmm, maybe I can find λ from this. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: ln(0.68) = -λ*100. So λ = -ln(0.68)/100.

But wait, I don't think I need to calculate λ numerically. Maybe I can use the property of exponential decay for the remaining time. Because the decay process is memoryless, right? So the fact that
