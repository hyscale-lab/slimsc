Okay, so I have this question here about a supermassive black hole and its entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my black hole thermodynamics, but I'll try to think this through. Let me break it down.

The question says that the angular size of the event horizon is θ=10^-17 degrees, and the distance is d=10^10 parsecs. I'm supposed to find the order of magnitude of the entropy. The options are all powers of ten, so I think I need to calculate the entropy and figure out which exponent it's closest to.

First, I remember that the entropy of a black hole is given by the Bekenstein-Hawking formula: S = (A c^3)/(4 ħ G k_B), where A is the area of the event horizon. So I need to find A first.

The area of the event horizon of a black hole is A = 4π r_s² /4, wait no, wait. The Schwarzschild radius is r_s = 2 G M / c². So the area would be A = 4π (r_s)^2. So A = 4π (2 G M / c²)^2. Simplify that, A= 16 π G² M² / c^4. But maybe I can approach this without getting into M directly.

Wait, I have the angular size θ. The formula for angular size is θ ≈ d / D, where D is the diameter of the object. Wait, wait, the formula is θ (in radians) ≈ (size of object) / (distance). But when the object is much smaller than the distance, θ is small, which is the case here. So θ (in radians) = d / D, where D is the diameter of the event horizon.

Wait no, the formula for angular size is θ ≈ (diameter of object) / (distance), but in radians. So since θ is given in degrees, I should convert it to radians first.

So, θ in radians is θ_rad = θ_deg * (π / 180). Let me compute that. θ_deg is 1e-17 degrees, so θ_rad ≈ 1e-17 * π / 180 ≈ (1e-17) * (1.745e-2) ≈ 1.74
