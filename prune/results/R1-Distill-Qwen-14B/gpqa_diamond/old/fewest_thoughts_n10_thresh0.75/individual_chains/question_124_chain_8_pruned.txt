Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about particles in a detector. Let me read it carefully and think through what I know.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the detector's inner walls. Now, the detector has a radius of 30 meters. The question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm. So, I think this has to do with the particles' speed and how quickly they decay or how far they travel before decaying. Since they are produced at the center, the distance they need to travel to reach the inner walls is 30 meters.

Wait, wait. But at ultra-relativistic speeds, their gamma factor (Lorentz factor) affects their lifetime as observed in the lab frame. Because from the lab's perspective, the particles are moving very fast, so their decay time is dilated. So, the time it takes for them to reach the detector's wall depends on their speed, right?

Wait, but in the problem, initially, with gamma=20, only one third reach the wall. So maybe when gamma increases, more particles reach the wall. Because higher gamma implies time dilation, making the particles live longer, so more have time to reach the wall.

So, if I can find a relation between gamma and the fraction of particles reaching the wall, I can find the required gamma.

Let me think. The particles are produced at the center, so the distance to the wall is 30 meters. The time available for the particles to reach the wall, from the lab frame, is the time it takes a particle to travel 30 meters at its speed. But if the particle's lifetime is tau (proper time), then in the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma * tau.

Wait, no. Wait, the proper lifetime is tau. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer: gamma * tau. So, the time available for the particle to reach the wall is (distance)/(velocity). But since the particles are moving at a relativistic speed, their velocity is approximately c for high gamma. So, time = 30 m / c.

Wait, but the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. If the time to reach the wall is t = (30 m
