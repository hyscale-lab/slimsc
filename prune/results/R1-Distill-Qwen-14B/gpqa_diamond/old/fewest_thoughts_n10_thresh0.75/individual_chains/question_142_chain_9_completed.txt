Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the density matrix rho as (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, including mixed states. Pure states have density matrices that are projectors (like |0><0|), but when you have a mixture, you combine them with classical probabilities.

Wait, what's the structure of a qubit's density matrix? Oh right, a qubit can be represented as a vector in a 2D space, but density matrices are 2x2 matrices. The geometric position is probably referring to the Bloch sphere representation. Oh yeah, the Bloch sphere is a way to visualize qubit states. Each qubit state can be plotted as a point on the surface of a unit sphere, with the Pauli matrices as axes.

So, the Bloch vector r is a vector from the origin to a point on the sphere, with components (x, y, z). For a pure state |ψ>, the Bloch vector is given by r = (2 Re(ψ₁ψ₂*), 2 Im(ψ₁ψ₂*), |ψ₁|² - |ψ₂|²), but wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Alternatively, I think for a general qubit state, the density matrix can be written using the Bloch vector components.

The general form of a density matrix for a qubit is:
ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,
where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is the Bloch vector (x, y, z). So this ρ must be written in terms of r and σ matrices.

Let me compute that. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So, let's write ρ in terms of these.

Given ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Let me compute |0><0| and |1><1| in terms of matrices. |0> is [1; 0], so |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. So when I add them, I get [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I.

So ρ = (1/2) I. Which means it's (1/2) times the identity matrix. So, ρ is a diagonal matrix with entries 0.5 and 0.5.

Now, using the formula ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, let's plug in ρ as (I)/2.

So, (I + r·σ)/2 = (I)/2. Subtract (I/2) from both sides: r·σ /2 = 0. So r·σ must be zero matrix. The only way that happens is if r is zero. Because any non-zero r would produce a non-zero matrix when multiplied with the Pauli matrices.

Wait, let me make sure. The term r·σ is r_x σx + r_y σy + r_z σz. If r is zero, this term is zero, so ρ is I/2, which matches the given density matrix.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). That would correspond to the completely mixed state, right? Because a density matrix of I/2 is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. It's like being in a superposition that's completely uncertain, so it's at the center of the Bloch sphere.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it is that the density matrix ρ given here is the maximally mixed state, which is the center of the Bloch sphere. So geometrically, it's at the origin (0,0,0). So yeah, option C is correct.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a qubit. To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} = (x, y, z) \) corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere, and the general form of a qubit density matrix in terms of the Bloch vector is:

\[
\rho = \frac{I}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma},
\]

where \( I \) is the identity matrix and \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli matrices. For the given \( \rho \), it simplifies to:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} I.
\]

This implies that the term \( \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) must be zero, which occurs only when \( \mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0) \). This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the options provided, the only one that matches this position is:

**C) \( r = (0, 0, 0) \).**

Answer: C
