Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about a star with some dark spots and how that affects its brightness variation. The scenario is that these spots can mimic the presence of an exoplanet in terms of the light curve. The goal is to find what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be to produce the same signal amplitude as the spots do.

Hmm, let's break down the given information. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. The effective temperature, Teff, is 6000 K. One hemisphere is covered with dark spots, filling factor is 20%. Filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered, right? So 20% of one hemisphere is covered. Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR², and one hemisphere is 2πR², so 20% of that is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR². Wait, no, the filling factor is just the area covered relative to the whole star, or relative to the hemisphere? Wait, actually, the problem states that one hemisphere is covered, so perhaps the filling factor is 20% of that hemisphere. But I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, the filling factor is the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots. Since only one hemisphere is spotted, the total area covered is 20% of the hemisphere. But wait, the hemisphere is half the star's surface. So the total covered area would be 0.2 * (π R²) (since a hemisphere is 2π R², but I think I'm getting mixed up here).

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. The star's surface area is 4π R². A hemisphere would be 2π R². If the filling factor is 20% on that hemisphere, then the area covered by spots is 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R². So total area with spots is 0.4 π R².

The spots have a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the star's Teff is 6000 K, and the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K? Wait, the problem says a temperature difference of 1000 K. So if the star is 6000 K, then the spots are either 5000 K or 7000 K. But dark spots are cooler than the surrounding, right? Because sunspots are cooler. So the spots are 5000 K.

So, the brightness variation comes from the spots rotating into and out of view. As the star spins, the spots come in and out of the observed hemisphere. So when the spots are on the visible side, their lower brightness causes a dip in the total light. Similarly, if there were an exoplanet trans
