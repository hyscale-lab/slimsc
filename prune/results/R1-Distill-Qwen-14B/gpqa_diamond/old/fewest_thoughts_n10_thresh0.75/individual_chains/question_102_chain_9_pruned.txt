Okay, so I've got this question about a ligand-receptor pair and some genetic constructs. Hmm, let me think through this. So the setup is that someone has identified a new ligand and receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to study their interaction's developmental fate.

The receptor is a monomeric transmembrane protein with eight alpha helices, four extracellular, and three beta sheets making the binding site. The ligand is a coiled-coil with two alpha helices. So the ligand probably binds to the receptor's extracellular part.

They made a bicistronic vector. Bicistronic means two genes in one vector. The vector is lox-Cre, which I think is a way to conditionally delete genes. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP at the C-terminus. 

So the vector structure: Ligand (CBA promoter) → stop cassette (loxP-stop-loxP) → mCherry; then IRES element upstream of receptor, and stop cassette with lox2272. Wait, no. Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is after an IRES. Oh, right. Bicistronic vectors often use an IRES to allow for internal ribosome entry, so the two genes can be expressed from the same promoter.

So the setup is: the vector has the ligand and receptor as two separate ORFs. The ligand is under CBA, which I think is a strong promoter. The receptor is under the control of an IRES, which requires that the upstream gene (ligand) is translated first. Because IRES allows for the ribosome to re-initiate, maybe without a second promoter.

Now, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. But there are stop cassettes. So between ligand and mCherry, they have a loxP stop loxP. Similarly, between receptor and eGFP, lox2272 stop lox2272. So these are stop signals that can be removed by Cre-mediated recombination.

Wait, loxP and lox2272 are different loxP variants. I think loxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is a variant that Cre can recognize but in a way that they can be used for different recombination events. So if you have multiple lox sites, you can have multiple recombination events in a specific order.

So the setup is: when Cre is present, it will recombine the loxP sites, removing the stop cassette. So for the ligand, the stop is in front of mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but the stop would prevent mCherry from being expressed. But wait, the ligand is fused to mCherry, so maybe that's a tag? Or perhaps the stop is between ligand and mCherry. Oh, the question says the ligand ORF is fused to mCherry, but with a stop in the lox
