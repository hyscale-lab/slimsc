Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it. Alright, let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about an atom that hasn't decayed for 50 minutes, and we want to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. The given info is that the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. Hmm, wait, do I remember how radioactive decay works?

So, radioactive decay is a random process, right? Each atom has a certain probability of decaying over time. The key thing here is that the decay process is memoryless. That means the probability of the atom decaying in the next t minutes doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. Oh wait, that's the exponential decay model.

Wait, so if the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%, that must be the probability that the atom decays at some point within that time. So, I think I can model this with the decay equation. Let me recall the formula.

The decay constant λ is related to the half-life, but maybe it's easier to use the formula for the probability P(t) that a nucleus decays within time t. The formula is P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), right? Because the survival probability is e^(-λt), so the decay probability is 1 minus that.

Wait, so in the problem, the given 32% is for t=100 minutes. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Let me solve for λ.

Rearranging, e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68. Taking the natural logarithm on both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68). So λ = - ln(0.68) / 100.

Let me compute ln(0.68). I remember that ln(1)=0, ln(0.5)≈-0.6931, and ln(0.7)≈-0.3567. Hmm, 0.68 is close to 0.7, so ln(0.68) is a bit less than that. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it. Let me calculate it.

Wait, but perhaps for the purpose of this problem, I can just keep it as ln(0.68) without calculating the exact value because maybe the exact value isn't needed if the question is about the next 150 minutes.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The problem is that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the remaining time we're looking at is 150 minutes, but I think the formula for the remaining probability is based on the remaining time.

Wait, no. The question is, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, what's the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes.

But wait, in radioactive decay, the decay process is memoryless. So the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period, regardless of how
