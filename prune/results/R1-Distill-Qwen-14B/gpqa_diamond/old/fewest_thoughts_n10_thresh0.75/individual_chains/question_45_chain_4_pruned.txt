Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, let me think. The question is about four identical spin-1/2 particles in such a well. I need to find the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state. The options are given, so I'll have to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, each particle is a spin-1/2, which means they can have spin up or down. But in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the energy levels depend on the quantum number n, right? Oh wait, but because they're identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. So each state can only be occupied by one fermion, considering their spin.

So the energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), right? And the problem gives E = π²ħ²/(2mL²), so each E_n is n² times E. So E_1 = E, E_2 = 4E, E_3=9E, and so on.

But wait, because these are four fermions, each with spin-1/2, each energy level can hold two particles—one for spin up and one for spin down. Oh wait, no, wait. For each n, you can have two particles: spin up and spin down. So for each n, we can have two fermions in that state.

So the ground state would be the lowest energy configuration possible with four particles. Let's think about filling up the states.

In the ground state, the particles will fill the lowest energy levels first, with each level accommodating up to two particles (due to spin). So:

n=1 can hold two particles. So two particles here.

n=2 can hold two more particles. So that's four in total. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute. For four identical fermions, each with spin-1/2, each n level can take two fermions (spin up and spin down). So for the ground state, n=1 has two particles (each spin), n=2 has two particles (each spin), and that's four.

So the total energy is the sum of each particle's energy.

So the two particles at n=1 contribute 2*(1²E) = 2E.

The two particles at n=2 contribute 2*(2²E) = 2*(4E) = 8E.

So total ground state energy is 2E +8E=10E.

Wait wait, no, that's not right. Wait, each particle contributes their own energy. But since each state (n, spin) is filled, the two particles in n=1 each have energy E, and the two in n=2 each have 4E. So the total is 2*(1²E) + 2*(2²E) = 2E + 8E =10E.

Wait, but wait, no. Each fermion in a state has its own energy. So for four particles, two in n=1 (E each) and two in n=2 (4E each). So 2*(E) + 2*(4E) = 2E +8
