Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT, and the options are 1 to 4, with the choices being combinations of these.

Let me remember what each symmetry means. The options are:

1. Lorentz Symmetry
2. Poincare symmetry
3. CP symmetry
4. CPT symmetry

Wait, Lorentz symmetry and Poincaré symmetry... I think Lorentz symmetry includes things like rotations and boosts, while Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz plus translations. So Poincaré is a bigger symmetry group. But in the SMEFT framework, I think that all operators must respect the gauge symmetries and some global symmetries.

Wait, SMEFT is an effective theory constructed by adding higher-dimensional operators to the Standard Model. These operators must respect the symmetries of the Standard Model. The Standard Model has the gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), and it also respects Lorentz symmetry because the SM is a Lorentz-invariant theory. So all operators in SMEFT must transform covariantly under the SM gauge group and also respect Lorentz symmetry.

Wait, but what about Poincaré symmetry? Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. The SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators should be Lorentz scalars. But wait, what about translation symmetry? Operators in the SMEFT are considered to have a certain scaling (like dimension 6, 7, etc.), but I'm not sure if all operators must respect Poincaré symmetry. Or do they? Because the effective theory should be a Lorentz-invariant theory, which would include Poincaré symmetry. Because if the theory is Lorentz-invariant, then it's also Poincaré invariant because Poincaré includes Lorentz and translations. Wait, no, I might be mixing things up. The Poincaré group includes both Lorentz transformations and translations. So if a theory is Lorentz-invariant, it doesn't automatically mean it's Poincaré-invariant. For example, a theory can be Lorentz-invariant but not translation-invariant if, say, there's a preferred frame for some reason. But I think in the SMEFT, the operators are constructed in a way that respects the Poincaré symmetry. Because the effective theory is meant to be a valid description up to some cutoff scale, so it should include all the symmetries of the original theory, which includes Poincaré.

Wait, no—another thought: when building SMEFT, you include all possible terms that are compatible with the Standard Model symmetries (gauge and global). But do they have to respect Poincaré? Well, the SM itself is Poincaré-invariant because it's a relativistic theory. So the SMEFT, which is an extension, must also respect Poincaré symmetry. So operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry.

Wait, but wait. The SMEFT is built by adding operators that are higher-dimensional. Each operator must be a
