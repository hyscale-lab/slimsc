Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of pH calculations. Let's see what it's about.

The question says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base are present and see if they neutralize each other or if there's excess.

Let me start by calculating the moles of each component. Moles are calculated as Molarity × Volume (in liters).

First, for acetic acid (CH3COOH):
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. So moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

Next, HCl:
0.2 M and 400 mL (0.4 L). Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Then, Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.3 M, volume 300 mL (0.3 L). So moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles.

Wait, but wait—Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, right? It dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- ions. So the moles of OH^- would be 2 × 0.09 = 0.18 moles.

Now, the acids are CH3COOH (a weak acid) and HCl (a strong acid). Both will contribute H+ ions. Let's see how much H+ each contributes.

HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So the moles of H+ from HCl is 0.08.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for the purpose of neutralization, I think we can say that it will donate H+ as much as it can, but since we're dealing with neutralization with a base, maybe I need to consider if it's being neutralized.

Wait, wait. Let's think: when you mix an acid and a base, they react. So the H+ from both acids will react with the OH- from the base.

So total H+ from both acids is 0.08 (from HCl) plus whatever CH3COOH can contribute. But wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when it's mixed with a base, does it donate H+?

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the total H+ and total OH- in the solution and see which is in excess.

Wait, another approach: calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate all its H+. CH3COOH, being weak, won't donate all its H+; but perhaps when mixed with a base, some of it will react.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should first calculate the moles of H+ and OH- separately, then see if they neutralize each other.

Wait, let's break it down.

Total moles of H+:
HCl provides 0.08 moles H+. CH3COOH is a weak acid, but when mixed with a base, it can donate H+ as well. But perhaps I should think of it as an acid contributing H+ but not fully dissociating. Alternatively, maybe the key is to see if the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH can neutralize the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait
