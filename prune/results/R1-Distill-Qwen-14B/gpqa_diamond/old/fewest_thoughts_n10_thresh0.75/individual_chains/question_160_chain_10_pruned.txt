Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are the same length a. When monochromatic light falls on it, we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field, especially when N is infinitely large. 

Wait, N going to infinity... Oh, right! If a polygon has infinitely many sides, it becomes a circle. So maybe the problem simplifies to a circular aperture. But wait, the options don't all look the same as the standard single-slit diffraction pattern. Or wait, no—aperture shape matters for the diffraction pattern.

Wait, in the far field, the diffraction pattern comes from the Fourier transform of the aperture. For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern has a central bright spot with the first minimum at an angle given by a certain formula. But wait, wait. Wait, the problem specifies a polygon with all apothems of length a. Hmm, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side in a regular polygon. So for a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem a is related to the radius R of the circumscribed circle. 

Wait, but when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. Because for a regular polygon, as N increases, the apothem approaches the radius of the circumscribed circle. So in the limit, the aperture is a circle of radius a. So the diffraction pattern would be the familiar Airy disk.

Wait, but the question is about an N-sided polygon, not a circle. Hmm, but when N is infinity, it's a circle. So the diffraction pattern would be similar to a circular aperture. So the minima in the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture occur at angles where the argument of the Bessel function J1 is at its zeros. The first minimum is when J1's first zero is reached.

But wait, the question is about the first two minima. Wait, no—wait, the first minimum after the central maximum is the first dark ring. So the separation between the first two minima would be the difference between the angles of the first and second minima.

Wait, but wait, the problem says “the first two minima when N is infinitely large.” So in the far field, the diffraction minima occur at angles determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum is at θ1 where J1(k a sinθ) = 0. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, and the second at x≈7.0156. So the first two minima correspond to these two zeros.

Wait, but the question is about the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a), because the formula is sinθ = (x λ)/(π a), wait, let me get that right. The general formula for the minima in the far field for a circular aperture is given by a sinθ = (x_m n λ)/(2), where x_m n is the nth zero of the Bessel function J_m. For the first minimum, m=1, n=1, so a sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/2.
