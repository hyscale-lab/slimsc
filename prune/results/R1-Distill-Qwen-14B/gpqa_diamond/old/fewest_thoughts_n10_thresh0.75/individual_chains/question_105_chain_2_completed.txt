Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about a star with certain characteristics and dark spots, and how that affects the brightness variations observed. They mention that this situation can resemble an exoplanet's effect on the star's light curve. The goal is to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the spots do.

Alright, let's start by understanding the given data. The star has a radius equal to the Sun, so R_star = R_sun. The effective temperature is 6000 K. One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of that hemisphere. The spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spots are at 5000 K, I suppose.

The problem says that when the star is observed, the brightness variations due to spots are similar to those caused by a planet transiting the star. So we need to compare the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots with that of a planet.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit tricky: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star?"

So, if the star didn't have spots, what planet radius would cause the same brightness dip as the spots do when the star does have spots.

Wait, no. The way I read it: the spot situation is making the brightness variations look similar to a planet. But the question is, to get the same amplitude, what planet radius would do that, considering that the star isn't spotted. So I think I need to calculate the relative brightness change caused by the spots and set that equal to the brightness change caused by a planet transit, then solve for R_planet / R_star.

Right, because when a planet transits a star, the brightness drops by an amount proportional to (R_planet / R_star)^2. So the amplitude of the light curve is (Rp / R*)^2.

Now for the spots: when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. So when a spot is on the visible side, it contributes less light than the rest of the star. The total brightness variation depends on the area of the spots and their temperature difference.

But wait, the star has a radius equal to the Sun. So area is 4π R^2. The spots cover 20% of one hemisphere. Oh wait, a hemisphere is half the star's surface. So 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * (2π R^2) / 2? Wait, no. Wait, the star's total surface area is 4π R². So one hemisphere is 2π R². So 20% of a hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4π R². So the spot area is 0.4π R².

Wait wait, no. Wait, the filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So for one hemisphere, 20% coverage. So total spot area is 0.2 * (hemisphere area) = 0.2 * (2π R²) = 0.4 π R².

But each spot is cooler. So the total flux from the star when a spot is visible would be lower. The flux from a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law: F = σ T^4. But when a spot is present, its flux is σ (T_spot)^4.

The total flux from the star without spots would be F_total = σ Teff^4 * 4π R². But with spots, when a spot is visible, the flux is F_total' = F_total - (area of spot * σ (T_spot)^4) + (area of spot * σ (T_spot)^4). Wait, no. Wait, the star's total flux is the sum of all parts. So the unspotted star has all parts at Teff. When a spot is present, that area emits at a lower T. So the change in flux is the difference.

So the difference is: delta_F = (area of spot) * [σ Teff^4 - σ (Teff - 1000 K)^4 ]

Wait, no. Wait, the spots are cooler. So the effective temperature of the spots is Teff - 1000 K? Or is it a 1000 K difference from the surrounding? The question says "temperature difference of 1000 K." So probably, the spots are at 5000 K, since the star's Teff is 6000 K.

So the star's Teff is 6000 K, spots are at 5000 K.

So each spot emits at (5000/6000)^4 of the star's flux per unit area.

But wait, the flux from the star without spots is F = σ (6000)^4. The flux from the spot is σ (5000)^4.

So when the spot is on the visible side, the total flux from the star is F_total = (1 - (area_fraction)) * F + (area_fraction) * F_spot.

Area_fraction is (spot area) / (star area). Which is (0.4π R²) / (4π R²) ) = 0.4 / 4 = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is spotted.

Wait, but the spot is on one hemisphere. So when the star rotates, the spots come into view when that hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum brightness variation would be when the spot is on the limb, but the maximum dip would be when the spot is fully in view. Alternatively, perhaps the total flux variation is calculated based on the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots.

Wait, perhaps I should model the maximum dip in brightness. The maximum dip occurs when the maximum amount of spotted area is visible. Since the star is being observed from Earth, and only one hemisphere is spotted, when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the entire spotted area is visible. So the dip in flux would be the difference between the unspotted star and the spotted star when the spotted area is fully visible.

So the flux without any spots is F0 = σ T^4 * (4π R^2). When the spots are fully visible, the flux is F = F0 - (spot_area) * σ (T_spot)^4 + (spot_area) * σ (T_spot)^4. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no. Let me rethink. The total flux is the sum of all areas. So without spots, all areas are at T=6000 K. With spots, the area of the spots is at 5000 K, and the rest at 6000.

So the flux when the spots are fully visible is:

F = (4π R² - A) * σ (6000)^4 + A * σ (5000)^4,

where A is the area of the spots.

The flux without spots is F0 = 4π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the change in flux is delta_F = F - F0 = A [σ (5000)^4 - σ (6000)^4 ].

Which is A σ [ (5000/6000)^4 - 1 ].

But wait, that would be negative, so the flux is less. So the dip is delta_F = F0 - F = A σ [ (6000^4 - 5000^4) ].

Hmm, perhaps I should compute the fractional change in flux. The fractional dip is (delta_F) / F0.

So delta_F = A σ (6000^4 - 5000^4).

So fractional dip = [ A (6000^4 - 5000^4) ] / (4π R² 6000^4 )

A is 0.4 π R² (from earlier calculation), right?

Wait, earlier I thought the spot area is 0.4 π R². Because one hemisphere is 2π R², 20% of that is 0.4 π R². So A = 0.4 π R².

So substituting A into the fractional dip:

fractional_dip = [ (0.4 π R²) * (6000^4 - 5000^4) * σ ] / [4 π R² * 6000^4 * σ ]

Simplify:

The R² and σ terms cancel. π cancels as well. So:

= (0.4 * (6000^4 - 5000^4 )) / (4 * 6000^4 )

Compute 0.4 divided by 4: that's 0.1.

So fractional_dip = 0.1 * (6000^4 - 5000^4) / (6000^4 )

Let me compute the term (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4.

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5/6)^4 is approximately (0.8333)^4.

Compute 0.8333^2 = ~0.6944. Then squared again: 0.6944^2 ≈ 0.4823.

So (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So (6000^4 -5000^4)/6000^4 = 1 - 0.4823 = 0.5177.

So fractional_dip ≈ 0.1 * 0.5177 ≈ 0.05177, or about 5.177% dip.

But wait, that's the maximum dip when the entire spotted area is visible. So the amplitude of the variation is about 5.177% of the star's flux.

But the star's brightness variation due to rotation would be this dip. So the maximum dip is ~5.177% of the star's flux.

Now, the question is, what exoplanet radius would cause the same dip amplitude if it were transiting.

When a planet transits the star, the dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2.

So setting (R_p / R_star)^2 = 0.05177.

Take the square root: R_p / R_star = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(0.05177):

0.05177 is approximately 5.177e-2.

sqrt(5.177e-2)= about 0.2275, as I thought.

So R_p/R* ≈ 0.2275.

Looking at the options:

Options are A) ~0.39, B) ~0.07, C) ~0.11, D) ~0.32.

Hmm, 0.2275 isn't exactly any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back through the steps.

First, spot area: one hemisphere is 2π R². 20% coverage, so 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the star rotates, the maximum area visible is 0.4 π R².

So when the spots are fully visible, the total flux from the spots is 0.4 π R² * σ (5000)^4.

The total flux without spots is 4 π R² * σ (6000)^4.

So the fractional dip is [ (0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) ) / (4 π R² σ (6000^4) )) ]?

Wait, no. Wait, the dip is the difference in flux when the spots are present. So the dip is [ (unspotted flux) - (spotted flux) ] / unspotted flux.

So unspotted flux is 4 π R² σ (6000^4).

Spotted flux when the spots are visible is (4 π R² σ (6000^4)) - (0.4 π R² σ (6000^4) ) + (0.4 π R² σ (5000^4) )

Wait, no, because the unspotted area is (4 π R² - 0.4 π R² ) = 3.6 π R². So the spotted flux is 3.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4).

So the dip is (unspotted - spotted) / unspotted.

Which is [4 π R² σ (6000^4) - (3.6 π R² σ (6000^4) + 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 )) ] / [4 π R² σ (6000^4) ]

Simplify numerator:

4 π R² σ (6000^4 ) -3.6 π R² σ (6000^4 ) = 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 )

Subtract the 0.4 π R² σ (5000^4 ), so numerator is 0.4 π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Denominator is 4 π R² σ (6000^4 )

So fractional dip is [0.4 (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 * 6000^4 ]

Which is 0.4/4 * (6000^4 -5000^4) /6000^4 = 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which is same as before. So the fractional dip is 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4 )

Earlier, I calculated (5/6)^4 as about 0.4823, so 1 - 0.4823 is 0.5177. Multiply by 0.1, 0.05177.

So the dip is 5.177% of the star's flux.

So the planet would need to cause a dip of the same amplitude. The dip from a planet is (R_p / R_star )^2. So set (R_p / R_star )^2 = 0.05177 → R_p / R_star ≈ 0.2275.

Wait, but none of the options are around 0.23. The closest options are option C: ~0.11 and option B: ~0.07, which are much smaller. Hmm, maybe I messed up the spot area calculation.

Wait, perhaps the spot is on one hemisphere, but when the star rotates, the hemisphere comes into view. So the area that's blocked is 20% of one hemisphere, but only when that hemisphere is facing us. So the maximum dip is when the entire 20% is facing us.

Wait, but perhaps the way the spots are arranged is such that the 20% is the maximum possible coverage when the hemisphere is visible. So the area that can be blocked is 20% of the hemisphere, which is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the total surface of the star. The star's total surface is 4π R². The spots occupy 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So the fraction is 0.4 π R² / 4 π R² = 0.1, or 10% of the star's surface is spotted.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the maximum area that can be blocked is 0.4 π R². So the maximum dip is when all 0.4 π R² is on the visible side.

So that part seems correct.

Hmm, but the options don't include 0.23. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the temperature difference is 1000 K, but the absolute temperature of the spots is 5000 K, as I thought. Let me recheck the (5/6)^4 calculation. Let me compute 5/6 exactly: 5000/6000 is 5/6. So (5/6)^4 = (625 / 1296) which is approximately 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So 0.1 * 0.517747 = 0.0517747 → 5.177% dip.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.05177) ~ 0.2275 R*.

Wait, but the options are A) 0.39, B)0.07, C)0.11, D)0.32.

Hmm, none match 0.2275.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area calculation. Let's re-examine. The star's radius is equal to the Sun. So R_star = R_sun.

The spots cover one hemisphere with a 20% filling factor. So each hemisphere is 2π R².

Wait, 20% of that is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So when the hemisphere is visible, the spot area is 0.4 π R². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is for a planet causing a dip of the same amplitude as the spots, so if the star didn't have spots, the planet would cause a dip of 5.177%. So (R_p / R_star)^2 ≈ 0.05177 → R_p/R* ≈ 0.2275. So approximately 0.23.

But the options don't have that. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I forgot that when the star is viewed at an angle (like when a spot is not exactly on the center), the blocked area would be less. But the maximum dip occurs when the spot is directly in front, so the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the relative brightness variation, but the brightness variation due to the spots is a dip, while the exoplanet also causes a dip. However, the problem states that the observed variation is due to the spots, which can resemble an exoplanet. So perhaps the amplitude of the brightness change is the same as that caused by a planet.

So perhaps the question is correct, but the answer isn't among the options. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the spot area. Let me think again. The star has radius R. The area of a hemisphere is 2π R². The spots cover 20% of that, so area is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

So the fraction of the star's surface covered by spots is (0.4 π R²)/(4 π R² )= 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

Wait, but when the star rotates, the spots come into view, so the maximum area that can be blocked is 0.4 π R².

Wait, perhaps the brightness variation isn't just the dip from the spots, but also the modulation due to rotation. But the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which is the dip in brightness.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation should consider the brightness variation not as a dip, but as the variation during rotation, but that might not change the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spots as causing a change in brightness that's similar to a planet, but the planet would cause a symmetric dip, while the spots would lead to a more complex variation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the relative change in flux as (delta F) / F = (A (Teff^4 - T_spot^4)) / (F_total ), which is what I did.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional dip.

Let me compute 6000^4 and 5000^4 more accurately.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * 1e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 -5000^4 = 1.296e15 -6.25e14= 6.71e14.

So (6.71e14) / (1.296e15 )= 0.5177.

So 0.1 * 0.5177= 0.05177, same as before.

So the fractional dip is ~5.177%.

So the planet's radius would need to cause the same 5.177% dip.

So (R_p / R*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R* = sqrt(0.05177 ) ≈ 0.2275.

But looking at the options, the closest would be none of them. So perhaps I made a mistake in the way I calculated the spot area or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the spots are only on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates, the spots come into view for a certain period. But the maximum dip is when the entire spot area is visible. So this part was correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the brightness variation isn't just a dip, but a periodic change as the spots rotate into and out of view. But the amplitude would still be the same as the maximum dip.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the variation as a sinusoidal curve, but I think for the purposes of this problem, it's about the maximum dip.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've mixed up factors somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the star has a radius equal to the Sun, and the spots are on one hemisphere, with a filling factor of 20%. So the area is 0.2 × 2π R² = 0.4 π R². So when this area is visible, the dip is based on that.

Wait, another approach: When the star isn't spotted, the planet would cause a dip of (R_p/R*)^2. We need to find R_p such that this is equal to the dip caused by the spots.

So R_p/R* = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, perhaps the area is 20% of the entire star's surface, not just one hemisphere. If that were the case, the area would be 0.2 × 4π R² = 0.8 π R². But the problem says the spots are on one hemisphere, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the star is observed, the spots are on one hemisphere, but the star's rotation makes the spotted hemisphere face us only part of the time. But the maximum dip would still be when the entire spot area is visible.

So perhaps I'm correct, but the options are wrong, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the average dip over the rotation period, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the spot's fractional contribution. Let me re-calculate the fractional dip.

Fractional dip = [ (0.4 π R²) (6000^4 -5000^4) ] / [4 π R² (6000^4) ]

Simplify: 0.4 cancels to 0.4/4 = 0.1.

So 0.1 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4 )

Which is 0.1*(1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) → 0.1*(1 - (0.8333)^4 )

(0.8333)^4 is approx 0.4823, so 1-0.4823=0.5177. 0.1*0.5177=0.05177.

So yes, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the planet's effect on the star's light curve as (R_p + R_star)^2, but that's not correct for small Rp. For a planet, the area blocked is π R_p², so the dip is (π R_p²)/(4π R_star² ) = (R_p/R_star )².

Yes, that's correct.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the way the spot's effect is modeled. Another possibility is that the star's flux is dominated by the spots, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps when the star isn't spotted, the planet's transit causes a dip in brightness. But the spotted star, when the spots are not visible, would have the same brightness as the unspotted star, and when the spots are visible, it's dimmer. But the variation occurs because the spots rotate into and out of view.

Wait, another thought: The brightness variation is due to the spots being on the visible side as the star rotates. So the maximum dip is when all the spots are visible, but the variation in brightness over time would be a periodic dip as the spots come into and out of view.

But the amplitude is the maximum dip, so I think my calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the total change in flux as the spots are on the far side of the star, but that wouldn't affect the brightness.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the star's brightness when the spots are on the far side. No, that doesn't change the observed brightness.

Another approach: perhaps the star's brightness when the spots are visible is F = F_unspotted - (spot_area) (F_unspotted per unit area - F_spot per unit area ) * ( spot_fraction )

So F = F0 - (A) [ (F0/(4π R² )) - (F_spot) ]

Wait, F0 is the flux without spots. So F0 = sigma T^4 * 4 pi R^2.

Flux from a spot area A is sigma T_spot^4 * A.

So the change in flux is F0 - (F0 - (A (F0/(4 pi R^2) - F_spot )) )

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting confusing. Maybe focusing on the fractional change is better.

Fractional dip = (F0 - F_spotted) / F0.

F_spotted = F0 - (F0/(4 pi R^2 )) * A + (F_spot ) * A.

Wait, no: F_spotted is F0 minus the flux from the unspotted areas plus the flux from the spotted areas.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the problem differently. The area of the spots is 0.4 pi R^2. The flux from the spots is sigma (5000)^4 * 0.4 pi R^2.

The total flux without spots is sigma (6000)^4 *4 pi R^2.

The fractional dip when the spots are fully visible is ( (4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 ) - (4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4 )) ) / (4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 )

Simplify numerator:

4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 - [ (4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 - 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 + 0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4 ) ]

= 4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 -4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 +0.4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 -0.4 pi R^2 sigma 5000^4

= 0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 )

Denominator: 4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4

So fractional dip is [0.4 pi R^2 sigma (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [4 pi R^2 sigma 6000^4 ] = 0.4/4 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) /6000^4 = 0.1 * (1 - (5000/6000)^4 )

Which again comes to 0.05177.

Hmm. So the problem is that the answer isn't in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the relative brightness change due to the spot as a percentage, but perhaps the star's brightness with spots is dimmer, and the planet's transit causes a similar percentage dip. So the calculation is correct, but perhaps the options are using a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the area of the spots as a fraction of the star's disk, which is 0.1 (10%), but when the star is viewed edge-on, the maximum area that can be blocked is 10% of the star's disk, which would correspond to a planet with radius 0.316 R* (since sqrt(0.1)= ~0.316), but that would be 0.316 R*, which is approximately option D (0.32). But wait, that's 0.316, which is close to D) 0.32.

Wait, but that approach would ignore the temperature difference. So perhaps the problem is considering the area blocked, not the actual flux change.

Wait, but the question is about the amplitude of the brightness variation, which depends on the change in flux, which is a function of both area and temperature.

So if the problem is considering a planet causing a dip in brightness of (R_p / R_*)^2, and the spots cause a dip of 5.177%, then the planet's R_p/R* is sqrt(0.05177)= ~0.2275, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is presented differently. Maybe the star's brightness variation due to the spots is the same as the planet's, but when the star isn't spotted. So the star's brightness variation is due to the spots, and the planet's effect is the same.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness is varying because of the spots, which can be mistaken for a planet. So the brightness variation amplitude from the spots is the same as that from a planet.

So, as done earlier, the spot's effect is a dip of ~5.177%, which would require a planet with R_p/R* ~0.2275. Since none of the options are close to that, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the spot area calculation. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered with a filling factor of 20%. So the area is 0.2 × (2 pi R² ) = 0.4 pi R². The total star area is 4 pi R². So the area fraction is 0.4 pi R² /4 pi R² = 0.1. So 10% of the star's surface is covered by spots.

But when the spot is on the far side, it doesn't affect the brightness. When it's on the near side, it blocks 10% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 10% × (T_spot / T_eff)^4.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The dip is (area fraction) × (1 - (T_spot / T_eff )^4 )

So dip= 0.1 × (1 - (5000/6000)^4 ) = 0.1 × (1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.1 × (1 - 625/1296 )= 0.1 × (671/1296 )= 0.1 × 0.5177= 0.05177 or 5.177%.

So same as before.

Hmm. Unless I'm missing something in the problem statement, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely. So perhaps I made a mistake in the spot area.

Wait, another possibility: the star's rotation causes the spots to appear in a certain way. Maybe the star is rotating such that the spots are not fully visible but are limb darkened. But that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's surface brightness variation, not the total flux. But I think the approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's effect as a darkening of the hemisphere, but without knowing the exact model, perhaps the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the brightness variation as the difference between the maximum and minimum brightness, not just the dip.

Wait, max brightness is when no spots are visible (unspotted star), and min is when all spots are visible.

So the dip is as I calculated. So the amplitude is 5.177% dip.

So R_p/R* of about 0.2275, but no option is close.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the brightness variation when the star is viewed edge-on, but for the planet, the transit would cause a maximum dip when the planet is directly in front. But for the spots, perhaps the dip is more complex because the spots are spread across the hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the area of the spot as 20% of the entire star's surface, not just the hemisphere. Let's try that.

If the spot is 20% of the entire star's surface, then area is 0.2 *4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R².

Then the fractional dip would be [0.8 pi R² * (6000^4−5000^4 ) ] / [4 pi R² *6000^4 ] = 0.8/4 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) = 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035 or 10.35% dip.

Then, (R_p/R*)^2 = 0.1035 → R_p/R* = sqrt(0.1035 ) ≈ 0.3218.

Which is approximately 0.32, which is option D.

But the problem states that only one hemisphere is covered. So this approach would only be correct if the spots covered 20% of the entire star, but the problem says one hemisphere, so 20% of that.

Wait, but perhaps the problem's filling factor is 20% of the entire star. Let me re-read the question.

The question states: "one hemisphere of the star is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Oh! So the filling factor is 20% of the hemisphere. So the area is 0.2 * 2 pi R² = 0.4 pi R², as calculated earlier.

So my initial approach was correct.

Wait, but if I use the 0.2 × 4 pi R², that's 0.8 pi R², then the dip is 10.35%, leading to R_p/R* ~0.3218, which is option D.

Hmm, but the problem says one hemisphere is covered. So perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the intended approach is to take the spot area as 20% of the star's surface, leading to option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the spot area to be 20% of the entire star, not just a hemisphere. If that's the case, then the calculation leads to option D (0.32).

But according to the problem statement, it's only one hemisphere, so I think my initial approach is correct, but perhaps the intended answer is option C: 0.11.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractional dip.

Wait, let me recompute (5/6)^4.

(5/6)^4 = (5^4)/(6^4) = 625 / 1296 ≈ 0.482253.

So 1 - 0.482253 = 0.517747.

So 0.1 × 0.517747 = 0.051775.

So the dip is 5.1775% of F.

So (R_p/R*)^2 = 0.051775 → R_p/R* ≈ 0.2275.

This isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the spots are on the far side of the star. No, that wouldn't affect the brightness.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the star's brightness variation is due to the spots modulating the light as they rotate, but the amplitude is the difference between maximum and minimum brightness.

Wait, wait, perhaps the star's brightness when the spots are on the near side is lower, and when they are on the far side, the brightness is higher than average? No, that can't be, because the spots are cooler, so when they are on the far side, the visible side is all unspotted, so the brightness is higher than when spots are on the near side.

Wait, but the star's brightness when the spots are on the near side is lower. When the spots are on the far side, the visible side is fully unspotted, so the brightness is higher than the average.

Wait, so the maximum brightness would be when the spots are on the far side (all unspotted), and the minimum when the spots are on the near side.

So the variation would be from (F0) to (F0 - dip).

So the amplitude would be dip = F0 - F_spotted = 5.177% F0.

But the planet's transit would cause a dip of (R_p/R*)^2 F0.

So to have the same dip, (R_p/R*)^2 = 0.05177 → R_p/R* = sqrt(0.05177) ≈ 0.2275.

Hmm. So I'm back to the same issue.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in brightness when the spot is on the limb, which would block less flux, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the star's brightness variation as a sinusoidal function due to spots, but that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Let me recalculate it numerically.

Compute 6000^4:

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * (1e3)^4 = 1296 * 1e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625 * (1e3)^4 = 6.25e14.

Difference: 1.296e15 -6.25e14 = 6.71e14.

So (6.71e14) / (1.296e15) = 0.5177.

Multiply by 0.1: 0.05177.

Same as before.

So the dip is 5.177% of F.

So the planet's radius would need to be sqrt(0.05177) ~0.2275 R*.

Which is about 0.23 R*, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the square root of 0.05177, which is ~0.2275, but the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended answer is option C: 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121), which is 1.1e-2, which is 1.1%.

Wait, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the spot's area as a fraction of the star's area, which is 0.1, leading to a dip of 0.1*(1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.1*0.5177=0.05177, which is the same as before.

So I'm not sure why the options don't have the correct value. But perhaps the intended answer is option C, 0.11, which is sqrt(0.0121) = 0.11^2 = 0.0121. Hmm, but that's much smaller than 0.05177.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended to have the spot area as 10% of the star's surface, leading to a dip of 0.1 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.05177, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the planet's brightness change as (R_p/R_*)^2, but the spot's effect is (0.2 * (T_spot/T_*)^2 ), which would be a different approach. But that approach isn't correct because it's the fourth power, not the square.

Another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering only the area blocked and not the temperature difference. That would be wrong, but perhaps the problem is designed that way.

If the problem were to ignore the temperature difference and just consider the area blocked, the dip would be 10% of the star's surface: 0.1.

So (R_p/R*)^2 = 0.1 → R_p/R* = sqrt(0.1 ) ≈ 0.316, which is option D: ~0.32.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.

But according to the problem statement, the spots are cooler, so the actual dip is 5.177%, not 10%. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the intended approach is to calculate the area fraction and then the planet's radius.

So area fraction is 0.1 (10% of star's surface). So (R_p/R*)^2 = 0.1 → R_p = 0.316 R*, which is option D.

But the problem includes the temperature difference, which reduces the dip, making the required planet radius smaller.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to have the spot area as 0.2 (20%) of the star's surface, leading to dip of 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 )= 0.2 * 0.5177=0.1035, leading to R_p/R* = sqrt(0.1035 )= ~0.3218, which is option D.

But the problem says the spots cover one hemisphere with a filling factor of 20%, so that would be 0.2 of the hemisphere, not the entire star.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is intended to have the spot area as 20% of the entire star, leading to the dip of 0.2*(1 - (5/6)^4 )=0.2 *0.5177=0.1035, which gives R_p/R*= sqrt(0.1035 )= ~0.3218.

So the intended answer would be D) ~0.32.

In that case, perhaps the spot area is 0.2 × 4 pi R² = 0.8 pi R², which leads to the dip of 10.35%, requiring a planet with R_p=0.32 R*.

So maybe that's the intended approach, despite the problem statement saying one hemisphere.

In conclusion, based on the problem's options, and perhaps the intended answer, the correct choice is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation amplitude as the dark spots on the star, we analyze the problem as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: Equal to the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%.
   - Spots are cooler, with a temperature difference of \( 1000 \, \text{K} \), so \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Spot Area**:
   - One hemisphere of the star has a surface area of \( 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).
   - With a filling factor of 20%, the area of the spots is \( 0.2 \times 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 = 0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \).

3. **Fractional Brightness Dip**:
   - The total flux from the star without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \times 4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \), where \( \sigma \) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.
   - When the spots are fully visible, the flux is reduced due to the cooler spots:
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = F_0 - (0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2) \left( \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right).
     \]
   - The fractional dip in brightness is:
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = \frac{F_0 - F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_0} = \frac{0.4\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \left( \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 - \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \right)}{F_0}.
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = 0.1 \times \left( 1 - \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 \right).
     \]
   - Substituting \( T_{\text{spot}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \) and \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \):
     \[
     \left( \frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}} \right)^4 = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823.
     \]
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = 0.1 \times (1 - 0.4823) = 0.1 \times 0.5177 = 0.05177 \, \text{(or 5.177%)}.
     \]

4. **Exoplanet Brightness Variation**:
   - The brightness dip caused by a planet transiting the star is proportional to \( \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 \).
   - To match the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots, set:
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.05177.
     \]
   - Solving for \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.05177} \approx 0.2275.
     \]

5. **Comparison with Options**:
   - The calculated value \( \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx 0.2275 \) does not match any of the provided options exactly.
   - However, if the problem assumes the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface (instead of one hemisphere), the fractional dip would be:
     \[
     \text{Fractional Dip} = 0.2 \times (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 \times 0.5177 = 0.1035 \, \text{(or 10.35%)}.
     \]
     \[
     \frac{R_p}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218.
     \]
   - This value is closest to option **D) ~0.32**.

### Conclusion:
Given the ambiguity in interpreting the problem and the provided options, the most reasonable answer is **D) ~0.32**, assuming the spots cover 20% of the entire star's surface rather than one hemisphere.
