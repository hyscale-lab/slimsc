Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the question is about a star that has some spots on its surface. When the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, and when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Specifically, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—meaning, how much does the ratio without spots divide by when there are spots?

Hmm, okay, so first, I remember that in stellar atmospheres, the ionization and excitation states of atoms depend on the temperature. The presence of spots, which are cooler regions, might affect the overall photosphere's temperature. But wait, the problem says the effective temperature decreases when spots are present. Wait, but effective temperature is an average measure—so does that mean the spots cause the overall emission to drop?

Wait, but the star's photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), so each region emits based on its local temperature. The spots are cooler, so the regions without spots (the rest of the surface) must be hotter? Or wait, no. Wait, when the spots cover 40% of the surface, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K. But the star without spots has 6000 K. So when spots are present, the effective temperature is lower, but that's an average.

Wait, the effective temperature is given as 5500 K for the star with spots. So the entire photosphere is at 5500 K? Or is it a mix of hotter and cooler regions? Hmm, the question says the photospheric effective temperature decreases. So perhaps the entire photosphere is being considered as at 5500 K when the spots are present? Or maybe it's a mix of spots and non-spots. But the problem says the surface is 40% covered by dark spots, which implies the rest is at higher temperature.

Wait, but the problem states that when the star's surface isn't covered by dark spots, Teff is 6000 K. When 40% is covered, Teff is 5500 K. So the average is lower. But for the photosphere, the temperature might vary over the surface.

But for the purpose of this problem, when looking at the ratio of Ti atoms in two energy levels, we're considering the photosphere as a whole. Wait, but LTE is assumed. So each region in the photosphere is treated locally, but how does the presence of spots affect the global ratio? Because spots are cooler, the Ti atoms in those regions would
