Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand the question.

The problem says that a chemist performs two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene under the same conditions. Both reactions go to completion. Then, the chemist combines the products and runs them on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) one and a chiral one. The question is about what peaks they'd see in each case.

Alright, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which I remember is commonly used as an oxidizing agent, particularly in epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is when an alkene reacts with mCPBA to form an epoxide. So, both reactions are epoxidations.

Now, the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers of oct-4-ene. Epoxidation of alkenes typically forms an epoxide where the two new oxygen atoms connect the adjacent carbons. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the configuration of the starting alkene.

Wait, for a double bond, when it's in a trans (E) configuration, the epoxidation would lead to a trans epoxide, right? Or wait, no. Let me think. Epoxidation is a peracid reaction, which is an electrocyclic opening. Oh wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that forms an epoxide. The reaction proceeds with the same stereochemistry as the peracid's approach. Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe it's a concerted process where the oxygen adds across the double bond, maintaining the stereochemistry.

Wait, more accurately, the epoxidation via mCPBA is a syn addition. So, the two oxygen atoms are added to the same face of the double bond. That affects the configuration of the resulting epoxide.

So, let's consider Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene. The double bond is between C4 and C5. The groups on either side are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, which is a peracid, it adds across the double bond in a syn fashion. So, the epoxide that
