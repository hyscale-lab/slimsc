Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to make 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I need to understand the target molecule. The substituents on the benzene ring are tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. Their positions are 2, 1, and 3 respectively. Wait, benzene is a ring with six positions, so numbering is important here. Let me draw it mentally: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, position 3 is nitro. So, the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions. That means they are meta to each other, wait no, 1,2,3 are adjacent. Oh wait, wait, no. Let me clarify: Positioning in benzene is such that numbering starts at one substituent and goes around. So, 1,2,3 would be adjacent, each next to each other. So, the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions, meaning each is ortho to the next. Hmm, but tert-butyl is a bulky group. 

Wait, perhaps it's more correct to think of the substituents as being at positions 1, 2, and 3 in a way that they're in a meta arrangement? No, because 1,2 are adjacent (ortho), 2,3 are adjacent, and 1,3 are meta. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused about the positions. Let me think again.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So, the benzene ring has three substituents: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, positions 1, 2, 3 are consecutive, so each adjacent. So the substituents are in a row, each next to each other. So ethoxy is at the first position, tert-butyl at the second, and nitro at the third. That would make them all meta to each other? No, because 1 and 3 are meta, while 1 and 2 are ortho, and 2 and 3 are ortho. So the substituents are in a 1,2,3-trisubstituted pattern.

But wait, the synthesis steps involve adding these substituents. Since benzene is symmetric, the order in which substituents are added will determine the positions. Also, the directing effects of each substituent will influence where the next group attaches.

Let me recall the directing effects. Nitro groups are meta directors, ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para director. Tert-butyl is a bulky group; since it's an alkyl group, it's activating and an ortho/para director. But wait, tert-butyl is bulky, so in actual reactions, it may prefer para positions due to steric hindrance, but as a director, it's activating and ortho
