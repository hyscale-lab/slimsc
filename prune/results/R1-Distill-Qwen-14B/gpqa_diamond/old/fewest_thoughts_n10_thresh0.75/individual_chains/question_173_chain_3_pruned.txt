Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that it's related to quantum mechanics. The question is about an electron moving at a certain speed, and we need to find the minimum uncertainty in its energy. 

Alright, let me think. The problem states that the electron is traveling along the x-direction with a speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position, Δx, is 0.1 nanometers. Oh wait, nanometers, so that's 1e-9 meters. But 0.1 nm is 1e-10 meters, right?

I remember the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, which says that the product of the uncertainties in position and momentum must be at least on the order of Planck's constant divided by 4π. So the formula is Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck constant. Or wait, sometimes it's written as Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Either way, the idea is similar.

So I need to find ΔE, the uncertainty in energy. But how do I relate that to Δx and Δp? Oh, right, the energy of a particle is related to its momentum. For a non-relativistic particle, the momentum p is mv, where m is mass and v is velocity. So the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). 

But wait, the uncertainty in energy, ΔE, would come from the uncertainty in momentum, Δp. Because E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty in E would be related to the uncertainty in p. Let me think about that. Using the Heisenberg principle, Δp is approximately ħ/(2Δx), or maybe something like that, depending on the precise form of the inequality.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relationship between energy and momentum more directly. So, if I have Δp, then ΔE is roughly (Δp)^2/(2m). Because E = p²/(2m), so the uncertainty ΔE would be approximately (Δp)^2/(2m). 

Wait, but I need to be careful here. Since E is a function of p, the uncertainty in E is the derivative of E with respect to p multiplied by Δp. The derivative of p²/(2m) with respect to p is p/m.
