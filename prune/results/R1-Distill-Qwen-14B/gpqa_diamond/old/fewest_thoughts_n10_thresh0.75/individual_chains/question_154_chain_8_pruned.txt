Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about identifying an unknown compound using spectral data. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The question gives mass, IR, and 1H NMR data. The options are four different compounds. I'll have to match the spectral data to each possibility.

Starting with the mass spectrometry. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and another peak at 158 (32%). Hmm, the molecular ion is the molecular weight, so the compound's molecular weight is 156. The peak at 158 is 32% abundance. Could that be a fragment or an isotopic peak? Wait, molecular weight peaks usually are the M+ something. For isotopes, common ones are chlorine (about 35Cl, 37Cl) and maybe bromine. Let me calculate. Let's see: if the M is 156, and there's an M+2 at 158, that suggests two chlorine atoms, because Cl has a doublet with ~3:1 ratio. Wait, but the abundance here is 32%, which is like 32% of the M+2. Wait, the natural abundance of Cl is about 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So, if the molecule has one Cl, the M and M+2 would be roughly in a 3:1 ratio. But wait, the options don't all have Cl. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. Chlorine is present.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid with Cl at the para position. So Cl is present.

C) Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be ClCOO-phenyl? Or maybe O-phenyl chloroformate. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So that has Cl, O, CO, and Ph.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl in ortho position, benzoic acid.

So all options except maybe C have Cl. Wait, option C: phenyl chloroformate would have Cl and perhaps another O. So let me think about the mass.

Wait, the M is 156. Let's compute the molecular weights of the options.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl at position 3, OH at 2, and a benzaldehyde (CHO at position 1? Let me visualize. Benzene ring with CHO, Cl, and OH groups. So molecular formula would be C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. Sum: 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, +32=156.5. So molecular weight is about 156.5. That matches the M peak at 156. But wait, the M is at 156, so that's possible. The M+2 would be 158, which is the 32% peak. That makes sense if there's a Cl in the molecule, because Cl has an isotope at 37 (about 25% abundance). So one Cl would give M and M+2 in a 3:1 ratio, but if there are two Cls, it's more complicated. Wait, but the options don't have two Cls except perhaps option C? Let me check each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A? Wait, benzoic acid is C6H5
