Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The system's state at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So that's a 3x1 vector. The observable is represented by matrix P, which has specific elements. I need to find the probability that measuring this observable gives 0.

Hmm, right. In quantum mechanics, the observable is represented by an operator, and the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is related to the eigenvectors corresponding to that eigenvalue.

Wait, but wait. The observable P is given here. So first, I think I need to find the eigenvalues of P because those are the possible outcomes when we measure the system. The probability of getting a specific eigenvalue is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between the state vector and the corresponding eigenvector.

But wait, the matrix P is given as:

First row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)
Second row: (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2))
Third row: (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0)

So P looks like a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

I should find the eigenvalues of this matrix. Because the possible measurement outcomes are the eigenvalues. So to find the probability that the measurement yields 0, I need to find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, and then compute the probability.

Alternatively, perhaps I can approach this differently. The state vector is |ψ> = [-1, 2, 1]^T. Then, the probability of measuring 0 is |<e_i | ψ>|², where |e_i> is the eigenvector of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but maybe I should first find the eigenvalues of P. Let's try to find the eigenvalues.

The eigenvalues are found by solving det(P - λ I) = 0.

So let me
