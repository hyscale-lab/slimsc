Okay, so I've got this question about quasars and the Lambda-CDM model, and I'm supposed to figure out the comoving distance of a quasar based on some observations. Hmm, let's see.

First, I remember that quasars can emit light across different wavelengths, and sometimes their emission lines are broad or have specific features. The question mentions a peak at 790 nm in the near infrared and optical spectrum, and the flux drops at shorter wavelengths. Wait, that makes me think of something like a Lyman break. Oh right! The Lyman limit is around 91 nm, but when you look at quasars, you sometimes see a drop in flux below a certain wavelength because that's where the Lyman series ends. But wait, the peak here is at 790 nm, which is in the near infrared, so maybe it's a different kind of break or just the peak of emission.

Wait, no, wait. The Lyman break is when the flux drops sharply below a certain wavelength because that's where the hydrogen in the quasar's vicinity (like the intergalactic medium) absorbs the light. So if the quasar's light is emitted at certain wavelengths, but when it travels through the universe, the intergalactic medium (like the IGM) at lower redshifts can absorb wavelengths below the Lyman limit (91 nm). So the observed drop would indicate that. But in this case, the peak is at 790 nm, and flux drops below that. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, 790 nm is in the near infrared. Let me think about the rest frame of the quasar. If the observed wavelength is longer than emitted because of redshift, then the emitted wavelength could be shorter. Suppose the peak is at 790 nm in the observed frame. If the quasar is at high redshift, then the emitted wavelength would have been shorter. For example, if the emitted wavelength was say 400 nm (violet), and redshifted to 790 nm, that would imply a redshift z such that 400*(1+z)=790. So z=(790/400)-1 â‰ˆ 1.975. Hmm, that's a high redshift, but maybe possible.

Wait, but the problem is about the comoving distance. I remember that the comoving distance is related to the look
