Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that the operator Ay is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as c multiplied by S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. The matrix S has its first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So, let me write that down:

Ay = c * S

And S is:
[ 0  -i ]
[ i   0 ]

So first, I should probably compute what Ay looks like. Let's substitute c = h/(4π) into Ay. So each element of S will be multiplied by c.

So Ay becomes:
[ 0, -i*(h/(4π)) ]
[ i*(h/(4π)), 0 ]

Wait, but when I'm looking for eigenvalues, maybe I should just work with the matrix S first and then scale the eigenvalues by c. Because if I find the eigenvalues of S, then multiply each by c, I'll get the eigenvalues of Ay.

So first, find the eigenvalues of S. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(S - λ I) = 0.

Matrix S:
[0   -i ]
[i    0 ]

So the matrix S - λ I is:
[-λ   -i ]
[i    -λ ]

The determinant is (-λ)(-λ) - (-i)(i) = λ² - (i * i) → but wait, (-i)(i) is (-i^2) because you have a negative sign from the determinant. Let me compute that again:

The determinant is (0 - λ)(0 - λ) - (-i)(i) → λ² - (i*(-i)) → because the off-diagonal elements are -i and i.

Wait, the product of the off-diagonal elements is (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is λ² - (1) = 0 → λ² = 1 → λ = ±1.

Wait, is that right? So the eigenvalues of S are 1 and -1.

Then, the eigenvalues of Ay are c * λ, since Ay = c * S. So c= h/(4π) → so the eigenvalues a are (h/(4π)) * 1 and (h/(4π)) * (-1). So a = ±h/(4π).

Wait, but that's just the eigenvalues. The options given in the choices are a bit different.

Looking at the options, option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh, and real parts ±h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues are purely real here,
