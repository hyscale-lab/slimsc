Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem to solve. The question is about the synthesis of a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to visualize the structure. So, ethan-1-one is acetone, right? So, the structure would have a ketone group (C=O) attached to a benzene ring. The benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. One substituent is a bromine (Br), and the other is a nitro group (NO2). Wait, but wait, the numbering might be a bit tricky. Let me think: in benzene, the substituents could be at positions 3 and 5, which are meta to each other. So, the substituents are on adjacent carbons in a way that they are across from each other.

So, the benzene ring has substituents at positions 3 and 5. Let me imagine the ring: if the ketone is at position 1, then substituents are at 3 and 5. So, the ketone is on one carbon, and Br and NO2 are on the adjacent carbons. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, maybe the ketone is attached to the benzene at the 1 position, and then the substituents are at 3 and 5 relative to that. So, the benzene ring would have the ketone at position 1, Br at 3, and NO2 at 5. So, they're all in a line? Or maybe it's a para arrangement? No, 3 and 5 are meta to each other relative to position 1.

So, thinking about the synthetic pathway. Starting with benzene, what reactions would lead to this product?

The target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the benzene ring is connected to a ketone (acetone group), and has Br and NO2 groups at positions 3 and 5. So, the substituents on the benzene are in the meta positions relative to the ketone.

I think the approach here is to figure out the order of functional group substitutions. Since benzene can undergo
