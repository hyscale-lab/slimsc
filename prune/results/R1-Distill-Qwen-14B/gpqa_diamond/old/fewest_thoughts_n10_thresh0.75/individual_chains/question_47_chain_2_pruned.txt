Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me see what I can figure out.

First, let me look at the options. There are four compounds: A, B, C, and D. I'll need to analyze each one based on the spectral data provided.

Starting with the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 and 3325 cm-1, which are medium to strong intensity. These are probably N-H stretches. For amines or amides. Then, there's a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is a good indicator of a carbonyl group (C=O). So, the compound likely has either an amide, ester, ketone, or maybe a carboxylic acid group. But wait, a carboxylic acid's O-H stretch would show up around 2500-3300, but the IR here doesn't mention that. So maybe it's an amide or ester.

Now, looking at the NMR. Let's break it down.

The 1H NMR shows several signals:
- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. This looks like a CH2CH3 group, because triplets are often from CH3 next to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlets can be from -NH- groups, maybe an amine or amide. Or maybe an OCH2 group in an ester or something else, but why broad? Maybe if it's near an electronegative group or split into a singlet due to coupling.
- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet with 2H – that's likely another CH2 group. Since the triplet at 1.20 is 3H, perhaps these are ethyl groups. For example, in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would give a quartet for the OCH2 and triplet for CH3. But wait, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit upfield for an OCH2. Alternatively, maybe it's part of an amide structure. Hmm, not so sure yet.
- 7.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. And 8.0 ppm, doublet (d), 2H. These are aromatic protons. Two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene ring. Because in para substitution, the two protons on adjacent carbons are each equivalent, and each couples with only one neighboring proton, giving doublets. So the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene group.

Putting this together, the compound has a para-substituted benzene ring, an ethyl group (as per the triplet and quartet), and a carbonyl group (from IR). Also, the N-H stretch suggests an amide or something with an amine group.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzamide with ethoxy group at position 3. Wait, but benzamide is an amide, so the carbonyl is present. The ethoxy would be an OCH2CH3. The ethoxy group in the meta position would give a certain NMR. Let me think: the ethoxy group's CH2 would give a quartet around δ4.5? Or maybe δ4.0? Wait, the ethoxy in benzamide would be attached to the oxygen, so the OCH2CH3. The CH3 would be triplet at around 1.2, and the OCH2 would be quartet around 4.5. Oh wait, in OCH2CH3, the OCH2 is normally around 4.0-4.3. But the quartet in the NMR is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe that's possible.

The NMR also has a broad singlet at 4.0. For 3-ethoxybenzamide, the OCH2CH3 would give a quartet around 4.3 (maybe 4.5 in this case) and a triplet at 1.2. But where is the amide's NH? In the IR, the N-H is present. So the amide would have an NH group, which would show up in the NMR as a broad peak. Wait
