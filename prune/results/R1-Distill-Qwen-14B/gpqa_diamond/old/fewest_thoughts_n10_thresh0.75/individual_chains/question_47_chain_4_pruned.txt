Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem where I have to identify a compound based on its spectral data. The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me go through the data step by step.

First, looking at the IR data. The peaks are at 3420 cm-1 and 3325 cm-1. I remember that these regions usually correspond to N-H or O-H stretches. Since the compound has a molecular formula with an N and O2, it's probably an amide or something similar. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a key indicator. That's in the range of a carbonyl group, like an ester or amide. So, maybe it's an amide or a formamide.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let me note down the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: That's usually a methyl group attached to something, like an ethyl group. Ethyl groups typically show up around 1.2 ppm as a triplet because of the neighboring CH2.
- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H: Broad singlet suggests some exchange, maybe from an amide's NH2 group. But wait, it's 2H. Hmm, could it be an OCH2 group? Or maybe an N-H that's in an amine or amide?
- 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H: Quartet with 2H. That's another part of an ethyl group. The quartet at 4.5 suggests it's next to an oxygen, like an OCH2CH3. So, maybe an ester group? Because esters have OCH2CH3, which would show up as a quartet around 4.5 ppm.
- 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, doublets each integrating to 2H: These are likely aromatic protons. The doublets suggest two sets of equivalent aromatic protons. Perhaps a para-substituted benzene ring. The lower chemical shift (7.0 ppm) might be next to an electron-withdrawing group, but the higher (8.0) suggests something more de-shielded, maybe next to a carbonyl or an amino group.

Putting this together, I'm thinking of a structure that has an ethyl group (from the triplet and quartet in NMR) attached to something else. The IR suggests a carbonyl, so maybe an ester or amide. Let's consider the options.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure would be benzamide (so a CONH2 group) with an ethoxy at position 3. The IR has the carbonyl from the amide. The NMR would have the ethoxy group (OCH2CH3) which would be a quartet around 4.5 and the triplet at 1.2. But the amide's NH would show up as broad signals. Wait, in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet of 2H, but if it's an amide, the NH would be a broad peak, possibly as a singlet if it's a secondary amide. Hmm, but maybe in this case, it's split into two peaks but as a singlet. Not sure yet.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide has a CONH2 group. The ethoxy would be at the para position. The IR has the carbonyl. The NMR would have the ethoxy as a quartet and triplet. The NH would appear as a broad peak, but in the data, there's a quartet at 4.5, triplet at 1.2, and possibly the NH as the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm. But wait, the molecular formula of formamide would fit. Let me check the formula: ethoxy is OCH2CH3, so the benzene ring is C6H4, plus the formamide group (CONH2) would add CNO, but wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate: benzene (C6), ethoxy (C2H5O), formamide is O=C(NH2) so that's O, N. Wait, wait, the formula for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be C6H4-OCH2CH3 attached to HCONH2? Wait, no, formamide is HCONHR, but in this case, it's HCONHR where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. Let me count the carbons: benzene (6) + ethoxy (2) + formamide (CO plus H and NH2). So total carbons: 6 + 2 + 1 (from CO) = 9? Wait, wait, the structure would be O=C(NH2)-O-C6H4-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no, the formamide is HCONR2. Wait, no, formamide is HCONHR'. So for N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide, it's HCON(Ph-OEt). So the formula would be C6H5-OCH2CH3 connected to HCONH. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, maybe
