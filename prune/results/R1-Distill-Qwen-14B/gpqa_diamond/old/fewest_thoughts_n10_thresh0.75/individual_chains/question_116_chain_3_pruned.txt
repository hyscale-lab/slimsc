Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let's see what the question says. Hmm, it's about NMR spectroscopy and some reactions. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question starts with Compound A. Its proton NMR shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. A triplet means each proton has two neighboring protons, so maybe something like a CH2CH3 group? Because the splitting for a triplet usually comes from two neighboring groups, like in ethyl groups.

Wait, the triplet is at 0.9 ppm. That's typical for a CH2CH3 group because the terminal methyl protons are usually around 0.9-1.0 ppm. So 6H in a triplet suggests maybe two ethyl groups or maybe a neopentyl-type structure? Or perhaps it's a diethyl group attached to something else.

The quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H: quartet implies three neighboring protons. Wait, no, quartet is splitting into four peaks. So each proton is next to three others. Oh wait, no, splitting is based on neighboring protons. If a proton is next to n+1 peaks, so quartet (four peaks) would mean each proton is next to three others. So for a quartet, the neighboring group has three protons. So maybe a CH2CH2CH3 situation? Or perhaps a group where the adjacent CH2 has two protons each.

Wait, 4H in a quartet. Hmm. Let's think: if the quartet comes from a CH2 group that's next to another CH2. Because each proton in a CH2 would see two neighboring protons (on the adjacent CH2), which would split into a triplet. Wait, no. Wait, if we have a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, each H in the first CH2 would be next to two Hs on the adjacent CH2. So each H would split into a triplet. That would make the quartet? Wait, no, I'm getting this confused. Let's think again.

Wait, the quartet is for 4H. So maybe each of those four Hs is split by a group with two Hs. Because a quartet (
