Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics. Hmm, okay, let's see. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles when a pion decays into a muon and a neutrino. The pion is at rest, so that should simplify things a bit.

Okay, the given reaction is Pi(+) â†’ mu(+) + nu. The rest mass of Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV. I remember that neutrinos are super light, but I think for these kinds of problems, we often assume their rest mass is negligible compared to the other particles. So maybe I can treat the neutrino as having zero rest mass, or at least that's the usual approximation.

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the kinetic energies of the product particles. So, when a particle at rest decays, the total momentum should be zero, right? Because initial momentum is zero, so the momenta of the products must cancel each other out. That means the muon and the neutrino have equal and opposite momenta. So their energies should be related in a certain way.

Let me think about conservation of energy and momentum here. The total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion since it's stationary. So, that's 139.6 MeV. After decay, the total energy should be the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino.

The muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so its energy will be its rest energy plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino, being massless, has energy equal to its kinetic energy (since E = pc for massless particles). But wait, actually, neutrinos do have mass, but in many problems, especially at the level of this question, their masses are considered negligible. So for this problem, I'll proceed under that assumption.

But wait, maybe the neutrino's rest mass isn't zero? Hmmm. Because in reality, neutrinos do have mass, but it's extremely small. For this problem, maybe it's better to consider that the neutrino's rest mass is zero. Otherwise, the problem would have given us its mass, I think
