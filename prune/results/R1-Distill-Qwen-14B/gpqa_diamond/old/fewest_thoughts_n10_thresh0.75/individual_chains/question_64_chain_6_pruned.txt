Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

Alright, the setup is an equimolar mixture of salts A and B weighing 7.20 grams. They're heated to 200°C without air. From this heating, only a mixture of gases is formed. These gases are passed through three tubes: the first filled with anhydrous Mg(ClO4)2, the second with Ca(OH)2 solution, and the third with red-hot copper. The results are that tube 1 gains 3.60g, tube 3 gains 0.80g, and tube 2's weight doesn't change. Also, 2.24 liters of gas C remain at standard temp and pressure.

The question is to find the total number of all atoms in salts A and B. The options are numbers like 13,15,17,19.

Hmm. So, first, I think I need to figure out what's happening in each of these tubes. Let's break it down.

The first tube has Mg(ClO4)2, which is a strong desiccant. It probably absorbs water. So if the gases passed through it caused tube 1 to gain 3.6g, that suggests water was absorbed. So the gas mixture must have contained water vapor, which was removed here.

The second tube is Ca(OH)2 solution. Since it's a solution, maybe it's for absorbing CO2. Because if the gas is passed through a Ca(OH)2 solution, CO2 would react, but if the weight didn't change, that suggests no CO2 was present. Alternatively, the solution could be used to absorb something else, but since the weight didn't change, maybe the gas that would react was already removed in the first tube.

The third tube uses red-hot copper, which I think is for absorbing CO. Copper can react with CO at high temperatures, producing CO2 and Cu. So if the gas mixture had CO, it would be absorbed here, and the increase of 0.8g would correspond to the mass gained from CO. 

Wait, but the mass increase in tube 3 is 0.8g. Let me think: the reaction is 2CO + Cu → 2CuO + C (I might have to check the balanced equation). Wait, no, let me write the correct equation. The reaction of CO with copper at high temperature is:

2CO + Cu → CuO + C. Wait, that's not balanced. Let me balance it.

The correct reaction is:

2 Cu + CO → 2 CuO + C? Let me balance it properly. 

Each CO is CO, so 2 Cu + CO → 2 CuO + C.

Wait, let's count the atoms. Left: 2 Cu, 1 C, 1 O. Right: 2 CuO has 2 Cu, 2 O, and C from C. So, 2 CuO is 2 Cu, 2 O, and the C is from CO. Hmm, perhaps I should write it as:

CO + Cu → CuO + C (but that's not balanced for O). Alternatively, maybe it's 2CO + Cu → 2CuO + C. Let me check:

Left: 2 C, 2 O, 1 Cu.
Right: 2 CuO has 2 Cu, 2 O, and C. So 2 CuO is 2 O, and C is C. So 2 CO is 2 C, 2 O. So the equation:

2 CO + Cu → 2 CuO + C.

Yes, because left has 2 C, 2 O, and 1 Cu. Right has 2 Cu (from CuO), 2 O (from CuO), and 1 C. So the equation is balanced. So each mole of CO would produce, in this reaction, 1 mole of CuO (since 2 CO gives 2 CuO?), wait no, 2 CO gives 2 CuO. So per mole of CO, it's 1 CuO. So the mass gain in tube 3 would be the mass of CuO formed.

Wait, but the mass of CuO formed is from CO and Cu. Let me think about the mass change. Each mole of CO would react to form CuO and C. So for each mole of CO, we're adding the mass of CuO minus the mass of CO. So the increase in mass is (mass of CuO) - (mass of CO). Because CO is a gas and gets consumed, while CuO is a solid produced.

Wait, the mass gained in the tube is the mass of the product formed minus the mass of the reactant consumed. So for each mole of CO consumed, 1 mole of CuO is formed. The mass of CuO is 80 g/mol (Cu is 63.55, O is 16, approx 63.55 +16 = 79.55, which I'll approximate as 80). CO is 28 g/mol. So the mass gained per mole of CO is (80 - (CO's molar mass)) but wait, let me think about the stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction is 2 CO + Cu → 2 CuO + C.

So for 2 moles of CO,
