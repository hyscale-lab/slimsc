Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because buffer solutions can be a bit tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. The solution has 200.00 cm³ (which is 0.2 liters) and contains 1.00 g each of KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. The temperatures are at 25°C, which is standard, so I think activity coefficients are probably assumed to be 1.

First, I remember that orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) come from the deprotonation of H3PO4. But wait, in this solution, we have two different potassium phosphate salts. Let me think: KH2PO4 is potassium hydrogen phosphate, which I think dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^- (so that's the dihydrogen phosphate ion). Then Na2HPO4·2H2O is sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (hydrogen phosphate ion).

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I remember that this kind of mixture forms a buffer solution. Buffer solutions are governed by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which relates the pH of the solution to the pKa and the ratio of the concentrations of the conjugate base and acid.

Wait, but what is the specific pH here? Or is the question about the concentration of PO4^3-? Hmm. Oh, wait, I think I might have misread. The question is about orthophosphate, which is PO4^3-, but wait, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-. Oh wait, but PO4^3- is the fully deprotonated form, which in solution is not very common. So, maybe the problem is actually about the concentration of HPO4^2- or H2PO4^-? Or perhaps considering the dissociation further.

Wait, I need to clarify. The problem asks for orthophosphate ions. Wait, no, orthophosphate is H3PO4. But in solution, it's more about the different deprotonated forms. Wait, perhaps in the context of this problem, the orthophosphate ion is referring to the HPO4^2- or PO4^3-? I'm a bit confused now.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the phosphate equilibria. H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, so it can lose three protons:

H3PO4 ↔ H+ + H2PO4^- (Ka1 = 7.5e-3)
H2PO4^- ↔ H+ + HPO4^2- (Ka2 = 6.2e-8)
HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12)

So, the first dissociation is the strongest (highest Ka1), then Ka2 is much smaller, and Ka3 is super tiny.

In the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These two are conjugate acid-base pairs for the second dissociation (Ka2), right? Because H2PO4^- can donate a proton to become HPO4^2- (as per the second equation).

So, the buffer here is between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, with the Ka2 of 6.2e-8. So the pH of the solution would be determined by this buffer system.

Wait, but the question is about orthophosphate ions. Hmm, orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, PO4^3-. But in the solution provided, the phosphate species are H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, not PO4^3-. So how much PO4^3- is present?

But wait, given that the solution has both H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, perhaps some of them can further dissociate. Since PO4^3- is the result of the third dissociation of HPO4^2-.

So, HPO4^2- can lose a proton to become PO4^3- (Ka3 = 1.8e-12). So the PO4^3- concentration would be very small because Ka3 is so tiny.

So, to find the concentration of PO4^3- in the solution, I might need to consider the third dissociation.

But wait, the problem is about the concentration of orthophosphate ions. Orthophosphate is the fully deprotonated form, which is PO4^3-. So I need to find [PO4^3-].

But the solution has H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- as the main species. So, how much of each is present, and how much of each can dissociate further?

Wait, but the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, so the pH is around pKa2. Let me compute pKa2 first. pKa2 = -log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.21 (since log(6.2) is about 0.79, and 10^7.21 ≈ 6.2e7, wait no, wait 6.2e-8 is 6.2 x 10^-8, so pKa2 is 7.21? Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly.

Ka2 = 6.2e-8. So pKa2 = log(1/(6.2e-8)) = log(1/(6.2)) + 7. Since 6.2 is about 10^0.79, so 1/6.2 is ~1.6e-1, so log(1.6e-1) is about -0.79. So pKa2 = 7.79? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the pKa is -log(Ka). So for Ka2=6.2e-8, log(6.2e-8) is log(6.2) + log(1e-8) = 0.7924 -8 = -7.2076. So pKa2 is 7.2076, approximately 7.21.

So the pH of the solution is around pKa2 because it's a buffer of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-.

Wait, but to find the exact pH, I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The equation is pH = pKa + log([base]/[acid]). In this case, the base is HPO4^2- and the acid is H2PO4^-.

So I need to find the concentrations of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- in the solution.

First, let's calculate the moles of each salt.

For KH2PO4: Mw is 136.09 g/mol. Moles = mass / Mw = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007336 mol.

For Na2HPO4·2H2O: Mw is 177.99 g/mol. Moles = 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005617 mol.

So, each contributes their respective ions. KH2PO4 dissociates into K+ and H2PO4^-. So moles of H2PO4^- from KH2PO4: 0.007336 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-. So moles of HPO4^2- from Na2HPO4: 0.005617 mol.

So in the solution, [H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 mol / 0.2 L = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 mol / 0.2 L = 0.028085 M.

So the ratio [base]/[acid] is (0.028085) / (0.03668) ≈ 0.766.

So, pH = pKa2 + log(0.766) ≈ 7.21 + log(0.766). Log(0.766) is about -0.114 (since 10^(-0.114) ≈ 0.766). So pH ≈7.21 -0.114 ≈7.096.

So pH is approximately 7.10.

Now, to find the concentration of PO4^3-, which comes from the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ↔ H+ + PO4^3-.

The Ka3 is 1.8e-12, and the pH is ~7.10.

So, Ka3 = [H+][PO4^3-] / [HPO4^2-].

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+].

But wait, [H+] can be found from the pH. pH is 7.10, so [H+] = 10^-7.1 ≈ 7.94e-8 M.

So, plugging in the numbers:

[PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 × 0.028085) / 7.94e-8.

Wait, let me compute that.

First, numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 ≈ 5.055e-14.

Denominator: 7.94e-8.

So 5.055e-14 / 7.94e-8 ≈ 6.37e-7 M.

Wait, that's about 6.37e-7 M.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 6.24x10^-7 M

Option B)5.48x10^-7 M

Option C)2.81x10^-7 M

Option D)3.97x10^-7 M

So my calculation gives about 6.37e-7, but the closest option is A)6.24e-7. Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me re-calculate the exact numbers.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = approx 1/136.09 ≈0.007336 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 1/177.99 ≈0.005617 mol.

Volume is 0.2 L.

So [H2PO4^-] = 0.007336 / 0.2 = 0.03668 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.005617 / 0.2 = 0.028085 M.

So, the ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] = 0.028085 / 0.03668 ≈ 0.766.

So, pH = pKa2 + log(0.766) = ~7.21 + (-0.114) ≈7.096.

So [H+] = 10^-7.096 ≈ 7.943e-8 M.

Now, for PO4^3-: [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028085) / 7.943e-8.

Let me compute 1.8e-12 * 0.028085 = (1.8 * 0.028085) * 1e-12 = 0.050553 * 1e-12 =5.0553e-14.

Divide by 7.943e-8: 5.0553e-14 / 7.943e-8 = (5.0553 / 7.943) * 1e-6.

5.0553 / 7.943 ≈ 0.6366.

So 0.6366e-6 = 6.366e-7 M.

Hmm, that's about 6.37e-7 M.

But the options don't have exactly that. The closest is option A:6.24e-7.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me recalculate the moles precisely.

Moles of KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol = 1 / 136.09 = approximately 0.0073367 mol.

Moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g /177.99 g/mol = 1/177.99 ≈ 0.0056172 mol.

So, [H2PO4^-] = 0.0073367 / 0.2 = 0.0366835 M.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.0056172 /0.2 = 0.028086 M.

So, the ratio is 0.028086 / 0.0366835 = approximately 0.766.

pH = pKa2 + log(0.766).

pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8) = 7.2076.

log(0.766) is approximately -0.114.

So pH ≈7.2076 -0.114 =7.0936.

[H+]=10^(-7.0936)= let's compute that precisely.

10^(-7.0936) = 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.0936) = 1e-7 * 0.871 ≈ 8.71e-8 M.

Wait, because 10^(-0.0936)= approx 0.871. Let me compute it more accurately: 10^(-0.0936) = e^(ln(10)*(-0.0936)) ≈ e^(-0.216) ≈ 0.806. Wait, maybe I should use more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use a calculator-like approach.

log(0.766) = ?

Well, I know that log(0.7) is -0.1549, log(0.75)= -0.1249, log(0.76) is about -0.117.

Wait, 0.766 is about 0.766. Let me compute this more precisely.

log(0.766) = ?

Let me use linear approximation between known values.

log(0.76) = approx -0.117.

log(0.77) = let's compute it.

Let me think, 10^(-0.12) is about 0.758. Wait, 10^(-0.12)= 10^(-0.1)*10^(-0.02)= 0.794 * 0.955 ≈ 0.758.

Hmm, maybe better to use a calculator function.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a more precise approach.

But perhaps I'll proceed with [H+] as approximately 8.71e-8 M.

Wait, no, wait, 10^-7.0936 is 7.0936 is 7 + 0.0936.

So 10^(-7) = 1e-7.

10^(-0.0936)= let me compute this.

We can use the Taylor series for 10^x around x=0:

10^x ≈ 1 + x * ln(10) + (x^2 (ln(10))^2)/2.

But perhaps an easier approach is to compute it as e^(x ln(10)).

So x= -0.0936.

ln(10)≈2.302585.

So,

e^(-0.0936 * 2.302585) = e^(-0.2155).

e^(-0.2155) ≈ 1 - 0.2155 + (0.2155)^2/2 - (0.2155)^3/6.

0.2155^2 = ~0.04643, so 0.04643/2 = 0.023215.

0.2155^3 ≈ ~0.00996, so 0.00996 /6 ≈ 0.00166.

So,

1 -0.2155 = 0.7845.

+0.023215 → 0.8077.

-0.00166 → 0.8060.

So, e^(-0.2155) ≈ 0.806.

So 10^(-0.0936) ≈ 0.806.

So [H+] = 1e-7 * 0.806 ≈ 8.06e-8 M.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's 7.94e-8, but this is more precise. So 8.06e-8.

So, now, [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 × [HPO4^2-]) / [H+] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028086) / (8.06e-8).

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028086 = 5.05548e-14.

Denominator: 8.06e-8.

So 5.05548e-14 / 8.06e-8 = (5.05548 /8.06) * 1e-6.

5.05548 /8.06 ≈ 0.6273.

So 0.6273e-6 = 6.273e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.27e-7.

Looking at the options, option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait a moment. I think I might have made a mistake in the calculation of [HPO4^2-].

Wait, the formula for Na2HPO4·2H2O is Na2(HPO4)·2H2O. So when it dissolves, it dissociates into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2-, and the 2H2O are just water molecules. So the moles of HPO4^2- would be the same as the moles of the salt, which is 0.005617 mol.

Yes, that's correct.

Similarly, KH2PO4 gives 1 mole of H2PO4^- per mole of the salt.

So the [HPO4^2-] is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of [H+] for more accuracy.

pH is 7.0936, so [H+] = 10^-7.0936.

Let me compute this precisely.

Compute 10^(-7.0936).

Since 7.0936 = 7 + 0.0936.

So, 10^7.0936 = 10^7 * 10^0.0936.

10^0.0936: Let's compute this.

log(1.24) is approximately 0.0936 because 10^0.0936 ≈1.24.

Wait, 10^0.09 = approx 1.23, so 0.0936 would be around 1.24.

So 10^0.0936 ≈1.24.

So 10^7.0936 = 1.24e7.

So 10^-7.0936 = 1/(1.24e7) ≈8.0645e-8 M. So [H+] ≈8.0645e-8.

So, now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.028086) / 8.0645e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.028086 = 5.05548e-14.

Divide by 8.0645e-8: 5.05548e-14 / 8.0645e-8 = (5.05548 /8.0645) *1e-6.

5.05548 /8.0645 ≈0.6273.

So, [PO4^3-] ≈0.6273e-6 =6.273e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.27e-7. The option A is 6.24e-7, which is very close. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I account for all sources of PO4^3-? Because the solution contains HPO4^2- which can further dissociate into PO4^3-. But the problem is, that's the only source. So, yes.

But perhaps another consideration: the solution might have some contribution from H2PO4^- dissociating all the way to PO4^3-, but that's unlikely because the first dissociation is much stronger, and the subsequent ones are much weaker. So, the contribution from H2PO4^- to PO4^3- would be negligible compared to what comes from HPO4^2-.

So, I think the calculation is correct. So the answer is option A.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the dissociation of phosphate species in the given buffer system. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH₂PO₄ (Mw = 136.09 g/mol) and 1.00 g of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O (Mw = 177.99 g/mol) in 200.00 cm³ (0.2 L). 

### Step 1: Calculate moles of phosphate species
- **KH₂PO₄ dissociates into H₂PO₄⁻**:  
  Moles of KH₂PO₄ = \( \frac{1.00}{136.09} \approx 0.007336 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Thus, moles of H₂PO₄⁻ = 0.007336 mol.

- **Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O dissociates into HPO₄²⁻**:  
  Moles of Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O = \( \frac{1.00}{177.99} \approx 0.005617 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Thus, moles of HPO₄²⁻ = 0.005617 mol.

### Step 2: Calculate concentrations of H₂PO₄⁻ and HPO₄²⁻
- **[H₂PO₄⁻]** = \( \frac{0.007336}{0.2} \approx 0.03668 \, \text{M} \).  
- **[HPO₄²⁻]** = \( \frac{0.005617}{0.2} \approx 0.028085 \, \text{M} \).

### Step 3: Determine pH of the buffer
The buffer system consists of H₂PO₄⁻ (acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (base), with \( \text{Ka}_2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8} \). Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa}_2 + \log \left( \frac{[\text{base}]}{[\text{acid}]} \right),
\]
where \( \text{pKa}_2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.21 \).  
Substituting the concentrations:  
\[
\text{pH} = 7.21 + \log \left( \frac{0.028085}{0.03668} \right).
\]
The ratio \( \frac{0.028085}{0.03668} \approx 0.766 \), and \( \log(0.766) \approx -0.114 \).  
Thus,  
\[
\text{pH} \approx 7.21 - 0.114 = 7.096.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate [PO₄³⁻] from the third dissociation
The third dissociation is:  
\[
\text{HPO₄²⁻} \leftrightarrow \text{H}^+ + \text{PO₄³⁻}, \quad \text{Ka}_3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}.
\]
Using the equilibrium expression:  
\[
\text{Ka}_3 = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{PO₄³⁻}]}{[\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}.
\]
Rearranging for \( [\text{PO₄³⁻}] \):  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{\text{Ka}_3 \cdot [\text{HPO₄²⁻}]}{[\text{H}^+]}.
\]
From the pH, \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.096} \approx 8.06 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M} \). Substituting values:  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028085)}{8.06 \times 10^{-8}}.
\]
- Numerator: \( (1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.028085) \approx 5.055 \times 10^{-14} \).  
- Denominator: \( 8.06 \times 10^{-8} \).  
Thus,  
\[
[\text{PO₄³⁻}] = \frac{5.055 \times 10^{-14}}{8.06 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.27 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated concentration of \( \text{PO₄³⁻} \) is approximately \( 6.27 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which is closest to option **A) 6.24 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}**.

Answer: A
