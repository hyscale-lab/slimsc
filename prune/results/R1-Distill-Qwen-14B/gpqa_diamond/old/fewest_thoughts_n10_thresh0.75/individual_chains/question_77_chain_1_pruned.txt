Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because these Cope rearrangement questions can get tricky. But let me take it step by step.

The question has two parts, A and B. I'll need to figure out the major products for each. Let's start with part A.

Part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. And the reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm. BuLi is a strong base, usually used for deprotonation. Wait, but in what context? Oh, wait, the starting molecule has an ether group. The structure is a benzene ring attached to an (OCH2CH2CH(CH3)2) group? Or wait, let me draw it out.

Wait, the starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. So, the benzene has a substituent that's an oxygen connected to a methyl group (OCH2-), and the other end of the oxygen is connected to a 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl group. Let me write that structure. The O connects to a CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH2? Wait, no. Let me think. 3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl: the butenyl has four carbons, with a double bond from 2 to 3. So structure is CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-, but wait, the substituent is 1-yl, so the chain starts from the first carbon. Wait, but but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, wait, the numbering is a bit confusing. Let me get this right. But-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2-CH2-? No, but the substituent is 3-methyl. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH
