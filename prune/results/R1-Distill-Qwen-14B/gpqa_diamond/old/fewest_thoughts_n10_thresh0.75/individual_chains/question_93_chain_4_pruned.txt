Okay, so I've got this question about qPCR, and I'm a bit rusty on the details, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand.

The scientist is making a calibration curve for qPCR. He used a positive control with known copy numbers and did serial dilutions. There are three technical replicates for each dilution. The efficiency is 100%, R² is 1, and the slope is -3.3. Hmm, I remember that in qPCR, the efficiency affects the calculation. Perfect efficiency (100%) would mean each cycle doubles the target, so the efficiency formula would be 100% = (2^(-1/slope)) -1. Wait, no, the slope is related to efficiency. Wait, the formula for efficiency E is E = 100% - (100% / (1 - (1/slope))). Or was it the other way around? No, wait, I think the formula is E = (10^( (slope)/-1 )) -1, or something like that. Alternatively, another approach: for a two-fold dilution, the change in Ct should be approximately -3.32 cycles because of the log base 2 in the equation Ct = (log2(N0)) + intercept, and diluting by ten each time would change the copies by a factor of 10, which is 2^3.32 (since 10 ≈ 2^3.32).

So the slope given is -3.3. Let's compute the expected efficiency. The slope in a qPCR calibration is related to the efficiency. The equation for qPCR is Ct = (log2(N0) ) + intercept. The slope (m) is the change in Ct per log change in concentration. For a 10-fold dilution, the log10 change is 1. The change in Ct (ΔCt) is m * log10(10) = m *1. So ΔCt = -3.3, which is approximately the expected change when you dilute by 10. Because with each 10-fold dilution, the Ct should increase by
