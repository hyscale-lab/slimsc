Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm trying to figure out which two compounds are in the mixture. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that the mixture is a 1:1 ratio of two aromatic compounds with the formula C10H14. The NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three singlets at 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the integration ratios can give clues about the structure.

Let me look at the aromatic region first. Two singlets at around 6.7 ppm. Singlets usually mean no neighboring protons. In aromatic compounds, that would imply that the protons are not adjacent to any others. So maybe each of these signals corresponds to equivalent protons in symmetrical positions.

Wait, the molecular formula is C10H14. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is one ring or double bond. For C10H14: each molecule has (2*10 +2 -14)/2 = (22-14)/2=4. So four degrees; that could be one benzene ring (3 degrees) plus one double bond or another ring. But since we're dealing with aromatic compounds, it's likely one benzene ring (3 degrees) and another double bond, or maybe another ring. Wait, no, benzene is six-membered with three double bonds, so the ring itself accounts for three degrees. So the remaining is one more degree, which could be a double bond or another ring.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating that. The compounds are all tetramethylbenzenes except one which is diethyl. So each is a benzene ring with substituents. Let me think about the options.

The options are four compounds:

1. 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene
2. 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3. 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4. 1,4-diethylbenzene

Looking at these, options 1,2,3 are all tetramethyl, so their molecular formula would be C10H14? Wait, benzene is C6H6. Each
