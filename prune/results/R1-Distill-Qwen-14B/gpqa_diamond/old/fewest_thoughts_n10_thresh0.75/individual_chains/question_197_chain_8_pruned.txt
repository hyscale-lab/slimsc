Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let me take it step by step. The question is about identifying a product formed when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'll need to figure out what Compound X is first using the given IR and NMR data, then determine the reaction.

First, let me look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400â€“2500 cm-1, which probably indicates an O-H stretch or maybe an N-H, but more likely O-H since the other peaks suggest something else. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a carbonyl group. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might be aromatic C=C stretches, so the compound might have a benzene ring.

Now, the 1H NMR data. Let's go through each peak:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet. Could be an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid -COOH. The broadness suggests it's exchanging, which fits with COOH.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are typical for a para-substituted benzene ring. The doublets with 2H each suggest two substituents opposite each other on the ring. So maybe a para disubstituted benzene, like para-methyl something.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe a methine (CH) group adjacent to something electronegative, like next to an oxygen. Or perhaps part of a CH2 group.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): This could be a CH2 group attached to something else, maybe next to an oxygen or another CH group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A doublet of 3H suggests a methyl group attached to a CH2 or another group with two protons, maybe a branching point. Like a CH(CH3) group.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A terminal methyl group, like from an ethyl chain. So maybe a CH2CH3 group.

Putting this together, the benzene ring has substituents in the para positions. One substituent is likely a methyl group since the 1.4 and 0.9 ppm signals suggest an ethyl group attached elsewhere. Wait, but the 1.4 (d,3H) and 0.9 (t,3H) sounds like a -CH2CH2CH3 group? Or perhaps a branching like -CH(CH2CH3) or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like a propanoate or something with a carbonyl.

Wait, the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone (around 1700) but maybe a carboxylic acid derivative. But wait, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 which is a carboxylic acid proton. So that suggests a -COOH group.

Wait, but the 1720 cm-1 is a carbony
