Okay, so I have this problem about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the well is of length L, and each particle is spin-1/2, so each can be either up or down. But wait, since they're identical fermions, they have to obey the Pauli exclusion principle. Oh right, that means no two fermions can have the same set of quantum numbers in the same system.

The energy levels for a single particle in a 1D infinite well are given by E_n = (n²π²ħ²)/(2mL²), which is E multiplied by n squared, where E is given as pi² ħ²/(2mL²). So E_n = n² E.

Now, the system has four particles. So I need to fill the energy levels while considering the spin. Each energy level can hold up to two particles because each can have spin up and down. So for each n, you can have two particles.

The ground state would be the lowest energy possible. Let's think about filling the lowest energy levels first. Each level can hold two particles. So starting with n=1, which can take two particles. Then n=2 can take two more. Wait, but we have four particles, so n=1 and n=2 each have two particles, right? So the ground state energy would be the sum of their energies.

Wait, wait. Wait, four particles in a well. Each n level can take two. So for four particles, we need to fill up to n=2. Because n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles) makes four in total. So the ground state would have two particles in n=1 and two in n=2. So the total energy would be 2*(1² E) + 2*(2² E) = 2E + 8E = 10E. Oh wait, but wait, wait. Let me think again. Because each particle in n=1 contributes E, so two particles there make 2E. Similarly, n=2 gives each E*(2^2)=4E, so two particles give 8E. So 2E +8E is 10E. So the ground state is 10E? But looking at the options, let me see.

Wait, no. Wait, maybe the ground state is when all four particles are in the lowest possible states. But wait, wait... in a 1D box, each state is defined by n and spin, right? So each energy level (n) can have two particles (spin up and down). So for four particles, n=1 holds two, n=2 holds two. So ground state is when each of these levels is filled as much as possible.

So ground state energy is (1² + 1² + 2² + 2²) E? Because each particle in n=1 contributes 1² E, so two of them make 2*(1²) E. Similarly for n=2, 2*(2²) E. So total would be 2*(1 +4) E = 2*5 E = 10 E. So ground state is 10E.

Wait, but the question is about the ground, first excited, and second excited states. So what
