Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting from compound A and ending with compound E. I need to identify what E is. There are some hints and an IR spectrum data to help me out.

First, I'll list out the reactions step by step:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints given are:
a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.
b) The IR spectrum of A has a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is at 1715 cm^-1.

Okay, let's break this down. The IR peaks are important because they tell us about functional groups. A strong peak around 1750 suggests a carbonyl group, probably a ketone or maybe an ester. But since A is reacting with HCN, which is a nucleophile, I'm thinking maybe A is a carbonyl compound. HCN typically adds to carbonyls, so A is likely a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, but the product of A and HCN is B. HCN adds to carbonyl groups. So A is probably a cyclic ketone. For example, cyclopentanone or something similar.

Now, looking at hint a: when A reacts with a phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting an ylide with a carbonyl group.

So in the Wittig reaction, the ylide would attack the carbonyl of A, forming an alkene. The product given is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me parse that structure.

The main ring is cyclopentane. At position 4, there's a substituent: propan-2-ylidene. Propan-2-ylidene is CH2-C(CH3)=, so as a substituent, it's a cyclopentane with a double bond connected via a CH2 group. Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally.

So, the cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups. Then, at position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group. Propan-2-ylidene is (CH3)2C- group attached via a double bond.

So the Wittig reaction product suggests that A's carbonyl is at a position that, when the ylide attacks, the resulting alkene is at position 4. So the carbonyl in
