Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the horizontal axis, but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate producing 2 photons. The energies of both photons were measured and they have the same value. The directions were also measured. One of the photons was moving in the upper-right direction, while another in the lower-right direction. What is the angle between the directions of the photons?

Hmm. So, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons. Since the original particles are an electron and a positron, which are each other's antiparticles, this makes sense. Also, the conservation laws—like conservation of energy and momentum—must apply here.

Wait, the problem says the two photons have the same energy. So their energies are equal. And their directions are one upper-right and the other lower-right. So they're both moving to the right, but one is above the axis and the other is below. So the angle between them is the angle between their directions. Probably, they are symmetric in some way.

But wait, what about the initial momenta of the electron and positron? Because the Lorentz factor affects their relativistic momentum.

Let me think about the setup. The system is the electron and positron approaching each other. The electron is moving from the left, so towards the right. The positron is moving from the right, towards the left. They collide and annihilate into two photons.

Wait, no, the problem says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So, if the electron is on the left moving right, and the positron is on the right moving left, they'll collide at the origin or somewhere in between. Their momenta are in opposite directions.

So, to compute the total momentum before annihilation, I need to find the relativistic momenta of both particles.

The Lorentz factor γ is given for each. The electron has γ=4, the positron γ=2. Wait, but the positron has the same mass as the electron, right? Because a positron is like an electron with positive charge.

So, the
