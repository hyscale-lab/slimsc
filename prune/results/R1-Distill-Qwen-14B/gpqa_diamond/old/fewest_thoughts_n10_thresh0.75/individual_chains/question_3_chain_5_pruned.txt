Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are the eigenstates of σz. The question is about finding the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation values. I remember that expectation values involve the probabilities of the states and the operators involved. 

Wait, expectation value is like the average outcome you'd expect if you measured the observable many times on identical systems. For a given state, the expectation value of an operator is calculated as ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

So the operator here is 10σz +5σx. I think I can break this down into two parts because expectation values are linear. That is, the expectation of a sum is the sum of the expectations. So, ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ = 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier.

First, let me find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So when I calculate the expectation value of σz, it'll be the sum of the probabilities of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues.

The state is ψ = 0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the coefficients are 0.5 for |↑⟩ and sqrt(3)/2 for |↓⟩. The probabilities are the squares of the absolute values of these coefficients. Let me compute that:

Probability of |↑⟩, P_up = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.
Probability of |↓⟩, P_down = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = P_up * (+1) + P_down * (-1). Plugging the numbers in: (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ would be 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the second part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh, wait, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are different. I'm a bit fuzzy on the eigenstates of σx. I remember that σx swaps the |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ states. So, in the computational basis, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩. But for the expectation value, I need to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩.

Another approach comes to mind: express σx in the basis of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So, σx|↑⟩ = |↓⟩ and σx|↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So, to compute ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩, I can write it out:

⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = (0.5 ⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↓|) σx (0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ ) )

Expanding this, each term would be:

0.5 * 0.5 * ⟨↑|σx|↑⟩ + 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σx|↓⟩ 
+ (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σx|↑⟩ 
+ (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ⟨↓|σx|↓⟩.
