Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember from my notes that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which is S_z. So, the state is a linear combination of these two states. I think I should first normalize this state because probabilities are involved, and probabilities depend on the norm of the state.

Wait, the question mentions that A_ij is the matrix representation of an operator. The elements are hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. That matrix would look like a 2x2 matrix because we have two states (up and down). Let me write it down.

So, the matrix A would be:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because when i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal is zero. Oh wait, wait. Wait, the problem says A_ij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and zero otherwise. So the matrix is:
[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

That looks familiar. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. So sigma_x has 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal, so A = (hbar/2) sigma_x. So the operator A is (hbar/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Now, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of operator A. Also, the average value of that operator.

Wait, but the state |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of S_z, not of A. So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, or perhaps find the eigenstates of A and project |alpha> onto them.

Alternatively, since A is proportional to sigma_x, its eigenstates are the eigenstates of sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are |+x> and |-x>, which
