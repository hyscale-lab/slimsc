Okay, so I've been given this problem about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). I remember that metrics describe the geometry of a space, right? So this is probably a 2-dimensional metric since it's in terms of dx and dy. Wait, the question mentions a pseudosphere, which is a surface in 3D, but maybe here it's represented in 2D somehow. Or perhaps it's a different kind of sphere.

Pseudosphere, I think, refers to a surface with constant negative curvature. Oh right, like the tractricoid or something. But how does that tie into the metric given? I remember that the metric for a sphere in 2D is usually expressed in polar coordinates, but this seems Cartesian here.

Let me parse the metric again. The coefficient for dx² and dy² is 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the line element depends on x and y. Wait, 4 is x² + y² when r=2, because x² + y² would be r squared. So 4 is (2)^2. So the denominator is (4 - r²), where r is sqrt(x² + y²). That makes sense.

The numerator is 32, so the coefficient simplifies to 32/(4 - r²). Hmm. I'm trying to recall the metric for a pseudosphere. Wait, I think the metric for a pseudosphere (with negative curvature) in polar coordinates is usually something like ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 + (a/r)^2))² dθ², where a is the curvature radius. Or wait, maybe that's for a sphere. No, for a pseudosphere, the metric is ds² = dr² + [ (a²)/(1 - (r²/a²))² ] dθ², but wait, that doesn't seem right because when r approaches a, the denominator goes to zero, which would cause the metric to blow up. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, I think the metric for a hyperbolic space (which is negatively curved) in polar coordinates is ds² = dr² + (a² / (1 - (r²/a²)))² dθ², but I'm not so sure. Or perhaps it's (a² / (cosh(r/a)))^2 dθ² or something like that. Hmm, maybe I should think about the Gaussian curvature here.

Wait, the area of a sphere is 4πr², but for a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is different. Oh right, wait, the pseudosphere is actually a surface with infinite extent. Because even though it's a finite surface area in 3D, in 2D hyperbolic space, the area can be infinite. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Or maybe I'm getting confused between the sphere in 3D and the 2D surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is that of a two-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space, but I'm not sure. Let me think about how to compute the area using
