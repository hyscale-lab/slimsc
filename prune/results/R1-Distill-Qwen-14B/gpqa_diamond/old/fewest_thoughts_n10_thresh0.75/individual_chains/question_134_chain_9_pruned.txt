Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. Hmm, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water. Enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, I think the standard enthalpy of neutralization is for strong acids and strong bases, and it's around -57 kJ/mol or something like that, but the options here are in kcal and kJ, so I need to pay attention.

The problem gives the volumes and concentrations of each solution. Let's list them out:

HCl: 500 mL, 0.2 M
H2SO4: 300 mL, 0.3 M
Ba(OH)2: 200 mL, 0.5 M

Wait, but HCl and H2SO4 are both acids, and Ba(OH)2 is a base. So when they mix, the acids will react with the base. But I need to figure out how much each acid contributes to the reaction.

First, I think I should calculate the moles of each substance. Moles = concentration (M) * volume (L).

Calculating each:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, it dissociates completely into H+ and Cl-.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. So each mole gives 2 H+ ions. Wait, does it completely dissociate in the solution? I think for neutralization, the second H isn't as strong, but perhaps in this problem, we're assuming complete dissociation for simplicity. So for H2SO4, 0.09 moles * 2 = 0.18 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates into Ba^2+ and 2 OH- ions. So each mole gives 2 OH- ions. So 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of OH-.

Wait, but wait. The reaction between an acid and a base often involves H+ and OH- combining to form water. The neutralization depends on the moles of H+ available and the moles of OH-.

So total H+ from acids: HCl contributes 0.1 moles, H2SO4 contributes 0.18 moles. Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2 moles.

So the neutralization
