Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question involves two separate reactions, A and B, and I need to pick the correct major products among the options given. 

First, let's look at the first part: Reaction A. The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Breaking it down: the structure is benzene with an ether substituent. The ether group is (CH₂CH₂C(CH3)=CH₂)OCH2. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂, but with the double bond starting at C2. Wait, no: but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH2- group? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂- but the substituent is at position 1. Wait, no, I think I got that wrong. But-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂- but the actual structure is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is: OCH2CH2C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, let me draw it mentally. The substituent is (3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl), which is a four-carbon chain where the double bond starts at C2, and there's a methyl group on C3.

Wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH₂=CHCH₂CH₂- but as a substituent, so the position of the substituent is on C1. So the structure would be:

The benzene ring attached to OCH2, then another CH2, then a C with a double bond, and a methyl group on that C. So perhaps the structure is OCH2CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So that's the starting material for reaction A.

Reaction A is treated with Bu
