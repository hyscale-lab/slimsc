Okay, so I've got this question about the hydrogen atom and transition probabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about the state |3,0,0⟩ decaying to |1,0,0⟩ via two dipole transitions. I remember that in the hydrogen atom, transitions happen through emission or absorption of photons, and dipole transitions involve changing the state in specific ways.

Dipole transitions... Oh right, the selection rules for dipole transitions are important here. The selection rules for hydrogen are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. But wait, for the 3,0,0 to 1,0,0 transition, since l changes from 0 to 0? No, wait, no. Wait, no, 3,0,0 is n=3, l=0, m=0. So when it transitions to 1,0,0, that's n=1, l=0, m=0. So l doesn't change? Wait, but that's not possible because for a dipole transition, Δl must be ±1. Because l can't stay the same. So wait, that can't happen directly, so it must go through an intermediate state.

Ah, right, so the |3,0,0⟩ state can't transition directly to |1,0,0⟩ because l changes from 0 to 0, which violates the Δl=±1 rule. So it must go via an intermediate state where l is 1. So the first transition would be from l=0 to l=1, and then from l=1 to l=0.

So the initial state is n=3, l=0. To transition via dipole, it must go to a state with l=1. So the intermediate state must have l=1. Then from l=1, it can transition to l=0, which is the final state n=1, l=0.

So the options are, I think, looking for the correct path and the probability. Let me look at the options.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0. So the first step is n=3→n=2, l=0→1, m=0→0. Then n=2→n=1, l=1→0, m=0→0. But wait, can m change like that?

Wait, the selection rules for m are that Δm can be 0, ±1. So in the first transition, m changes by 0, which is allowed. Then in the second transition, m is still 0, so that's also allowed.

What about the probabilities? How do we calculate the transition probability? I think the transition probability involves the square of the matrix elements of the dipole operator between the states. But since it's a two-step process, maybe the total probability is the product of the probabilities of each step.

But wait, each step is a dipole transition. So first, from |3,0,0⟩ to an l=1 state, which must be |2,1,m⟩ or |4,1,m⟩, but since n can't go beyond 3 in this case, it's probably to n=2, l=1.

Wait, but n can decrease or increase by 1 in each step, right? So from n=3, it can go to n=2 or n=4. But since the final state is n=1, it's more likely to go through n=2 or maybe n=3 to n=2, then n=2 to n=1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,m⟩, where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, the dipole operator connects states where m changes by 0, ±1. So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, so m=0. So the possible transitions are to m= -1, 0, +1. But since the initial m is 0, the intermediate in the first step must have m=0, ±1. Wait no, during the first transition, m can change by 0, ±1. So after first transition, m could be 0 → 0, ±1.

Wait, but in the first step, the intermediate must have l=1. So possible states are |2,1, m⟩ where m is -1, 0, +1. So the first transition could be to any of these three m states.

Wait, but let's think about the possible transitions from |3,0,0⟩. The dipole operator has components proportional to rY_1m, so m can change by -1, 0, +1. So from m=0, possible m in intermediate is -1, 0, +1. So possible l=1, m can be -1,0, +1.

So the first transition could be to any of these three states. Then, from each of these, the next transition must go to |1,0,0⟩.

Wait, but the second transition must go from l=1 to l=0. So for each of these possible intermediate states, the second transition would have to change m by 0, ±1, but since the final state has m=0, the intermediate m must be such that m can go to 0.

So let's see. If the intermediate state is |2,1, 0⟩, then from m=0, it can go to m=0, ±1. But the final state is m=0, so it can come from m=0 (by Δm=0) or m=1 (Δm=-1) or m=-1 (Δm=+1). So the intermediate state |2,1, 0⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩.

Similarly, intermediate |2,1,1⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩ by changing m by -1. And intermediate |2,1,-1⟩ can transition to |1,0,0⟩ by changing m by +1.

So all three intermediate states are possible.

Wait, but the options given are only considering certain paths. Let's look at the options.

Option A: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 →1,0,0. So the intermediate is m=0. Then the probability is 1/3.

Option B: 3,0,0 →2,1,1 →1,0,0. Probability 1/4.

Option C: 3,0,0 →2,1,-1 →1,0,
