Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about astrophysics, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again.

The question says: Large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at Lyman alpha wavelength (~1216 Angstrom). We need to estimate the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, I remember that the Lyman alpha emission line is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The Lyman alpha wavelength is around 121.6 nanometers, which is 1216 Angstroms. So when quasars emit this light, if there's neutral hydrogen in front of them, the H I clouds can absorb this specific wavelength.

Now, the problem is about redshift. Redshift (z) affects the wavelength we observe. The observed wavelength λ_obs is related to the emitted wavelength λ_emit by the formula λ_obs = λ_emit * (1 + z). So the higher the redshift, the longer the wavelength we see.

But wait, the key here is detection with optical ground-based telescopes. Optical telescopes can only observe a certain range of wavelengths, specifically visible light. So if the absorbed light is shifted into the optical range, it can be detected. But if it's in the ultraviolet or beyond, ground-based telescopes can't observe it because Earth's atmosphere blocks UV light (it's why space telescopes like Hubble are better for UV). So the Lyman alpha absorption, when redshifted into the optical, is detectable.

Wait, but the question is about the lower limit of redshift. So the minimal z where the Lyman alpha line is still in the optical range. Because if z is too low, the wavelength would be in UV or not redshifted enough, so the ground telescope can't see it.

Let me think about the optical range. The visible spectrum is roughly from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). Let's convert all the units to nanometers to make it easier. 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. So for the Lyman alpha line to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength must be ≥400 nm.

So set up the equation: λ_obs ≥ 400 nm.

We know λ_emit is 121.6 nm, so:

121.6 nm * (1 + z) ≥ 400 nm.

Divide both sides by 121.6 nm:

1 + z ≥ 400 / 121.6.

Let me calculate that. 400 divided by 121.6. Let me compute:

121.6 * 3 = 364.8 (since 120*3=360, plus 1.6*3=4.8, so 364.8). 400 is 35.2 more than that. So 400/121.6 ≈ 3.29.

So 1 + z
