Okay, so I have this physics problem here about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. The question gives me several phase shifts, δ0 to δ4, and I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I think the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) involves the sum of various terms. The general expression, if I recall correctly, is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ ( (2l + 1) (δ_l) P_l(cosθ) ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial. But wait, I'm being asked specifically about the imaginary part along the incident direction. Oh right, along the beam direction, θ is 0 degrees, so cosθ is 1. So I only need to consider the terms where P_l(1) is non-zero.

Legendre polynomials: P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_l(1) = 1 for any l. So that simplifies things. Then, the expression for f(θ=0) becomes (1/k) Σ ( (2l+1) δ_l ), where the sum is over the given phase shifts.

Wait, but each δ_l is the phase shift for each angular momentum state l. The question gives me δ0=90°, δ1=67°, δ2=55°, δ3=30°, δ4=13°, and the rest are ignored. So l goes up to 4 here.

So the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, Im f(θ=0), is (1/k) times the sum from l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) times δ_l. Wait, no, wait. Wait the phase shifts are in degrees, but I think in the formula, they're in radians. Because when you're calculating the exponential, which is e^{iδ}, the δ must be in radians. So I need to convert each δ from degrees to radians.

So each term would be (2l+1) * δ_l (in radians). Let me compute each term:

l=0: (2*0+1)* (90°) = 1 * (π/2) ≈ 1.5708 radians
l=1: (2*1+1)*
