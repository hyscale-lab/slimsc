Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wow, that's a mouthful. I think it's a hydrocarbon, maybe a polystyrene or something similar. Well, regardless, I need to figure out the structure to count the number of each bond.

The data provided includes the enthalpy of atomization for carbon and bond energies for H-H, C-C, C=C, and C-H. Oh wait, enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to produce isolated atoms. So for carbon, which is in graphite or diamond form, it's 1000 kJ/mol to break into C atoms.

So the approach is probably to calculate the enthalpy change using bond energies. I think the formula is: 

ΔHformation = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]

Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, wait! Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can also be calculated using bond energies. The general formula is:

ΔHf° = (sum of bond energies of all bonds in reactants) - (sum of bond energies of all bonds in products)

But wait, no, I think that's when you're looking at bond energies in reactions. Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh, right, when you calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction using bond energies, it's the bonds broken minus bonds formed. But for enthalpy of formation, perhaps it's about the energy required to build the molecule from atoms.

Wait, another approach: The enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the enthalpy of atomization and the bond energies. So, the formula for the enthalpy of formation (ΔHf) of a molecule would be:

ΔHf = [ (number of atoms × enthalpy of atomization per atom) ) + (sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in the reactants) ] - [ sum of bond energies of all bonds
