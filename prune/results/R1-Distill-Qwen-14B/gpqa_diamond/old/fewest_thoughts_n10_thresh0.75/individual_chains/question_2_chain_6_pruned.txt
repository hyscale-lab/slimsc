Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question starts with trans-cinnamaldehyde. I remember that cinnamaldehyde is an aromatic aldehyde, right? The structure is something like a benzene ring with a propenal group attached. Trans means the double bond has a certain stereochemistry, but maybe that won't matter immediately.

The first step is treating trans-cinnamaldehyde with methylmagnesium bromide. Wait, methyl magnesium bromide is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents typically add to carbonyl groups. So cinnamaldehyde has an aldehyde group (RCHO), and when Grignard is added, it should form RCH2OMgBr, but wait, no, Grignard adds to the carbonyl, right? So the aldehyde would react with the Grignard. The aldehyde has the structure Ar-CH₂-CHO. Adding methyl Grignard would add a methyl group to the carbonyl carbon, forming Ar-CH₂-CH(O-)MgBr. Then, when quenched, it would become an alcohol. So product 1 would be Ar-CH₂-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, cinnamaldehyde is benzaldehyde with a propenyl group. Oh wait no, cinnamaldehyde is actually the aldehyde from cinnamic acid. So structure is benzene ring connected to a CH₂-CH₂-CHO? No, wait, cinnamic acid is benzene ring with CH₂CH₂COOH, so cinnamaldehyde would be benzene ring with CH₂CH₂CHO. Wait, no. Wait, cinnamic acid is C6H5-CH=CH-COOH. So the aldehyde would be C6H5-CH=CH-CHO. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cinnamaldehyde is C6H5-CH₂-CHO? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think.

Cinnamaldehyde is actually an aromatic aldehyde with the structure C6H5-CH₂-CHO. No,
