Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: We're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH at 25°C. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I need to figure out what's happening at each of these points—before the titration even starts, during, and at equivalence. Let me break this down.

First, the initial dilution. We have 20.0 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Adding 20.0 cm³ of water would dilute it. So, the concentration of acetic acid after dilution can be calculated using the dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2.

So, M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 20 cm³. The total volume after adding water is 40 cm³ (20 + 20). So M2 is (M1*V1)/V2. Let me compute that.

M2 = (0.05 M * 20 cm³) / 40 cm³ = (1) / 40 = 0.025 M. Oh wait wait, 0.05 * 20 is 1, divided by 40 gives 0.025 M. So the diluted acetic acid is 0.025 M.

Next, when we titrate this with 0.1 M NaOH. The equivalence point is when the moles of NaOH added equal the moles of acetic acid initially present.

Wait, let's calculate the moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution. The volume is 40 cm³ (which is 0.04 L), so moles = M * V = 0.025 M * 0.04 L. 0.025 * 0.04 is 0.001 moles of acetic acid.

Since each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid, the moles of NaOH needed at equivalence are also 0.001. The concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, so volume V = moles / conc = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration and the equivalence point. So 25% of the equivalence volume would be 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

But wait, the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence point and at the equivalence point. So I need to calculate pH at both these points.

Let me tackle the 25% titration first. At 25% titration, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by the NaOH. So the situation is a buffer solution of acetic acid and its conjugate base, acetate ion.

To find the pH, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be useful. The equation is pH = pKa + log([A-]/[HA]).

First, I need the pKa. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)) or wait, pKa is -log(Ka). Let me compute that.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) is the same as pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that. Log(1.85) is about 0.267, so log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733? Wait, wait, more accurately, pKa = -log(1.85e-5) = 4.73 (since 1.85 is approximately 10^0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 10^(-4.733) → pKa is 4.733).

So the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be pH = 4.733 + log([A-]/[HA]).

At 25% titration, how much of the acetic acid has been neutralized? 25% of the moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001, so 25% would be 0.00025 moles of OH- added (since each mole of OH- neutralizes a mole of HA). So, moles of HA that react is 0.00025, producing 0.00025 moles of A-.

So the moles remaining of HA would be 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075. Moles of A- are 0.00025.

But I also need to consider the dilution when adding the NaOH. Since the initial solution is 40 cm³, and
