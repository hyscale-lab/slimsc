Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says it's a 1-dimensional system with mass m and maximum amplitude A. It obeys Hooke's law, so F = -kx. The problem is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. Oh right, and we're considering relativistic effects because the speed of light c is mentioned.

Wait, I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So for a non-relativistic oscillator, the maximum speed v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). But that's option C, and I think the correct answer might not be that because we're dealing with relativity here.

Relativity comes into play when speeds are significant fractions of the speed of light. So the kinetic energy in relativity isn't the same as in classical mechanics. The relativistic kinetic energy is given by (γ - 1)mc², where γ is the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx². The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential. At maximum displacement (x = A), the oscillator has maximum potential energy and zero kinetic. As it moves towards equilibrium, potential energy decreases and kinetic increases.

Wait, but in the relativistic case, since the mass increases with speed, the energy isn't just split between kinetic and potential the same way as classically. So maybe I need to set up the energy equation correctly.

At any point in the motion, the total energy should be the sum of kinetic and potential. But the potential energy is (1/2)kx², right? And the kinetic energy is (γ - 1)mc².

But wait, in the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the situation is a bit more complicated. The potential is still (1/2)kx², but the kinetic energy is relativistic. So the total energy E is (γ)mc², because the rest energy plus the kinetic energy. Wait, no, the total energy is the sum, so E = kinetic + potential. Or is E the total mechanical energy, which is conserved?

Wait another approach: the total mechanical energy E is the same at all points. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest (v=0), so E would be equal to the potential energy there,
