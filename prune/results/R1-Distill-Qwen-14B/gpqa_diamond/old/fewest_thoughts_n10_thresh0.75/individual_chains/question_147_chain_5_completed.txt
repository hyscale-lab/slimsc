Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an annihilation process. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. Alright, the reaction is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles each with charge + and -.

The problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving. Wait, so if the antiproton is moving slowly, that probably means its velocity is much less than the speed of light, right? Oh wait, but when I'm dealing with particles and their annihilation, maybe I should consider conservation of energy and momentum here.

Wait, the mass of A is given as mA c² = 300 MeV. Oh, I think that's the rest mass energy of each A particle. So each A has a rest mass of 300 MeV/c².

The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. So I need to find the velocity v of A in terms of c.

Since the process is p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻, let me think about the initial and final states. The initial state is a proton and an antiproton. The final state is two particles of each type, A⁺ and A⁻.

Wait a second, protons and antiprotons have rest masses of about 938 MeV/c² each. So the initial total rest mass is 2*938 MeV = 1876 MeV. But wait, the final particles each have a rest mass of 300 MeV, so four particles in total make 4*300=1200 MeV. So that's way less than the initial rest mass. But wait, that can't be because I'm probably missing kinetic energy.

Wait, but the antiproton is moving slowly, so maybe the initial kinetic energy isn't that high. Hmm, but wait, the initial setup is a proton and a moving antiproton annihilating into these two pairs. So perhaps I need to consider the conservation of energy and momentum.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So maybe its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest mass energy. But wait, the proton is presumably at rest? Or is it also moving? Or perhaps the frame in which the antiproton is moving is considered, and the proton is at rest.

Wait, maybe it's better to model this in the center-of-momentum frame. Or perhaps the lab frame where the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving slowly.

Let me think. Let's consider the initial frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with some velocity v. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its velocity is much less than c, so v ≈ 0. But wait, if it's moving slowly, but in reality, in high-energy physics, particles are often considered in their rest frames, but here the antiproton is moving, so maybe I need to calculate the total energy and momentum.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the antiproton is at rest, but that's not what the question says. It says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm, but maybe for the sake of calculation, I can approximate that the antiproton's velocity is non-relativistic, so its kinetic energy can be treated using non-relativistic equations. Or perhaps it's better to proceed with relativistic calculations.

Wait, let's think about the initial state. The proton is at rest, and the antiproton has some velocity u. So the initial energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the total energy of the moving antiproton.

Proton's rest energy: E_p = m_p c² = 938 MeV.

Antiproton's energy: E_p̄ = γ m_p c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, u is small, so γ is approximately 1 + (u²)/(2 c²). But perhaps I can even ignore the kinetic energy, but maybe not. Wait, but if the antiproton is moving, the total initial energy is E_p + E_p̄ = (m_p + γ m_p) c² = m_p c² (1 + γ). Hmm, but perhaps I should calculate the total four-momentum.

Wait, but maybe I can approach this by considering the conservation of energy and momentum.

In the initial state, the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with velocity u, so its momentum is p_p̄ = γ m_p u.

So the initial energy is E_initial = E_p + E_p̄ = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

The initial momentum is just p_initial = γ m_p u.

In the final state, we have two A⁺ and two A⁻. Assuming they are all moving in the same direction (to make things simple, perhaps), but maybe the simplest case is when all four particles are at rest, but that can't be because their rest mass is much lower than the initial rest mass.

Wait, but the initial rest mass energy is 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV, and the final rest mass is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the initial rest mass is higher, which suggests that in the center of mass frame, the initial energy is higher than the final rest mass, so there's kinetic energy involved.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem is assuming that the antiproton is at rest, so u = 0. Because the problem says it's moving slowly, but perhaps the velocity's direction is such that the total momentum is zero. Wait, maybe the setup is such that the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities, but that's not stated. Hmm. Let me read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So perhaps the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it with a small velocity. Then, in the initial frame (proton's rest frame), the total energy is E_p + E_p̄ = m_p c² + gamma m_p c², and the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p u, where u is the antiproton's velocity.

The final state must have total energy E_final = 2 E_A⁺ + 2 E_A⁻, and total momentum p_final = 2 p_A⁺ + 2 p_A⁻, assuming each A⁺ and A⁻ has the same magnitude of momentum but perhaps opposite directions or same. But perhaps for simplicity, the particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe it's easier to consider the situation in the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, but the problem is asking for the velocity of A, so perhaps it's in the lab frame where the proton is at rest.

Alternatively, perhaps an approximation can be made. Let's think about the conservation of energy and momentum.

Assuming that all four A particles are moving with the same velocity v, which would make sense if the system is symmetric. So each A⁺ and A⁻ has the same speed v, but perhaps opposite directions in pairs. But perhaps for simplicity, maybe they all move in the same direction as the initial antiproton's momentum.

Wait, but the initial momentum is due to the moving antiproton. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p u. The final momentum is sum of the momenta of all four A particles. If all A particles are moving in the same direction, their momenta would add up. But perhaps another approach is to consider that in the final state, the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

Wait, but perhaps I should model this more carefully.

Let me define variables. Let me denote:

m_p = 938 MeV/c² (proton mass)
m_p̄ = 938 MeV/c² (antiproton mass)
mA = 300 MeV/c² (mass of A)
u = velocity of antiproton (slow, so maybe small, but I'm not sure yet)
E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c²
p_initial = gamma m_p u

In the final state, there are four A particles. Let's assume two are moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction, each with speed v. But wait, that would make the total momentum zero, which can't be because the initial momentum is non-zero. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum. So their momenta add up. Let's say each has velocity v, same direction.

Then, the total final momentum would be 4 * gamma_A * mA * v, where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for A's velocity.

But wait, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p u.

So, equating momentum:

4 gamma_A mA v = gamma m_p u.

Similarly, energy conservation:

E_initial = 2 E_A⁺ + 2 E_A⁻

But each E_A is gamma_A mA c², so:

E_initial = 4 gamma_A mA c².

Wait, but E_initial is m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

Wait, but I'm not sure if this assumption of all four moving in the same direction is correct. It's possible that they might have different directions.

Alternatively, perhaps the two A⁺ and two A⁻ are moving in pairs in opposite directions, leading to some momentum cancellation. Hmm, but this might complicate things. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum.

So, equations:

Conservation of momentum:
4 gamma_A mA v = gamma m_p u.

Conservation of energy:
4 gamma_A mA c² = m_p c² (1 + gamma).

Wait, but gamma is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton's velocity u. So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - u²/c²).

But since the antiproton is moving slowly (u << c), gamma ≈ 1 + (u²)/(2 c²), but maybe for the sake of approximation, we can take gamma ≈1. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to treat the antiproton's velocity as non-relativistic, so gamma is approximately 1. Let me see.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving at non-relativistic speeds, then u is much less than c, so gamma ≈1, and E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² + (1/2) m_p u². So the initial energy would be E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + (1/2) m_p u² = 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p u².

But then, the energy in the final state is 4 gamma_A mA c², which must be equal to this.

But wait, perhaps I can proceed with the initial approximation that the antiproton is at rest, so u=0. Then the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

Then, 4 gamma_A mA c² = 2 m_p c².

Dividing both sides by c²: 4 gamma_A mA = 2 m_p.

So gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 mA) ) = (m_p)/(2 mA).

m_p is 938 MeV/c², mA is 300 MeV/c².

So gamma_A = (938) / (2 * 300) ) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563333.

So gamma_A is approximately 1.5633.

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - beta²), where beta = v/c.

So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Let's compute 1/gamma²: 1/(1.5633)^2 ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.4093.

So 1 - 0.4093 = 0.5907.

sqrt(0.5907) ≈ 0.7685.

So beta ≈ 0.7685 c, so v ≈ 0.7685 c.

Wait, but none of the options exactly match this. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 0.77c → 0.77
B) 0.96c → 0.96
C) 0.91c → 0.91
D) 0.86c → 0.86

Hmm, 0.7685 is close to 0.77, but option A is 0.77c, which would be the first option.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any mistake in the assumption? I assumed the antiproton is at rest, but the problem says it's moving slowly. So this might affect the calculations. Because if the antiproton is moving, the initial energy is higher, and that could change the gamma for the A particles.

Ah, right, because I initially assumed the antiproton is at rest, but the problem says it's moving, albeit slowly. So perhaps my initial assumption was wrong.

So, perhaps I should not neglect the antiproton's motion. Let me try to include it properly.

Let me denote the antiproton's speed as u, which is small. So gamma_p̄ ≈ 1 + (u²)/(2 c²) because u is small. So E_p̄ ≈ m_p c² (1 + u²/(2 c²)).

Wait, but for small u, (u/c)^2 is small, so maybe I can expand in terms of (u/c)^2.

So the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p̄ m_p c² ≈ m_p c² [1 + (1 + u²/(2 c²))] = m_p c² (2 + u²/(2 c²)).

Similarly, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p̄ m_p u ≈ m_p u [1 + u²/(2 c²)] ≈ m_p u, since u²/(2 c²) is very small.

In the final state, four A particles, each with momentum p_A and energy E_A.

Assuming all four are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum, their total momentum is 4 p_A, and their total energy is 4 E_A.

So from conservation of momentum:

4 p_A = p_initial ≈ m_p u.

From conservation of energy:

4 E_A ≈ m_p c² (2 + u²/(2 c²)).

Express E_A and p_A in terms of mA and beta (v = beta c).

E_A = gamma_A mA c²
p_A = gamma_A mA beta c.

So substituting:

4 gamma_A mA beta c = m_p u → equation 1.

4 gamma_A mA c² = m_p c² (2 + u²/(2 c²)) → equation 2.

Let me divide equation 2 by c²:

4 gamma_A mA = m_p (2 + u²/(2 c²)) ) → equation 2'.

From equation 1, solve for beta:

beta = (m_p u) / (4 gamma_A mA c).

Hmm, perhaps I can square equation 1 and equation 2 to find a relationship.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the fact that u is small. Let me see.

Since u is small, maybe u² is negligible compared to other terms. Let me try to make approximations.

From equation 2':

4 gamma_A mA ≈ m_p * 2 → since u²/(2 c²) is small.

So gamma_A ≈ (m_p * 2 )/(4 mA) ) = m_p/(2 mA).

Which is the same as before, leading to gamma_A = 938/(2 * 300) ≈ 1.5633.

So beta ≈ 0.7685 c, which gives v ≈ 0.7685 c. That's approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but in this approach, I neglected the u terms in equation 2. But perhaps the u² term is not negligible enough. Let me see.

Wait, but wait, since the antiproton is moving, the initial energy is higher than 2 m_p c² by a small amount, so the energy of the four A particles would be slightly higher than 2 m_p c². So gamma_A would be a bit higher than 1.5633, leading to a slightly higher beta and hence a higher velocity v.

But in that case, the velocity would be a bit higher than 0.77c. Let me check the options.

Option C is 0.91c, which is higher. Option D is 0.86c, which is higher than 0.77.

Wait, but perhaps I should include the u² term in equation 2.

Let me proceed without approximation.

Equation 2':

4 gamma_A mA = m_p (2 + (u²)/(2 c²)).

From equation 1:

4 gamma_A mA beta = m_p u → equation 1.

Let me square equation 1:

(4 gamma_A mA beta)^2 = (m_p u)^2 → 16 gamma_A^2 mA^2 beta^2 = m_p^2 u^2.

But from equation 2':

4 gamma_A mA = 2 m_p + (m_p u^2)/(2 c^2).

So gamma_A = [2 m_p + (m_p u^2)/(2 c^2)] / (4 mA) → equation 3.

Substitute gamma_A into the squared equation 1:

16 [ (2 m_p + (m_p u^2)/(2 c^2)) / (4 mA) ]^2 mA^2 beta^2 = m_p^2 u^2.

Simplify:

16 * [ (2 m_p + (m_p u^2)/(2 c^2)) / (4 mA) ) ]^2 * mA^2 beta^2 = m_p^2 u^2.

Simplify the numerator:

(2 m_p + (m_p u^2)/(2 c^2)) = m_p [ 2 + (u²)/(2 c²) ].

So,

16 * [ m_p (2 + (u²)/(2 c^2)) / (4 mA) ]^2 * mA^2 beta^2 = m_p^2 u^2.

Expand the square:

16 * (m_p² (2 + u²/(2 c^2))^2 ) / (16 mA^2) ) * mA^2 beta^2 = m_p^2 u^2.

Simplify numerator and denominator:

16 cancels with 16. mA^2 cancels with mA^2.

So,

m_p² (2 + u²/(2 c^2))^2 * beta^2 = m_p^2 u^2.

Divide both sides by m_p²:

(2 + u²/(2 c^2))^2 beta^2 = u^2.

Take square roots:

(2 + u²/(2 c^2)) beta = u.

Hmm, so:

beta = u / (2 + (u²)/(2 c^2)).

Since u is small, the denominator is approximately 2 + (u²)/(2 c^2) ≈ 2.

So beta ≈ u/(2 ) → but wait, that can't be right because u is small, so beta would be small, but earlier calculation gave beta ≈ 0.77c, which is not small. So this suggests that my assumption that u is small might not hold. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach where the antiproton is at rest is a better approximation, giving beta ≈ 0.77c, but the correct answer might be higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that all four A particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect. Maybe two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum that is the same as the initial momentum.

But this might complicate the matter. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to use the conservation of energy and momentum in the rest frame of the proton.

Wait, another approach: in the proton's rest frame, the antiproton is moving with velocity u, which is small. Let's calculate the total energy and momentum.

Total initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Total initial momentum: p_initial = gamma m_p u.

After annihilation, four A particles are produced. Let's assume that two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, so that their momenta add up constructively.

Wait, but perhaps the simplest case is to assume that all four A particles are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum. Let me proceed with that.

So, total final momentum: 4 gamma_A mA beta c.

Total final energy: 4 gamma_A mA c².

Conservation equations:

4 gamma_A mA beta c = gamma m_p u → equation 1.

4 gamma_A mA c² = (m_p + gamma m_p) c² → equation 2.

Wait, equation 2 is from the energy conservation. Wait, m_p + gamma m_p = m_p (1 + gamma).

So equation 2:

4 gamma_A mA c² = m_p (1 + gamma) c².

Divide both sides by c²:

4 gamma_A mA = m_p (1 + gamma).

Equation 1:

4 gamma_A mA beta = gamma m_p u.

Now, from equation 2, gamma_A = [m_p (1 + gamma)]/(4 mA).

Substituting into equation 1:

4 * [m_p (1 + gamma)/(4 mA)] * beta = gamma m_p u.

Simplify:

[m_p (1 + gamma) beta ]/(mA) )= gamma m_p u.

Cancel m_p from both sides:

(1 + gamma) beta = gamma mA u / mA.

Wait, because mA is in the denominator, it's (1 + gamma) beta = gamma u.

Wait, that gives:

beta = [ gamma u (1 + gamma) ]^{-1}.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, let's write equation 1 in terms of equation 2.

From equation 2, gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) ]/(4 mA).

So from equation 1:

4 gamma_A mA beta = gamma m_p u.

Substituting gamma_A:

4 * [ m_p (1 + gamma)/(4 mA) ] * mA beta = gamma m_p u.

Simplify:

m_p (1 + gamma) beta = gamma m_p u.

Cancel m_p:

(1 + gamma) beta = gamma u → beta = [gamma u]/(1 + gamma).

Hmm, but I don't know u yet. Wait, perhaps I can find u in terms of beta.

Alternatively, since the antiproton is moving slowly, u is small, so gamma ≈ 1 + (u²)/(2 c²) ≈ 1.

Wait, but if u is small, then gamma ≈1, and beta ≈ [1 * u ] / (1 +1 ) → beta = u/2.

So, beta = u/2 → u=2 beta.

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is the right path. Let me think about another approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the problem in terms of the conservation of energy and momentum, but considering that the initial system (proton and antiproton) is moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the four A particles are all moving with the same speed v, so their velocities are the same in magnitude. Then, using energy and momentum conservation.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this, and the correct answer is option A (0.77c), but the initial calculation when the antiproton is at rest gives that.

But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which would imply that the initial kinetic energy is small compared to its rest energy. So, perhaps the main contribution to the energy comes from the rest mass of the proton and antiproton. So, perhaps the first approximation is correct, leading to v ≈ 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back, I'm a bit confused because when the antiproton is moving, the initial energy is higher, which would require the A particles to have higher energy, leading to higher speed. So perhaps the velocity is higher than 0.77c, meaning the correct answer would be higher than that.

Wait, but let's redo the calculation without assuming the antiproton is at rest.

Let me take the initial energy as E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p u.

In the final state, four A particles, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A.

Assuming all A particles move in the same direction as the initial momentum, so:

Total final energy: 4 E_A = 4 gamma_A mA c².

Total final momentum: 4 p_A = 4 gamma_A mA beta c.

So, equations:

4 gamma_A mA beta c = gamma m_p u → equation 1.

4 gamma_A mA c² = (m_p + gamma m_p) c² → equation 2.

Equation 2:

4 gamma_A mA = (m_p (1 + gamma)).

Equation 1:

4 gamma_A mA beta = gamma m_p u.

So, from equation 2:

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma) ]/(4 mA).

Substitute into equation 1:

4 * [ m_p (1 + gamma) / (4 mA) ] * beta = gamma m_p u.

Simplify:

[ m_p (1 + gamma) ] * beta / mA = gamma m_p u.

Cancel m_p:

(1 + gamma) beta / mA = gamma u.

So,

u = [ (1 + gamma) beta ] / (gamma mA) ) * c ?

Wait, perhaps I should write u in terms of beta and gamma.

Wait, let's write u as beta_p c, where beta_p is the beta for the antiproton.

So, u = beta_p c.

Then,

u = [ (1 + gamma_p) beta_A ] / (gamma_p mA) ) * c.

Hmm, but I still have two variables, beta_A and beta_p. Maybe I can find a relation between them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta_A.

Wait, from equation 2:

gamma_A = [ m_p (1 + gamma_p) ]/(4 mA).

But I can write gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p^2).

Hmm, but this seems complicated. Maybe I can make an assumption that beta_p is small, so gamma_p ≈ 1 + (beta_p^2)/2.

But I'm not sure. Let me try substituting.

Let me let gamma_p = 1 + x, where x is small, since u is small.

So, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (u^2)/(2 c^2) = 1 + x.

So, 1 + gamma_p = 2 + x.

Now, equation:

u = [ (2 + x) beta_A ] / ( (1 + x) mA ) ) * c.

But since x is small, (1 + x) ≈ 1, so:

u ≈ [ (2 + x) beta_A ] / mA * c.

But from equation 2, gamma_A = [ m_p (2 + x) ] / (4 mA).

But gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_A^2) ≈ 1 + (beta_A^2)/2, since beta_A is not that small.

So,

1 + (beta_A^2)/2 ≈ [ m_p (2 + x) ] / (4 mA ).

Let me plug in the numbers.

m_p =938 MeV/c², mA=300 MeV/c².

So,

1 + (beta_A^2)/2 ≈ [938*(2 + x) ]/(4 * 300).

Calculate the right-hand side:

938 / 4 = 234.5.

234.5 * (2 +x ) = 234.5 * 2 + 234.5 x = 469 + 234.5 x.

Divide by 300:

(469 + 234.5 x)/300 ≈ 1.5633 + 0.7817 x.

So,

1 + (beta_A^2)/2 ≈ 1.5633 + 0.7817 x.

Subtract 1: (beta_A^2)/2 ≈ 0.5633 + 0.7817 x.

Multiply both sides by 2: beta_A^2 ≈ 1.1266 + 1.5634 x.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should consider that x is small, so 0.7817 x is much smaller than 1.1266, so beta_A^2 ≈ 1.1266, leading to beta_A ≈ sqrt(1.1266) ≈ 1.0615. But that's impossible because beta cannot exceed 1. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, this suggests that the approximation might not hold, indicating that the velocity cannot be found using such methods.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the initial assumption is that the antiproton is at rest, which gives us a beta_A of 0.7685, but the correct answer is higher because the antiproton is moving, so the initial energy is higher, leading to higher gamma_A and hence higher beta_A.

But then, what's the correct approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the antiproton's velocity is negligible, and we can ignore it, leading to the initial approximation.

But in that case, the velocity would be around 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 0.91c, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the initial momentum comes only from the antiproton, and the initial energy is sum of the rest energies plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton.

But without knowing the antiproton's velocity, I'm stuck. The problem states the antiproton is moving slowly, but doesn't provide its velocity. So perhaps the correct approach is to model it as the antiproton being at rest, giving the initial energy as 2 m_p c².

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me think about it again.

Another approach: The process p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻ must conserve charge. So the initial charge is zero (proton + antiproton = 0). The final has 2*(+1) + 2*(-1) = 0. So that's okay.

Now, the key is to use conservation of energy and momentum.

Assume the proton is at rest, and the antiproton has velocity u (slow). The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p u.

In the final state, four A particles. Let me assume they all have the same speed v and move in the same direction as the initial momentum.

So, each A has energy gamma_A mA c², momentum gamma_A mA beta c.

Total energy: 4 gamma_A mA c².

Total momentum: 4 gamma_A mA beta c.

Conservation equations:

4 gamma_A mA beta c = gamma m_p u → equation 1.

4 gamma_A mA c² = (m_p + gamma m_p) c² → equation 2.

Equation 2: 4 gamma_A mA = m_p (1 + gamma).

From equation 1: 4 gamma_A mA beta = gamma m_p u.

From equation 2, gamma_A = m_p (1 + gamma)/(4 mA).

Substituting into equation 1:

4 * [ m_p (1 + gamma)/(4 mA) ] * beta = gamma m_p u.

Simplify:

[m_p (1 + gamma) beta ]/(mA) = gamma m_p u.

Divide both sides by m_p:

(1 + gamma) beta / mA = gamma u.

But u is the antiproton's velocity, which is beta_p c, where beta_p = u/c.

So,

(1 + gamma) beta / mA = gamma beta_p.

But beta_p = u/c = (gamma (beta_p) ) * c / c → wait, no. Let me think. No, beta_p is u/c, so u = beta_p c.

Thus,

(1 + gamma) beta / mA = gamma beta_p.

But from equation 2, gamma = gamma_p, since gamma is the gamma for the antiproton's velocity.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me make it explicit.

Let me denote:

gamma_p = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta_p^2), where beta_p = u/c.

So,

(1 + gamma_p) beta_A / mA = gamma_p beta_p.

But beta_p = u/c.

So,

(1 + gamma_p) beta_A = mA gamma_p beta_p.

Hmm, but without knowing beta_p, I can't proceed. So perhaps I need another equation.

Wait, perhaps I can use the expression from equation 2 and substitute into equation 1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything in terms of beta_A and beta_p.

Wait, from equation 2:

gamma_A = [m_p (1 + gamma_p)]/(4 mA).

Which is,

gamma_A = [ (938 MeV/c²) (1 + gamma_p) ] / (4 * 300 MeV/c² ) ) = [938 (1 + gamma_p) ]/(1200) ) ≈ [ (938/1200) (1 + gamma_p) ) ].

Which is approximately (0.7817) (1 + gamma_p).

Wait, but gamma_A must be greater than 1 since the A particles are moving.

Hmm. So,

gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma_p).

But gamma_A = 1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2).

So,

1/sqrt(1 - beta_A^2) = 0.7817 (1 + gamma_p).

Hmm, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should make an assumption that the antiproton's gamma_p is approximately 1, since u is slow. So gamma_p ≈ 1.

Then, gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 * (1 + 1 ) = 1.5634.

Which brings us back to beta_A ≈ sqrt(1 - (1/(1.5634)^2)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409) ≈ sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769 c.

Which is approximately 0.77c, option A.

So, perhaps despite the antiproton's motion, the velocity of A is about 0.77c.

But why is the antiproton's motion not affecting the outcome much? Because it's moving slowly, so its gamma is ≈1, and its contribution to the energy is small compared to the rest mass.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is correct, and the answer is option A.


The problem involves the annihilation process:

\[
p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^{+} + 2A^{-}
\]

where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest mass energy of each \(A\) particle is given as \(m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}\). The goal is to determine the velocity of the \(A\) particles.

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is at rest, so its energy is \(m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV}\).
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately \(E_{\bar{p}} \approx m_p c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_p u^2\), where \(u\) is the antiproton's velocity.
   - The total initial energy is:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \left(m_p c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_p u^2\right) = 2 m_p c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_p u^2.
     \]
   - The total initial momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma m_p u \approx m_p u,
     \]
     where \(\gamma \approx 1\) since \(u \ll c\).

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - The final state consists of four \(A\) particles, each with rest mass \(m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}\).
   - Assuming all four \(A\) particles move in the same direction as the initial momentum, their total energy is:
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2,
     \]
     and their total momentum is:
     \[
     p_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A \beta c,
     \]
     where \(\beta = v/c\) and \(\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}\).

3. **Conservation of Energy and Momentum**:
   - From energy conservation:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = 2 m_p c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_p u^2.
     \]
   - From momentum conservation:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A \beta c = m_p u.
     \]

4. **Simplifying the Equations**:
   - Dividing the momentum equation by the energy equation gives:
     \[
     \beta = \frac{m_p u}{4 \gamma_A m_A c}.
     \]
   - Substituting \(\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}\) into the energy equation:
     \[
     4 \frac{m_A c^2}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}} = 2 m_p c^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_p u^2.
     \]

5. **Approximation for Slow Antiproton**:
   - Since the antiproton is moving slowly (\(u \ll c\)), \(\gamma \approx 1\), and the initial kinetic energy \(\frac{1}{2} m_p u^2\) is negligible compared to the rest energies. Thus, the total initial energy is approximately:
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} \approx 2 m_p c^2.
     \]
   - Substituting this into the energy conservation equation:
     \[
     4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2.
     \]
   - Solving for \(\gamma_A\):
     \[
     \gamma_A \approx \frac{m_p}{2 m_A} = \frac{938}{2 \cdot 300} \approx 1.5633.
     \]

6. **Relating \(\gamma_A\) to \(\beta\)**:
   - Using \(\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \beta^2}}\), we solve for \(\beta\):
     \[
     \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.409} \approx \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.769.
     \]
   - Thus, the velocity of the \(A\) particles is approximately \(v \approx 0.77c\).

### Conclusion

The velocity of the \(A\) particles is closest to **0.77c**, which corresponds to **Option A**.
