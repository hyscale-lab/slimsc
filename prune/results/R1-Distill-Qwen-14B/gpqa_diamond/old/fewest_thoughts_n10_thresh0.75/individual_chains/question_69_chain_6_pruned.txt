Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's read through it carefully. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. 

Alright, the given data: X⁰ has a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The decay is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are different resolutions, measured in meters.

Wait, what's the context here? I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when observed in a lab frame, the lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So the lifetime we observe is gamma times the proper lifetime, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

The problem is about the bubble chamber's ability to resolve the decay. So the chamber needs to have a resolution good enough to see the decay products. The resolution relates to the distance the particles travel before decaying. If the lifetime is longer, they move further, but the chamber's resolution must be able to detect that.

The key formula here is the time dilation formula: τ = γ τ₀. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is E/(m c²), but since we're dealing with units where c is 1 (like in natural units), gamma is just E/m. But wait, E is the total energy of the particle, which is given as 27 GeV. The mass is 3.41 GeV, so gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

Gamma = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.917. So τ = 7.917 × 8e-16 s ≈ 6.334e-15 seconds. 

But how does this help me find the minimum resolution? Oh, right, the distance the particle travels before decaying is vτ. So we need to find the velocity v of the particle. Since E is the total energy, and E = gamma m c², and the kinetic energy is E - m c². But for velocity, I think it's better to use beta, which is v/c. 

Beta can be found using beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma²)). Wait no, let me think. Gamma is E/(m c²), and beta is (pc)/(E), where p is the momentum. Alternatively, since E² = (pc)² + (m c²)², so (pc) = sqrt(E² - (m c²)²). But perhaps a simpler approach is to use beta = sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E²)} ). Oh, right, because beta is v/c, and beta squared is 1 - (m² c^4)/(E²) when everything is in terms of c=1 units.

So beta squared is 1 - (3.41^2)/(27^2). Let's compute that.

3.41 squared is approximately 11.63. 27 squared is 729.
