Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options give different sequences of reactions, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I'll draw the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl group connected to a ketone (ethan-1-one). The substituents on the benzene ring are a bromine and a nitro group. Looking at the numbering, the bromine is at position 3 and the nitro is at position 5. Wait, benzene rings are numbered in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, if the substituents are at positions 3 and 5, that's correct as 3 and 5 when the ring is numbered to give the lowest positions.

Now, the target molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the ketone is attached to position 1 (which is para to position 5, meta to 3, but wait, I should probably think about the substituents' positions again. Alternatively, perhaps the benzene has a ketone group at position 1, but in reality, in benzene, all positions are similar. Wait no, benzene is a six-membered ring, so if it's 3-bromo and 5-nitro, that's the same as 1,2,4 positions? No, wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me number the benzene ring with the ketone. So, the ketone is at position 1. Then bromine is at position 3 (two carbons away) and nitro at position 5 (four away?). Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the meta and para positions relative to each other. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think about the substituents' positions relative to the ketone.

Wait, the molecule is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, the phenyl group is attached to the carbonyl carbon (position 1). The substituents on the benzene ring are bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. Let me imagine the benzene ring with the ketone substituent. So the benzene has a ketone group attached at position 1. Then, the bromine is at position 3 (two positions away from 1) and nitro at position 5 (four positions away, but in a benzene ring, that's actually adjacent to position 1 because benzene is cyclic. Wait, noâ€”position 1, then positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 go around. So position 3 is meta to position 1, and position 5 is ortho to position 1. Wait, no. Because position 1 is the ketone, so position 2 is adjacent (ortho), position 3 is next (meta), position 4 is para, but in benzene, all positions are connected in a hexagonal way.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is
