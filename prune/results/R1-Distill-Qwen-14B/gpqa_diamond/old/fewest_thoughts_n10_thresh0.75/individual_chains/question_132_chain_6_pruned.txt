Alright, so I've got this NMR problem in front of me. Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about identifying two aromatic compounds from their NMR spectra. Hmm, I remember that NMR can tell us a lot about the structure based on the signals, like the number of peaks and their integration.

The problem states that the mixture is 1:1 of two compounds, both with the formula C10H14. So each compound is probably a substituted benzene. Wait, the molecular formula C10H14â€”benzene has six carbons, so the substituents must add four carbons. Oh, wait, each substituent is a methyl group? Because if it's four methyl groups, that's 4*(CH3) = 12 H's. Benzene is 6 C's, so 6 + 4*1 =10 C's. And for hydrogen, benzene has 6 H, each methyl has 3 H. So 6 + 4*3 = 18 H. But wait, the formula is C10H14. So maybe not all substituents are methyl or the structure is different. Let me think again. Alternatively, each substituent could be ethyl groups. Hmm, 2 ethyl groups would add 4 carbons (each ethyl is two carbons), but that would be 6 (benzene) + 2*(2) =10 C's. And for hydrogen, benzene has 6, each ethyl has 5 (since each is CH2CH3, which has 2 groups of 3 H each? Wait, no. Each ethyl group is -CH2CH3. So each has 2+3=5 H's. Two ethyl groups would add 10 H's. Benzene's 6 H's. So total 16 H's. But the formula is C10H14, which is 14 H. Hmm, so that doesn't fit. Maybe the substituents are a combination of methyl and something else? Or perhaps it's not all substituents being the same.

Wait, let me think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm, each in a 1:1 ratio, meaning each compound contributes one singlet. Also, there are three
