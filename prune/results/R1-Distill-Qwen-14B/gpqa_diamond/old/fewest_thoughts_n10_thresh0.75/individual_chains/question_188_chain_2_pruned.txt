Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with rhombohedral structures, but I remember that they have all sides equal and all angles the same. The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles α, β, γ are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane.

Wait, interplanar distance is the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. Oh right, that's calculated using something called the Miller indices, which in this case are (111). So the formula for interplanar distance, d, is given by the formula d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l² + ... some terms involving the angles). Oh wait, I think the formula for a general cubic system is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²), but rhombohedral is a bit different because the angles aren't 90 degrees.

Oh right! For a rhombohedral crystal, the formula for interplanar distance is a bit more complicated. The general formula is:

d = (a) / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + 2(hk cos α) + 2(hl cos β) + 2(kl cos γ) )

Wait, but wait, since in a rhombohedral structure, all the angles α, β, γ are equal. So for this problem, all three angles are 30 degrees. And the Miller indices here are
