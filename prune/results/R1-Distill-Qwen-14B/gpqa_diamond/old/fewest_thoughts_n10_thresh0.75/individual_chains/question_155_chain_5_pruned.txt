Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the uncertainty of Pz given that the system is in an eigenstate of Px. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔPz = sqrt⟨Pz²⟩ - ⟨Pz⟩². So I need to compute the expectation values of Pz and Pz squared.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let's denote this as |ψ⟩. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of Pz, which is the usual Pauli z basis, I think.

Wait, the operator Pz is given as a 3x3 matrix. Let me write that out. It's diagonal: first element is ħ, second is 0, third is -ħ. So Pz = diag(ħ, 0, -ħ).

So first, I need to compute ⟨Pz⟩, which is the expectation value. That's the bra vector multiplied by Pz, then multiplied by |ψ⟩.

But wait, since Pz is diagonal, it's easier. Each element Pz_ii is just the eigenvalue for basis vector i. So the expectation value ⟨Pz⟩ is the sum of |ψ_i|² * Pz_ii.

Let me calculate each component. The state vector has components:
ψ₁ = -1/2,
ψ₂ = 1/sqrt(2),
ψ₃ = -1/2.

So |ψ₁|² is ( (-1/2)^2 ) = 1/4.
Similarly, |ψ₂|² is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.
|ψ₃|² is 1/4.

So ⟨Pz⟩ = (1/4)(ħ) + (1/2)(0) + (1/4)(-ħ) = (1/4 ħ - 1/4 ħ) = 0. Oh, so ⟨Pz⟩ is zero.

Next, I need ⟨Pz²⟩. Since Pz is diagonal, Pz squared is just diag(ħ², 0, ħ²). So the expectation value ⟨Pz²⟩ is the same as |ψ₁|² * ħ² + |ψ₂|² * 0 + |ψ₃|² * ħ².

Calculating that: (1/4) ħ² + (1/2)*0 + (1/4) ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So now, ΔPz is sqrt(⟨Pz²⟩ - (⟨Pz⟩)^2 ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ²) - 0 ) = sqrt(1/2) ħ = ħ / sqrt(2). 

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake here. The state vector is given as (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let
