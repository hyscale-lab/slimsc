Okay, so I have this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find the relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic mechanics, but let's think this through.

First, the problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, wait. Relative speed in relativity isn't as straightforward as just subtracting the two speeds. Oh right, because at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just use classical addition. So I think the formula for relativistic velocity addition comes into play here.

The formula for relative velocity, when you have two objects moving at u and v relative to a rest frame, what's the speed that one sees the other moving at? I remember it's (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/(c²)). Oh wait, but in this case, since both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)).

Let me compute that. So the numerator is 0.1c. The denominator is 1 - (0.3c²)/(c²) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7. So 0.1c / 0.7 is approximately 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that's a clue.

Now for the total energy. Hmm, in relativity, the total energy isn't just the sum of their rest energies. Each astronaut has kinetic energy plus their rest energy. Oh, but wait, the question says "total energy of the system." So I think it's the sum of their individual energies.

Each astronaut's energy is given by the relativistic energy formula: E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute each one:

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.

Gamma for him is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.
