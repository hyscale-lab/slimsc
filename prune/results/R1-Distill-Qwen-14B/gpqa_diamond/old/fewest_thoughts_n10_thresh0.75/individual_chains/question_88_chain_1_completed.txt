Okay, so I've got this question about rotavirus and some experiments done on mice. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

The question says that inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are tagged with GFP and given to mice via oral gavage. Some fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, which makes sense because the stomach has a lot of acid. But some made it past and got entangled in intestinal mucus before reaching secondary lymphoid organs. They identified the fluorescent Peyer patches and isolated proliferating cells. When they sequenced the variable heavy chain gene, there was high variability. So the question is about which process is happening.

Wait, what's happening here? So Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), right? They're specialized for handling antigens that come into the intestine, like from food or oral vaccines.

The GFP-tagged proteins are probably being used as antigens here. So the mice are ingesting them, and the immune system is responding. The fact that some were destroyed by stomach acid but others reached the Peyer patches suggests that the ones that did get there triggered an immune response.

In the Peyer patches, antigen-presenting cells like M cells probably capture the antigens and present them to B cells. The B cells would then get activated. Now, when B cells are activated, they start to proliferate and differentiate. But the question says they isolated the proliferating cell population. So these are likely B cells that are dividing, perhaps in the process of an immune response.

The variable heavy chain gene has high variability. Wait, variable regions are on the B cell receptors (BCRs) and antibodies. High variability means that each B cell has a slightly different receptor. Oh, this sounds like something to do with the generation of diversity.

I'm trying to remember the processes. There's VDJ recombination, which happens during B cell development in the bone marrow, right? That's when the variable, diversity, and joining segments are combined to create the initial diversity of BCRs. But once the B cells are activated, another process comes into play.

Oh, right! Somatic hypermutation. That's a process that occurs in activated B cells, especially in the germinal centers. Somatic hypermutation introduces point mutations in the variable regions of the heavy and light chains of the BCR. This increases the diversity of the antibodies, allowing for a more specific response. So after the initial response, B cells undergo this process to tweak their receptors, leading to higher affinity antibodies.

Wait, but VDJ recombination is during the early stages, so the initial BCRs have variable regions, but somatic hypermutation happens later, after activation. So in this scenario, since the B cells are proliferating and showing high variability in their variable heavy chains, it must be somatic hypermutation that's happening. Because each cell is undergoing mutations, leading to different sequences.

Another option is class switching, but that's about changing the class of antibody (like from IgM to IgG) and doesn't directly cause variability in the variable regions. Complement activation is more about the complement system attacking pathogens, not the B cell receptor variation.

So the process is somatic hypermutation, which is option A.


The question involves an experiment where GFP-tagged inner capsid proteins of rotavirus are administered to mice via oral gavage. Some of the fluorescence is destroyed by stomach acid, while others reach the Peyer patches and trigger an immune response. The isolated proliferating cell population from the Peyer patches shows high variability in the variable heavy chain gene. This suggests a process that generates diversity in B cell receptors.

Peyer patches are part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and are specialized for handling antigens in the intestine. The GFP-tagged proteins likely act as antigens, activating B cells in the Peyer patches. The high variability in the variable heavy chain gene indicates a process that introduces mutations in the variable regions of the B cell receptors.

VDJ recombination occurs during early B cell development in the bone marrow and establishes the initial diversity of B cell receptors. However, this process does not explain the observed variability in the variable heavy chain gene after antigen activation. Class switching recombination involves changing the class of antibody (e.g., from IgM to IgG) and does not directly affect the variable regions. Complement activation is unrelated to B cell receptor variability.

Somatic hypermutation, on the other hand, is a process that occurs in activated B cells, particularly in germinal centers, where point mutations are introduced into the variable regions of the B cell receptors. This process increases the diversity of the antibodies and explains the high variability observed in the variable heavy chain gene. Since the B cells are proliferating and showing variability, somatic hypermutation is the most likely process occurring in this experiment.
