Alright, so I have this physics problem in front of me about the annihilation of gamma-rays with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons. The question is asking at what gamma-ray energy their lifetimes would be limited by this process. Hmm, okay, I remember that high-energy particles can interact with the CMB, and this interaction can limit their lifetimes because they get annihilated.

The problem states that the reaction is gamma-gamma → e+ e-. So, a high-energy gamma-ray colliding with a CMB photon produces an electron-positron pair. I think the CMB photons are low energy, right? The average photon energy is given as 1e-3 eV. So, the CMB is a bath of low-energy photons.

I remember that the cross-section for this kind of process depends on the energy of the gamma-ray. The cross-section is a measure of the probability of the interaction happening. For pair production via the γγ reaction, the cross-section increases as the energy of the gamma-ray increases, but it probably has some threshold conditions.

Wait, what's the threshold for producing an electron-positron pair from gamma-gamma collision? I think the minimum energy required is when the combined energy of the two photons is just enough to create the rest mass of the electron and positron. The rest mass energy of an electron is about 0.511 MeV each, so together 1.022 MeV. But since in the center-of-mass frame, the sum of the photon energies should be at least twice the electron mass.

But wait, in this case, one photon is a high-energy gamma, and the other is a CMB photon. So the threshold condition would be when the sum of their energies in the center-of-mass frame equals 2*m_e*c². Alternatively, in the lab frame, perhaps the product of their energies multiplied by some factors should meet a condition.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula here. Let me think. The process is γ + γ → e+ e-. The cross-section for this process depends on the energies of the two photons. The cross-section is probably proportional to σ ~ (s)/(m_e^4), where s is the square of the center-of-mass energy. Wait, no, the cross-section for pair production
