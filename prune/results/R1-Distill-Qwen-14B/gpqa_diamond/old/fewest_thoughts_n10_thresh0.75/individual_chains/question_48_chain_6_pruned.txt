Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about a series of organic reactions starting with cyclohexanone, and we need to determine the number of chemically distinct hydrogen atoms in the final product. Hmm, I remember that each step changes the structure, so I need to track each transformation carefully.

First, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I think cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, right? So its structure is a six-membered ring with one ketone group.

Step 1: Treating cyclohexanone with bromine. Wait, what reaction does bromine do with a ketone? Oh, I think that's the haloform reaction. In the haloform reaction, a halogen (like bromine) reacts with a methyl ketone. But wait, cyclohexanone isn't a methyl ketone—it's a cyclohexyl ketone. Oh, wait! No, wait a second—cyclohexanone is (cyclohexyl)ketone, but the haloform reaction requires a methyl group attached to the carbonyl. So, maybe I was wrong. Alternatively, could it be some kind of addition reaction?

Wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh right, sometimes ketones can undergo enolate formation under certain conditions, but bromine as a dienophile? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Another thought—could it be an aldol addition? No, because that typically involves a base. Alternatively, bromine could be adding across the carbonyl group in a ketone. Oh, wait, ketones can undergo halogenation via the enol mechanism. So when a ketone is treated with bromine, especially in a less substituted position, it might form a dihalide.

Wait, another idea: maybe the initial step is the bromination of the ketone. So cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Bromine can add across the carbonyl, but that would form a dibromide. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nucleophilic attack if the conditions are right. Wait, no, ketones are more prone to nucleophilic addition, but bromine is a dienophile. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromination of the ring itself. Wait, cyclohexanone has an alpha position (the methyl groups adjacent to the carbonyl), so maybe bromine is adding there.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Another approach: think about the product. So cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2)
