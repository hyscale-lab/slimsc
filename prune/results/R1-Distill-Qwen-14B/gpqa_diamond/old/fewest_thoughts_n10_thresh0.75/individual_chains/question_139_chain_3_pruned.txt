Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it carefully and try to break it down.

The question says that two compounds, A and B, are treated separately with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. This treatment produces two different diketones. I need to find out which starting materials A and B are from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite are usually involved in diazotization reactions. Diazonium salts, right? But wait, what happens after that? Oh, right, when amines are treated with HCl and NaNO2, they form diazonium salts. But wait, the products here are diketones. So maybe the starting materials aren't amines but something else that can form a diketone upon treatment.

Wait a second, another possibility comes to mind. If the starting material is a diol, maybe a glycol, and under certain conditions, it can undergo pinacol or oxy-Cope elimination. But wait, what's the role of HCl, H2O, and NaNO2 here? Oh wait, maybe it's not elimination. Another thought: could this be a case of the Stephen reduction or some kind of oxidation? Or wait, maybe it's about the formation of a carbonyl group from an alcohol.

Wait, another approach: sodium nitrite and HCl are often used in the production of diazonium salts from aromatic amines. But in the case of aliphatic amines, under certain conditions, they can form diazonium salts too. Then, when the diazonium salt is hydrolyzed with water, it can form a carbonyl group. For example, if you have an aryl diazonium salt, hydrolysis can give a ketone or a carboxylic acid, depending on the conditions. But in this case, the products are diketones, meaning two ketone groups are formed.

Wait, but how do you get two ketones from a single starting material? Let me think. Suppose the starting material is a diol with adjacent hydroxyl groups. If both hydroxyls are converted to diazonium salts and then hydrolyzed, each would give a carbonyl group. So, would that generate a diketone?

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a geminal diol, but those are less likely. Or maybe the
