Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me read it again and try to understand what's going on.

The question is about particles being collided in a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of around 20. On average, one third of them reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector's inner walls.

Hmm, okay. So I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that time. Because if a particle decays, it won't reach the walls. So, the fraction that reaches the walls depends on the particle's lifetime and their speed.

Wait, right! I remember that in particle physics, the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is multiplied by the Lorentz factor to get the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. So, if the particles have a proper lifetime τ, their lifetime in the lab is γτ, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

The detector has a radius R of 30 meters. So, the time it takes for a particle to reach the wall is the time it takes to travel 30 meters at its speed. But since they're moving at ultra-relativistic speeds, we can approximate their speed as the speed of light, right? So, the time t is approximately R / c. Let's compute that.

So, R is 30 meters. The speed of light c is about 3e8 meters per second. So t = 30 / (3e8) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 10^-7 seconds.

Wait, but particles are moving at a speed close to c, so the time is about 0.1 nanoseconds? Hmm, that seems really short. But okay, moving on.

So, the condition for a particle to reach the detector walls is that its lifetime (γτ) must be longer than the time it takes to reach the wall. Otherwise, it decays before reaching, so it doesn't contribute to the detector's signal.

But wait, in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is γτ. So, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed when it reaches the wall depends on
