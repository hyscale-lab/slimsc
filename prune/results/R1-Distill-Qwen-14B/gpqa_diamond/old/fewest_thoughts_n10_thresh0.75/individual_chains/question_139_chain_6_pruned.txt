Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question says that two compounds A and B are treated with hydrochloric acid, sodium nitrite, and water. After that, two different diketones are produced. I need to figure out what A and B are from the given options.

Wait, I remember that sodium nitrite and HCl are involved in some kind of reaction, maybe the formation of diazonium salts. Oh right, that's typically for aromatic amines, but wait, in the context of ketones or aldehydes? Or maybe it's related to the Stephen reduction or something else. Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: when a secondary amine is treated with HCl and NaNO2, it forms a diazonium chloride, which can undergo various reactions. Oh wait, but if the amine is adjacent to a carbonyl group, maybe we're talking about the formation of a carbocation or something else.

Wait, no. Another angle: I remember that the treatment of a carbonyl compound with HCl and NaNO2 under certain conditions can lead to the formation of a geminal diol. Oh wait, no, that's when you use something like H2S or other reagents. Alternatively, maybe it's about the formation of a hydrate, but I don't think that's right.

Wait, another thought: The Reimer-Tiemann reaction? No, that's for phenols. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the formation of a nitro
