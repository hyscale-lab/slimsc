Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The starting material is 7-(tert-butoxy)bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene. Wait, I remember bicyclo structures. Bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane is norbornane, right? So the structure is a norbornene with substituents. Oh, and the substituent is a tert-butoxy group at position 7. So, the starting compound has an oxygen connected to a tert-butyl group attached to the norbornene.

Then, this compound is combined with 2 equivalents of 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene and sodium iodide at elevated temperature. Sodium iodide is a good nucleophile, and I think it's a substitution reaction. The dibromomethyl groups might be leaving groups. Wait, 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene is a cyclohexadiene with two CH2Br2 groups on carbons 5 and 6. So each of those positions has two bromines. Maybe this is a diene undergoing some kind of Diels-Alder reaction? Or perhaps it's a diene that's acting as a dienophile?

Wait, but the starting material is a bicyclo diene. Maybe the norbornene is acting as a diene in a Diels-Alder reaction. So the bicyclo diene (like norbornadiene) could react with the other dienophile. But the other molecule has two dienophile groups? Or each of the two substituents is a dienophile?

Alternatively, the reaction could be a ring-opening of the norbornene with the dibromomethyl groups. Because when you have dienes and dienophiles, Diels-Alder is a possibility. Let me think. The starting molecule is a diene (bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene), and the other compound has two dibromomethyl groups attached to a cyclohexa-1,3-diene. That structure sounds like a dienophile. So, perhaps the norbornene is the diene, and the cyclohexa-diene is the dienophile. But wait, Diels-Alder requires a diene (conjugated double bonds) and a dienophile (like a ketone, ester, or another dienophile with electron-withdrawing groups). But in this case, the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is conjugated, but the substituents are Br on methyl groups. Hmm, maybe the cyclohexa-1,3-diene is actually a dienophile.

Wait, but 5,6-bis(dibromomethyl)cyclohexa-1,3-diene. So the main ring is a cyclohexa-
