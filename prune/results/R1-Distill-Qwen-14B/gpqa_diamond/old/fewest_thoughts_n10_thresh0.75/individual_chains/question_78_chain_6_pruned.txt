Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the potentials in electromagnetism. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the scalar potential V and the vector potential A for a moving point charge. I remember that when charges move, they produce both electric and magnetic fields, and the potentials are related to these fields.

The setup is a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're considering the potentials at a later time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the field was generated. So, that makes sense because the potentials are retarded; they depend on the state of the charge at an earlier time.

The problem gives me four options, A to D, each with different expressions for V and A. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I recall that the scalar potential V is given by Coulomb's law when the charge is static. But when the charge is moving, there might be some adjustments. Wait, no, the scalar potential is still due to the charge's position at the retarded time. So, the expression for V should look similar to the static case but modified by any motion effects.

Wait, but wait. The scalar potential for a charge at rest is V = q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between the charge and the observation point. But when the charge is moving, does V change? Hmm, maybe not directly because the potential is sourced by the charge's position at the retarded time. So, for the scalar potential, it's still similar to the static case, but with r being the distance at the retarded time.

Wait, but in the options, the denominator often has terms involving d and v. Let me think. The vector d is from the field's generation point (at tr) to the observation point r. So d is a vector, and in the options, sometimes it's multiplied by c and so on.

Wait, the general form for the potentials when charges are moving is given by the retarded potentials. So, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1/(d c - d ⋅ v), where d is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point. Or wait, maybe I have to think in terms of the denominator being (c times the time it took for
