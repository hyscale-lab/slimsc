Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what I can do. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then figuring out what it reacts to form when treated with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus with HI is usually a dehydrohalogenation reaction, maybe eliminating to form an alkene.

First, let's look at the data. The IR shows strong peaks. The 3400â€“2500 cm-1 region is probably O-H or N-H stretching. Since there's a peak around 1720 cm-1, that might be a carbonyl group, like a ketone or ester or maybe an acid. The peaks at 1610 and 1450 cm-1 could be aromatic C=C stretching, so the compound likely has a benzene ring.

Looking at the NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's probably an acidic proton, like a carboxylic acid. The broad singlet makes sense because carboxylic acids have broad peaks. So maybe there's a COOH group.
- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): This looks like a para-substituted benzene ring. Two doublets with integral 2 each. So, something like two substituents opposite each other on the benzene.
- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet, maybe from a CH group adjacent to something electronegative, maybe next to a carbonyl or an oxygen.
- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Two protons in a multiplet, perhaps adjacent to another CH group.
- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet from a CH3 group attached to something, maybe a CH2 group that's next to a CH.
- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet, likely from a terminal CH3 in an ethyl chain.

Putting this together, maybe it's a benzoic acid derivative. The 10.5 ppm peak is the COOH proton. The aromatic protons are para-substituted, so the substituents are on opposite positions.

Looking at the substituents: We have a CH2CH(CH2CH3) group perhaps? Let me think about the structure. The NMR shows a CH adjacent to a carbonyl, then some branching. Let's try to sketch it.

Wait, let's try to build the molecule. The benzene ring has a substituent in the para position. That substituent is a chain leading to a carbonyl group (since IR shows 1720 cm-1). So maybe it's a benzoyl group attached to an ethyl group or something.

Wait, but the NMR shows a CH at 2.9 ppm, which is probably next to a carbonyl. Then the 1.7 ppm multiplet could be the next CH2, and then 1.4 ppm is a CH3 attached to that CH2.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like Ph-C(O)-CH2-CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the 1.4 ppm is a triplet of 3H, which is a methyl attached to something. Let's think again.

Alternatively, the structure of compound X could be a benzene ring with a substituent that's a ketone (since 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl, but wait, if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl might be lower. Wait, no, carboxylic acids have O-H and a carbonyl around 1700. So 1720 is a bit high, but maybe it's a ketone or an ester. Hmm.

Wait, the NMR shows a broad peak at 10.5, which is a strong indication of a -COOH group. So the COOH is present. So the
