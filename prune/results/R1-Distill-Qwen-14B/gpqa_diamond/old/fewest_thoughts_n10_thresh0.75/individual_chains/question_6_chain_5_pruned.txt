Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the energy spectrum of a particle in a two-dimensional potential. The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² cos²θ. The options are different expressions for the energy E in terms of n_x and n_y, which are probably quantum numbers.

Wait, I remember that in two dimensions, especially when dealing with polar coordinates, the problem can sometimes be separable. If the potential depends on r and θ in a way that allows the Schrödinger equation to separate into radial and angular parts, then the solution might involve the product of radial and angular wavefunctions.

Let me think about the form of the potential. The potential has two terms: the first is (1/2)kr², which looks like a harmonic oscillator potential in two dimensions because the standard 2D harmonic oscillator has V(r) proportional to r². The second term is (3/2)kr² cos²θ. Hmm, cos²θ can be written using a double-angle identity. Cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2. So maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms that split into functions of r and θ.

Let me rewrite the potential:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/2)kr² * [ (1 + cos2θ) / 2 ]

Wait, expanding that, (3/2)kr² * (1/2) is (3/4)kr². And (3/2)kr² * cos2θ/2 is (3/4) kr² cos2θ. So:

V(r, θ) = (1/2)kr² + (3/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Combine the terms without cos2θ: (1/2 + 3/4) kr² = (5/4) kr². So,

V(r, θ) = (5/4) kr² + (3/4) kr² cos2θ.

Wait, but I can factor out kr² (1/4)(5 + 3 cos2θ). So,

V(r, θ) = (kr² /4) (5 +
