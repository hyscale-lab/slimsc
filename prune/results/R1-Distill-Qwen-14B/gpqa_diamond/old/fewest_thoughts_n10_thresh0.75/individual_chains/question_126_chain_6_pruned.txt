Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm just starting to learn about these reactions. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products. I'll start by looking at each reaction separately.

Reaction I is treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH (Lithium Aluminum Hydride) followed by an acidic workup. I remember that LAH is a strong reducing agent. It usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, hexan-3-one is a ketone, right? The structure is CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3. When LAH reduces it, the carbonyl (C=O) becomes a CH2-OH group. So it should become a secondary alcohol. Wait, but waitâ€”does LAH do anything else? I think sometimes LAH can also reduce esters, but in this case, the compound is a ketone with a methoxy group. Oh, the methoxy is on carbon 5, so the structure after reduction should be CH2CH(OH)CH2CH2CH2OCH3. So, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Wait, wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the carbonyl is at position 3. So reducing it would give a secondary alcohol at position 3. So the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Hmm, but wait, when you reduce a ketone, you form a secondary alcohol. So, the stereochemistry would be preserved if the reduction is stereospecific. Because LAH is a strong reducing agent, but in this case, the starting material is a single enantiomer. So the product would retain the configuration? Or wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C3. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon. In the case of ketones, the hydride comes from the same face as the existing substituents to give the alcohol with the same configuration as the starting ketone? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Wait, ketones are planar at the carbonyl, so when LAH reduces it, the hydride attack can come from either face, leading to a mixture of R and S configurations. Wait, but wait! No, wait. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at C3. But wait, wait. Wait, the starting material is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so the carbonyl is at C3. The structure is CH2CH2 (positions 1 and 2), then C=O at 3, then CH2-CH2-OCH3 at positions 4,5,6? No, wait, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2C(O)CH2CH2CH3. But with the 5-methoxy substituent. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-OCH3? Wait, maybe I should draw it.

Structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one:
