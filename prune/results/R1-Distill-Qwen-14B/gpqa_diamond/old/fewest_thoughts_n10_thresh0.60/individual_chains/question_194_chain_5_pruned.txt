Okay, so I've got this statistical mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the partition function Z for a system of three spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is the sum over all possible states of the Boltzmann factor for each state.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1. So for three spins, each has two choices, meaning there are 2^3 = 8 possible states. I need to find the energy for each of these states and then sum up the corresponding terms for Z.

The energy is given by E = -J [ S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 ]. Let me see, J is a coupling constant. Since each S can be ±1, the product S_i S_j will be +1 if the spins are aligned and -1 if anti-aligned. 

Wait, but the energy is negative J times the sum of these products. So, each term S_i S_j is either +1 or -1. Let's think about the possible values for this sum.

Let me list all possible states. Each state is a triplet (S1, S2, S3). There are 8 of them. Maybe it's easier to think about the possible values of the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

Wait, another approach: the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can be rewritten. Let me see, perhaps in terms of the product of all three spins. Because (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = S1^2 + S2^2 + S3^2 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Since each S is ±1, S_i^2 is 1. So (S1 + S2 + S3)^2 = 3 + 2(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me solve for the sum:

S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 = [ (S1+S2+S3)^2 - 3 ] / 2.

Hmm, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, for each state, compute the sum.

Alternatively, think about the number of aligned pairs. Each term S_i S_j is 1 if aligned, -1 if not. So the sum is (number of aligned pairs
