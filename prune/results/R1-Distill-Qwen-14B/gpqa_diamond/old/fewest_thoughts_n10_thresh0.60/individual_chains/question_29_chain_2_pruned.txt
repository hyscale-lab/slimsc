Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading through it carefully.

So the question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound, and they've found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking at the sequence of the target gene in these mutants.

The intact gene sequence is given, and then four mutants (1-4). The question is which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. So the idea is that the compound is made by the gene, so if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made. So we need a mutation that disrupts the gene's function.

Looking at the sequences, it's about where the changes are. The target area is the beginning of the first exon. So the mutations are in the first exon's beginning.

Each mutant has a change in the first exon. Let's look at the sequences.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So comparing the first part. The intact has ...TTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT...
Mutant 1 has ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGT...

Wait, the fourth codon in the wildtype is TCT (Ser), in mutant 1 it's TCA (Ser), but wait, same amino acid. Hmm, but wait, the fifth codon is CGC (Arg) in wildtype. In mutant1, it's changed to GCT (Ala). Wait, let me check:

Wait, maybe I should line them up.

Intact:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGT... 

Wait, perhaps I should write the sequences:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG... 

Wait, let me break each into codons.

Intact:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCTGTG...

Wait, maybe I should look at each codon.

Intact: The first few codons are ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Mutant 1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTCT...

So the first codon is same. Second codon is same (TTT). Third codon: CTC (Leu) in wild becomes CTA (Leu) in mutant 1. So same amino acid. Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) becomes CGC (Arg). That's a change. So Ala to Arg. Different amino acid, but does that cause a problem? Maybe not. Let's check the next codon. Wild: GGT (Gly) becomes TGG (Trp) in mutant 1? Wait, no, let's see:

Intact's
