Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r squared radially. So, the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I remember that divergence is a measure of how much the field is spreading out or converging at a point.

Wait, so the field is radial, which means it's pointing directly away from the origin, right? And its strength is 1/r². That rings a bell—like the electric field of a point charge. Oh wait, but for the electric field, the divergence is zero except at the origin where the charge is. But wait, no, the divergence of a radial field like this... Let me think.

The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field that's purely radial is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), right? Because the other components (like theta and phi) are zero. So in this case, f_r is 1/r², so let's compute that.

So, f_r = 1/r². Then, the derivative of r² f_r with respect to r is the derivative of (r² * 1/r²) = derivative of 1. Oh wait, that's zero. So the divergence would be (1/r²) * 0 = 0. So the divergence of f is zero everywhere except perhaps at r=0.

So if the divergence is
