Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A) 1, B) 3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated based on the formula Degree of Unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. Well, in this case, I don't think there's any N or X, so it's (2C +2 - H)/2.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, that's the reaction where the phosphorus acts as a reducing agent, specifically for the elimination of halogen from compounds. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Red phosphorus is used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that's for ketones or aldehydes. Alternatively, when you have red phosphorus and HI, it's a deoxygenation reaction, perhaps removing carbonyl groups.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure mentally. It's a cyclohexene ring. Position 3 is a double bond (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH2CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-).

So the structure is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2,3, and 5 positions. 2-formyl, 5-vinyl, and the ring is cyclohex-3-ene. Additionally, there's a carboxylic acid group (COOH), so I think that's at position 1 or another position, but the numbering might be such that position 1 is the carboxylic acid.

Wait, the name
