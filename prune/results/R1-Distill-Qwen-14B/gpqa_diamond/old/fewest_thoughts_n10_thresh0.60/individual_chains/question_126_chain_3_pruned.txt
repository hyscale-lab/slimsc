Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. It's about reactions involving ketones and the products they form after certain reagents. The question is about how many peaks will appear when the products are run on different HPLC columns. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the problem carefully. So, there are two reactions, I and II. Each involves treating a specific compound with a reagent, then an acidic workup. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on HPLC columns: one normal-phase and one chiral. The question is about the number of peaks observed in each.

Let me think about each reaction separately.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH (lithium aluminum hydride) followed by acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent. Typically, it reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, but waitâ€”the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. The structure would be CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Or wait, no, wait. Hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-(CH2)3? No, wait: hexan-3-one is (CH2)2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait: I think I should write the structure correctly.

Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. Is that right? So, position 3 is the ketone. So the molecule is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2CH2CH3. Now, with a methoxy group on carbon 5. So carbon 5: in hexan-3-one, the carbonyl is at position 3. So the positions are 1, 2, 3 (C=O), 4,5,6.

So 5-methoxy would be on carbon 5. So the structure is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH
