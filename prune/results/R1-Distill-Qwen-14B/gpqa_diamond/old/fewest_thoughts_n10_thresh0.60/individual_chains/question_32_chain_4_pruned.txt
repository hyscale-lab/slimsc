Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The question is asking for the energy of the collider such that the speed of the nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons, so I think that means it's Lithium-6 because Li typically has 3 protons, and if it has 3 neutrons, the mass number would be 6. So the nucleus is Li-6.

First, I need to find the energy of the ion in the collider. From what I remember, in particle physics, when dealing with relativistic speeds, the energy of a particle is given by the relativistic energy equation. Oh right, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy, where gamma is the Lorentz factor.

Gamma, γ, is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since the speed v is 0.96c, I can plug that in. Let me calculate that.

So v = 0.96c. Then v squared is (0.96)^2 c², which is 0.9216 c². So 1 - v²/c² is 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of that is sqrt(0.0784) which is 0.28, because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So gamma is 1 divided by 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 = 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is 0.28 because 0.28^2=0.0784, yes. So gamma is 1 / 0.28. Let me compute that: 1 divided by 0.28 is approximately 3.57142857.

So gamma is about 3.5714.

Now I need the rest mass energy of the Li-6 nucleus. The rest mass energy is mc². The mass of a Li-6 nucleus is the atomic mass. The atomic mass of Li-6 can be found using the periodic table. Let me recall: the atomic mass of lithium is about 6.941 g/mol. Wait, but for a single nucleus, the mass would be in atomic mass units (u). So one mole is Avogadro's number, so each nucleus is 6.941 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number (6.022e23) and then converted into kilograms. Alternatively, I can just look up the mass of a Li-6 nucleus in kilograms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the atomic mass in u and then multiply by c² and convert to GeV. But I might need to remember the conversion factors.

Wait, I think 1 u is approximately 931.5 MeV/c². So the rest mass energy in MeV is mass in u multiplied by 931.5. Then I can convert that to GeV by dividing by 1000.

So, the mass of Li-6: since Li has an atomic number of 3, and it's Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. The mass of a proton is about 1.007276 u, and neutron is about 1.008665 u. Wait, but wait, the actual mass of a Li-6 nucleus isn't exactly 6 u because of binding energy, right? Or wait, no, the atomic mass includes electrons as well. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait the nucleus is Li-6, which has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making a total of 6 nucleons. The mass of each proton is about 1.00727
