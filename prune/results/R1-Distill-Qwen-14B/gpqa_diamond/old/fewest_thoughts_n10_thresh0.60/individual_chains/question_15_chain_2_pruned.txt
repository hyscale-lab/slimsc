Okay, so I've got this question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method involves a planet passing in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of a transit depends on various factors like the star's size and the planet's orbit.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, which was detected via the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method gives us the minimum mass, but since both have the same detected mass, maybe that's not the factor here.

Wait, the key factors for transit probability are the orbital period and the star's size. I think the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to align with our line of sight. The formula I remember is something like (R_star / a) where a is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

But wait, the semi-major axis is related to the orbital period via Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets have the same mass as each other (same mass), and the stars have different masses, the semi-major axes will vary.

Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. Let me think: if P1 is shorter, then a1 is smaller, because for a given star mass, a shorter period means closer orbit. Because Kepler's law says P² is proportional to a³/(M_star), so a is proportional to (P² * M_star)^(1/3).

So for Planet_1, P1 = P2 / 3.

Wait, no: the question says Planet_1's period is three times shorter, so P1 = P2 / 3. So let me compute a1 and a2.

Since M1 is the mass of the star for Planet_1, which is twice that of Planet_2's star (M2). So M1 = 2*M2.

Using Kepler's law: a³ = (G(M + m) P²) / (4π²). Since m is much smaller than M, we can approximate M as the star's mass.

So a1³ ∝ (M1) * P1² = (2M2) * (P2² / 9) ) [because P1 is (P2/3), so squared is
