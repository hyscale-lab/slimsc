Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) inside a sphere of radius R. The field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². Also, the field has only a radial component in spherical coordinates. Hmm.

Wait, divergence. Right, divergence is a measure of how much a vector field is spreading out or converging at a point. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only radial component is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r), if I remember correctly. So since the field is only radial, the other terms would drop out.

So the vector field f(r) has magnitude 1/r² and is radial. So f_r is 1/r², and the other components (like theta and phi) are zero.

Let me write down the divergence formula for this case. So,

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r )

Substituting f_r = 1/r²,

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ) ]

Simplify the expression inside the derivative: r² * (1/r²) is 1. So,

∇ · f = (1/r²) * d/dr (1)

The derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇ · f equals zero? That can't be right. Wait
