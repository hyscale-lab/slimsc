Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I remember that the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I think I need to use bond energies for this calculation.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. Wait, that looks a bit complicated. Let me count the number of each type of bond in this molecule. Oh wait, no, maybe I should think about how to break this down. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can be calculated using the formula:

Enthalpy of formation = (sum of bond energies of reactants) - (sum of bond energies of products)

Wait, no, actually, I think I might be mixing this up. Let me recall. The standard approach is to calculate the enthalpy change by considering the bonds broken and formed. Since the problem gives bond energies, maybe I need to compute the total energy required to break all the bonds in the reactants and subtract the energy released when the bonds in the product are formed.

Wait, the problem here is about the enthalpy of formation, which is the reverse of the formation reaction. So, the formula would be: 

Enthalpy of formation = sum of bond energies of all bonds broken in reactants - sum of bond energies of all bonds formed in products.
