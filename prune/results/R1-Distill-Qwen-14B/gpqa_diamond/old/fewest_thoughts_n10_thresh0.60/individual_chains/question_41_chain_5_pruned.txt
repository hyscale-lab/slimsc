Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about light moving through a glass that's itself moving. Hmm, okay, let's try to break it down. I remember from my basic physics classes that when you have objects moving relative to each other, you sometimes need to consider things like velocity addition, especially when dealing with light. But wait, light is tricky because it's always speed is c in a vacuum, right?

The question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v, same direction as the beam and towards the observer. So the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards them. I'm supposed to find the speed of the light relative to the observer.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n. So in the glass, it's moving at c/n. But the glass itself is moving towards the observer at velocity v. Now, how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I think this has to do with the addition of velocities. Like when you have two objects moving relative to each other, you use the velocity addition formula. But wait, isn't that part of special relativity? Because in classical mechanics, you just add velocities, but relativity changes that when speeds are significant compared to c.

Wait, but the speed of light in the glass is v_light = c/n. So from the frame of the glass, the light is moving at v_light towards the observer. But the glass itself is moving towards the observer at v. So the observer would see the light's speed as the sum of
