Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? So the spin state χ is given as χ = [3i, 4]^T. I think that's a column vector, so each component is a complex number. Oh wait, maybe I should write it as a column vector for clarity. So χ = |3i; 4>.

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Right, because expectation values are calculated using the bra-ket notation. So I need to find the matrix representation of S_y, then compute this inner product.

Wait, the note says that σ_y is the Pauli matrix:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

Oh right, because S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. And I remember that S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. Oh yeah, because spin operators are S = (ħ/2) σ for each component. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So the matrix for S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by that σ_y matrix. Let me write that out:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
               [i, 0]]

So that's our operator
