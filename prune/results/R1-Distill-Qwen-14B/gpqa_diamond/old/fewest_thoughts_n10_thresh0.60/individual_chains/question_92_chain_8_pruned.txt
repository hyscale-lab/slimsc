Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, the compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit of a mouthful. Let me try to parse it.

Wait, enthalpy of formation usually refers to the change in enthalpy when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But the question gives me bond energies, so maybe I should approach it using the bond enthalpy method instead. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation can sometimes be calculated using bond energies by considering the bonds broken and formed.

The data provided includes the enthalpy of atomization for carbon, which is 1000 kJ/mol. Oh, right, the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break all bonds in an element to produce isolated atoms. For carbon, which forms four bonds in a molecule (like in graphite or diamond), so each C atom would need 1000 kJ/mol to be atomized.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives bond energies for C-C, C=C, C-H, H-H. Hmm. So I think the approach is to calculate the total energy required to break all bonds in the compound and then compare it to the energy released when those atoms form the compound.

But wait, no. Another approach is to calculate the enthalpy of formation using the bond energies. The formula is:
