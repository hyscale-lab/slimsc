Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The starting material is cyclohexanone. Then it goes through several reactions, and we need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product, product 4.

Let me break down each step.

First step: cyclohexanone treated with bromine forms product 1. Wait, cyclohexanone is a ketone. Bromine, Br2, in what conditions? Well, when ketones react with bromine, the most common reaction is the addition to the carbonyl group. But wait, ketones don't usually add bromine in the same way as alkenes. Oh wait, wait—wait a second, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. So adding bromine would probably lead to a dihydroxy dibromide? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's a bromohydrin formation. Wait, no—bromine in a different solvent? Let me think. Oh, wait, another possibility: perhaps the cyclohexanone is undergoing a ring-opening reaction? No, the ring is cyclohexane with a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. Bromine (Br2) in a polar aprotic solvent like acetone can undergo a ketone addition. So the carbony
