Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. I'm a bit rusty on my particle physics, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed in the Bubble Chamber to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. The decay process is X⁰ → Y⁺ Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8×10^-16 seconds. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime can be longer due to time dilation if they're moving at relativistic speeds. The proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So, in the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer by the Lorentz factor gamma (γ).

Right, the lifetime observed (τ) is τ = γ * τ₀. So, I need to calculate γ first. Gamma is equal to the total energy of the particle divided by its rest mass energy. Because E = γ m c², but since we're dealing with units where c is 1, it's just E = γ m. So γ = E / m.

Wait, the energy E is 27 GeV, and the mass m is 3.41 GeV. Let me plug those numbers in. γ = 27 / 3.41. Let me do that calculation. 27 divided by 3.41... Well, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, which is less than 27. 3.41 * 8 is 27.28, which is just a bit more than 27. So 27/3.41 is approximately 7.92. Let me compute it more accurately.

3.41 times 7 is 23.87. 27 minus 23.87 is 3.13. 3.13 /3.41 is about 0.918. So 7 + 0.918 is 7.918, roughly 7.92. So γ is about 7.92.

So, the observed lifetime τ = γ τ
