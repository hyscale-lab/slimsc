Okay, so I need to figure out which stars can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. Let's see, I remember that each spectrograph has a magnitude limit. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag, and HIRES can go down to 16 V mag. So a star needs to be brighter (smaller magnitude number) than 17 for ESPRESSO, but for HIRES, it needs to be brighter than 16. So, the star must have an apparent V magnitude less than 16 to be seen by both, because if it's brighter than 16, HIRES can't see it, but wait no, wait. Wait, the question is about which stars can be detected by both. So the star's apparent magnitude must be brighter than both 17 and 16, but wait that's not possible. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. 

Wait, the ESPRESSO can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17. So, any star with V mag <17 is detectable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can detect stars with V mag <16. So, the star must be brighter (so lower magnitude) than 16. Because if the star's apparent magnitude is, say, 15, both can detect it. But if it's 16, HIRES can, but ESPRESSO can't because it's only up to 17. Wait no, no, the question says
