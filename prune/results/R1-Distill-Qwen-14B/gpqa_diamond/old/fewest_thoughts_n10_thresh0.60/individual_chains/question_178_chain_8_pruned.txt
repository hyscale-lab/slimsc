Okay, so I have this question about the Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, let's see. I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the coupling constant plays a role in renormalizability. So, the idea is that for a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive mass dimensions? Or wait, maybe it's that the mass dimension needs to be ≥ something. Let me think.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. Right, so σ is antisymmetric and relates to the spinor representation.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should determine the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to have mass dimension 4 because it's integrated over four-dimensional spacetime, so each term must have [Lagrangian density] = 4 in mass dimension.

So, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let's break down each part.

The Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation tells us that (iD - m)ψ = 0. The derivative D has dimension 1, so each term in the equation must match. So ψ has dimension 3/2. Therefore, ψ̄ also has dimension 3/2.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism or another gauge field. F is the derivative of the gauge field A, so F has dimension 2 (since A has dimension 1, and derivative is 1). So [F^{μν}] = 2.

σ_{μν} is made up of gamma matrices, which have dimension 1 each. Since σ is a commutator of two gammas, its dimension is [γ_mu][γ_nu] = 1 + 1 = 2. Wait, but the definition is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu], so the commutator is dimension 2. So σ_{μν} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together. The term is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

So each factor's dimensions:

κ: [κ] 

ψ̄: 3/2 

σ: 2 

ψ: 3/2 

F: 2 

Multiplying all together: [κ] * (3/2) * 2 * (3/2) * 2.

Let me compute that step by step. 

3/2 * 2 = 3. Then 3 * 3/2 = 9/2. 9/2 * 2 = 9. So [κ] * 9 must equal 4 because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. 

Wait, no, because the Lagrangian is a sum of terms each with dimension 4. So the entire term κ ψ̄
