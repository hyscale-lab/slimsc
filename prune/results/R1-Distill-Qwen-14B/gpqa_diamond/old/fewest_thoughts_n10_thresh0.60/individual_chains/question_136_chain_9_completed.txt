Okay, so I have this physics problem here about vector fields and volume integrals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my vector calculus, but let me try to work through this step by step.

The problem says that the vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r². So the magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², right? And it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. So f(r) is a vector field pointing radially outward (I guess, or maybe inward depending on the sign, but since the magnitude is given, direction might not matter right now).

The question is asking about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of f inside a sphere of radius R. So I need to compute the integral of ∇·f over the volume of this sphere. Oh wait, I remember that there's a theorem related to this... Gauss's Law maybe? Or is it the Divergence Theorem?

Wait, Divergence Theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = ∫∫ (f · n) dA over the surface. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the approach I should take here. Alternatively, maybe I can compute the divergence in spherical coordinates and then integrate.

Since the field is radial and only has a radial component, the divergence formula in spherical coordinates for a vector field with components (f_r, f_θ, f_φ) is ∇·f = (1/r²)(df_r/dr) + (1/(r sinθ))(d(f_θ sinθ)/dθ) + (1/(r sinθ))(d f_φ/dφ)/r. But wait, since all components except f_r are zero, the other terms vanish. So the divergence is just (1/r²) d(f_r)/dr. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The general formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is (1/r²)(d(r² f_r)/dr) + ... other terms for θ and φ. But since f only has an r component, the divergence simplifies.

So f = f_r r̂, where f_r = 1/r². So the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Let's compute that. So f_r is 1/r², so r² f_r is r² * (1/r²) = 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Wait, that would mean the divergence is zero? No, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere inside the sphere, then the volume integral would be zero. But wait, what about the origin?

Wait a second. Oh, right, because when r is zero, the field might have a singularity. So maybe I'm missing something here. Let me go through this again.

So the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r). Since f_r = 1/r², r² f_r = (r²)(1/r²) = 1. So derivative of 1 with respect to r is 0. So ∇·f is zero everywhere except at r=0. So yeah, the divergence is zero except at the origin.

But wait, the problem is about integrating over a volume. So if the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, then the integral would be zero. But wait, no, because the divergence theorem can account for sources and sinks. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about the field. If the field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, then in Cartesian terms, it's like f(x,y,z) = (x, y, z)/(x² + y² + z²)^(3/2), right? Because each component is (x/(r^3)), since r^2 is (x² + y² + z²), so 1/r² would be 1/(r²), and each component is x/(r³) which is (x/r²)*(1/r). Hmm, wait, no. Let me write it correctly.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the unit vector r̂ is in the radial direction, so the vector field is (1/r²) r̂. So in terms of Cartesian coordinates, that would be ( (x/r²), (y/r²), (z/r²) ), but r is sqrt(x²+y²+z²). So each component is (x)/(x²+y²+z²)^(3/2) * r^2? Wait, no. Wait, r^2 is (x²+y²+z²), so 1/r² is 1/(x²+y²+z²). So each component is x/(x²+y²+z²)^(3/2) times something. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about this in terms of Gauss's Law. Gauss's Law states that the integral of E · dA over a closed surface is equal to the charge enclosed divided by ε₀. But here, if f is analogous to an electric field, then the divergence would relate to charge density.

Wait, but in this problem, the vector field is f(r) = 1/r². Hmm, for the electric field of a point charge, E(r) = (k Q)/r² r̂, so the divergence of E is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function. So the volume integral of the divergence would be the charge enclosed, Q/ε₀ if we're in that scenario.

But wait, in this problem, the field is f(r) = 1/r². So scaling aside, if f were the electric field of a point charge, then the integral of the divergence over any volume not containing the origin would be zero, but if the volume contains the origin, then it would be non-zero, equal to the charge.

But the problem says the field falls off as 1/r², so perhaps the divergence is zero except at r=0. So when I integrate the divergence over the volume of the sphere, if the sphere includes the origin, the integral would be a constant, perhaps, like 4π times the charge density or something similar.

Wait, but in this problem, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r², which seems like it's decreasing as 1/r². The electric field of a point charge with charge Q is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (Q/r²) r̂. The divergence of E is (1/ε₀) ρ, where ρ is charge density. But for a point charge, the charge density is a delta function at the origin, so ∇·E = (1/ε₀) δ³(r). So the integral of ∇·E over all space is Q/ε₀, which is the total charge.

But in our problem, the vector field f(r) is given, and it's f(r) = 1/r² r̂. Let's compute ∇·f. As I thought earlier, in spherical coordinates, the divergence of a purely radial vector field f(r) r̂ is given by (1/r²) d/dr (r² f(r)).

So plugging in f(r) = 1/r²:

d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = d/dr (1) = 0.

So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0, except at r=0, where it's not defined and might have a delta function.

Wait, but in this case, the field f(r) is given as 1/r², so when you compute the divergence, you get zero everywhere except at r=0. So the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R would be zero, unless the sphere includes the origin. But since the sphere is centered at the origin with radius R, the origin is inside the sphere. So the integral can't be zero because the divergence isn't zero at the origin.

Wait, but wait. The divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. So when I integrate over the volume except r=0, the integral is zero. But the origin is a point of zero volume. So how can the integral be non-zero?

Ah, but that's where the delta function comes in. If f(r) is such that its divergence is a delta function at the origin, then the integral over any volume containing the origin would be the coefficient of the delta function.

So let me compute ∇·f again.

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² f(r)).

f(r) = 1/r².

So r² f(r) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0.

But wait, that suggests ∇·f = 0 for r≠0.

Wait, but wait a minute. If f(r) is 1/r², then the divergence is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² (1/r²)) = (1/r²) * d/dr (1) = 0, so ∇·f is zero except at r=0, but wait, what about the behavior at r=0?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think: when f(r) is 1/r², the function is singular at r=0. So the divergence isn't zero everywhere except at r=0; actually, the divergence might be a delta function at the origin.

Wait, let me think about another way. The integral of ∇·f over all space should equal the flux through the surface. If f(r) is 1/r², then the flux through a sphere of radius R would be the surface integral of f · r̂ over the sphere. Since f is radial, the dot product is just f multiplied by the area. So the surface integral would be f(R) * 4π R². Since f(R) is 1/R², that gives (1/R²) * 4π R² = 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, the integral of ∇·f over the volume equals the integral of f · n over the surface. So ∫∫∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π. But this is true only if the divergence isn't zero everywhere. So in this case, the divergence must be a delta function at the origin that gives a total integral of 4π.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the surface integral.

f(r) = 1/r² r̂. So the flux through the sphere of radius R is ∫ (f · r̂) dA over the sphere. Since f is radial, the dot product is 1/r² * r̂ · r̂, which is 1/r². So the integral is ∫ (1/r²) * r² sinθ dθ dφ, but wait, no, the area element in spherical coordinates is r² sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, so for a sphere of radius R, r is fixed at R, so the area element is R² sinθ dθ dφ.

So the surface integral would be ∫ (f · r̂) dA = ∫ (1/R²) * (R² sinθ dθ dφ) ) = ∫ (1) * sinθ dθ dφ. The limits are from θ=0 to π and φ=0 to 2π. So the integral becomes ( ∫ (0 to π) sinθ dθ ) * ( ∫ (0 to 2π) dφ ). The integral of sinθ from 0 to π is [ -cosθ ] from 0 to π = (-cos π) - (-cos 0) ) = (1 +1 )=2. The integral of dφ is 2π. So the surface integral is 2 * 2π =4π.

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f is 4π. But wait, earlier when I computed the divergence, I got zero everywhere except at the origin. So how does that reconcile?

Ah, because the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it has a delta function. So the volume integral of ∇·f would be the flux out of the surface, which is 4π, so the integral of the divergence is 4π. But wait, wait. That can't be right because in the earlier calculation, the divergence was zero except at r=0, but the integral is 4π. So in reality, ∇·f must be equal to 4π δ³(r), because the integral over all space would be 4π. But wait, I thought the divergence of 1/r² was zero, but no, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me think. If the divergence of f is 4π δ³(r), then the integral of ∇·f over the sphere (which includes the origin) would be 4π. So the volume integral would be 4π, but that's only if the divergence is a delta function.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I computed ∇·f, I got zero everywhere except at r=0. So why is the integral 4π?

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in the computation of the divergence. Let me recompute ∇·f.

f(r) = (1/r²) r̂.

So in spherical coordinates, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f_r).

f_r = 1/r².

So r² f_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0. So ∇·f = 0, but wait, that's only for r ≠ 0.

But that suggests that the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, which is a point where the function is singular. So the divergence is zero in the volume except at the origin, but the surface integral is 4π.

Wait, that's a contradiction because according to the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence over the volume should equal the surface integral.

So maybe the divergence is not zero. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in computing the divergence.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the divergence in spherical coordinates.

Let me double-check. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field F = (F_r, F_θ, F_φ) is:

∇·F = (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d (F_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) d F_φ / d φ.

In our case, F_θ and F_φ are zero, so the divergence reduces to (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr.

So F_r is 1/r².

So r² F_r = r² * (1/r²) ) = 1.

So d(r² F_r)/dr = d(1)/dr = 0.

So ∇·F = (1/r²)*0 = 0.

So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's undefined. So the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere of radius R should be zero, except that the divergence theorem says it's equal to the surface flux, which is 4π.

So that's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?

Ah, I think I see. When the function has a discontinuity or a singularity at a point, the divergence theorem still applies, but the divergence includes the delta function at the origin.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the divergence is zero except at r=0. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume would be zero, but according to the surface integral, it's 4π. That can't be. So perhaps the divergence is a delta function multiplied by 4π. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r), making the volume integral 4π times the integral of δ³(r) over the sphere, which is 1. So the integral would be 4π.

Wait, but according to the formula, ∇·f is zero everywhere except at the origin. So that suggests that the divergence is zero, but the integral is 4π. So that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption about f(r).

Alternatively, perhaps the vector field is actually f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, which would have a divergence of 4π δ³(r). Then, the integral of ∇·f over the sphere would be 4π.

Wait, but how? Let me think again. Let's imagine the vector field is f(r) = (1/(4π r²)) r̂. Then, the divergence would be (1/(4π r²)) * (d/dr)( r² * (1/(4π r²)) ) ) = (1/(4π r²)) * d/dr( 1/(4π) ) = 0. So the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, but the surface integral would be (1/(4π R²)) ) * 4π R² =1. So the divergence is zero, but the surface integral is 1, which would imply that the volume integral is 1, but according to divergence, it's zero. So that's a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think about this more carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the given vector field is not the same as the electric field. Let me try to compute the divergence again.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, which is the same as (r̂)/r².

So the divergence in spherical coordinates for F = F_r r̂ is:

∇·F = (1/r²) d(r² F_r)/dr.

So F_r = 1/r².

r² F_r = (r²)(1/r²) )=1.

d/dr (1) =0. So ∇·f =0.

But the surface integral gave 4π, so according to the divergence theorem, the integral of the divergence over the volume is 4π. But the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, which seems to imply that it's a delta function.

Ah, so I think the correct approach is that the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral over the volume that includes the origin is 4π.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, the integral over the volume should be zero, but the surface integral shows it's 4π. So perhaps the divergence isn't zero. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the vector field is given as f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, but I'm forgetting that the divergence in this case does have a delta function.

Wait, perhaps the correct expression is that ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). So when you integrate over the volume, if the volume includes the origin, the integral is 4π. If it doesn't, it's zero.

In this problem, the sphere is centered at the origin and has radius R, which is positive. So the origin is inside the sphere, so the integral of ∇·f is 4π.

But wait, according to the earlier calculation, the divergence is zero except at r=0, so the integral would be zero, but that's conflicting with the surface integral.

So perhaps the correct answer is 4π. Looking back at the options, option A is 4π.

But wait, let me recheck the surface integral. The surface integral of f · r̂ over the sphere of radius R is ∫ f(r) R² sinθ dθ dφ. Wait, no, because f(r) is 1/r², and r = R on the surface.

Wait, f(r)·r̂ is f(r) because f is radial. So f(r) =1/R².

The surface area is 4π R². So the integral is (1/R²) * 4π R² =4π. So the surface integral is 4π, which according to the divergence theorem, equals the volume integral of ∇·f. So the volume integral is 4π.

But according to the divergence calculation, ∇·f is zero except at the origin, but that leads to a contradiction. So perhaps the correct way to think about this is that ∇·f is 4π δ³(r), so the integral is 4π.

So the answer would be option A, 4π.


The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** inside a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin. The vector field is given as **f(r) = (1/r²) r̂**, where **r̂** is the radial unit vector in spherical coordinates. The field has only a radial component and falls off as **1/r²**.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence in Spherical Coordinates**:  
   For a vector field **f = f_r r̂**, the divergence in spherical coordinates is given by:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right)
   \]  
   Substituting **f_r = 1/r²**, we compute:  
   \[
   r^2 f_r = r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = 1
   \]  
   Taking the derivative with respect to **r**,  
   \[
   \frac{d}{dr} \left( 1 \right) = 0
   \]  
   Thus, **∇ · f = 0** everywhere except at **r = 0**, where the field is singular.

2. **Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence to the surface integral of the vector field over the boundary:  
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f}) \, dV = \int_S (\mathbf{f} \cdot \mathbf{n}) \, dA
   \]  
   Here, **S** is the surface of the sphere of radius **R**, and **n** is the outward unit normal vector. Since **f** is radial, **f · n = f(r)** on the surface, and **f(r) = 1/r²** at **r = R**. The surface integral becomes:  
   \[
   \int_S f(r) \, dA = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi
   \]  
   Therefore, the volume integral of **∇ · f** is **4π**.

3. **Behavior at the Origin**:  
   The divergence **∇ · f** is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field is singular. The singularity at the origin contributes a delta function **δ³(r)**, and the integral of **∇ · f** over the volume of the sphere is equal to the flux through the surface, which is **4π**.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the field **f(r)** inside the sphere of radius **R** is **4π**. This matches option **A**.

**Answer: A**
