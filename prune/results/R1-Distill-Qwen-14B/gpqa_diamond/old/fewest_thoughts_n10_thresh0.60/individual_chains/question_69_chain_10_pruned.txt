Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and a decay process of a particle X⁰ into Y⁺ and Z⁻. The proper lifetime of X⁰ is given as τ₀ = 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question asks about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Hmm, right. So I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime as observed in the lab frame is longer than their proper lifetime due to time dilation. But for this problem, I think the key is about the path length the particle travels before decaying, which depends on its speed and lifetime. The resolution of the detector probably refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point accurately, so if the particle travels a certain distance, the detector's resolution must be good enough to capture that.

Wait, the problem says "minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays." That probably means that the detector can only see the decay if the particle's path length is longer than the resolution. Because if the actual path length is much smaller than the resolution, the detector can't pinpoint where the decay happened. So, for 30% of the decays to be observed, maybe the path length should be at least 30% of the average path length? Or perhaps there's a statistical consideration here, like the probability that the decay occurs within a certain length.

Wait, another thought: the proper lifetime is τ₀, and the lifetime observed in the lab frame is longer due to the particle's speed. The lab frame lifetime τ would be γ times τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor. The path length L is then the velocity v multiplied by τ, so L = v * γ τ₀.

But wait, the velocity v can be found using the energy and mass of the particle. Because the energy E of the particle is given as 27 GeV, and the rest mass is 3.41 GeV. So the total energy E is related to the momentum p and mass m by E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Let me write that down.
