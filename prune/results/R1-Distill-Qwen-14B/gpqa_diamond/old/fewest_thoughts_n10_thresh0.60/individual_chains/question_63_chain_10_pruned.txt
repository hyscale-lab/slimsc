Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about diatomic molecules and their energy states. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The question says we have a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They're modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, also known as the non-rigid rotor model. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Alright, so first, what's the deal with the quantum rotation-vibration model? I remember that molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy states. In the rigid rotor model, the molecule is assumed to have a fixed bond length, but the non-rigid one allows for some stretching, so maybe that affects the moment of inertia?

Wait, but the problem gives me the bond length R. So maybe the moment of inertia is based on that. The moment of inertia, I, for a diatomic molecule is (mu) * R squared, where mu is the reduced mass.

Let me get the formula right. The reduced mass mu is (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Oh, right, Mx is the mass of X and My is the mass of Y. Given that Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu.

Wait, but wait — do I need to convert amu to kilograms? Because the units for momentum will be in SI units. Yes, I think so. Because the angular frequency and the bond length are given in SI units already.

So, let's compute the reduced mass mu first. Mx is 20, My is 2. So mu = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But I need to convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Calculating that: 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's see, 1.8 *1.66 is about 2.988, but more accurately, 1.818 * 1.6605 ≈ let's compute:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889
0.018 * 1.6605 ≈ 0.02989
So total is about 2.9889 + 0.02989 ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute that again. 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

1.818 * 1.6605 = let's compute that.

1.818 * 1.6605 = (1 + 0.8 + 0.018) * 1.6605.

Wait, maybe just multiply 1.818 * 1.6605.

1.818 * 1.6605:

Break it down:

1.8 * 1.6605 = 2.9889
0.018 * 1.6605 = 0.029889
So total is 2.9889 + 0.029889 ≈ 3.018789e-27 kg.

So mu ≈ 3.0188e-27 kg.

Now, the moment of inertia I is mu * R². R is given as 2 angstroms. But wait, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So R is 2e-10 meters.

So I = mu * R² = 3.0188e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating R squared: (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So I = 3.0188e-27 kg * 4e-20 m² = 1.2075e-46 kg m².

Wait, that seems a bit small, but I think that's correct for diatomic molecules.

Now, the molecule is in its fundamental state. What does that mean in terms of quantum numbers? For a diatomic molecule modeled as a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by E_J = (h²/(8 I)) * J(J+1), where J is the rotational quantum number. But wait,
