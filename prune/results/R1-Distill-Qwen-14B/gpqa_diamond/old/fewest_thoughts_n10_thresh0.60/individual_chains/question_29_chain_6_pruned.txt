Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this genetics question about mutations in a gene that causes an anti-nutritional compound in barley. Hmm, the goal is to find out which mutation would eliminate the compound. Let me break this down.

The problem says that the gene has five exons and four introns. So, the gene is split into exons, which are the coding regions, and introns, which are non-coding but spliced out. When they used EMS mutagenesis, which typically causes point mutations, they looked at the target gene in all mutants. The changes are in the first exon area. So, I should focus on the first exon sequences of the mutants.

The intact gene's sequence is provided. Let me write it down:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Now, the mutants have changes in the first part. Let me look at each mutant's sequence.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to the intact gene, let's see. The starting part of the intact is ATGTTTCTC... So, in Mutant 1, the sequence starts ATGTTCTACG... Wait, let me check the exact position. Intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTA... So position-wise, the first few nucleotides: the intact has TTTCTCGC. Mutant 1 has TCTACG... So, let me count:

Intact: positions 4-10: T T C T C G C
Mutant 1: T C T A C G C

So, the change is at the 5th position maybe? Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the difference is. Let me check each position.

Looking at the first few bases:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT...
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT...

So, the intact has TTTCTCGCT, while mutant 1 has TTC TAC GCT. So, the third base in the
