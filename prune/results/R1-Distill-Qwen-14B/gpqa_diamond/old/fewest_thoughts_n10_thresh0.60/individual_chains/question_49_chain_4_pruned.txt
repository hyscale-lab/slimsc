Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct products of three different reactions. The question involves sigmatropic rearrangements, which I remember are a type of pericyclic reaction where a pi bond moves to a sigma bond. The examples given are the Cope and Claisen rearrangements, so I should think about those as well.

Let me take each reaction one by one.

Reaction 1: 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + H+ and Heat â†’ A

Hmm, okay. So the starting materials are 1,1-dimethoxyethanamine and but-3-en-2-ol. Wait, but-3-en-2-ol is allyl alcohol. When I see H+ and heat, I think of acid-catalyzed reactions, maybe some kind of rearrangement.

Wait, but the question says it's a sigmatropic rearrangement. The initial reactant is 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine. That structure would have two methoxy groups on the same carbon as the amine. So the structure is CH2(OCH3)2NH2? Or maybe it's (OCH3)2C-NH2. Oh wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine
