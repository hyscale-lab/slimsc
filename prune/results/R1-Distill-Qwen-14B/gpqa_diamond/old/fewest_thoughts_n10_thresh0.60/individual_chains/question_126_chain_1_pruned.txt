Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the question describes two reactions performed by an organic chemist. For each reaction, a compound is treated with a specific reagent, and then an acidic workup is done. After both reactions are completed, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and a chiral stationary phase. The question is asking how many peaks the chemist will observe in each chromatogram.

First, I need to figure out what each reaction does. Let's break them down one by one.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, which is a strong reducing agent. It's commonly used to reduce carbonyl groups. In this case, the starting material is a ketone: hexan-3-one. So, I think LAH would reduce the ketone group. The structure is (S) configuration at the 5-methoxy group, but I'm not sure if the stereochemistry will matter here.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2CH(O)CH2CH2CH3, but with a methoxy group on the 5th carbon. So the molecule is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH(CH2OCH3)-CH2 something? No, wait more accurately.

Wait, the structure of 5-methoxyhexan-3-one is: 

The hexan-3-one part is six carbons with a ketone on C3. So, positions:

1  2  3  4  5 6

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait, let me think again.

Wait, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. So, the carbonyl is on C3.

But in this case, the 5th carbon (from the CO) would have a methoxy group. So, the structure is:

The full structure is CH2CH2-C(O)-
