Alright, I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Let me think through this step by step.

So, the question provides information about each star, including their apparent magnitudes or absolute magnitudes, distances, and some extinction values. The key here is to determine the apparent V magnitude each star has from Earth because both spectrographs have different limiting magnitudes.

ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17.0 mag. That means any star with apparent V <=17 is observable by ESPRESSO. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16.0 mag, so stars with V <=16 are observable by HIRES.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, no, that's not right. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So if a telescope can observe stars brighter than 17 mag, that means it can detect stars with V mag less than or equal to 17. Because, for example, a star with V=17 is at the limit. So, for each star, I need to calculate their apparent V magnitude and see if it's <=17 for ESPRESSO and <=16 for HIRES. Then, the star must satisfy both conditionsâ€”meaning the apparent V mag must be <=16, because that's the stricter condition.

Wait no, the question is asking which stars can be detected with both spectrographs. So, a star must be observable by both. So, for a star to be seen by both, its apparent V magnitude must be <=17 (for ESPRESSO) and <=16 (for HIRES). So the more restrictive condition is <=16.

Wait, no. Wait, let me clarify. The question says: which stars can be detected with both. So a star must be detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES. So, a star must have apparent V mag <=17 (because ESPRESSO can see brighter than 17, so up to 17 is okay). And it must also have apparent V mag <=16 for HIRES. So, the limiting factor is the lower of the two, which is 16. Because a star that's V=16.5 mag would be too faint for HIRES but visible to ESPRESSO. So for both, the star's V must be <=16.

Wait, but I think I might have gotten that backward. Let me re-read the question: "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed" with ESPRESSO. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the magnitude scale is inverted. Brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, when the question says "brighter than 17 mag", that's a bit confusing. Because 17 is fainter than 16. So, "brighter than 17" would mean magnitude <17. Because, for instance, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17.

So, ESPRESSO can observe stars with V <17, and HIRES can observe stars with V <16.

So for a star to be
