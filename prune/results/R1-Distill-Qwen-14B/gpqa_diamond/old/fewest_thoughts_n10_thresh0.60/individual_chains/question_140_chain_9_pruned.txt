Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction releases a gas W, which has a molecule with the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, and when heated, it releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is about 4 degrees Celsius, right? Because 273 K is 0Â°C, so 277 is almost there.

The product of a keto acid reacting with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Also, X's analog is used, which makes me think it might be something common but with an isotope variation.

Hmm, so let's break this down. First, I think I need to figure out what substance X is. Since it's a reagent in organic chemistry, maybe it's something like a strong base or a metal used in reactions. The heavier isotope part suggests that one of its elements has an isotope with a higher atomic mass.

The reaction with Y produces gas W. W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. Let's think about possible gases. For example, CO2 has 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44 g/mol. But CO2's molecule has 22 neutrons and 22 protons? Wait, no. Carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons in its isotope, but in CO2, each O has 8 protons. So the total protons in CO2 would be 6 + 8*2 = 22. The neutrons would be 6 (if C-12) + 8*2 (O-16) = 6 + 16=22? Oh, wait, that's right. So the molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So W is CO2 maybe? Or another gas like something else.

Wait, another possibility is H2O. H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (for H-1), O has 8. So H2O has 2 H (2 protons, 0 neutrons) and O (8 protons, 8 neutrons). Total protons: 2+8=10. Neutrons: 8. So that doesn't match. So CO2 is a better fit because the total protons and neutrons are both 22.

So perhaps W is CO2. If that's the case, then the reaction between X and Y produces CO2. So what could X and Y be? If Y is a liquid, maybe Y is water or something else. Wait, but another possibility is that Y is a carboxylic acid, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. The precipitate G is formed. When heated, it releases B. B's melting point is around 277 K, which is close to
