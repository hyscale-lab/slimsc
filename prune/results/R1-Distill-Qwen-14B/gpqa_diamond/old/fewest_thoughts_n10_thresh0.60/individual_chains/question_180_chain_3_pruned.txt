Okay, so I have this physics problem here. Let me try to understand it. So, the question is about finding the minimum energy of an isolated system of charges. Hmm, I remember that in physics, when you have charges, you often think about electric potential energy. Oh right, because the energy between charges is stored in the electric fields they create.

The setup says there's 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Oh wait, e is the elementary charge, so 2e would be like twice that, which is 2 times 1.6e-19 coulombs. So each charge is 3.2e-19 C? Or wait, no, 2e is 2 times the elementary charge, so yeah, 3.2e-19 C each.

Now, the system: 12 of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. And the 13th charge is fixed at P. So, point P has the 13th charge, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So, all 12 are at a distance of 2m from P.

Wait, but what's the configuration of those 12 charges? Are they all on a sphere of radius 2m around P? Or are they arranged in some other way? Because the potential energy depends on how the charges are arranged relative to each other.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. Oh right, the potential energy between point charges is
