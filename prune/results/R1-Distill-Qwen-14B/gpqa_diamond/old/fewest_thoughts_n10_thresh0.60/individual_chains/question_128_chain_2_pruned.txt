Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which plasmid I should use to produce the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that when producing a protein in E. coli, the plasmid must have the correct sequence, including the start codon and proper reading frame. Also, E. coli uses the same genetic code as humans, so that shouldn't be a problem, but sometimes there can be issues like incorrect codon usage which can affect expression, but I think that's more about optimization rather than the initial cloning.

Looking at the options, each is a DNA sequence starting with ATG, which is the start codon. So all the options have the correct start. But I need to check for the presence of the correct stop codon as well. Oh wait, wait, the question is about the correct plasmid for the amino acid sequence given.

Wait, the question gives the amino acid sequence of P53. So I need to find a plasmid that encodes this sequence.

But looking at the options, each plasmid starts with ATG and then a long stretch of DNA. But to match the amino acid sequence, the DNA must be the correct coding sequence (CDS) without any extra stuff that would add or remove amino acids.

Wait, the problem says that the four options are plasmids with four different sequences. So which one correctly encodes the given amino acid sequence?

Hmm, but the amino acid sequence is given as a long string of letters. Let me recall how to convert that into DNA. Each amino
