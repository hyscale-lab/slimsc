Okay, so I have this genetics question here about barley mutants and an anti-nutritional compound. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on.

The question says that there's this drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has a gene that makes an anti-nutritional compound, making it unusable for food. So, they found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and are looking for which mutation would eliminate the compound.

The intact gene and the mutants' sequences are given. I guess the key is to look for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, possibly by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, so in the first part, the intact has TTTCTCG..., mutant 1 has TTCTACG... Let me compare. The first part of the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT...

In mutant 1, the sequence after ATG is TTCTACG... So, comparing, the third codon changes from TTC (which is P?) to TAC, which is Tyr. So, maybe a point mutation? Let me count the nucleotides.

Wait, maybe it's easier to look for changes in the codons. The first exon is where the changes are, so all these mutations are in exon 1.

In the intact gene, the start is ATG, which is methionine, the start codon.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The beginning is ATGTTCTACGCT... so after ATG, it's TTC (P), then TAC (Y), CGC (R). Wait, the intact gene after ATG has TTT CTC GCT. So, in mutant 1, the first codon after ATG is TTC (same as intact?), then in the next codon, instead of CTC (Leu), it's TAC. Wait, wait, let me check carefully.

Wait, the intact gene's first part is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT... 

Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C T GGT ACT TCT...

Wait, wait, maybe I should break them into triplets to see the codons.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT...

Wait, maybe I should split each into triplets.

Intact gene starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

Mutant 1: ATG T T C T A C G C T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT... Hmm, wait, that can't be right. Let me re-express:

Intact:

ATG TTC TTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me line them up.

Wait, the intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

So, breaking into triplets starting from ATG:

ATG TTC TTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So for mutant 1, the triplet after ATG is TT CTA CGC? Wait, let me split the sequence:

ATG T T C T A C G C T GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, the entire sequence for mutant 1 is:

ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

Splitting into triplets from the start:

ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TTA TGC GC... ?

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let's take the first part.

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT...

Mutant 1: ...TTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACAT...

So, the first part is:

Intact: TTT CT C G C T
Mutant1: TTC TAC G C T

Wait, no, perhaps the first triplet after ATG is TTC (mutant 1: TTC?), but in the intact it's TTT. Wait, let's see:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the first codon after ATG in the intact is TTT (which is Phe), and in mutant 1, it's TTC (also Phe). Oh, wait, same amino acid. Then next codon in intact is CTC (Leu), and in mutant 1 it's TAC (Tyr). So, that's a change from Leu to Tyr. So, a point mutation. Since it's in a coding region (exon 1), this could change the protein.

But what's the effect? Well, a single amino acid substitution. It might or might not affect the function.

Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, after ATG, the next is TTC, then TAA, then GCT...

Wait, let's break it into triplets.

ATG TTC TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the second codon is TTC (Phe), third is TAA (which is a stop codon, I think. TAA is stop, as well as TAG and TGA. So, in this case, the gene would have a premature stop codon.

Wait, but wait. The start codon is ATG, so the first triplet is ATG (start), then TTC (Phe), then TAA (stop). So, that's a problem. That would cause the mRNA to terminate at the second codon. So, the resulting protein would be much shorter. If the gene is for the anti-nutritional compound, a nonfunctional or shorter protein might not produce the compound.

But wait, does that mean that the gene is non-functional? If the protein is truncated early, perhaps the compound isn't made. So, this could be a candidate.

But let me look at the other mutants.

Mutant 3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

So, the first codon is TTT (Phe), same as intact. Second is TAC (Tyr), which in the intact is CTC (Leu). So, again, an amino acid change. Then GCT is same, GGT same, but next is GTC (Val) in mutant 3, whereas in intact it's ACT (Thr). So, multiple changes here. But would this affect the function? Possibly, but not necessarily a stop codon.

Mutant 4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Splitting into triplets:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT...

So, after ATG, it's TTT (Phe), then TAC (Tyr), then GCT (Ala), and then ACT (Thr). Wait, in the intact gene, after the TAC in mutant 4, the next codon is GCT, same as in the intact, but wait, the intact after TAC would be GCT? Let me check.

Wait, the intact gene after ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT. So, the full sequence is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

In mutant 4, after TTT TAC GCT, the next is ACT instead of GCT?

Wait, no, let me re-examine:

Intact gene: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT...

Mutant 4: ...TTTTACGCTACTTCT...

So, the wild type is CTC GCT GGT ACT, while mutant 4 is TAC GCT ACT. So, the first part: TAC would be the third codon.

Wait, let me line up the sequences:

Intact:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...

Mutant 4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, in mutant 4, after the first two codons (ATG, TTT), third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then fourth codon is GCT (Ala), same as wild type. Fifth codon in wild type is GGT (Gly), in mutant 4, it's ACT (Thr). So, changes in amino acids. But again, not a stop codon.

So, looking for which mutation would eliminate the compound. That would require the gene product to be non-functional. So, possible ways are a premature stop (nonsense mutation) leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein, or a missense mutation that disrupts the function.

Mutant 2 has a TAA codon, which is a stop. So, that would lead to a much shorter protein. It would likely be non-functional.

Mutant 4 has a change in the third codon to TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), so that's another amino acid change. But not a stop.

So, the best candidates for eliminating the compound would be a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop.

Looking at the options, the question is which mutation would let you eliminate the compound. So, if the gene is non-functional, the compound isn't produced.

So, let's see the options:

Option A) Mutant 2: has a TAA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would be very short. So this could disrupt the gene.

Option D) Mutant4: no stop codon, just some amino acid changes.

So, the correct answer should be Mutant 2, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure. The first part of the gene is the first exon, so all these mutations are in that area. So, the question is which mutation would disrupt the gene's function.

In Mutant 2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop. So the protein would be only 2 amino acids long (ATG is start, TTC is Phe, TAA is stop). So, the rest of the gene is not read. So, the gene product is a short peptide, not the full-length. So, the compound isn't made because the gene product is non-functional.

So, among the options, the correct answer is Mutant 2, which is option A.


To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the drought-resistant barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene, as all changes occur in this region. The key is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, such as by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - The sequence shows a point mutation where the codon changes from CTC (Leu) in the intact gene to TAC (Tyr).  
   - This is a missense mutation, altering the amino acid but not introducing a stop codon.  
   - The protein may still be functional, as there is no premature termination.

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - The sequence contains a TAA codon, which is a stop codon.  
   - This results in a truncated protein with only two amino acids (Phe and Tyr) before termination.  
   - The gene product is likely non-functional, preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - Multiple point mutations are present, including changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) and ACT (Thr) to GTC (Val).  
   - These are missense mutations, altering the amino acids but not introducing a stop codon.  
   - While the protein structure may be affected, it is unclear if the gene product is completely non-functional.

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - The sequence shows changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr) and GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr).  
   - These are missense mutations, altering the amino acids but not introducing a stop codon.  
   - The protein structure may be altered, but the gene product is unlikely to be completely non-functional.

### Conclusion:
The most effective mutation for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound is **Mutant 2**, as it introduces a premature stop codon (TAA), leading to a non-functional gene product. This ensures that the compound is not synthesized.
