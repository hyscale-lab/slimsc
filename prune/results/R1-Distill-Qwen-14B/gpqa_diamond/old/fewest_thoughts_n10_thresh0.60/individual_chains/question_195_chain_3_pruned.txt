Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, the setup is about two planets orbiting a star. The first planet has Earth's radius and is in a circular orbit with a transit impact parameter of 0.2 around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this planet is 3 days. The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which has 2.5 Earth radii, such that both transit and occultation events are observed. Both planets share the same orbital plane and have circular orbits.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me think. So, transit events happen when a planet passes in front of the star from our point of view, and occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, from our perspective. For both events to occur, the orbital planes must align in a way that the planets are on the same line relative to us at some point in their orbits.

Wait, but since they share the same orbital plane, their orbits are coplanar. So, transits and occultations depend on their orbital periods and the alignment of their positions relative to the star and us.

I remember that for a planet to transit, the alignment of the orbital plane must be such that the planet's path in front of the star is along our line of sight. The transit impact parameter is the distance (in units of the star's radius) from the center of the star that the planet's path passes. A zero impact parameter means it's directly in front. But here, the first planet has an impact parameter of 0.2, so it's not exactly central.

Wait, but the second planet needs to have both transit and occultation events. Oh, wait, occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so that would occur when the planet is on the opposite side of the star from us relative to its transit. So, for both to happen, the planets' orbital periods should be such that their orbital positions coincide in a way that allows both events.

Wait, but the question is about the maximum period of the second planet so that both events are possible. I think this relates to the concept of orbital resonance or perhaps the synodic period, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the times when their orbital positions coincide. For both transits and occult
