Okay, so I just landed my first big job in a structural biology lab at Stanford. The PI is super excited and wants me to produce the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21 as quickly as possible. The task is to pick the right plasmid from four options to get the correct sequence. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think this through.

First, I remember that when cloning a gene into E. coli, you need the right promoter and other regulatory elements. The protein they want is Human P53, so the plasmid should have the correct coding sequence for that. Oh wait, but the plasmids are provided as sequences, so I'll need to look for the start and end codons and see if the rest matches the given amino acid sequence.

Wait, the options are A, B, C, D. Each is a long DNA sequence starting with ATG, which is the start codon. So all of them are probably open reading frames. But I need to find which one correctly encodes the Human P53 protein.

Let me think about how DNA translates to protein. The coding sequence is in the same reading frame as the start codon. Each codon (3 nucleotides) translates to an amino acid. So if I can take the DNA sequences and see which one matches the amino acid sequence provided, that's the right one.

But wait, that's a lot of amino acids and a very long DNA sequence. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATG
