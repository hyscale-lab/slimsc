Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of a certain operator for a spin-half particle. I remember that expectation values are like the average outcome of a measurement on a quantum state, right?

The particle is in a superposition state: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz. So σz is the Pauli z-matrix, I think. The operator we're dealing with is 10σz +5σx. So I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

First, I need to recall how expectation values work. The expectation value of an operator O in a state |ψ⟩ is ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. So I'll have to compute that for O =10σz +5σx.

Breaking it down, expectation values are linear. So ⟨10σz +5σx⟩ =10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute ⟨σz⟩ and ⟨σx⟩ separately and then combine them.

Let me write down the state ψ. The state is given as (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. Let me check: is this normalized? The coefficients squared add up to (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4)= 1. Yep, that's good.

Now, since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz should be straightforward. Because σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. So when I calculate ⟨σz⟩, it's the sum of the coefficients squared times their respective eigenvalues.

So, let's compute ⟨σz⟩. The state is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So the amplitude for |↑⟩ is 0.5, and for |↓⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. Squaring them: 0.25 and 3/4, which sum to 1.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (+1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1). So that's 0.25*(1) + (3/4)*(-1) → 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Now onto ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix. Its eigenstates are not the same as |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The eigenstates of σx are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. So calculating ⟨σx⟩ might be a bit more involved.

Alternatively, I can express σx in terms of the basis |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. The Pauli matrices are:

σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So σx in
