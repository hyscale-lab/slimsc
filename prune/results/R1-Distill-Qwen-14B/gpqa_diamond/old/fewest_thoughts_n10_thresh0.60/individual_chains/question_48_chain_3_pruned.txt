Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the starting material is cyclohexanone. I remember that cyclohexanone is a six-membered ring with a ketone group.

The first reaction is treating cyclohexanone with bromine, which forms product 1. Wait, bromine in what conditions? Oh right, when a ketone is treated with bromine, it usually undergoes a bromination. But wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group. I think that under certain conditions, like maybe in a base, it can undergo an enolate formation. Or wait, maybe it's a different reaction. Oh, wait, no, another possibility: when ketones react with Br2, it's a nucleophilic addition. Oh wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, cyclohexanone has a carbonyl group which can undergo addition reactions. But bromine is a dienophile? Or wait, maybe it's adding across the carbonyl?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, another thought. Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromide addition to the ketone. For example, in the presence of a base, like maybe the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that's for carboxylic acids. Hmm. Or maybe it's a benzoin condensation? No, that's with cyanide. Or perhaps it's a simple addition of bromine to the carbonyl group, like an alpha bromination. Oh wait, wait, maybe it's an Aldol addition
