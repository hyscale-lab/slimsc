Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember that the radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift in a star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravitational pull. The star moves back and forth, and that causes the spectral lines to shift in wavelength periodically.

The question says both stars have the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. So the planets are probably in the same mass category. Now, the RV method detected a shift in spectral lines. Planet #1 caused a 5 milliangstrom shift, and Planet #2 caused a 7 milliangstrom shift.

Wait, I think the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The formula I remember is something like velocity (v) is proportional to the wavelength shift (delta lambda) over the original wavelength (lambda_0). Oh wait, the formula is v = (delta lambda / lambda_0) * c, where c is the speed of light. But in this problem, since we're comparing two different shifts for the same star mass and same planet mass, maybe we can relate the velocity semi-amplitudes.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift. So K is proportional to delta lambda. But wait, K is the velocity of the star due to the planet. For each planet, K1 is 5 milliangstrom and K2 is 7 milliangstrom? Or wait, no, the shift is given as 5 and 7 milliangstrom, so their velocities are proportional to these shifts.

Wait, but the actual formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i ) / ( (1 day) ) ) 

Wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of the formula for the same star mass because the stars have the same mass. Both stars are Sun-like, so M* is the same for both. The planets have similar masses, so M_p is roughly the same for both. But wait, wait, the problem says both planets have masses similar to Neptune. So their masses are about the same.

Wait, but the question is about the orbital periods. Oh, right, because the RV method gives us the velocity semi-amplitude, which relates to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

Wait, the formula that connects the semi-amplitude K with the orbital period P is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

But since the eccentricity e is zero (the orbits are circular), that term drops out. Also, M_p is much less than M_*, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*. And since both stars are identical, M_* is same for both.

Wait, but wait, the problem says both stars have the same mass, and both planets have similar masses, so M_p is same for both.

So let's simplify. The formula for K (the semi-amplitude) is:

K ≈ ( ( (G * M_p )^(1/3) ) / ( (M_*)^(2/3) ) ) ) * ( 1 / (P^(1/3)) ) )

Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between K and P.

Alternatively, since both stars are the same and the planets have the same mass, the only variable here is the orbital period P and the semi-major axis a. But wait, the RV method gives K, which depends on the mass, the period, and the inclination angle. But here, we can probably assume that the inclination is the same for both, or that it's the same for each case, and we can compare.

Wait, but the problem doesn't say anything about inclination, so maybe that's a factor, but perhaps it's similar for both, so we can ignore it.

Wait, perhaps the formula that connects the velocity semi-amplitude K with the orbital period P is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (c * P ) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_* )^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) )

Since e=0, and M_* same, and M_p same, K is proportional to P^(-1/3) * sin i.

But if we assume that the inclination is the same for both planets (like sin i is same), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). 

Wait, let me double-check. Let's write the formula for K:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(0.5) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ sin i ] * ( 2 pi G )^(1/3) ) / ( (P)^(1/3) c )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a simpler relation.

Alternatively, I remember that for the radial velocity method, the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (27 * pi * G) / (c^3) )^(1/3) ) * ( (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

But since e is zero, and M_p << M_*, we can approximate M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )/(c^3) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) ) * (1/P)^(1/3)

So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1/P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both planets, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3) * sin i.

Assuming that the inclination is same (sin i same for both), then K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

So if K1 is 5 miliangstrom and K2 is 7 miliangstrom, then K2 = (7/5) K1.

But since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then K ∝ 1/P^(1/3) → P ∝ 1/(K^(3)).

Wait, no, K is proportional to (1/P)^(1/3), so K = C / P^(1/3), where C is some constant.

So if K2/K1 = 7/5, then (K2) / (K1) = (C / P2^(1/3)) ) / ( C / P1^(1/3) ) ) = (P1 / P2) )^(1/3)

So (7/5) = (P1 / P2 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides: (7/5)^3 = P1 / P2 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3.

Wait, let me compute that.

(5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 = P1 * 0.364 → so P2 is about 0.364 times P1. Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 = 0.364 * P1 → so P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of ~0.36. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1.

Wait, so which option is that? Looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

But wait, let me think again. I have K proportional to 1/P^(1/3). So K2 = (7/5) K1 → P2 = (5/7)^3 P1. So P2 is smaller. So planet #2 has a shorter orbital period than planet #1.

Wait, but the question is how many times longer is the period of planet #2 compared to planet #1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's shorter, so P2 / P1 = 0.36. So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as planet #1. So it's shorter, not longer.

But the question is phrased: How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1.

Hmm, if P2 is 0.36 times P1, then it's 36% as long, which is shorter, not longer. So the answer would be option A, 0.36 times as long, meaning it's shorter. But the question is asking how many times longer. So if it's 0.36 times as long, it's actually shorter. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter, meaning it's not longer.

Wait, that's a problem. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me go back. So K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)). So if K2 is bigger than K1, that would imply that P2 is smaller than P1. Because a higher K implies a lower P.

So for example, K=5 and K=7: K2 is larger, so P2 is shorter.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? Well, it's shorter, so the ratio is less than 1. So the answer is 0.36 times as long, which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A, ~0.36.


To determine how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, we analyze the relationship between the radial velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) and the orbital period \( P \). The radial velocity semi-amplitude is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \), as derived from the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that planet #1 causes a wavelength shift of 5 milliangstrom (\( K_1 \)) and planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstrom (\( K_2 \)), the ratio of their semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{7}{5}
\]

Since \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the ratio of the periods can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1. However, the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since \( P_2 \) is shorter than \( P_1 \), the answer is approximately 0.36.

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1.
