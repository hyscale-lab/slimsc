Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me try to break it down. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X⁰. 

Wait, first, I remember that when a particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. Oh right, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. So the observed lifetime depends on the particle's speed, specifically its Lorentz factor gamma.

The formula for the lifetime as observed (t) is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime (tau_0). Gamma is 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), but maybe I can find it using energy and mass instead.

The problem gives the energy of the particle as 27 GeV and its mass as 3.41 GeV. Oh wait, the energy probably includes rest mass energy. So the total energy E is gamma times the rest mass energy, so E = gamma * m c². Since m is given in GeV/c², and E is GeV, I can calculate gamma as E/(m c²) but wait, in units where c=1, E = gamma m. So gamma would just be E/m.

So gamma = 27 GeV / 3.41 GeV. Let me compute that. 27 divided by 3.41... 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41 times 7.9 is around 27.239, so gamma is approximately 7.9.

Next, the lifetime observed (t) is gamma * tau_0. Tau_0 is 8e-16 seconds. So t = 7.9 * 8e-16. Let's calculate that: 7.9 *8 is 63.2, so 63.2e-16 seconds, which is 6.32e-15 seconds.

Now, the particles move during their lifetime, so the distance they travel is v * t. But to find the minimum resolution, I think we need to ensure that the decay products are detected. The resolution probably refers to the minimum distance that the decay must travel so that it's observable.

Wait, but wait, the
