Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's about pH calculations. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: Determine the pH of a solution made by mixing 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, with some numbers.

Hmm, right. So the solution is a mixture of an acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. I remember that acids and bases will react when mixed. So first, I need to figure out the total moles of H+ and OH- after mixing, but wait, maybe I should consider the neutralization reactions first.

Let me think. CH3COOH is a weak acid, HCl is a strong acid, and Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when they are mixed, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base.

But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will dissociate completely. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions, right? Because the formula is Ba(OH)2 → Ba²+ + 2OH⁻.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate moles of each component.
2. Determine the reaction between acids and bases.
3. Find out the excess after neutralization.
4. Calculate the concentration of H+ or OH- in the total solution volume.
5. Then determine the pH.

Let's start with step 1: Calculating moles.

First, for CH3COOH:
Molarity = 0.1 M, volume = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
Molarity = 0.2 M, volume = 400 mL = 0.4 L.
Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2:
Molarity = 0.3 M, volume = 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles of Ba(OH)2
