Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to parse it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, Pz. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Right, because in quantum mechanics, spin operators are often expressed like that.

So, the problem is asking for the normalized eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Let me think. Since the operator is along a direction n in the x-z plane, the direction vector must be something like (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because it's in the x-z plane. So the angle θ is between the direction and the z-axis.

The operator P is given by the vector components. So the operator itself is P = n · σ * ħ/2, where σ is the Pauli matrices. Wait, no, more accurately, each component is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So, P = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y is zero. So P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

Wait, n is arbitrary, so the direction isn't fixed. But the eigenvalue is +ħ/2. So the eigenvector is the spin-up state along the direction n.

Eigenvectors of the spin operator along a direction n are the spin-up and spin-down states. The eigenvalues are ±ħ/2. So for eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector is the spin-up state along n.

The spin-up state along n can be written in terms of the eigenstates of Sz, which are |↑⟩ = (1, 0) and |↓⟩ = (0, 1). But when the spin is along a different axis, the state is a superposition.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this by constructing the operator P and then finding its eigenvectors.

Let me write down the components:

Px is (ħ/2) times [[0,1],[1,0]]
Py is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]
Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So the operator P is n_x Px + n_z Pz. Since n is in the x-z plane, n_y =0. Let me denote n as (a, 0, b), but since it's a unit vector, a² + b² =1.

So P = (a)(ħ/2) [[0,1],[1,0]] + (b)(ħ/2) [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Which simplifies to (ħ/2) [ a [[0,1],[1,0]] + b [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside. 

Matrix would be:
