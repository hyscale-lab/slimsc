Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this Michael addition problem. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves a nucleophile attacking the beta position of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile is usually an enolate ion, right? So, the first part of the question has three separate reactions, and I need to figure out the products for each.

Let's see the first reaction: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt and EtOH. Wait, NaOEt is sodium ethoxide, a strong base, so I think it deprotonates something to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate has two ester groups; I recall that it's a good Michael donor because it can form a conjugate base (enolate) easily. When the enolate attacks the alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl, which is the acceptor here.

So the acceptor is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. Its structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the p-tolyl group on the beta carbon. Wait, actually, the structure is CH2-C(=O)-OCH2CH3? No, wait, no, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(O)-OCH3, but with p-tolyl on the acrylate part. Maybe it's (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH2-C(O)OCH3? Wait, no, wait. Acrylate is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. But methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe it's CH2=CH-C-O-p-tolyl? No, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct structure is probably (E)-CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-COOCH3? No, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula for acrylate is CH2=CHCOOR. So, if it's 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, the substituent is on
