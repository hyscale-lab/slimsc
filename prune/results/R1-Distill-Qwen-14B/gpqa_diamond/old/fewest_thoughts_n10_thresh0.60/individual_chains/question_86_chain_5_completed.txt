Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents. The first reaction uses compound A and LiBH4 with H+ to produce (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The second reaction uses compound B and BH3 with H+ to give (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. I need to select the correct starting materials A and B from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they work under different conditions and maybe have different selectivities. Wait, wait. Wait, LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent than BH3 (which is typically used in a different solvent, maybe THF?), but more importantly, I think BH3 is used for ketone reductions, but wait, no—LiBH4 usually reduces ketones to secondary alcohols, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I think BH3 is used in hydroboration reactions, which are different. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think: BH3 is used in the BH3·THF (tetrahydrofuran) complex for hydroboration reactions, which typically add across double bonds in an anti-Markovnikov fashion. But wait, in this problem, the product is a ketone. Wait, that can't be. Oh no, wait. Wait, the product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a cyclic ketone, right? So maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether or something that undergoes ring-opening to form a ketone upon reduction.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material was an ester or something that gets reduced to a ketone. Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester, like a lactone, which upon reduction would form a diol or something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this confused.

Wait, let me think about the reagents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, no, wait: LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols? Oh wait, no, wait. Typically, esters (R-O-CO-R') are reduced by LiBH4 to give alcohols. For example, an ester RCOOR' would reduce to RCH2OH and R'OH? Or does it reduce the carbonyl to an alcohol? Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The ester group is RCOOR'. LiBH4 reduces the carbonyl to an alcohol. Wait, no, I'm getting confused because LiBH4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce esters to aldehydes? Or maybe to alcohols. Let me think: I think that LiBH4 can't reduce esters to alcohols. Wait, no, wait. I think that esters are reduced by LiBH4 to give the corresponding alcohols. For example, ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) would be reduced by LiBH4 to CH3CH2OH (ethanol) and maybe another alcohol, but wait, no, that's not right. Alternatively, maybe the ester is first converted to a ketone under certain conditions. No, perhaps I should think differently.

Wait, let's look at the product: 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So that's a six-membered ring (since pyran has six atoms), with two substituents: an ethyl group at position 4 and a ketone at position 2. So it's a cyclic ketone. So the starting material for each reaction must be something that, upon reduction, forms this ketone.

Wait, but wait. Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are both used as reducing agents. Oh wait, is it possible that LiBH4 is used for reducing esters to ketones? Or maybe the starting material is an epoxide, and the reagent opens it. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ether with an ester group. Oh wait, wait, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material is a lactone (cyclic ester), which when reduced gives the ketone.

Wait, but let me think about the reaction. If you have a lactone (cyclic ester) and you reduce it with a strong reducing agent like LiBH4, what happens? Lactones are esters, so maybe the LiBH4 would reduce the ester group. Wait, esters are RCOOR', so LiBH4 would reduce that to RCH2OR'—but wait, that's not a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a different functional group.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone that's been protected, and the reducing agent is deprotecting it.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about what each reagent does.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, esters to alcohols (maybe), amides to amines, etc. Wait a second, wait: LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. For example, ethyl acetate (CH3COOEt) would be reduced by LiBH4 to ethanol (CH3CH2OH) and maybe something else? Or wait, perhaps I'm confusing with another reaction. Alternatively, maybe the ester is converted into a ketone upon reduction. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something similar. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with an adjacent ketone group, and the reducing agent is opening it.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product structure. The product is 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. So it's a six-membered ring with a ketone at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4.

So the ring is probably formed via a hemiacetal or acetal formation. Wait, if the starting material is an aldehyde or ketone that's been protected as an acetal, then when you reduce it, you might get something else.

Wait, but in the problem, the reagents are LiBH4 and BH3. So perhaps the starting materials are esters or something else that can form the ketone upon reduction.

Wait, another approach: the product is a ketone, which is formed from the reduction of some group. So the starting material must have a carbonyl group (like an ester or a ketone) that upon reduction would form this product.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because LiBH4 is a reducing agent, not oxidizing. So if the product is a ketone, the starting material must have a higher oxidation state.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think. Wait, ketones are at a certain oxidation state. If you're reducing an ester, perhaps you get a secondary alcohol. But our product is a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are cyclic ethers with ketone groups. Or perhaps they're lactones.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an epoxide. When you open an epoxide with a reducing agent, you might form something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that when reduced forms a diol, but I'm not seeing how that would form a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with an ester group. Let me think. Suppose the starting material is an ester group adjacent to a ketone, and when reduced, the ester is converted into an alcohol, possibly forming a ring. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar. Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach it differently.

Looking at the options, the starting materials are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with either R or S configuration. So the structure is a pentanoic acid, with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 3, there's an ethyl group; at position 5, an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo).

Wait, so the structure is like:

CH2CH2COOH
But wait, more precisely, the structure is a pentanoic acid (five carbons), with substituents on carbons 3 and 5. Carbon 3: ethyl group; carbon 5: isobutoxy and oxo (so it's a ketone).

Wait, so the structure is:

CH2-C(ethyl)-C(OCH2CH(CH3)2)-COOH ? No, wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but in this case, it's 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the pentanoic acid has five carbons in the chain. Let me number from the COOH end.

Carbon 1: COOH
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: CH(CH2CH3) (ethyl)
Carbon 4: CH (since it's pentanoic, so positions 1 to 5)
Wait, but wait: 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Wait, the pentanoic acid would be:

CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, but with substituents. So:

Position 3 (third carbon from COOH) has an ethyl group. Position 5 (which is the same as the first carbon, since COOH is on C5?) No, wait, I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, in pentanoic acid, the chain is five carbons, with the COOH on C1. So the chain is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's hexanoic. Wait no, pentanoic is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, so the COOH is on C5, and the chain is C5-C4-C3-C2-C1. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to draw the structure:

The compound is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So the pentanoic acid is five carbons long, with the COOH on the first carbon. Then, the third carbon (C3) has an ethyl group, and the fifth carbon (C5) has both an isobutoxy group and a ketone (oxo) group.

Wait, that would make the structure:

COOH-(CH2)-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OCH(CH2)2CH3)-CH2-?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because position 5 would be beyond the chain. Wait, maybe I'm numbering differently. Let me think again.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the carbons are:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: CH2
5: CH3

Wait, but that's not right. Wait, I think I'm mixing up the numbering. Actually, the carboxylic acid is on the first carbon. So the formula is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is actually butanoic acid. Wait, no, wait: butanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2COOH (four carbons). Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH (five carbons). Wait no, I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

The correct IUPAC name for pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. So it's CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, which is pentanoic acid. So the chain is five carbons, with the COOH on the first carbon.

So, 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid would have an ethyl group on carbon 3 and an isobutoxy group and a ketone on carbon 5.

Wait, but carbon 5 is the last carbon (CH3), so it can't have both isobutoxy and a ketone. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Unless the structure is a cyclic one, but that's unclear.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-OCH(CH2)2CH3 ?

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, not five. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but maybe I should move forward.

So, the starting materials are these pentanoic acid derivatives. When treated with LiBH4 and H+ (probably an acid workup), and BH3 with H+, they form the same product but with different configurations (R and S).

Wait, so maybe the starting materials are esters, and the reduction leads to the formation of the ketone.

Wait, no, because the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material is an ester that upon reduction gives a secondary alcohol, but then why would that form a ketone? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a ketone group. Then, when reduced, the ester is converted to an alcohol, but the ketone remains. But that doesn't form a ketone, it would form a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that upon reduction forms a diol, which then somehow forms the ketone. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is a hemiacetal or acetal. For example, if the starting material is an acetal, then treatment with a strong reducing agent like LiBH4 could break the acetal and form an alcohol. But how would that lead to a ketone? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal, and reduction leads to ring opening, forming a diol, which then tautomerizes or undergoes some rearrangement to form the ketone. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone ester, and the reduction converts the ester into an alcohol, which somehow forms the ring. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the stereochemistry. The product has either R or S configuration, and the starting materials have different configurations (A and B are different). So when each starting material is reduced with a different reagent (LiBH4 and BH3), they give different configurations in the product.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but they have different mechanisms. LiBH4 is a stronger reducing agent and is typically used in more polar solvents, like methanol or ethanol. BH3, especially when used in hydroboration, typically follows anti-Markovnikov addition and has a preference for less substituted positions.

Wait, but in this problem, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting materials are epoxides or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and the reduction leads to the formation of a secondary alcohol. But wait, the product is a ketone, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a nitrile? But I don't think LiBH4 reduces nitriles to ketones. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an ester group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of the starting material being a ketal. Let me explain: a ketal is a protecting group for a carbonyl. If the starting material is a ketal, then treatment with a reducing agent like LiBH4 would break the ketal and form an alcohol. But then that wouldn't produce a ketone—it would produce an alcohol.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the product structure again. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a six-membered ring with a ketone group. The ethyl is at position 4. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal or something similar, which upon reduction would form the ring.

Wait, diethyl acetal of a ketone would be something like (CH2CH2O)2COR. When reduced, perhaps the acetal is broken and the ketone is formed. But that doesn't make sense because the acetal protects the carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that gets reduced to form the ketone. Wait, but a lactone upon reduction would form a diol, not a ketone.

Wait, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone with an ester group. Then, reducing the ester group would produce an alcohol, which could form the ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, undergoes a ring-forming reaction to give the ketone. But I'm not quite getting it.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. For example, something like RCOCH2COOR'. When reduced, the ester group (COOR') could be reduced to CH2OH, and the ketone (RCO-CH2-) could be reduced to RCH2-CH2OH. But that doesn't directly explain the formation of a cyclic ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a bicyclic ester, and upon reduction, it forms a ring with a ketone.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think about the stereochemistry part.

The product from reaction A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and from reaction B it's (S). So when compounds A and B are treated with LiBH4 and BH3 respectively, they form enantiomers.

Wait, so the starting materials A and B must have opposite configurations that, upon reduction, produce R and S configurations respectively.

But how does the configuration of the starting material affect the configuration of the product?

Ah, perhaps the starting materials are esters with a chiral center, and the reduction leads to inversion or retention of configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure how the configuration would change during the reduction.

Wait, considering that LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and BH3 is a milder one, perhaps the stereochemistry of the product depends on the reducing agent used.

Wait, but in any case, the key is that A and B, when reduced with different reagents, give R and S products respectively.

Looking at the options, options D has A as R and B as S. Option C has A as S and B as R.

So, which is it?

Wait, maybe the configuration of the starting material and the reagent determine the configuration of the product.

Let me think: if the starting material is a ketone, and you reduce it with LiBH4, you get an alcohol. But wait, the product is a ketone, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps it's the opposite: the starting materials are esters, and when reduced, they form the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone), and upon reduction, it opens into a diol, which then forms the ketone.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me think about the possible options.

Looking at the options, all four options have A and B as either R or S configurations, same or different.

The correct answer would be the pair where the configurations of A and B are such that upon reduction, they produce the R and S products respectively.

Assuming that the reducing agent's selectivity (LiBH4 vs BH3) determines the configuration of the product.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure how that works. Maybe I should think about the possibility of the starting materials being acyclic and forming rings upon reduction.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ester, and upon reduction, it forms a cyclic structure with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diethyl esters of acids with a ketone group, and upon reduction, the ester is converted into an alcohol, leading to ring formation.

Wait, the product is a six-membered ring with a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ester of a pentanoic acid with substituents, which upon reduction forms the ring.

Wait, let's think about the possible structure of the product. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

The ring is six-membered: positions 1,2,3,4,5,6.

Position 2: ketone (O)
Position 4: ethyl group.

So the ring is:

O=C-O-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-

Wait, or something like that. Hmm, but I'm not visualizing it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ester, and the reduction forms the ring with the ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester, like CH2CO-CH2COOEt. When reduced, the ester group would be converted to an alcohol, and the keto group to an alcohol as well, but that wouldn't form a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alpha-keto ester: RCOCH2COOR'. Reduction would convert the ester to an alcohol, but the ketone would stay as it is. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the stereochemistry of the starting materials.

Suppose the starting material A is R configuration. When treated with LiBH4, it forms R product. Starting material B is S, when treated with BH3, forms S product.

But why would the same starting material give different configurations based on the reducing agent?

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the starting material and the reducing agent together determine the configuration of the product. For example, if the starting material is R, LiBH4 reduces it to R, and starting material S with BH3 gives S.

But I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epimers (differing in configuration at a single stereocenter). When reduced with different reagents, they form enantiomers.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Let me try to approach this from the options.

Option D says A is R and B is S. So when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. When B is treated with BH3, it gives S product.

If the configuration of the starting material is opposite in A and B, then perhaps the reducing agents lead to retention or inversion.

Wait, perhaps LiBH4 leads to retention of configuration, and BH3 leads to inversion, or vice versa.

But I'm not sure about the actual behavior of these reagents in this context.

Another approach: the product is a pyran-2-one derivative. Pyran is a six-membered ring with oxygen. So the product is a cyclic ketone. So perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. When the acetal is reduced, the ketone is regenerated.

Wait, but if the starting material is an acetal, and upon reduction, the acetal is hydrolyzed to the ketone, that would make sense.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents. How would they affect an acetal?

Wait, an acetal is a protecting group for a ketone. To remove the acetal, you typically hydrolyze it under acidic conditions. But if you reduce an acetal with LiBH4, perhaps it would break the acetal and form the corresponding diol and the ketone.

Wait, but that doesn't directly form the product, which is a cyclic ketone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic acetal, which when reduced, opens to form a diol, which then rearranges into the cyclic ketone. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester in a cyclic structure. For example, a lactone (cyclic ester). When reduced with LiBH4, the ester is converted into an alcohol, which could form the cyclic structure.

Wait, let's think about the lactone scenario. Suppose the starting material is a lactone. When reduced with LiBH4, the ester group (lactone) would be reduced. Wait, LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols. So a lactone (cyclic ester) would be reduced to a diol. But the product is a cyclic ketone, not a diol. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester. When reduced, the ester group is converted to an alcohol, and the ketone remains. But then the product would be a secondary alcohol, not a ketone.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the possible answer options and see which makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option D: A is R, B is S. So when A is treated with LiBH4, it gives R product. When B is treated with BH3, it gives S product.

Which option would lead to R and S products based on the starting material's configuration?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epimers, and the reducing agents cause different configurations to form.

Wait, but I'm not making much progress. I'll try to think about the possible reaction mechanisms.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces esters to alcohols. BH3, especially in the presence of a Lewis acid like THF, is used for hydroboration, which is anti-Markovnikov addition to alkenes. But in this problem, the starting materials are presumably carbonyl compounds.

Wait, wait. Another possibility: the starting materials are cyclic ethers with a ketone group. Upon reduction, the ether is opened, and the ketone is formed.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a ketone substituent. When reduced, the ester is converted into an alcohol, leading to the formation of the ring with the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an acyclic ester with a ketone, and upon reduction, it forms a cyclic structure with a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol but retains the ketone. But that doesn't lead to a cyclic product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a γ-keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol and a ketone. Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the product again. 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The ring has six members, so perhaps the starting material is a five-membered ring ester that upon reduction forms the six-membered ring with a ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diethyl ester of a β-keto acid, which upon reduction forms the ring.

But I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options again.

The options are all 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which is a pentanoic acid with substituents on carbons 3 and 5. The configuration is either R or S.

So, when this acid is treated with a reducing agent, perhaps the ester group (if present) is reduced. Wait, but the structure as given is a carboxylic acid, not an ester.

Wait, that's a problem because LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce carboxylic acids. They're generally not reduced by LiBH4. Wait, but the starting materials in the options are carboxylic acids. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait, the starting materials are (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, etc. So they're acids with an oxo group at position 5.

Wait, so the structure would be:

COOH - CH2 - CH(CH2CH3) - C(OCH(CH2)2CH3) - CH2 ?

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, not five. Or maybe I'm numbering wrong.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

Position 1: COOH

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3)

Position 4: C(OCH(CH2)2CH3)

Position 5: CH2 ?

Wait, that doesn't add up to five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(OCH(CH2CH2CH3)) ?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think about the possibilities.

If the starting material is a β-keto acid, then upon reduction, the keto group could be converted into an alcohol, but LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce carboxylic acids. So perhaps the starting material is an ester.

Wait, but the options say it's a pentanoic acid, so the COOH is present. So perhaps the reaction involves reducing the ester to an alcohol, but if it's a carboxylic acid, that's not possible.

Hmm, perhaps the starting material is a β-keto acid, and when reduced, the keto group is converted into an alcohol, but LiBH4 can reduce the keto group to an alcohol, leaving the carboxylic acid intact.

Wait, but then the product would be a secondary alcohol, not a ketone. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic β-keto ester. When reduced, the ester becomes an alcohol, and the ketone remains.

But I'm not seeing how that forms the product, which is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) with a β-keto group. Upon reduction with a reductant, the ester is converted into an alcohol, and the ketone remains. But then the product would have an alcohol group, not a ketone.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should just look at the options again.

The correct answer is either C or D. Because option D has A as R and B as S, and option C has A as S and B as R.

Assuming that when the starting material is R, it gives R product with LiBH4, and when the starting material is S, it gives S product with BH3.

But why would the reagents affect the configuration in that way?

Alternatively, perhaps the reducing agents cause different stereochemical outcomes based on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are diastereomers, and the reagents reduce them in a way that produces enantiomers.

Wait, but if the starting materials are enantiomers (mirror images), then reducing them with different reagents could produce enantiomeric products.

Wait, that's possible. So if A is R and B is S, then upon reduction with different reagents, they form R and S products respectively.

So looking at the options, option D has A as R and B as S. So when A is reduced with LiBH4, it gives R product, and B is reduced with BH3 to give S product.

Wait, but why would the reagents affect the configuration? Maybe because LiBH4 and BH3 have different selectivities.

Alternatively, perhaps the reagents result in different reaction pathways, leading to opposite configurations.

But I'm not certain. Given the options, I think the correct answer is D, where A is R and B is S. Because when each is reduced with their respective reagents, they form R and S products.


The problem involves determining the correct starting materials A and B for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from A with LiBH4 and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one from B with BH3. The starting materials are given as 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, which can exist as either (R) or (S) configurations.

The key observations are:

1. **Reagents and Products**: Both LiBH4 and BH3 are reducing agents, but they differ in their mechanisms and stereochemical outcomes. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, while BH3 (often used in hydroboration) can exhibit different stereochemical preferences depending on the reaction conditions.

2. **Starting Material**: The starting materials are enantiomers of 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, differing in configuration (R or S). The stereochemistry of the starting material influences the stereochemistry of the product.

3. **Stereochemical Outcome**: The product from reaction A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, and the product from reaction B is (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. This suggests that the starting materials A and B must have opposite configurations (R and S, respectively) to yield the enantiomeric products.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would not produce the required enantiomeric products.
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This would also not produce the required enantiomeric products.
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would produce (S) and (R) products, respectively, which does not match the given products.
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This would produce (R) and (S) products, respectively, matching the given products.

Thus, the correct starting materials are A = (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and B = (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

Answer: D
