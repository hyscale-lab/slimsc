Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state is given as |alpha> proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually written in terms of basis states. Here, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form an orthonormal basis. That probably means they're eigenvectors for the spin-z operator with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively.

The first part of the problem asks for the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator is given as Aij, where Aij = ħ/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, what does that matrix look like? For a 2x2 matrix, since the basis is |up> and |down>, the matrix would be:

A = [ [0, ħ/2],
      [ħ/2, 0] ]

Because for i≠j, Aij is ħ/2, and for i=j, it's 0. So this is a 2x2 matrix with zero diagonal and ħ/2 off-diagonal. I think this operator is related to the spin in the x-direction because the Pauli X matrix is similar, which has eigenstates |+x> and |-x>.

Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], but in this case, the A matrix has ħ/2 as the off-diagonal elements. So maybe this operator is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix. Because the Pauli matrices usually have elements 1 or -1, but here the scaling is different.

So, the eigenstates of this operator A are the eigenstates of the spin-x operator. So to find the probabilities, I need to express the given state |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities will be the square of the magnitudes of the coefficients.

But wait, actually, the operator A is diagonal in the eigenbasis of the x-axis. So the eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and
