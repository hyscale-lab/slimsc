Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

So the question is about a chemist performing two reactions with two different reducing agents. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, no, the products are each from different reactions. Let me check again.

Wait, the question says:

A + LiBH4 + H+ → (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one
B + BH3 + H+ → (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one

So the starting material A is treated with LiBH4, and H+ probably as a workup, and gives the R enantiomer. Starting material B is treated with BH3 and H+ and gives the S enantiomer.

The options give possible structures for A and B, both being 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, but with different stereochemistry (S or R).

I need to determine what starting materials A and B would be to form these products through the respective reductions.

Hmm, so I'm thinking about the reactions here. Both are reductions, probably ketones to secondary alcohols. Wait, no, wait—LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, typically used for ketones and aldehydes, converting them into alcohols. BH3, which is usually used in the form of BH3-THF (tetrahydrofuran), is another reducing agent, but I think it's more selective. Wait, maybe the question is about the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, but with different stereochemistry depending on the reducing agent.

Wait, but both LiBH4 and BH3 are used for ketone reductions, but I remember that LiBH4 tends to give more racemic products when the ketone is prochiral. Oh wait, no—wait, no, when the ketone is prochiral, like in the case of a cyclic ketone, the reduction can lead to the formation of a chiral center. The reducing agent's method can influence the stereochemistry.

Wait, but let me think—LiBH4 is a bulky reducing agent? Or not. No, BH3 is more selective in
