Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about a star with certain parameters. So, the star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. Without any spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

Wait, but then the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). They observe that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the question is asking for the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor should be the ratio when no spots are present divided by when spots are present. So star without spots has higher ratio, star with spots has lower. So the factor is (no spots ratio)/(has spots ratio), which would be a number greater than 1.

The transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Ã…. And it's stated that the photosphere is in LTE, so Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium applies. That probably means we can use the Boltzmann equation for the level populations.

The Boltzmann equation states that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n2/n1) = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where g is the statistical weight (degeneracy) of each level, E is energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

Wait, but the problem says that the ratio decreases when there are spots. So let me think about how temperature affects this ratio. The exponential term depends on the energy difference divided by temperature. If the temperature decreases, what happens to the ratio?

If the energy difference E2 - E1 is positive (since level 2 is higher than level 1), then a lower T would make the exponential term smaller. So the ratio n2/n1 would decrease if the temperature drops.

But wait, the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level
