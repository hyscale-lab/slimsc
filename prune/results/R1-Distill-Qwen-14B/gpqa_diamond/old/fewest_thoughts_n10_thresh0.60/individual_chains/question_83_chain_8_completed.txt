Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that when you titrate a weak acid with a strong base, the pH changes at different points. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. 

Let me read the problem again. We start with 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. Then we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. So the initial concentration must be halved because the volume doubles. Oh wait, wait, when you mix equal volumes, the concentration becomes half. So 0.05 M becomes 0.025 M after dilution.

Next, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The first step is to find the pH at 25% titration. Wait, 25% of what? Oh right, 25% of the equivalence point volume. So I need to calculate the volume of NaOH needed to reach 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, what's the equivalence point volume? Let me think. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. The initial moles of acetic acid: volume (L) multiplied by concentration. So 0.02 L (20 cm³) times 0.05 M is 0.001 moles. Wait, no, wait. Wait the initial is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. So 0.02 L * 0.05 mol/L = 0.001 mol. Then we add 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³, so the concentration becomes 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. 

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the moles of NaOH (which is a strong base) will neutralize the acetic acid. The reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O. So at equivalence point, moles of NaOH = moles of CH3COOH.

So, moles of CH3COOH is 0.001 mol. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume needed is (0.001 mol) / (0.1 M) )= 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So the equivalence point is at 10 cm³ of NaOH. 

Wait, but wait, the problem says we're adding NaOH. So the initial volume of acetic acid solution after dilution is 40 cm³. But when you titrate, you add NaOH until equivalence. So the equivalence point is when 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH is added.

So 25% titration would be 25% of 10 cm³, which is 2.5 cm³. So at 2.5 cm³, 25% of the equivalence point is reached. But wait, wait, I think another approach is better. Because sometimes the 25% refers to the volume of base added, not the equivalence point. Or maybe not. Let me think. No, I think in titration problems, when they say at 25% titration, it usually refers to 25% of the volume needed to reach the equivalence point. So yes, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added.

Now, for the first part, the pH at 25% titration. So, in this case, only 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the moles of NaOH added would be 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. Since acetic acid is 0.001 mol, the moles reacted are 0.00025 mol. So the remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of acetate ion (CH3COO^-) formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, the total volume now is the original 40 cm³ plus the 2.5 cm³ of NaOH added. So 42.5 cm³ = 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations are:
[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M
[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M

This is a buffer solution, so I can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The pKa is -log(1.85e-5) ≈ 4.735.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

So pH = 4.735 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647)

Calculating the ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333, which is 1/3.

Log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH = 4.735 - 0.477 ≈ 4.258. Let's say approximately 4.26. That would match option A's first value, but let me check the options.

Options are:

A) 4.26; 8.52

B) 3.17; 6.73

C) 4.73;7.00

D)4.57;6.92

So first part is about 4.26, which is option A or D. Wait, but let me redo the calculations more accurately.

Wait, let me compute pKa accurately.

Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let's compute that:

log(1.85) is about 0.267. So log(1.85e-5) is 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa is 4.733.

Wait, why did I get 4.735 before? Hmm, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

But anyway, let's go with pKa ≈4.733.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is 0.00025 / 0.0425 / (0.00075 / 0.0425) )= 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3. So the ratio is 1/3.

So log(1/3) is approximately -0.477.

So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256 ≈4.26. So first part is around 4.26. So option A has first part as 4.26.

Now the equivalence point. At equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ions. So the solution is a solution of sodium acetate in water. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid and strong base, so it will hydrolyze in water to form a basic solution.

The moles of acetate ions at equivalence point are 0.001 mol (since all the acetic acid is converted to acetate). The total volume is 40 cm³ (original solution) + 10 cm³ (NaOH added) =50 cm³=0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 =0.02 M.

The acetate ion is the conjugate base of acetic acid, so it will hydrolyze:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb=1e-14 /1.85e-5 ≈5.405e-10.

The concentration is 0.02 M. Let's set up the ICE table.

Initial:
[CH3COO^-] =0.02 M
[CH3COOH]=0
[OH^-] =0

Change:
- x
+ x
+ x

At equilibrium:
[CH3COO^-] =0.02 -x
[CH3COOH]=x
[OH^-] =x

So Kb = (x^2)/(0.02 -x) ≈ x^2 / 0.02, since x is very small.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 =5.405e-10 * 0.02 =1.081e-11.

x^2=1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11 )= approx 3.29e-6 M.

So [OH^-] =3.29e-6 → pOH =-log(3.29e-6) ≈5.486. Since pH + pOH=14, pH=14 -5.486=8.514. So approximately 8.51.

Looking at the options, option A's equivalence point is 8.52, which matches this.

So the two pH values are approximately 4.26 and 8.52, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Wait another thought: when you dilute the acetic acid, the initial concentration is 0.025 M, but when you add NaOH, the volume increases. So when calculating buffer concentrations, I have to consider the total volume correctly.

Wait, for the 25% titration, I added 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. So the moles of NaOH are 0.1 *0.0025=0.00025 mol. As the acetic acid was 0.001 mol initially, so 0.00025 mol reacts, leaving 0.00075 mol of HA. And 0.00025 mol of A^-.

But the total volume is 40 + 2.5 =42.5 cm³=0.0425 L. So the concentrations are [HA]=0.00075 /0.0425= 0.017647 M; [A^-]=0.00025/0.0425=0.005882 M. So the ratio is 0.005882/0.017647=0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH= pKa + log(0.3333). Log(1/3)= approx -0.477. So pH=4.733 -0.477=4.256, about 4.26.

So the first part is correct. The equivalence point pH is about 8.51, which is very close to option A's second value of 8.52.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we first calculate the initial concentration of acetic acid after dilution. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ (0.02 L) with a concentration of 0.05 M, giving 0.001 moles of acetic acid. After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L), so the new concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
\]

Next, we determine the equivalence point volume. At equivalence, moles of NaOH equal moles of acetic acid. Since the moles of acetic acid are 0.001 mol and the concentration of NaOH is 0.1 M, the volume of NaOH required is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{mol}}{0.1 \, \text{M}} = 0.01 \, \text{L} = 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

At 25% titration, 25% of the equivalence point volume (10.00 cm³) is added, which is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH at 25% titration} = 0.25 \times 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

The moles of NaOH added at 25% titration are:

\[
\text{Moles of NaOH} = 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Since 0.00025 mol of NaOH reacts with 0.00025 mol of acetic acid, the remaining moles of acetic acid are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetic acid remaining} = 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The moles of acetate ion (\( \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- \)) formed are:

\[
\text{Moles of acetate ion} = 0.00025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The total volume at 25% titration is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ion are:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M},
\]
\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} \right),
\]

where \( \text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733 \). Substituting the concentrations:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right).
\]

The ratio \( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \approx 0.333 \), and \( \log(0.333) \approx -0.477 \). Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \approx 4.26.
\]

At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid is neutralized to acetate ion. The moles of acetate ion are 0.001 mol, and the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of acetate ion is:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
\]

Acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
\]

The \( K_b \) for acetate ion is:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

Using the approximation \( K_b \approx \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-]} \), where \( x = [\text{OH}^-] \):

\[
x^2 = K_b \cdot [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = (5.405 \times 10^{-10})(0.02) = 1.081 \times 10^{-11}.
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.29 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.29 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.486.
\]

The pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.486 \approx 8.514 \approx 8.52.
\]

Thus, the pH at 25% titration is approximately 4.26, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately 8.52. The correct answer is:
