Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of the decays of a particle X^0.

Alright, let me start by understanding the problem. The decay process is X^0 → Y^+ Z^-. The proper lifetime of X^0 is τ0 = 8e-16 seconds. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X^0 is 3.41 GeV. The question is asking for the minimum resolution, which I think refers to the detection resolution required to see at least 30% of these decays.

Wait, what's the proper lifetime? Oh right, proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. So when the particle is moving, its lifetime appears longer due to time dilation. But how does that affect the decay observation?

I remember that the number of particles that decay within a certain time depends on the Lorentz factor gamma. Gamma is the factor by which time dilates, given by gamma = total energy / rest mass energy. Because energy is 27 GeV and mass is 3.41 GeV, so gamma would be 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that: 27 divided by 3.41. Let's see, 3.41 times 7 is about 23.87, and 3.41*8 is 27.28, so 27 is a bit less than 8 times. So gamma is approximately 7.9 something, maybe around 7.91.

Once I have gamma, the lifetime as observed in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So tau = gamma * tau0. That would be 7.91 * 8e-16 seconds. Let me compute that: 7.91 *8 is approximately 63.28, so tau is about 6.328e-15 seconds.

Wait, but how does that relate to the minimum resolution? Oh, right, because the particles are moving, their decay paths might be too short for the detector to resolve. So the decay length is the distance the particle travels before decaying, which is velocity multiplied by the lifetime.

Wait,
