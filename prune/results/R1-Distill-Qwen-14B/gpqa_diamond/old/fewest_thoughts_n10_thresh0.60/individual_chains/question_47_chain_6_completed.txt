Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out which compound it is based on the spectroscopic data provided. Let me take it step by step.

The molecular formula given is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation first. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as (2n +2 - m - x - p)/2. Wait, n is the number of carbons, m hydrogens, x oxygen, p nitrogen. So here n=9, m=11, x=2, p=1.

Plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -2 -1)/2 = (20 - 14)/2 = 6/2 = 3. So DoU is 3. That means three double bonds, rings, or a combination. Maybe a benzene ring (that's 4 DoU, wait no, benzene is 3 because it's a ring plus three double bonds? Wait, no. Each ring or double bond is one DoU. Benzene has three double bonds and one ring? No, wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three conjugated double bonds. So that counts as 4 DoU? Wait, no, actually, each ring or double bond is one. Benzene has three double bonds and one ring, but that's not correct. Wait, no: each ring or double bond is one DoU. So benzene is a ring (that's one) plus three double bonds (each is another), but no, wait, that's not right. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring with three conjugated double bonds. Each double bond is a DoU. But a ring is also a DoU. So a benzene ring has three DoU? Wait, no. Wait, the structure of benzene is a ring with three double bonds, but the DoU counts each ring as one, and each double bond as one. So benzene is a ring (1) plus three double bonds (3), total four DoU? But that can't be right because the molecular formula for benzene is C6H6. Let's compute its DoU: (2*6 +2 -6)/2 = (14-6)/2=8/2=4. Right, so benzene has four DoU. So in our case, the compound has a DoU of 3, which could mean a benzene ring (4 DoU) is too much. Hmm. So maybe a benzene ring is not present? Or perhaps it's another structure.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me see. If it's an aromatic compound with a benzene ring, then maybe a substituent. Let me think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A) 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide suggests a benzene ring with an amide group. Structure would be benzene with an OEt (ethoxy) and a CONH2 group. Wait, but benzamide is usually where the amide is attached directly. So 3-ethoxybenzamide would have OEt at position 3 and the amide group at position where?

Option B) N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So this would be HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the benzene ring has an ethoxy group at para position, and the amide is attached via the N.

Option C) 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the benzene ring has an NH2 group at para, and the propionoate ester or amide? Wait, propionate would be RCOO- as an ester. So 4-aminophenyl propionate would be something like PhNH2 attached to a propionate group. Alternatively, maybe the structure is benzene with NH2 at position 4, and a propionoate ester (like OCOCH2CH2CH3) attached where? Or maybe it's a secondary amide? Hmm, not sure.

Option D) ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would be benzene with NH2 at position 4, and the ester group (COOEt) at the para position. So structure is OEt-CO-benzene with NH2.

Wait, but let me check the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide is C7H7NO. Ethoxy is C2H5O. So C7 + C2 = C9? Wait, benzamide is C6H5CONH2. Adding an ethoxy group (C2H5O-) would be C6H5OEt (C2H5O-) and CONH2. So the structure would be OEt is attached to the benzene. So the formula would be C6H5-O-C2H5 (which is C8H11O) plus the amide (CONH2, which is C2H3NO2). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute it.

Benzamide is C7H7NO2. Adding ethoxy as a substituent would add C2H5O. But wait, when you have substituents on benzene, the formula changes. Let me think: Benzene (C6H6) plus OEt (C2H5O-) and CONH2. So the total formula would be C6 + C2 (from OEt) + C from benzamide? Wait, maybe it's better to compute each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The structure is benzene with OEt and CONH2. So the formula would be:

Benzene (C6H5) + OEt (C2H5O-) + CONH2 (which is O=C-NH2). So combining, the formula is C6 + C2 (from OEt) + C (from CONH2) = C9. Hydrogens: benzene has 5 H (since two substituents?), OEt is C2H5O, so 5 H there, and CONH2 is NH2 which has 2 H. Wait, perhaps I should think it through more carefully.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to consider the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure: benzamide with an ethoxy at position 3. Benzamide is C7H7NO2. But wait, the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

Wait, let's compute each option's formula.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So C7H7NO2. Adding an ethoxy group would replace a H on benzene. So the formula would be C6 + C2 (from OEt) + C (from CONH2). Wait, no, because the benzamide already includes the C from CONH2.

Wait, the molecular formula for 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C9H11NO2?

Let me count: benzene (6 C) + OEt (2 C) + CONH2 (1 C) → 6+2+1=9 C. H: benzene would have 5 H (if two substituents), OEt contributes 5 H (since it's C2H5O), and CONH2 contributes 2 H. So 5 +5 + 2=12? Wait, but that seems off because the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, but I'm probably messing up the H count. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to accept that each option's molecular formula matches C9H11NO2. Let me check:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide: Each substituent is OEt and CONH2 on benzene. So benzene has 6 C. OEt is C2H5O, so that's 2 C. Benzamide contributes a CONH2, which is 2 O and 1 C. Wait, but benzamide is C6H5CONH2. So that's 7 C, but with an ethoxy group, it's C7 + C2? No, wait, the structure is C6H5-O-C2H5 (ethoxy) and C6H5-CONH2. Wait, no, that's not right. 3-ethoxybenzamide would be C6H4(OEt)(CONH2). So the formula is C6 (benzene) + OEt (C2H5O) → C6 + C2 = C8, plus the CONH2 (which is another C). So 8 +1 =9 C. H: benzene has 4 H (two substituents). OEt has 5 H. CONH2 has 2 H. So total H: 4+5+2=11. O: from OEt (1), and CONH2 (2 O) → 3 O? But molecular formula is O2. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

In 3-ethoxybenzamide, the structure is benzene ring with two substituents: ethoxy group (OEt) and a benzamide group (CONH2). So the molecular formula would be:

C6 (benzene) + C2 (from OEt) + C (from CONH2) → C9.

Hydrogen: Benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). OEt has 5 H. CONH2 has 2 H. So 4 +5 +2=11 H. O: OEt contributes 1 O, CONH2 contributes 2 O → total 3 O. But the formula given is O2. So that can't be right. So A must not be correct.

Wait, the given formula is C9H11NO2. So O is 2. So option A's O would be 3, which doesn't match. So A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. Formamide is HCONR2. So here, the R is 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure is HCO-N-(4-ethoxyphenyl). So the formula would be:

Phenyl group (C6H5) with OEt (C2H5O) → C8H9O. Plus formamide part: HCONR2 where R is the phenyl group. Wait, formamide is HCONH2. But in this case, the N is attached to the phenyl. So HCON-(Ph). So the formula would be:

HCON-(Ph-OEt). So:

Phenyl: C6H5.

OEt: C2H5O.

HCON: HCON is (H, C, O, N).

Wait, let me count atoms:

Ph-OEt: C6 + C2 = C8.

HCON: C (from HCO) is 1, plus N from amide.

So total C: 8 (from Ph-OEt) +1 (from HCO) =9 C.

H: from Ph-OEt: benzene has 3 H (since OEt is at para position, so two substituents on benzene), OEt contributes 5 H. HCON has H (1 from HCO), and N attached to phenyl doesn't add H. So H from Ph-OEt: 3 (benzene) + 5 (OEt) =8. Plus H from HCO: 1. Total H: 9. But given formula is H11. Hmm, so that doesn't add up. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the OEt is on the benzene, and the formamide is attached as HCO-N-Ph-OEt. So the formula would be:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O.

HCON: HCON has H (1), C (1), O (1), N (1). So with the phenyl group, it's C8 + C1 =9 C, which matches. O: from OEt (1) and HCO (1) → 2 O. So O is correct.

Hydrogen: OEt contributes 5 H. Benzene in Ph-OEt has 3 H (since it's substituted at two positions; para position, so four positions, but substituents at 1 and 4? Wait, no, 4-ethoxyphenyl implies substituent at para position, so benzene has 4 H (since two substituents: OEt and the N-attached group). Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula of option B is correct.

Wait, let's compute for option B:

Ph-OEt is C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H10O.

Then, HCON-Ph-OEt → adds a H, C, O, N.

So HCON is H, C, O, N. So adding that to the Ph-OEt group.

So the formula would be:

C: 8 (from Ph-OEt) + 1 (from HCO) =9.

H: Ph-OEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3 has 5 H: CH2 has 2 and CH3 has 3?), and benzene has 4 H (since two substituents). Wait, benzene with two substituents (OEt and the N-) would have 4 H. So 4 (Ph) + 5 (OEt's CH2CH3) =9 H. Then, H from HCO is 1. So total H=10. But the given formula has 11 H. So that's a problem. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the structure is different. Let me think again. The formamide is HCONR2, but in this case, R is the 4-ethoxyphenyl group. So the structure is HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl), which would be:

HCON-Ph-OEt.

So the formula would be:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O (since benzene is C6H5 (5 H), OCH2CH3 is C2H5O → 5 H from CH2CH3? No, OCH2CH3 has 2 H on CH2 and 3 H on CH3 → 5 H. So benzene (5 H) + OCH2CH3 (5 H) =10 H. Wait, but when you have two substituents on benzene, the H count is 4. So for Ph-OEt, benzene has 4 H; OEt has 5 H. So Ph-OEt has 4+5=9 H. Then, the HCON group adds a H (from HCO), and the N doesn't add any. So total H is 9 (from Ph-OEt) +1 (HCO) =10. But the given formula is 11 H, so perhaps this is not matching. So option B's formula is C9H10NO2, but given is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem. So B might not be the correct option.

Alternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me think about the actual structure. The formamide is HCONR2, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the structure is HCON-(Ph-OEt). So the molecular formula would be:

C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) + 1 (HCO) + 1 (N) → 6+2+1=9 C.

H: Benzene with two substituents (OEt and the N) → 4 H. OEt has 5 H. HCON adds 1 H. So 4+5+1=10 H. But the given formula has 11 H. So it doesn't match. So option B is not correct.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate is CH2CH2COOH (but as an ester, perhaps). Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-.

So the structure could be benzene with NH2 at para position, and a propionate ester group attached. Alternatively, it's an amide. Let me think. If it's a propionate ester, then the structure would be OCOCH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene. So the formula would be:

PhNH2 (C6H5NH2) + OCOCH2CH2CH3 → C6H5NH2OCOCH2CH2CH3.

Wait, that would be C6 (Ph) + C3 (propanoate) + C2 (O connecting) → no, maybe better to count all.

PhNH2: C6H5NH2 → C7H7N.

Propionate ester: OCOCH2CH2CH3 → C3H5O2.

Wait, but the ester is OCOCH2CH2CH3, which is C3H6O2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the molecular formula for option C.

Structure: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So benzene with NH2 at position 4, and a propionoate group. Propionoate would be -O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

So the molecular formula would be:

Benzene (C6H5) → C6, H5.

NH2: adds N and 2 H.

Propionate group: O-CO-CH2CH2CH3: O, COO (but wait, in ester, it's O-CO-O-R? No, wait, no, the ester is R-O-CO-R'. So propionate ester is CH2CH2COO-R, where R is the benzene group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me compute the formula.

The formula for 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C9H11NO2.

Wait, let's see: benzene (6 C) + NH2 (adds 0 C) + propionate (3 C) → 6+3=9 C. That's correct.

Hydrogen: benzene contributes 4 H (since two substituents: NH2 and propionate). NH2 contributes 2 H. Propionate group (CH2CH2COO-) when attached as an ester would have how many H? The ester group is O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, in propionate ester, it's R-O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, the ester would be OCOCH2CH2CH3 attached via an oxygen. So the propionate ester part is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

So for the propionate ester, the H count is: the CH2CH2CH3 group has 3 CH2 groups → 2*(2 H) + 3 H =7 H. But wait, each CH2 has 2 H, except the CH3 which has 3.

Wait, propionate ester group is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3: the CH2CH2CH3 has 2+2+3=7 H. Plus the oxygen and other parts.

So the entire molecule would have:

Benzene: 4 H (since two substituents),

NH2: 2 H,

Propionate ester: 7 H,

But wait, the oxygen and other parts may not add H. So total H would be 4 + 2 + 7 =13. But the given formula is H11. Hmm, that doesn't match.

Alternatively, maybe it's an amide structure. If the propionate is attached as an amide, then the structure would be benzene with NH2 and a CONHCH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but that would make the formula different.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is a carboxylic acid derivative. Wait, in any case, the given formula is C9H11NO2, so let me see. If the structure is PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3, that would be 4-amino phenyl propionate. So counting H:

Ph (with two substituents): 4 H.

NH2: 2 H.

COOCH2CH2CH3: the ester group. The CH2CH2CH3 part has 7 H. The oxygen doesn't add H. So 4 +2 +7=13 H. But the given is 11 H. So this doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in counting. Alternatively, maybe it's a secondary amide. So the structure would be PhNH-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But that would be 4-aminophenyl propanamide. Wait, but that's not the option given. The option is propionate, which is ester, not amide.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is PhNH2 with an ester group. So the formula for 4-aminophenyl propionate would be C9H11NO2.

Wait, let me calculate.

PhNH2 has formula C6H5NH2 → C7H7N.

Propionate ester is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So adding that, the formula becomes C7 (PhNH2) + 3 (propionate) → C10? No, wait, the propionate is O-CO-CH2CH2CH3, which is 3 C. But the ester is connected via O to the benzene. So the formula would be C6 (Ph) + NH2 (no C) + O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (3 C and 1 O). So total C: 6 +3=9. O would be 2 (from ester group: O in the ester linkage and O in the carbonyl). N is 1. H: Let's recalculate.

Ph group with NH2 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 substituents. Benzene has 4 H (two substituents). NH2 has 2 H. O-CO-CH2CH2CH3: the CH2CH2CH3 has 7 H (each CH2 has 2, except CH3 has 3). So total H:4 +2 +7 =13. But the given formula is 11. So that's not matching.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the other option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Structure is benzene with NH2 at position 4 and an ester group (COOEt) at position where? Probably para to NH2. So structure is benzene with NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1 (if numbering starts from the NH2 as position 4, but probably the substituents are at positions 1 and 4). Wait, but the name is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which implies the ester is attached to the benzoate group, with the amino at position 4.

So benzoate is C6H5COO-. But in this case, the benzoate has an NH2 at position 4. So the structure is:

O
|
O-CO-OEt
|
PhNH2

Wait, no. The structure is benzene ring with COOEt group and NH2 at position 4.

So the molecular formula would be:

Ph (C6H5) → C6, H5.

COOEt: C3H5O2. Because COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5.

Wait, but the benzoate ester would be PhCOOEt. So Ph is C6H5, COOEt is C3H5O2. So total C:6 +3=9. H:5 (Ph) +5 (from COOEt, which is O-CO-O-C2H5 → C2H5 has 5 H) → 5 +5=10. Plus, the NH2 group contributes 2 H. So total H:10+2=12. But given formula is H11. Hmm, that's a problem. So D's H count would be 12, but given is 11. So that's not matching.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm counting wrong. Let me think again.

Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure is:

Benzene ring with NH2 at position 4 and COOEt at position 1.

So the formula would be:

PhNH2COOEt → which would be C6H5-NH2-COO-C2H5.

Wait, but that's not correct. The correct structure is benzene with COOEt and NH2. So:

Benzene (C6H5) → when two substituents are present, COOEt and NH2, at para positions.

So the formula is C6H5 (Ph) with COOEt and NH2.

COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5. So C3 (COOEt: C from COO is 2, and C2 from ethyl). So the formula becomes:

Ph (C6H5) → C6.

COOEt: C3 (C from COO, plus C2 from Et).

NH2: adds N and 2 H.

So total C: 6 +3 =9. Correct.

Hydrogen: Ph has 4 H (two substituents). COOEt contributes 5 H (from C2H5). NH2 contributes 2 H. So total H:4 +5 +2=11. That matches the given formula.

O: from COOEt is 3 O (from COO and OEt). Wait, no, COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5. So each O is one. So COO has two O, and O from OEt is another. So total O: 3. But the given formula is O2. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. So O is 2. But in option D, O would be 3. So that's not matching. So that's a problem.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the IR and NMR data provided.

IR data: medium to strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are broad peaks, likely from N-H stretches, possibly from amide or amine groups. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 is typical of a carbonyl group, like ester or amide.

In the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm (t, 3H) → likely a CH3 group attached to an O (like ethyl ester's CH3).

4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) → broad singlet, maybe an N-H group or an OCH2 group. But broad suggests perhaps N-H, but it's 2H. Alternatively, an OCH2 adjacent to an electronegative group (like ester's OCH2).

4.5 ppm (q, 2H) → quartet, likely a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen and next to another CH2. Like in an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, such as OCH2CH2O. Wait, but ethyl esters have triplet for the CH2 next to O. Wait, in ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would have a triplet at around 4.1 ppm, integrating to 2H. But the NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 ppm could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH2, such as in an ethyl group attached to an oxygen elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps it's an acetamide's CH2.

Wait, the 7.0 and 8.0 ppm regions are doublets integrating to 2H each. That suggests two sets of two protons each, which could be from a para-substituted benzene. So a benzene ring with two substituents, each having two protons, but as doublets. That's common for para-substituted aromatic rings.

Putting this together: The IR shows N-H (3420 and 3325) and a carbonyl (1720). The NMR has a triplet at 1.20 (CH3), quartet at 4.5 (CH2), and broad singlet at 4.0 (maybe OCH2). The aromatic protons are at 7.0 and 8.0 as doublets, suggesting para substitution.

Looking at the options:

Option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. That would have a benzene ring with NH2 and COOEt. The IR would show N-H (from amine) and carbonyl (ester). The NMR would have:

- The ethyl ester's CH3 as triplet around 1.2 ppm.

- The OCH2 in the ester would be a quartet, but typically around 4.1 ppm. But in option D, the OCH2 is in the ester, so it's adjacent to the carbonyl. So the OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1. But in the given data, it's at 4.5 ppm (q). Hmm, that's a bit off.

The N-H in the amine would show up as a broad peak, perhaps in the 4.0 region. But the 4.0 ppm in the data is a broad singlet integrating to 2H. That might fit with an N-H, but amines typically have broad peaks around 1-5 ppm.

Wait, but in option D, the structure is Ph-NH2. The NH2 would show up as a broad peak. But in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which might not fit an NH2. NH2 usually shows up as a broad peak, but the integration is 2H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an OCH2 group.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the groups. Let me think.

Another approach: the 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) is likely an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom, such as O. So that would be OCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a propyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2 next to another CH2, like in an ethyl group attached to O.

Wait, but in an ethyl ester, the OCH2CH3 would be a quartet for the OCH2 (if split by the CH3), but usually the OCH2 is a quartet around 4.1 ppm. But in the data, it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Could that be due to coupling with another group, like adjacent to an electronegative group?

The 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be an N-attached CH2, but that's less common. Alternatively, it's an OCH2 that's next to something else, like adjacent to a carbonyl.

Wait, looking at the IR, the strong band at 1720 is a carbonyl. So the compound has a carbonyl group, like ester or amide.

Looking back at the options:

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has an ester (COOEt) and an amine (NH2). So IR would show the ester carbonyl (~1720) and the amine N-H stretches (~3300-3500). The NMR would have the ester's CH3 triplet at 1.2, the OCH2CH3 as a quartet around 4.1, and the NH2 as a broad peak. But in the NMR data, the quartet is at 4.5, so that doesn't match.

Hmm. Maybe option B is correct. Let me think again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure is HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl).

The IR would show the formamide's carbonyl (around 1700-1750) and N-H from the amide (around 3300-3500). The N-H in amides is usually a sharp peak, but in the data, the IR shows broad N-H, which is more typical of amines. So perhaps that's not matching.

The NMR data would have:

- The ethoxy's CH3 as triplet around 1.2 ppm.

- The ethoxy's OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.0-4.5 ppm.

- The aromatic protons as doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm.

But formamide's amide N-H would appear as a broad peak, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but the data shows a peak at 4.0 (bs, 2H). That doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps option A.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure is benzene with OEt and CONH2.

IR would have N-H stretches from the amide (broad around 3300-3500) and the carbonyl at 1720.

In the NMR:

- The ethoxy CH3 as triplet at 1.2.

- The ethoxy OCH2 as quartet around 4.0-4.5.

- The aromatic protons as doublets at 7.0 and 8.0.

But wait, the CONH2 group in benzamide would have an NH2, which in the NMR would show up as a broad peak. But in the data, the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2, but usually NH2 protons are exchanged and appear broader than a singlet, but perhaps in this case, it's a singlet. Alternatively, maybe it's an OCH2.

Wait, but the CONH2 would have two NH protons, which would appear as a broad peak. In the data, the 4.0 ppm is a singlet for 2H, which doesn't match the amide's NH2. So perhaps that's not it.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. Let's think about its NMR.

If it's a propionate ester, the OCH2CH2CH3 would be split into a triplet for the CH3, quartet for the middle CH2, and quintet for the next. But the given data has a triplet at 1.2 (3H), which fits the CH3 of ethyl. So that's conflicting.

Alternatively, if it's a propyl group attached to oxygen, the NMR would show triplet, quartet, quintet. But the given data only has triplet at 1.2 (3H) and quartet at 4.5 (2H). So perhaps it's an ethyl group attached to something else.

Wait, another thought: the quartet at 4.5 (2H) and triplet at 1.2 (3H) suggests an ethyl group, such as OCH2CH3. But where is the quartet in the ethyl group? The OCH2 would be a quartet around 4.1 ppm, and the CH3 would be triplet around 1.2. So that fits. So the 1.20 (t,3H) is the CH3 of ethyl, and 4.5 (q,2H) would be the OCH2. But wait, typically, the OCH2 in ethyl esters is a quartet around 4.0-4.1.

In the given data, the quartet is at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe it's due to coupling with another group. For example, if the OCH2 is adjacent to a carbonyl, the chemical shift could be upfield or downfield.

Wait, another possibility: the quartet at 4.5 could be a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen, such as in a methylene group attached to an amine or another electronegative atom. But I'm not sure.

Looking back at the aromatic region: 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests that the aromatic ring has two substituents para to each other, such as OEt and another group. So the substituents are in para positions, causing the aromatic protons to be in two doublets.

Which options have a para-substituted benzene? All options except maybe C, but I'm not certain.

Wait, option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The substituents are COOEt and NH2 at para positions. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6, each as doublets. So their NMR would show two doublets, which matches the data.

In that case, the OCH2 of the COOEt would appear as a quartet around 4.1, but the data shows it at 4.5. Hmm. Maybe it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from the COOEt's OCH2, but why is it shifted to 4.5? Maybe because of conjugation or substitution.

Another possibility is that the quartet is from a CH2 next to an amide group. For example, if the compound is an amide, the adjacent CH2 could be deshielded, shifting the peak upfield.

Wait, looking back at the IR, the strong band at 1720 cm-1. An amide's carbonyl is typically around 1650-1700 cm-1, while an ester is around 1720-1750. So the 1720 is more consistent with an ester than an amide.

So if the compound is an ester, then options D and B have ester groups. Let's reconsider.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The structure would have COOEt and NH2 on the benzene. The NMR would have:

- 1.20 ppm (t,3H) → CH3 of ethyl ester.

- 4.1 ppm (q,2H) → OCH2 of ethyl ester.

- 4.0 ppm (bs,2H) → NH2.

Wait, but NH2 protons are usually broad and can appear as a singlet, but in the data, it's a broad singlet integrating to 2H. So that could fit.

The aromatic protons would be two doublets at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm, which matches the data.

But the quartet in the data is at 4.5 ppm, not 4.1. Hmm. Could the ethyl ester's OCH2 be at 4.5? Maybe in some cases, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from an acetylation or another group.

Wait, another option: perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to an oxygen and a carbonyl. For example, in an ester group, the OCH2 would be split into a quartet by the adjacent CH3. That's what usually happens, giving a quartet around 4.1.

But in the data, it's at 4.5, which is a bit higher. Maybe the substituent on the benzene is causing some deshielding, shifting it upfield.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a different group. Let me think about option B.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. The structure is formamide (HCONR2) where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the formamide group has a carbonyl and an amide N.

The NMR would show:

- 1.20 (t,3H) → ethoxy's CH3.

- 4.0-4.5 (q,2H) → ethoxy's OCH2.

But the formamide's amide NH would appear as a broad peak. However, the data has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm integrating to 2H, which doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to match the NMR data with each option.

Taking option D again: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

NMR:

1.20 (t, 3H) → ethyl CH3.

4.0 (bs, 2H) → NH2? Or maybe OCH2. But OCH2 in ester is usually around 4.1. If it's NH2, that could fit as a broad singlet.

4.5 (q, 2H) → maybe another CH2 group, but I'm not sure where. Alternatively, maybe it's the OCH2 from the ester, but that would typically be at 4.1.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.5 quartet is from another group, but I don't see what that would be.

The aromatic region fits para substitution.

IR shows strong carbonyl at 1720 (ester), and N-H at 3420 and 3325 (amine). That fits.

So perhaps the discrepancy in the OCH2's chemical shift is acceptable, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach: the 4.5 quartet with 2H and the 4.0 singlet with 2H.

Perhaps the quartet is from the OCH2 of the ester, and the singlet is from something else. Alternatively, the singlet could be an NH2 group.

But in option D, the NH2 would be on the benzene, which is a strong deshielded group. The NH2 protons are typically broad and might not show up as a singlet. They might be a broad multiplet or a broad singlet.

But the data shows a singlet, which would imply no splitting, but NH2 is usually split because of exchange with water or other protons, but in DMSO or other solvents, it might appear as a broad singlet.

So the 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H) could be the NH2.

The 4.5 q (2H) would be the OCH2 of the ester. But why is it at 4.5 instead of 4.1? Maybe the coupling is with another group. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the OCH2 but another CH2.

Wait, perhaps the quartet at 4.5 is from the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl. In an ester, the OCH2 is next to the carbonyl, so its chemical shift could be around 4.5 if there's conjugation.

Alternatively, perhaps the quartet is from a carbamate or another group, but that doesn't fit the options.

Another thought: in the 1H NMR, the quartet at 4.5 (2H) could be a CH2 connected to an oxygen and adjacent to another CH2, which is split into a quartet. So that would fit an ethyl group attached to oxygen.

Putting it all together, the IR data supports an ester and an amine. The NMR's ethyl group fits an ester. The aromatic protons fit a para-substituted benzene.

So the best fit seems to be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. Even though the OCH2's chemical shift is a bit off, perhaps it's due to substituent effects.

But wait, the molecular formula for D would have O3 (COOEt has 3 O?), but the given formula is O2. Hmm.

Wait, COOEt is O-CO-O-C2H5. So that's three O atoms: one from each oxygen in the ester linkages. So the formula would be C9H11NO3, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So that's a problem.

Hmm, that's a contradiction. So option D can't be correct because O is 3, but the formula is O2.

So now I'm really stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, let me check the molecular formula for each option.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: C6H5-OCH2CH3 and C6H5-CONH2.

Wait, no, more accurately, it's C6H4(OCH2CH3)(CONH2). So the formula would be:

C: 6 (benzene) + 2 (OCH2CH3) + 1 (CONH2) → 9.

H: Benzene has 4 H (two substituents). OCH2CH3 → 5 H. CONH2 → 2 H. Total H: 4+5+2=11. O: OCH2CH3 (1 O) + CONH2 (2 O) → 3 O. N: 1.

So formula is C9H11NO3. But given is C9H11NO2. So O is 3 instead of 2. So A is out.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl).

Formula:

PhOCH2CH3: C8H9O.

HCON: H, C, O, N.

So total C:8 +1=9.

H: PhOCH2CH3 has 3 H on benzene (since two substituents?), plus OCH2CH3 →5 H. HCON has 1 H. So total H:3+5+1=9. But given is 11 H. So no.

O: OCH2CH3 (1 O) + HCON (1 O) → 2 O. So formula would be C9H10NO2. But given is C9H11NO2. So H doesn't match.

Hmm.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 and O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, propionate would be -OOC-CH2CH2CH3. So formula:

C6H5NH2 (C7H7N) + OCOCH2CH2CH3 (C3H5O2).

Total C:7 +3=10? No, wait, benzene is C6, NH2 adds nothing, OCOCH2CH2CH3 is C3. So total C:6+3=9.

H: benzene has 4 H. NH2 has 2 H. OCOCH2CH2CH3 has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3). So 4+2+7=13 H. But given is 11. So no.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Formula:

PhNH2COOEt: that's C6H5NH2COO-C2H5.

So C:6 (Ph) + 2 (NH2) → but wait, the formula is:

Ph (C6) + COOEt (C3) → C9.

H: Ph (4) + NH2 (2) + COOEt (5) → 4+2+5=11. O: COOEt has 3 O (COO and OEt). So O3. But given is O2. So again, discrepancy.

Hmm, none of the options seem to fit perfectly, but I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the molecular formula for option B. Let me recheck.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl).

So the formula is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C8H9O) + HCON (C1H1NO).

Wait, HCON is H, C, O, N.

So total C:8 +1=9.

H: Ph-OCH2CH3 has 9 H (Ph has 3, OCH2CH3 has 5, plus H from HCON: 1 → total 3+5+1=9). But given is 11 H. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Since all options have O issues except maybe option C, which I think I miscalculated.

Wait, option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

If the propionate is an amide, then the structure would be benzene with NH2 and CONHCH2CH2CH3. But that's not the option. The option is propionate, which is ester.

Wait, perhaps the propionate is a primary amide? No, the option says propionate, which is ester.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is PhNH2-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. That would be 4-aminophenyl propionate as an ester.

So the formula would be:

Ph (C6) + NH2 (no C) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (C3).

So C6 + C3=9.

H: Ph (4 H) + NH2 (2 H) + COOCH2CH2CH3 (7 H) →4+2+7=13. Not matching.

But the given formula is 11 H. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the propionate is a secondary amide. But the option says propionate, not amide.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct option is D, despite the O discrepancy, because the NMR and IR fit so well. But that would mean the O is 3, but the formula is O2. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the molecular formula. Let me double-check.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The formula is C6H5COOEt.

C6 (Ph) + COOEt (C3) → C9.

H: Ph has 4 H (since two substituents: COOEt and NH2). COOEt has 5 H (OCH2CH3). NH2 has 2 H. So 4+5+2=11. O: COOEt has 3 O (COO and OEt). So O3. But the given formula is O2. So this is a problem.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the substituents.

Wait, another angle: the IR shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which is an ester carbonyl. So the compound has an ester group. That would point to options D and B.

The NMR shows a triplet at 1.20 (3H), which is likely an ethyl group.

The quartet at 4.5 (2H) could be the OCH2 of the ethyl ester, but why is it at 4.5?

Another possibility: perhaps the quartet is from a CH2 adjacent to an electronegative group, such as in an amide. But formamide's OCH2 would be at a higher shift.

Wait, looking at option B again: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

The structure is HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl). The ester-like OCH2 would be from the ethoxy group on the benzene.

The OCH2 in the ethoxy would be a quartet around 4.0-4.1 ppm, split by the adjacent CH3.

In the given data, the quartet is at 4.5. Hmm, that's a bit high but possible.

The HCON group (formamide) would have a carbonyl at 1720 cm-1, which matches.

The NH in formamide would show up as a broad peak, perhaps around 8 ppm, but the given data has a peak at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 (bs, 2H) is the ethoxy's OCH2, which is split by the ethyl group.

So:

1.20 (t,3H) → ethoxy's CH3.

4.0 (bs,2H) → ethoxy's OCH2.

4.5 (q,2H) → ??? Not sure. Maybe another group.

But I don't see another group in option B. Unless the formamide's CH2 is involved, but formamide is HCONR2, which doesn't have a CH2 group.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct answer is D, despite the O count, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another possibility: the molecular formula for D is C9H11NO3. But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So D can't be correct.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in considering the substituents.

Looking back, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but the O count was wrong.

Wait, option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. The formula would be C9H11NO3, which doesn't match. So no.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. Let me try to think of the NMR data again.

The 4.5 ppm quartet (2H) and 1.20 ppm triplet (3H) indicates an ethyl group. So the compound must have an ethyl group attached to something.

The 4.0 ppm broad singlet (2H) could be an NH2 group. So the compound must have an amine or amide.

The aromatic protons are in two doublets, suggesting para substitution.

The IR has a strong carbonyl at 1720, which points to an ester or amide.

So, thinking again, the only option that has an ester group and an NH2 group is option D, but the O count doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula for option D is correct. Let me recheck.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 and COOEt.

Formula: C6H5COOEt → C6H5COO-C2H5.

C:6 (Ph) +2 (COO) +2 (Et) →6+2+2=10? No, wait, COO is part of the same group.

Wait, the formula is C6 (Ph) + COOEt (which is C3: COO has 2 C, Et has 1 C?), no, COOEt is C3 (COO has 2 C, Et has 1 C). So C6 + C3 =9 C.

H: Ph (5 H without substituents, but with two substituents, it's 4 H) + COOEt (5 H) + NH2 (2 H) →4+5+2=11 H.

O: COOEt has 3 O (COO and OEt). So O3. But given is O2. So no.

This is perplexing.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, and I'm miscalculating the formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl).

So the formula is:

Ph-OCH2CH3 (C8H9O) + HCON (C1H1NO).

Total C:8+1=9.

H: Ph-OCH2CH3 has 3 H (Ph) +5 H (OCH2CH3) →8 H. HCON has 1 H. So 8+1=9 H. But given is 11 H. So no.

Wait, perhaps the Ph-OCH2CH3 has more H. Benzene with two substituents (OCH2CH3 and HCONR2) would have 4 H. OCH2CH3 has 5 H. HCON has 1 H. So 4 +5 +1=10. Still not 11.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: benzene with NH2 and O-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

Formula: C6 (Ph) + NH2 (no C) + O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (C3).

So C6 +3=9. Correct.

H: Ph (4 H) + NH2 (2 H) + O-CO-CH2CH2CH3 (7 H) →4+2+7=13 H. Not matching.

Wait, but if the propionate is an ester, then the structure would be O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 attached to benzene. So the formula would be C6 +3=9 C.

H: Ph (4) + NH2 (2) + O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3 (5 H from OCH2CH2CH3) →4+2+5=11. That matches.

O: O from O-CO-O- is 3 O. But given is O2. So that's a problem.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I think I'll have to go with the best fit based on spectroscopic data, even if the formula doesn't match. But that's not ideal.

Based on the NMR data, the ethyl group, aromatic protons, and the IR, the best fit seems to be option D, even though the O count is off. But I must have made a mistake because the formula doesn't align.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the O count for option D. Let me recheck.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The formula is C6H5COOEt → C6H5COO-C2H5.

Breaking it down:

COOEt is O=C-O-CH2CH3.

So O in COO: 2 O.

O in OCH2CH3: 1 O.

Total O: 3.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So O is 2. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B. Let me reevaluate.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCON-(4-ethoxyphenyl).

Formula: C9H10NO2.

Wait, the given formula is C9H11NO2. So H count is off by 1.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not seeing it.

After much consideration, I think the correct answer is option D, but I'm not certain because of the O count. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the structure.

Wait, another angle: the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. That's 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking for a structure with 2 O.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

O in formamide: 1 (from CON).

O in ethoxy:1.

So total O:2. That matches.

H: Let me recompute.

Ph-OCH2CH3: benzene with two substituents (OCH2CH3 and HCONR2). So benzene has 4 H.

OCH2CH3:5 H.

HCON:1 H.

So total H:4 +5 +1=10. But given is 11. So discrepancy.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't a formamide but another group.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is D, but I have to accept that the O count doesn't match, which can't be.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

The IR shows N-H (3420 and 3325), which suggests either amine or amide.

The NMR shows a quartet at 4.5 (2H) and triplet at 1.2 (3H), which suggests an ethyl group.

The aromatic protons are para-substituted.

The carbonyl is at 1720, indicating ester or amide.

So, the structure likely has an ester group and an amino group.

Looking at option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. It has both. But O count is 3, which is off.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option B, but I'm not seeing it.

In the end, I think the correct answer is option D, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I can't reconcile the H count.


The question involves identifying the compound C9H11NO2 based on IR and NMR data. The molecular formula suggests a degree of unsaturation (DoU) of 3, which could correspond to a benzene ring (4 DoU) with substituents or another structure. The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 cm⁻¹ and 3325 cm⁻¹, likely from N-H stretches, and a strong band at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicating a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. The NMR data includes a triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H), a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H), a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H), and aromatic protons as doublets at 7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm, suggesting a para-substituted benzene.

### Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**
- **Structure**: Benzene ring with an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) and an amide group (-CONH2).
- **Molecular Formula**: C9H11NO3.
- **Discrepancy**: The given formula is C9H11NO2, but this option has 3 oxygen atoms instead of 2. Additionally, the NMR data does not fully align with this structure, as the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm does not fit the expected NH2 protons.

#### **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**
- **Structure**: Benzene ring with an ethoxy group (-OCH2CH3) at the para position and a formamide group (-HCON-).
- **Molecular Formula**: C9H10NO2.
- **Discrepancy**: The given formula has 11 hydrogens, but this option has only 10 hydrogens. The NMR data also does not fully match, as the quartet at 4.5 ppm cannot be easily attributed to this structure.

#### **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**
- **Structure**: Benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) at the para position and a propionate ester (-COOCH2CH2CH3).
- **Molecular Formula**: C10H13NO3.
- **Discrepancy**: The given formula is C9H11NO2, but this option has 10 carbons and 3 oxygen atoms instead of 2. The NMR data does not align with this structure either.

#### **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**
- **Structure**: Benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) at the para position and an ethyl ester (-COOCH2CH3).
- **Molecular Formula**: C9H11NO3.
- **Discrepancy**: The given formula is C9H11NO2, but this option has 3 oxygen atoms instead of 2. However, the NMR data fits well: the triplet at 1.20 ppm corresponds to the CH3 of the ethyl group, the quartet at 4.5 ppm corresponds to the OCH2 of the ester, and the aromatic protons match a para-substituted benzene. The IR data also aligns with the presence of an ester carbonyl and N-H stretches.

### Conclusion:
While option D fits the NMR and IR data well, the molecular formula discrepancy (O3 instead of O2) is a significant issue. Despite this, option D is the best match for the spectroscopic data provided.

**Answer: D**
