Okay, so I have this problem about vector fields and calculating the divergence. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my vector calculus, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that there's a vector field f(r) which falls off radially as 1/r². So, the magnitude is 1/r², and it's only along the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of this field within a sphere of radius R.

Wait, so the vector field is purely radial. That probably simplifies things because there are no components in the angular directions (theta or phi) in spherical coordinates. So, the vector field f(r) can be written as f_r(r) * r_hat, where f_r is 1/r².

Divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field with only a radial component is given by the formula: (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² f_r). So let me write that down.

f_r = 1/r². So substituting into the divergence formula:

div f = (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² * (1/r²)).

Wait, r² multiplied by 1/r² is just 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So div f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0.

Oh, wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, then integrating over the volume would give zero. But wait, the function might have a singularity at r=0. Like the electric field of a point charge has a divergence proportional to rho, but that's another issue.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Let me double-check the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Oh right, the divergence for vector field A is (1/(r²)) [d/dr (r² A_r) + ... ] for the other components. Since A_theta and A_phi are zero here, the divergence only has the first term.

So A_r = 1/r². So the term inside is d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) = d/dr (1) = 0.

Wait, so the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0. But if I integrate the divergence over the volume, it would be zero, right? But wait, that doesn't account for the singularity at the origin. Because if the vector field behaves like 1/r², that's similar to something with a delta function at the origin, perhaps.

Wait, but actually, if the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, but the function itself is not defined at the origin, I might have to consider the Dirac delta function. Because in electromagnetism, for example, the electric field of a point charge has a divergence proportional to the charge density, which is a delta function. So maybe the divergence is a delta function here.

Wait, let me think. The divergence of a vector field that's radial and 1/r²... Let me think about what fields have known divergence properties. For example, the electric field of a point charge is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q r_hat)/r². The divergence of E is (1/(ε₀)) ρ, where ρ is the charge density, which is a delta function.

So if that's the case here, then the divergence of f is a delta function scaled by some constant.

But in this problem, the field f has magnitude 1/r². So comparing to the electric field, which is proportional to 1/r² and has a divergence proportional to a delta function. So for this field, maybe the divergence is 4π times a delta function at the origin. Because I remember that the divergence of E is (ρ)/(ε₀), and for a point charge, ρ is a delta function and E's divergence is (1/(ε₀)) δ³(r). But wait, maybe in Gaussian units or another system, the constants change.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the volume integral of the divergence of f over the sphere of radius R. So if the divergence is a delta function, then the integral would be the value of the delta function scaled by any constants, multiplied by the volume integral. But the delta function is zero outside
