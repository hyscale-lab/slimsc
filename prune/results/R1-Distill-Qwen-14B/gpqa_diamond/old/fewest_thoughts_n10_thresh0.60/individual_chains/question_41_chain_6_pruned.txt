Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says: A light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory? The speed of light in a vacuum is given as c=1.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with relative motion of objects and light, there's some relativity involved, but I'm not sure if this is a case for special relativity or just using the Galilean transformations. Wait, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So the glass is moving towards the observer, but the light is moving in the same direction as the glass, which probably means the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, the light is propagating through the glass. So normally, in a stationary glass, the speed of light would be c/n because the index of refraction n = c/v, where v is the speed of light in the medium. So v in the medium is c/n. But since the glass itself is moving, how does that affect the observed speed of the light?

I think this involves considering the frame of reference. The observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving. So the speed of the light relative to the lab would be the speed of
