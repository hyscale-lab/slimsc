Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out which compound corresponds to the given spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll just walk through my thoughts.

The compound is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. The formula is CnHmOxNp. The degree of unsaturation is (2n +2 - m -x + p)/2. Wait, no, the formula is (2n +2 - m)/2 for organic compounds without considering O and N. But since O and N can affect it, maybe I should think differently. Alternatively, each double bond or ring counts as one, each triple bond as two, etc. Each nitro group or amide group might add to this.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it. Let me compute:

n = 9, m=11, O=2, N=1.

The formula to calculate degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, I think the actual formula is Degree of Unsaturation = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. But since there's no X (halogens) here, it'll be (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11 +1)/2 = 10/2=5. So degree of unsaturation is 5. That could mean a
