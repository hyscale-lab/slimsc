Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution. Hmm, the question is about radiation patterns and the power radiated at a certain angle. Let's try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the charge distribution is spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. It's oscillating, so it must be radiating electromagnetic waves. The problem states that the maximum power radiated is A, and we're looking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at a specific angle theta (30 degrees) and the possible form of the function f, which is the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function of lambda and theta.

Wait, so the function f is the power per unit solid angle. So the total power A would be the integral of f over all solid angles, right? Because solid angle is 4pi steradians in total, so the maximum power A is the maximum value of f multiplied by 4pi, or maybe it's the integral of f over all angles.

Wait, no, maximum power is when the function reaches its peak. So maybe the function f depends on theta, and the maximum occurs when the angle is such that the radiation is most intense. For an oscillating charge, I remember the radiation pattern for a dipole. The radiation from a dipole is maximum at the equator, i.e., theta = 90 degrees. So the intensity is proportional to (sin(theta))^2 or something like that.

Wait, but wait, in this case, the problem says the charge distribution is spheroidal and oscillating,
