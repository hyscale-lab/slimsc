Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction.

Let me read the question again: It's about 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are usually involved in some kind of elimination or addition reaction. Wait, no, maybe in deoxygenation or something else. Oh right! I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the Wolff-Kishner reaction or maybe in the dehydrohalogenation, but wait, that's more with strong bases. Alternatively, HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Oh, wait, maybe it's about the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's for ketones. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the Clemmensen reduction or something else.

Wait, no, I think red phosphorus and HI is used in the dehydrohalogenation or perhaps in the hydrolysis of some functional groups. Alternatively, maybe it's about the removal of carbonyl groups. Oh right! I think when a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reduction. Wait, no, maybe it's the Arndt-Eistert reaction, but that's for extending carbon chains. Alternatively, I remember that when aldehydes or ketones react with red phosphorus and HI, it's a specific type of reaction.

Wait, I think it's the Clemmensen reduction. No, the Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl and Hg. Oh wait, no, the Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes. Red phosphorus and HI—I think that's the method to reduce aldehydes and ketones to alkanes. Alternatively, wait, maybe it's the preparation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's a deoxygenation reaction.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the structure is a cyclohexene ring, with substituents. Let me try to draw it mentally.

The cyclohexene ring is numbered such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene). Then, at position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH-). So the substituents are at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH₂CH₂?), wait no, wait: 5-vinyl would be a CH₂CH₂ group attached to the ring? No, wait, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH–. So at position 5, it's a CH₂=CH– group attached.

So the structure is cyclohexene (double bond at 3-ene), with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl). Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I think this setup is for a dehydrohalogenation or perhaps a reduction.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a situation where the carbonyl groups (like the aldehyde) undergo some reaction. Alternatively, considering the HI is in excess, perhaps it's a situation where the aldehyde is reduced.

Wait, I think the reaction of aldehydes and ketones with red phosphorus and HI is the deoxygenation reaction, converting the carbonyl group into a methylene group. Wait, like in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that typically uses hydrazine and heat. Alternatively, the Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg) and HCl. Oh wait, wait! I think the reaction of ketones with red phosphorus in HI is the formation of alkanes. Let me think. When a ketone is treated with red phosphorus and HI, the oxygen is replaced by a hydrogen. So for example, R2C=O + P, HI → R2CH + PHO.

Wait, no, maybe more accurately, the carbonyl group (RCHO) is converted to RCH2 group. So, the aldehyde group (CHO) becomes CH2. So the formyl group (CHO) at position 2 would become CH2.

But wait, what about the other substituents? The 5-vinyl group is already an alkene, so that might not change. The cyclohexene ring itself has a double bond—so perhaps it's involved in some reaction.

Wait, but if the aldehyde group is being reduced to CH2, that would change the structure. So the original compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. After reacting with red phosphorus and HI, the formyl group becomes CH2, so the substituent at position 2 becomes CH2.

Wait, but the reaction conditions also involve HI, which is a strong acid. Could that cause any ring-opening or other reactions? Alternatively, maybe the double bonds in the ring and the vinyl group are affected.

Wait, the starting material has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring (3,4 double bond) and another in the vinyl substituent (the 5-position, which is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring). So that's two double bonds already.

But when treated with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Let me think about the specific reaction. I've read that when a carbonyl is treated with H-I and red phosphorus, it undergoes a reduction. For aldehydes, this would reduce the carbonyl to a methylene group. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Wait, another possibility is that the carbonyl group is converted into an alcohol, but in the presence of HI and P, maybe it's a different pathway.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation. No, that's not it. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydrohalogenation or elimination.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product structure. So the starting material is a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which I think is a deoxygenation reaction. So the formyl group (CHO) is at position 2. When the CHO is converted to CH2, that's a reduction. So the product would have a CH2 group at position 2, a vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) at position 5, and the ring still has a double bond.

Wait, but wait. The starting material is a cyclohex-3-ene, so the ring has one double bond. The 5-vinyl is another double bond (CH₂=CH–). So the starting molecule has two double bonds. So the degree of unsaturation (index of hydrogen deficiency) for the starting material is 2 from the ring double bond plus 1 from the vinyl group, plus 1 from the carbonyl (CHO) group. Wait, let me calculate the index of hydrogen deficiency.

The formula for the starting compound: molecular formula? Let's see. Cyclohexene is C6H10. Then, substituents: at position 2, a formyl (CHO) adds one C and O, and at position 5, a vinyl (CH₂=CH–) adds two C and one H (since it's attached as a substituent). Also, the carboxylic acid group is at position ... wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid is at position 6? Because numbering would go in a way that the substituents get the lowest numbers. So maybe position 1 is the COOH, but no, the numbering is such that the substituents are at 2 and 5.

Wait, the base structure is cyclohexene with substituents. The main chain is cyclohexene, and the substituents are at positions 2 and 5, and the carboxylic acid is at position 3? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the main chain isn't the cyclohexene, but the substituents are attached to it.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is C8H8O3? Let me calculate:

Base cyclohexene: C6H10.

But with substituents:

- At position 2: formyl (CHO) → adds 1 C, 1 O, and 1 O.

Wait, the formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down: the cyclohexene is C6H8 (because cyclohexene has 6 carbons and 8 hydrogen—since each double bond reduces two hydrogens from cyclohexane, which is C6H12 → 12-2=10? Wait, no. Wait, cyclohexane is C6H12. Each double bond reduces two H. So cyclohexene is C6H10. So if the ring has one double bond, that's 6 carbons and 10 hydrogens.

Then, substituents:

At position 2: formyl (CHO) → adds 0 carbons (since part of the ring) but adds one oxygen. So the CHO substituent is a carbonyl group.

At position 5: vinyl substituent (CH₂=CH–). Vinyl has two carbons, so that's adding two more carbons and one double bond.

And the carboxylic acid group is at the end, perhaps at position 1. Wait, the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the ring has a double bond (at 3), and the carboxylic acid is at position 1 (since the suffix is -carboxylic acid, so the numbering starts with that). So the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl). So the formula would be:

C6 (ring) + CHO is 1 C (but already in the ring?), no. Wait, the formyl is a substituent on the ring. So each substituent adds to the count.

Wait, the ring is C6. The substituents:

- At position 2: a formyl group (CHO) → adds 1 O and 1 C (since it's a substituent on the ring, so it's CH₂–CHO? No, wait, the structure would be cyclohexene with a CHO group at C2 and a vinyl at C5, plus the COOH at C1 (since it's cyclohexene carboxylic acid → the COOH is at position 1).

Wait, perhaps the formula is C9H8O3.

Wait, let's compute:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Add two substituents: formyl (CHO) and vinyl (CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH–, so it's CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. So each substituent adds their own carbons.

Wait, the substituents are: at C2, a formyl (CHO) group. So that's adding 1 carbon (the C from CHO). At C5, a vinyl group (CH₂=CH–), which adds 2 carbons. The COOH group is at position 1, which is another O and H.

So the total carbons are 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) + 0 (COOH is O and H, no additional C) → 9 C.

Hydrogen: cyclohexene has 8 H (since C6H10? No, wait, cyclohexene is C6H10, but substituents may take away H. Each substituent replaces a H on the ring.

So for the substituents:

- Each substituent (CHO, vinyl, COOH) replaces a H on the ring.

The ring initially has 10 H (cyclohexene is C6H10). Each substituent replaces one H, so 3 substituents: COOH at C1, CHO at C2, vinyl at C5. So 3 H replaced.

So the ring now has 10 -3 =7 H.

The substituents contribute their own H:

- CHO has O and no H (since it's CHO).

Wait, no, the formyl group is CHO attached to the ring. So the structure is cyclohexene with a CHO at C2. So the ring's C2 is connected to a CHO, which has no additional H.

The vinyl group at C5 is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. So that's a substituent with 3 H (the CH₂ and the CH in the vinyl group: CH₂=CH–, which has two H on the CH₂ and one H on the CH, making three H in total for that substituent).

The COOH group is at C1: it's COOH, which is -COOH. So that group contributes two O's and two H's (the COOH group has two O's and two H's: one from the COOH and another from the -OH).

Putting it all together:

Carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (CHO) + 2 (vinyl) =9 C.

Hydrogens: 7 (ring) + 3 (vinyl) + 2 (COOH) + any others?

Wait, maybe I need a better approach. Let's find the molecular formula.

The structure is cyclohex-3-ene with substituents at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (CH₂=CH–), and 1 (COOH). So the formula would be:

Each substituent:

- COOH: adds O2, H.

- CHO: adds O, no additional H beyond the ring.

- CH₂=CH–: adds 2 C, 3 H, and a double bond.

So the overall formula:

C: 6 (ring) +1 (CHO) +2 (vinyl) +0 (COOH) =9 C.

H: let's count:

Ring as cyclohexene: C6H10 (but with substituents, which remove H's).

Number of H's on the ring: 6 (if each substituent is at a position, each substituent replaces a H).

Wait, but the ring is cyclohexene (so 6 carbons, one double bond, which reduces H by 2 → C6H10). Then, each substituent (CHO, vinyl, COOH) is attached, each substituent replacing a H.

So, initial ring H: 10.

Each substituent removes one H, so 3 substituents: 10 -3 =7 H on the ring.

The substituents:

CHO: no additional H (since it's O).

Vinyl: CH₂=CH–, which has 3 H (the two on CH₂ and one on CH).

COOH: -COOH has an -OH group, which has one H.

So total H:7 (ring) + 3 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 11 H.

Oxygens: CHO has one O, COOH has two O, and the ring doesn't add any. So 1 + 2 =3 O.

So the molecular formula is C9H11O3.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The COOH group is -COOH, which has two O's. The CHO has one O. So 3 O in total.

Now, the index of hydrogen deficiency for the starting material is calculated as:

Index = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Assuming no halogens or nitrogen here, so X=0, N=0.

So for the starting material:

C=9, H=11, O=3.

So Index = (2*9 +2 -11)/2 = (20 -11)/2=9/2=4.5 → but that can't be right. Wait, I must have made a mistake in the H count. Wait, maybe I should recount.

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the degree of unsaturation using the formula:

Degree of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

But wait, I think the formula is:

Each degree of unsaturation (DoU) is equivalent to a ring or a double bond.

The formula is:

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2

Where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, N nitrogens.

In this case, X=0, N=0.

So for the starting material, C=9, H=11, O=3.

So DoU = (2*9 + 2 -11)/2 = (20 -11)/2 = 9/2 =4.5 → which is impossible, so I must have made a mistake in determining H.

Wait, perhaps the correct H count is different. Let's think again.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The structure:

- A cyclohexene ring (C6H10), but with substituents.

The substituents are:

1. COOH at position 1 → replaces a H on the ring.

2. CHO at position 2 → replaces another H.

3. CH₂=CH– at position 5 → replaces another H.

So the ring now has 10 -3 =7 H.

The substituents contribute H as follows:

COOH: -COOH has two O and two H? No, wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which has one H from the -OH group. But in the substituent, the H is part of the group.

So:

CHO substituent: The formyl group is –CHO. It has no additional H beyond the ring.

Vinyl substituent: CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. The substituent has two CH2 groups? No, it's CH₂–CH₂? Wait, no, the vinyl group is CH₂=CH–. So that's a double bond and the substituent is CH₂=CH–, attached to the ring. So the substituent has 3 H: the two on the CH₂ and one on the CH.

COOH substituent: -COOH has an -OH, which contributes one H.

So the H from substituents: 3 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) =4.

Plus the ring's 7 H, total H is 11.

So the molecular formula is C9H11O3.

So DoU = (2*9 +2 -11)/2 = (20-11)/2 = 9/2 =4.5 → which is impossible, so perhaps I made a mistake in the substituent H count.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group doesn't contribute an H. Let me think: the COOH is -COOH, so it's -O-OH. So the H is part of the substituent. So perhaps the H count is 7 (ring) + 3 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = 11 H.

Wait, but perhaps the substituents add more H.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me think about the structure.

The structure is a cyclohexene ring (C6H8?), wait, no. Wait, when a cyclohexane has a double bond, it becomes cyclohexene, which is C6H10. So the base ring is C6H10.

Then each substituent replaces a H.

So:

COOH at position 1: replaces a H → ring H becomes 9.

CHO at position 2: replaces another H → ring H becomes 8.

Vinyl (CH₂=CH–) at position 5: replaces another H → ring H becomes 7.

So ring H=7.

Substituents:

COOH: -COOH → contributes two O and one H (-OH).

CHO: -CHO → no additional H.

Vinyl: -CH₂CH₂ (no, wait, it's -CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond in between? No, it's -CH₂=CH–. So this substituent is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. Wait, that's a vinyl group, which is CH₂=CH–. So the substituent is CH₂=CH–, which has two carbons and three H (the two on CH₂ and one on CH).

Wait, the substituent is attached to the ring as CH₂=CH–. So the substituent contributes 3 H (the two from CH₂ and one from CH).

So substituents contribute:

COOH: 1 H.

Vinyl: 3 H.

Total substituent H: 4.

So total H: 7 (ring) +4 (substituents) =11.

So molecular formula is C9H11O3.

Then, DoU = (2*9 +2 -11)/2 = (20-11)/2=4.5 → which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's H count is different. Let me recount the substituent H.

The vinyl substituent is CH₂=CH– attached to the ring. The structure would be:

Ring-C-CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, it's CH₂=CH– attached to the ring, so the substituent is CH₂=CH–, which has two CH groups: CH₂ (with two H) and CH (with one H). So total substituent H is 3.

COOH substituent: -COOH has an -OH, which has one H.

So substituent H:3 +1=4.

Ring H:7.

Total H:11.

So formula C9H11O3.

Wait, but DoU can't be 4.5. So perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe I'm not counting the H correctly.

Wait, perhaps the substituents add more H. Let me think of each substituent.

Formyl (CHO) substituent: The ring carbon (C2) is attached to a CHO group. So the structure is:

Ring-C(CHO)-...

So the CHO has no H attached to it beyond the ring. So substituent H from CHO is zero.

Vinyl group (CH₂=CH–): attached to the ring at C5. So this substituent has three H: two on CH₂ and one on CH.

COOH substituent: -COOH has one H in the -OH group.

So substituent H:3 (vinyl) +1 (COOH) =4.

Ring H:7.

Total H=11.

So formula C9H11O3.

DoU is (2*9 +2 -11)/2 = (20-11)/2=4.5 → which is impossible. So I must have made a mistake in the substituent H or C count.

Alternative approach: perhaps the starting material has a different structure. Let me try to think of the correct molecular formula.

Another way: the starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

So the carboxylic acid is at position 1, formyl at 2, vinyl at 5.

The cyclohexene ring has a double bond at positions 3 and 4.

So the substituents at positions 2 and 5, and the COOH at position 1.

The formula would be C9H10O3.

Wait, because the cyclohexene is C6H10, adding substituents as follows:

Each substituent (COOH, CHO, vinyl) adds certain H.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is different. Let me think of the degrees of unsaturation.

The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (one double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a carbonyl group (CHO) (third double bond). So the DoU would be 3 from double bonds plus any rings.

Wait, the ring itself is a cyclohexene, which is a six-membered ring with one double bond, so that's one ring (equivalent to one DoU) and one double bond, so that's two DoU. Then, the vinyl group adds another DoU (the double bond in the substituent), and the carbonyl group (CHO) adds another DoU. So total DoU is 1 (ring) +1 (cyclohexene double bond) +1 (vinyl) +1 (CHO) =4.

Wait, no. Wait, the ring itself as a cyclohexene: a six-membered ring with one double bond. Each ring is one DoU, and each double bond is another. So for cyclohexene, it's one ring (DoU 1) and one double bond (DoU 1), making 2.

Then, the vinyl substituent has a double bond (DoU 1) and the CHO has a double bond (DoU 1). So total DoU would be 2 (from the ring) +1 (vinyl) +1 (CHO) =4.

So original starting material has DoU 4.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. What does this do to the molecule?

I think that the reaction is the deoxygenation of the carbonyl group. So the formyl (CHO) group is converted into a CH₂ group.

So the product would have a CH₂ group at position 2 instead of CHO.

So the product's structure would be 2-methyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Wait, is that right? Or does the COOH group change?

No, the reaction is specifically targeting the CHO group. So COOH remains as is.

So the product has:

- A cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CH₂), 5 (CH₂=CH–), and 1 (COOH).

Wait, but the original ring's double bond (cyclohexene) is still present. So the product has:

- The cyclohexene ring (one DoU from the ring, one from the double bond)

- The vinyl substituent (another DoU)

Plus, after the reaction, the formyl group is now CH₂, which is a single bond, so no DoU from that.

Wait, no: the original formyl group was a carbonyl (DoU 1). After converting to CH₂, that DoU is lost. So the product would have:

DoU = (ring: 1) + (cyclohexene double bond:1) + (vinyl substituent:1) → total DoU 3.

Wait, but wait: the ring's double bond is part of the cyclohexene structure, so it's one DoU. Then, the substituents: the vinyl substituent adds another DoU (its double bond), and the ring's double bond is also part of the ring's DoU.

Wait, perhaps I should recount.

The product has:

1. A cyclohexene ring (which has a double bond and a ring → 2 DoU)

2. A vinyl substituent (another double bond → 1 DoU)

3. The COOH group (no DoU, as it's a single bond)

4. The CH₂ group at position 2 (no DoU)

So DoU is 2 (from ring) +1 (vinyl) =3.

So the product's index of hydrogen deficiency is 3.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.


The problem involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI. 

### Step 1: Analyze the starting material
The starting compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Its structure includes:
- A cyclohexene ring (C₆H₁₀) with a double bond at positions 3 and 4.
- A formyl group (CHO) at position 2.
- A vinyl group (CH₂=CH–) at position 5.
- A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 1.

The molecular formula is **C₉H₁₁O₃**. To calculate the DoU:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2C + 2 - H - X + N}{2}
\]
Here, \(C = 9\), \(H = 11\), \(X = 0\), and \(N = 0\). Substituting:
\[
\text{DoU} = \frac{2(9) + 2 - 11}{2} = \frac{20 - 11}{2} = 4.5
\]
This is inconsistent, so the structure must be re-evaluated. The starting material has:
- 1 ring (1 DoU).
- 1 double bond in the cyclohexene ring (1 DoU).
- 1 double bond in the vinyl group (1 DoU).
- 1 double bond in the formyl group (1 DoU).
Thus, the total DoU is **4**.

### Step 2: Reaction with red phosphorus and HI
The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is a deoxygenation reaction. Specifically, the formyl group (CHO) at position 2 is reduced to a methylene group (CH₂). The product is **2-methyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid**.

### Step 3: Analyze the product
The product has:
- A cyclohexene ring (1 ring and 1 double bond, contributing 2 DoU).
- A vinyl group (1 double bond, contributing 1 DoU).
- A CH₂ group at position 2 (no DoU).
- A COOH group at position 1 (no DoU).

Thus, the total DoU of the product is:
\[
\text{DoU} = 2 \, (\text{ring and double bond}) + 1 \, (\text{vinyl group}) = 3
\]

### Step 4: Evaluate the options
The options are:
- **A) 1**: Incorrect, as the product retains multiple double bonds and the cyclohexene ring.
- **B) 3**: Correct, as calculated above.
- **C) 5**: Incorrect, as the product loses the double bond from the formyl group.
- **D) 0**: Incorrect, as the product still contains unsaturated bonds.

### Final Answer:
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **3**.

**Answer: B**
