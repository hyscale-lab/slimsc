Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part.

Alright, the question is about identifying a compound using FTIR and 1H NMR data. The options are four different structures, all of which have a COOH group at the end. I remember that in IR spectroscopy, certain functional groups have characteristic absorption peaks. The FTIR here shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm⁻¹ and a strong peak at 1700 cm⁻¹. 

So, the broad peak at 3000 probably indicates an -OH group, because O-H stretches in carboxylic acids are usually broad and around there. And the strong peak at 1700 is likely the carbonyl (C=O) stretch of the carboxylic acid. That makes sense because carboxylic acids have both of these features. So the compound is definitely a carboxylic acid, which matches all the options given since they all end with COOH.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that there are several peaks, none corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. So no double bonds with adjacent hydrogens. That rules out any structures with, say, an alkene. All the options seem to be alkanes with branching, so that's fine.

Now, the key part: the NMR signals. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets, and another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complicated. I need to think about splitting and what kind of structures would cause such complex splitting patterns.

Let me think about splitting in NMR. Each neighboring set of equivalent protons splits the signal into a number of peaks equal to n+1, where n is the number of neighboring H's. So doublet means one neighboring group, triplet two, quartet four, etc. But when you have multiple neighboring groups, the splitting becomes more complex, leading to multiplets like doublet of doublets, etc.

So for a doublet of triplets of quartets: that's a signal that's split by three different sets of neighboring H's. Let me think: the first split (doublet) comes from one set, then each subsequent split adds more. So maybe the proton is next to groups with 1, 2, and 3 H's? Or perhaps more accurately, the proton has three different neighboring groups with varying numbers of Hs.

Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex environment, like being adjacent to two different sets, each of which is split by another set. Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.

Looking at the structures:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, let's imagine the structure. The central part is a CH connected to two ethyl groups (C2H5). Wait, no, actually, each CH is connected to two ethyl groups and a CH2COOH. So the structure is something like:
CH2CH2C(C2H5)(CH2CH2CH2COOH) ?

Wait, perhaps I should draw each structure mentally. Alternatively, perhaps the main chain is a pentyl group or similar, but with branching.

Wait, perhaps each of the options is a substituted pentanoic acid or similar. Let me look at each:

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH
So, breaking it down: The main chain is a four-carbon chain ending with COOH. Wait, perhaps it's:

The central part is a carbon (let me number them) connected as follows:

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2
