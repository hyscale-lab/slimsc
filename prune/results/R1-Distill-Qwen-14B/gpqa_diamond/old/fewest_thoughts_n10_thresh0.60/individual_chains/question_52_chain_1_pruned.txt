Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Let's break down what's given.

First, the star's parameters: radius is 1.5 solar radii, mass is 1.1 solar masses. But when the star doesn't have spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. When 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. So the spots are making the star cooler overall.

Now, the key part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels. The ratio observed decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—specifically, the ratio when no spots are present compared to when spots are present.

I remember that in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the distribution of atoms in different energy levels is described by the Boltzmann equation. The equation is something like (n_i)/(n_j) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ), where n is the number density, g is the statistical weight (like the degeneracy), and E is the energy of each level.

In this problem, the ratio is n1/n2, and it decreases when spots are present. So when the star has spots, the ratio is lower than when it doesn't. We're looking for the factor, so maybe it's (n1/n2)_unspotted divided by (n1/n2)_spotted.

Wait, or wait—no, the ratio decreases, so let me think. When spots are present, the Teff is lower. Since the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2)*exp(-(E1-E2)/(kT)), if T decreases, then the exponential term becomes larger because the denominator is smaller. So if E1 is higher than E2, then (E1-E2) is positive, and the exponent becomes less negative as T decreases, so the exponential increases. So n1/n2 increases if T goes down. But wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when spots are present.

Hmm. That suggests that when T is lower (spots present), the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if E1 > E2, then as T decreases, the ratio n1/n2 should increase because the exponent becomes less negative. So maybe E1 is lower than E2? Or perhaps I got the levels wrong.

Wait, maybe the problem says the ratio of level 1 to level 2. So n1/n2.

Suppose level 2 is higher energy than level 1. So E2 > E1. Then E1-E2 is negative, so the exponent is -(negative)/(k T), which is positive. So the exponential term is exp(positive), which is a larger number. So when T is lower, the exponent becomes more positive because 1/T is larger. So exp(something positive) increases, so n1
