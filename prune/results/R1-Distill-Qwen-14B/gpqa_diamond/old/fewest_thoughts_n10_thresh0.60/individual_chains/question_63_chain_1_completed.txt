Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics question about a diatomic molecule. Hmm, the question is about the momentum of a photon that causes the molecule to switch to the next lowest energy state. Let me think through this step by step.

The molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. I remember that in such models, the energy levels are a combination of rotational and vibrational states. But wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state. Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is the ground state for both rotation and vibration.

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. So, what happens when it absorbs a photon? It should transition to the next higher energy state. But the question specifies the next state with the lowest possible energy. That would imply a transition that only increases one quantum number by one, either rotational or vibrational. But I'm a bit confused here because I'm not sure if it's a vibrational or rotational transition.

Wait, the question mentions the molecular bond length and the angular frequency of vibration. Oh, that makes me think it's about a vibrational transition. But wait, both rotational and vibrational energy levels are quantized. So the next state could involve either a vibrational or rotational change. But the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so maybe it's the next allowed state, which could be a combination of both.

Wait, but the fundamental state for a diatomic molecule in the rotation-vibration model is usually the ground state for both vibrations and rotations. So the fundamental state is where the vibrational quantum number is zero (v=0) and the rotational quantum number is also zero (like J=0). Or wait, no, the rotational quantum number might start at J=0, but for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

Wait, but the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So, the current state is the ground state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next possible state would be the smallest increase in energy, which would either be increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or increasing J to 1 (v=0, J=1). I need to find which transition gives the lower energy.

But wait, the energy levels for vibrations are quantized as E_v = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the frequency. For rotations, E_J = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So the energy difference between v=0 and v=1 is h ν. The energy difference for J=0 to J=1 is 2B (since E_J=1 is 2B, E_J=0 is 0). So which is smaller? It depends on the values of B and ν.

Given the data, the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. So ν = ω/(2π) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz. Then, the energy for the vibrational transition would be ΔE_vib = h ν ≈ 6.626e-34 * 6.37e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

For rotation, the rotational constant B is given by ħ²/(2 I ω_rot²), wait no, B is usually defined as h/(8π² c I), but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, B can be calculated using the bond length and moments of inertia.

Wait, the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I. The formula is B = ℏ²/(2 I k), but wait, let's think again. The rotational energy levels are E_J = B J (J+1), and B is given by ħ²/(2 I), where I is the moment of inertia. Alternatively, another formula comes into mind: B = h/(8π² c I), but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia I first. The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule is I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass and r is the bond length.

So, let's calculate μ. The masses are Mx=20 amu and My=2 amu. The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) amu. Let's compute that: (20 * 2)/(20 + 2) = 40 /22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Oh, wait, but I need to convert that to kg. 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

The bond length r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so r = 2e-10 m. So I = μ r² = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg m².

Now, B = ħ²/(2 I), but wait, I think I might have messed up. No, wait, the rotational constant in terms of energy is B = ħ²/(2 I). Let me calculate ħ, which is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So, B = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.206e-46) → let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ (1.112e-68) (since (1e-34)^2 is 1e-68).

Denominator: 2 * 1.206e-46 = 2.412e-46.

So B ≈ 1.112e-68 / 2.412e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, no, wait another thing. I think I might have mixed up the units because rotational constants are often given in cm^-1 or other units. Wait, but the formula I used gives B in Joules.

Wait, but perhaps I should calculate the energy difference for the rotational transition. The current state is J=0, and the next is J=1. The energy difference is E_J=1 - E_J=0 = B*(1)(2) - 0 = 2B. So 2 * 4.61e-23 J ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

Comparing that to the vibrational energy difference of 4.22e-20 J. Wait, 4.22e-20 is way bigger than 9.22e-23. So the rotational transition would require less energy (since lower energy difference is smaller). So the photon would have to supply less energy for a rotational transition.

Wait, wait, but in reality, the molecule can absorb a photon to go from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state. But in the non-rigid rotor model, are both vibrational and rotational transitions allowed? Or does the question imply that the molecule is in the fundamental vibrational state (v=0) but in some rotational state?

Wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0 and J=0. So the next possible state would be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. But which transition requires a lower energy photon?

As I calculated, the rotational transition ΔE is about 9.22e-23 J, and the vibrational is 4.22e-20 J. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the molecule would absorb a photon with lower energy (longer wavelength) if it's a rotational transition. But the question is about which momentum the photon should have. Wait, because the photon's energy is related to its momentum.

The energy of a photon is E = p c, where p is momentum and c is speed of light. So p = E/(c).

So for the rotational transition, the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J. So p = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) ≈ 3.073e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

Wait, but looking at the options, the given options are in the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28 N·s. My calculation is giving me 3e-31 N·s, which is way smaller than any of the options. That suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of B. Let me double-check the steps.

I calculated the moment of inertia I as 3.015e-27 kg multiplied by (2e-10 m)^2. So (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20 m². So I = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

Then B = ħ²/(2I). ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s. So ħ squared is about (1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J² s².

So B = 1.112e-68 / (2 * 1.206e-46) = 1.112e-68 / 2.412e-46 ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

Wait, that's right. So 2B is 9.22e-23 J. So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J, so its momentum p is E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 kg m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are way larger than this. So perhaps I messed up the approach.

Wait another thought—maybe the molecule's transition involves both a rotational and vibrational change. But wait, that would require a photon with energy corresponding to the sum of the differences. But that would make the energy even higher, which isn't what the question is asking.

Alternatively, maybe the quantum model being referred to is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, where the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration. In that case, the energy levels are E = E_vib + E_rot. The ground state is v=0, J=0.

The next possible state with the lowest energy would be either v=1, J=0 (vibrational excitation) or v=0, J=1 (rotational excitation). Which of these requires less energy?

As before, the vibrational energy difference is hν, and the rotational is 2B. So which is smaller between hν and 2B?

Compute hν: h is 6.626e-34 J·s, ν is 4e14 rad/s. Wait, wait, no—wait, ν in Hz is ω/(2π). Given that ω is 4e14 rad/s, ν = 4e14 / (2π) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

So hν ≈ 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

Earlier, I calculated 2B as 9.22e-23 J. So hν is larger than 2B. So the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon would need to have energy corresponding to 2B.

So then p = E/c = (2B) / c.

Wait, but why is the momentum so small? Let me compute it again.

E_rot = 2 * (4.61e-23 J) ≈ 9.22e-23 J.

p_rot = E / c = 9.22e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) → 3.07e-31 kg·m/s → 3.07e-31 N·s.

But the options are much larger. So perhaps I miscalculated B.

Wait another possibility: perhaps B is in units of cm^-1, but I'm using Joules. Let me think about what B is. The rotational constant B is often expressed in terms of energy per rotation quantum number. Alternatively, sometimes B is given in terms of wavenumbers (cm^-1), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the rotational constant is defined differently. Let me rethink the formula for B. The rotational energy levels are given by E_J = B J (J+1), where B is h/(8π² I c), but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another definition: rotational constant B is h/(8π² I c), where c is the speed of light. So I can calculate B in cm⁻¹.

Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe B is given in Joules per rotation state. Let me try to recalculate B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me check the formula again. E_J = (ħ² / (2I)) * J (J+1). So B is ħ²/(2I), which is in Joules.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ħ. ħ is h/(2π), which is about 1.0545718e-34 J·s. So that part is correct.

I = μ r². μ is (20 * 2) / (22) amu → (40)/(22) = 1.818 amu. 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg, so μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. So I = (3.015e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

So B = ħ²/(2I) = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.206e-46) → let's compute that.

(1.05457e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68. So 1.112e-68 / (2.412e-46) ≈ 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B is 9.22e-23 J. So p = 9.22e-23 / (3e8) ≈ 3.07e-31 N·s. But the options are all about 1e-27 N·s. Hmm, my calculation is way off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units. Let me check the bond length again. 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters? Yes, because 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the reduced mass is wrong. Let me recalculate μ.

Mx = 20 amu, My = 2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.81818... amu. So that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is v=1, J=0. Since 2B is about 9.22e-23 J, which is way smaller than hν (4.22e-20 J), the photon's momentum would be based on hν.

Wait, because the question is about the photon that the molecule absorbs to go to the next state. If the next state is the vibrational state, the momentum would be higher. But why is the calculation not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the transition to the next state, which is the first excited state. In that case, the molecule would go from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1) or (v=1, J=0). But perhaps the next state is the one with the smallest possible energy increase, which would be the rotational transition. But in that case, the photon's momentum is way too small.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which would require hν.

Wait, let's calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition. E = hν = 4.22e-20 J. So p = E/c ≈ 4.22e-20 / 3e8 = 1.407e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28. Option A is 1.9e-28. So 1.4e-28 is close to option D. So maybe the correct answer is D.

But why is the rotational transition not considered? Because if the rotational transition requires less energy, why would the photon be the one that corresponds to the higher energy vibrational transition?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial assumption. The question says, "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the smallest possible ΔE. Hence, the rotational transition is lower in energy, so the photon's momentum would be based on 2B.

But our calculation for 2B gives a much smaller p than any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, maybe I should compute B in terms of the rotational frequency. Wait, the rotational frequency isn't given. Hmm, but the question gives the angular frequency of vibration, not rotation.

Wait, another approach: calculate the rotational energy difference in terms of angular frequency.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are E_J = ℏ ω_rot J (J+1), where ω_rot is the rotational angular frequency. But without knowing ω_rot, I can't compute that. Alternatively, perhaps B is related to the rotational frequency.

Wait, the rotational constant B is often expressed as B = ħ ω_rot / (2π), so ω_rot = 2π B.

But without knowing ω_rot, that seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the vibrational energy difference because the only frequency given is the vibrational one.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule would absorb the least energy photon possible to transition to the next state. So it would choose the transition with the smallest ΔE.

As calculated, 2B is 9.22e-23 J and hν is 4.22e-20 J. So 9.22e-23 is smaller, so the rotational transition is the one.

But then, why isn't the photon's momentum in the options matching this? Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps the error is in the calculation of B. Let me recompute I.

I = μ r².

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.015e-27 kg.

r = 2e-10 m.

I = 3.015e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.015e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.206e-46 kg·m².

B = ħ²/(2 I) → (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 * 1.206e-46) → 1.112e-68 / 2.412e-46 = 4.61e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.22e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.22e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 ≈ 3.07e-31 N·s.

But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is in the ground vibrational state (v=0) but in some rotational state J>0. But the question says it's in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state, so J=0 and v=0.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering a transition from the fundamental state to the next state, which could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0). Because in that case, the momentum would be based on hν.

Wait, let's recalculate hν.

ν = ω/(2π) = 4e14 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 6.366e13 Hz.

hν = 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 ≈ 4.22e-20 J.

p = hν / c → E = 4.22e-20 J.

p = 4.22e-20 / 3e8 ≈ 1.407e-28 N·s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 N·s. So that's matching.

But why would the molecule transition to the vibrational state when a rotational transition requires less energy? Because the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which would actually be the rotational transition. But that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next allowed state, which could be a combination of both. Or perhaps I'm missing something in the model.

Wait, another angle: in the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels are a combination of rotation and vibration. So perhaps the next state is the first state with higher energy than the ground state, regardless of whether it's rotation or vibration. So the energy difference would be the smallest possible between the ground state and any other state.

So in that case, the photon's energy would be the minimum possible ΔE, which is the rotational transition (2B) as calculated earlier. But that gives a p of ~3e-31 N·s, which isn't among the options.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me think again. Perhaps the question is not considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but only one. Maybe it's about the vibrational transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition because the angular frequency is given for vibration. But why would that be the case? Because the question mentions the rotation-vibration model, implying both are considered.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the transition that causes a change in both rotational and vibrational states. But that would require more energy.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next possible state in terms of quantum numbers, not necessarily the lowest energy. But that would complicate things further, and I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the selection rules. In rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1. For vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But in a diatomic molecule, the dipole transition is allowed only for certain changes. But without more information on that, perhaps it's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the photon's momentum for a transition from v=0 to v=1. In that case, the energy is hν, and p = hν/c.

So p = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (4e14 rad/s) / (3e8 m/s). Wait, wait, no—wait, ν is in Hz, which is s^-1. So hν is in J.

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly. ν is 6.366e13 Hz.

p = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (6.366e13 Hz) / (3e8 m/s) → 6.626e-34 * 6.366e13 = 4.22e-20 J. Then divide by 3e8 → 1.407e-28 N·s.

Which is option D: 1.4e-28 N·s.

But earlier I thought that the energy for the rotational transition is lower. But perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in reality, the molecule can't just transition between vibrational states without considering the rotational. So I'm a bit confused why the options don't include the smaller momentum from the rotational transition.

Another thought: perhaps the given options are based on the vibrational transition. So maybe the correct answer is D) 1.4e-28 N·s.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the rotational energy difference. Let's see: 2B is 9.22e-23 J. p = 9.22e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 N·s, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the rotational transition isn't allowed, so the molecule must absorb a photon corresponding to the vibrational transition. But I'm not sure about the selection rules here.

Wait, in a diatomic molecule, the vibrational transition is allowed when there's a change in the dipole moment. Similarly, for rotational transitions, a change in dipole moment is needed. But in the absence of specific selection rule information, perhaps the question expects to consider the vibrational transition.

So, given that, the momentum is 1.4e-28 N·s, which is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the system using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in its fundamental state, which corresponds to the ground state of both vibration (v=0) and rotation (J=0). The next possible states are either the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational excited state (v=0, J=1). The energy difference for these transitions determines which photon momentum is required.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Vibrational Transition (v=0 → v=1):**
   - The vibrational energy levels are quantized as \( E_v = (v + \frac{1}{2}) h \nu \), where \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \).
   - Given \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), we calculate \( \nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz} \).
   - The energy difference for the vibrational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.22 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Thus:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{4.22 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]

2. **Rotational Transition (J=0 → J=1):**
   - The rotational energy levels are quantized as \( E_J = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \) is the rotational constant.
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \times 2}{20 + 2} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms, \( \mu \approx 3.015 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).
   - The moment of inertia \( I \) is \( I = \mu r^2 \), where \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Substituting:
     \[
     I = (3.015 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.206 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2.
     \]
   - The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{(1.05457 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 1.206 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The energy difference for the rotational transition is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon for this transition is:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s}.
     \]

### Comparison:
- The vibrational transition requires a photon with momentum \( p_{\text{vib}} \approx 1.407 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{N·s} \), which matches option D.
- The rotational transition requires a photon with momentum \( p_{\text{rot}} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{N·s} \), which is much smaller than any of the given options.

Since the question asks for the photon momentum required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, and the vibrational transition has a higher energy difference than the rotational transition, the correct answer is based on the vibrational transition.

**Answer: D**
