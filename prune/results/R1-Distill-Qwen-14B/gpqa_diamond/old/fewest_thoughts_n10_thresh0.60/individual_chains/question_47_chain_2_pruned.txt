Okay, I've got this problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. So, the question is to identify a compound with the formula C9H11NO2 using the given spectral data. The options are A to D. Hmm, I remember that IR and 1H NMR can give a lot of clues about the structure.

First, let me break down the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation are calculated by (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, no X (halogens) so it's (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2. So that's (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be a benzene ring (which is three double bonds, so three degrees), a carbonyl group (another one), and maybe an amide or something else. But wait, five makes sense for a benzene ring (3) plus a carbonyl (1) and an amine or something else (like a double bond or ring).

Looking at the IR data. Strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are typically N-H stretches. If it's a primary amine, you might see a broad peak around 3300-3500. But wait, the presence of an amide would show N-H stretches as well. Amides usually have two peaks around 3300-3500, which could explain these two bands. Alternatively, maybe an amine group or an alcohol. But the strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group. 1720 is typical for esters or amides, maybe a ketone but less likely with the other data.

So the functional groups likely present are a carbonyl (like ester, amide), and possibly an amine or an ether.

Now, the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows several signals.

1.20 ppm, triplet, 3H. That's a typical triplet for a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something deshielded. So maybe an ethyl ester or ethyl ether.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests possibly an -NH- group, but in this case, maybe an OCH2 or something else. Alternatively, maybe an -OCH2CH3 where the protons are split, but the integration here is 2H. Wait, but in an ethyl group, you'd have more splitting, but this is a singlet. Alternatively, maybe a methylene (-CH2-) group attached to an oxygen. Like OCH2.

4.5 ppm, quartet, 2H. Quartet and 2H suggests a -CH2- group adjacent to another CH2 group. Like in an ethyl ester, the ester oxygen is connected to a CH2 which is next to another CH2. For example, in ethyl acetate, the CH2 near the oxygen is a quartet. So quartet at ~4.5 ppm, 2
