Okay, so I've got this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about the oxidizing strength of oxygen in basic and acidic solutions, and how it reacts kinetically in acidic solutions.

Hmm, the question says: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. The options are about whether it's a stronger or weaker oxidant, and whether the reaction is faster or slower.

Wait, I remember that the oxidizing power (or strength) of a substance depends on the conditions—like pH. In basic solutions, OH- ions are around, and maybe that affects the O2's ability to act as an oxidant.

Oxygen is O2, right? So when it's acting as an oxidant, it gets reduced. The standard reduction for O2 in acidic solution is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O. The E° for that is about +1.23 V. But in basic solution, the same reaction would have O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH-. What's the E° for that?

I think the E° for the basic solution is higher. Wait, maybe? Because in basic conditions, H+ isn't present, but OH- is. The E° for O2 in basic solution is higher than in acidic. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think. The standard reduction potential for O2 in acid is 1.23 V. In basic solution, the E° is actually the same because the standard conditions are 1 atm, but the presence of OH- affects the actual reaction. Or does it?

Wait, no, the standard electrode potentials are measured under standard conditions, which are 1 M concentrations for all ions. So in acidic solution, the H+ is 1 M, and in basic, OH- is 1 M. So the reaction in basic would be O2 + 2H2O +4e- → 4 OH-. The E° for that is the same as in acidic? Or does the pH affect the E°? Hmm, I think that the standard E° is a measure under standard conditions, but when the solution isn't standard, like in real situations, the actual E can shift.

Wait, no, the standard E is calculated using the Nernst equation. So the E for each solution would be based on their pH.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Nernst equation. For the O2 reduction in acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O. The E° is 1.23 V. In a basic solution, the same reaction can't proceed because H+ is low, so O2 would react with water: O2 + 2H2O +4e- → 4OH-. So in basic conditions, the same E° value would apply, but under standard conditions, the H+ would be 1 M, which is acidic. So perhaps in basic, the effective E is lower?

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me approach it another way. The oxidizing strength depends on the E° value. Higher E° means a stronger oxidizing agent. So in acidic solution, E° for O2 is 1.23 V. In basic, what's the E° for O2? I think the E° is the same, but when you calculate the actual potential under non-standard conditions, like when the pH is higher (basic), the potential changes.

Wait, let me think about the Nernst equation. For the reaction in acidic solution: E = E° - (RT/nF) ln(Q). But in basic conditions, the reaction is different. Alternatively, perhaps the O2 is a stronger oxidizing agent in basic solution because the E° is higher. Or maybe I'm mixing up the concepts.

Alternatively, perhaps the thermodynamic favorability in basic solutions makes O2 a stronger oxidant. Because in basic solutions, the product (like OH-) is more stable. So, in basic conditions, the O2 is a stronger oxidant. Because the E° for the O2 reduction in basic is higher than in acidic? Wait, no, because the E° in acidic is 1.23 V and in basic, maybe higher? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, when O2 is in a basic solution, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e- → 4OH-. The E° for this reaction is calculated using the standard conditions, which for OH- is 1 M. So the standard E° for this reaction is the same as the acidic one because they're both under standard conditions (1 M H+ in acidic, 1 M OH- in basic). Wait, but the E° for O2 in basic is actually also 1.23 V because it's measured under standard conditions. Or does the E° change based on the solution's pH? Hmm.

Wait, no. The standard electrode potentials are all determined under standard conditions, which for acids is 1 M H+ and for bases is 1 M OH-. So the E° for O2 in acidic is 1.23 V, and in basic, it's the same because it's the same reaction but under basic conditions. Wait, no, that can't be. Because the actual reaction is different. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the oxidizing power of O2 is the same in any solution, but the kinetics (the rate) are different. Because in acidic solutions, maybe the reaction is faster because of the presence of H+ ions which could act as catalysts or something.

Wait, but the question is about thermodynamic vs kinetic aspects. Thermodynamically, it's about whether it's a stronger or weaker oxidant. Kinetically, it's about how fast it reacts.

So, for the thermodynamic part: in basic solutions, is O2 a stronger or weaker oxidant? If the E° is higher, it's a stronger oxidant. But how does the solution's pH affect E°? Or does it not affect the standard E° because E° is a standard value.

Wait, perhaps the standard E° for O2 in acidic and basic is the same, so thermodynamically, it's equally strong. But that can't be the case because the question says the first part is a blank. Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Alternatively, maybe in basic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant because the reduction is more favorable. Because the O2 can react with water, producing OH- which is more in concentration in basic solution, making the reaction more favorable.

Wait, the standard E° for O2 in acidic is 1.23 V. For O2 in basic, since the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e- →4OH-, the E° for this reaction is the same as in acidic because it's under standard conditions. So the E° doesn't change based on the solution's pH. So thermodynamically, O2 is equally strong in both solutions.

But the question says, "Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions." So if the E° is the same, but the actual cell potential (E) would be different under non-standard conditions. Wait, but the question is about thermodynamic favorability, not the actual E in a non-standard cell.

Wait, no. The standard E° is a measure of the thermodynamic favorability. So if E° is higher, the reaction is more favorable. So if in basic solution, the E° is higher, then O2 is a stronger oxidant.

Wait, but in acidic, the E° is 1.23 V, and in basic, it's the same. Because it's the same reaction under standard conditions. So the E° is the same in both cases. So why would the statement say oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the reaction in basic solution is more favorable because of the presence of OH- ions. Or maybe because the activation energy is lower, making the reaction proceed faster.

Wait, the question has two parts: thermodynamic and kinetic. So the first part is about whether O2 is a stronger or weaker oxidant in basic solutions. The second part is about whether it reacts faster or slower in acidic solutions.

Hmm. Let's think about the Nernst equation. For the reaction O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O, the E is E° - (0.0592/4) log (1/[H+]^4) ), because Q is 1/(H+)^4.

In acidic solution (like pH 0, so [H+] = 1), E would be 1.23 V. In a more acidic solution (lower pH, higher [H+]), the E increases? Because the log term becomes less negative.

Wait, for O2 as an oxidant, the higher the E, the stronger the oxidant. So in acidic solution, if E is higher, it's a stronger oxidant. But in basic solution, the same O2 has a different reaction.

Wait, for the basic solution, the reaction is O2 + 2H2O +4e- →4OH-. The E° for this is also 1.23 V. But under non-standard conditions, what happens. Let's say in a basic solution, [OH-] is high. So the Nernst equation for this reaction would be E = E° - (0.0592/4) * log(1/[OH-]^4 )

Which is E = 1.23 - (0.0148) * log(1/[OH-]^4 )

Because OH- is 1 M in standard conditions, but in basic solution, [OH-] is higher, say 10 M. So log(1/(10^4)) = log(1e-4) = -4. So the term becomes 0.0148 * (-4) = -0.0592. So E = 1.23 + 0.0592 = 1.289 V.

So in a basic solution, the E is higher than 1.23 V, meaning O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic solutions. So thermodynamically, it's a stronger oxidant in basic.

So the first blank is 'stronger'.

Now, the second part is about kinetic. In acidic solutions, does O2 react faster? Kinetic factors are about activation energy and how fast the reaction proceeds.

In acidic solutions, H+ ions are present. The reaction of O2 as an oxidant involves electrons and possibly H+ ions. For example, in acidic conditions, the O2 reduction involves H+ which can help in the reaction mechanism. H+ can stabilize transition states or intermediates, possibly lowering activation energy and making the reaction proceed faster.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction in acidic is more sluggish because the reaction pathway is different. I'm a bit confused here. Wait, the reaction in acidic is O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O. In basic, it's O2 + 2H2O +4e- →4OH-.

Which reaction occurs faster? I remember that in acidic media, some reactions are faster because H+ can act as catalysts. For example, the O2 reduction in acidic might have a lower activation energy because H+ can stabilize the transition state.

But wait, in basic solution, the reaction doesn't involve H+ ions, so maybe it's slower. Or is it the opposite?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction in basic is slower because it's harder to get the H2O molecules involved in the reaction. Or maybe it's faster because the solution is more conductive? Not sure.

Wait, I think that in acidic solutions, the reaction of O2 is kinetically slower because of the higher activation energy. Or maybe it's the opposite. Let me think about catalysis. H+ can act as a catalyst in the reaction. So in acidic solution, H+ would facilitate the reaction, making it faster. So if O2 is an oxidant in acidic, the reaction is faster.

But the question says: Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. So if in acidic, it reacts faster, then the blank is 'faster'.

Putting it together: thermodynamically stronger in basic, kinetically faster in acidic. So the blanks are 'stronger' and 'faster'.

Looking at the options:

Option A) stronger – faster → Yes, that's what I got.

Wait, but looking at the options: the options are combinations of weaker/stronger and faster/slower.

So the correct combination is stronger (thermodynamic in basic) and faster (kinetic in acidic). So option A is stronger – faster. So the answer should be A.


The question involves analyzing the oxidizing strength and reaction kinetics of oxygen (O₂) in basic and acidic solutions. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Thermodynamic Analysis in Basic Solutions**:  
   The standard reduction potential for O₂ in acidic solutions is 1.23 V. In basic solutions, the reaction shifts to O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻, with the same standard reduction potential (E° = 1.23 V). However, under non-standard conditions, the actual potential (E) increases in basic solutions due to the higher concentration of OH⁻ ions. This makes O₂ a stronger oxidant thermodynamically in basic solutions compared to acidic solutions.

2. **Kinetic Analysis in Acidic Solutions**:  
   In acidic solutions, the reaction involves H⁺ ions (O₂ + 4H⁺ + 4e⁻ → 2H₂O). The presence of H⁺ ions can act as catalysts, stabilizing intermediates or transition states and lowering the activation energy. This facilitates a faster reaction in acidic solutions compared to basic solutions, where the reaction involves water and OH⁻ ions, which may have a higher activation energy.

3. **Combining the Results**:  
   Thermodynamically, O₂ is a **stronger** oxidant in basic solutions. Kinetically, O₂ reacts **faster** in acidic solutions. This matches the combination "stronger – faster."

4. **Evaluating the Options**:  
   - **A) stronger – faster**: Correct, as explained above.  
   - **B) stronger – slower**: Incorrect, as reactions in acidic solutions are faster.  
   - **C) weaker – faster**: Incorrect, as O₂ is stronger in basic solutions.  
   - **D) weaker – slower**: Incorrect, as O₂ is stronger in basic solutions and faster in acidic solutions.

Thus, the correct answer is **A) stronger – faster**.

Answer: A
