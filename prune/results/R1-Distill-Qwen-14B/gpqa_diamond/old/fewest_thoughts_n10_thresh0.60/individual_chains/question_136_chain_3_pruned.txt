Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: A vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r² from the origin. The magnitude is f(r) = 1/r², and the field only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I need to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field, ∇ · f, inside a sphere of radius R centered at the origin.

Hmm, I remember that divergence is a measure of how much a vector field spreads out or converges at a point. So, ∇ · f would tell me about the sources or sinks in the field. Since the field is radial, maybe there's something about Gauss's law here? Or maybe it's a simpler divergence calculation.

Wait, the field is given as f(r) = 1/r², and it's only radial. So in spherical coordinates, the vector field would look like f(r) = (1/r²) * r̂. Because the only component is the radial one, and everything else (θ and φ components) are zero.

I think I need to compute the divergence of this vector field. The divergence in spherical coordinates for a vector field A = A_r r̂ + A_θ θ̂ + A_φ φ̂ is given by:

∇ · A = (1/r²) [d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/sinθ) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(sinθ r)) dA_φ/dφ]

But in our case, A_θ and A_φ are zero, so the expression simplifies. Only the radial term matters.

So, substituting A_r = 1/r², and the other components zero:

∇ · f = (1/r²) d/dr [r² * (1/r²)] 

Wait, let's compute the derivative. r² times 1/r² is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. Therefore, ∇ · f would be (1/r²) * 0 = 0?

Wait, that can't be right. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, but wait, the function 1/r² is only defined for r not equal to zero. So when r is zero, the field is undefined, or maybe it's a point source or something.

Wait, but let me think
