Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right reagents for two reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with cyanide usually undergo nucleophilic addition. But wait, wait. In a typical scenario, when a ketone like acetone reacts with HCN, it adds the cyanide to the carbonyl carbon, right? So the product would be a cyanohydrin. Oh, right, that's what's happening here.

So butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN and some acid as a catalyst? Oh, wait, but what's the role of A here. NaCN is a source of CN- ions, but sometimes the reaction needs acid catalysis. I think the reaction is acid-catalyzed because the carbonyl needs to be protonated to make it more electrophilic. So A is probably something that provides H+ ions. Looking at the options, options A and B have H3O+ as A. Options C and D have NaHSO3, which is a source of HSO3^- and H+.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have a strong base, it might deprotonate things, but in the case of HCN addition, you usually need an acid catalyst. So maybe A is H3O+ (like HCl or H2SO4, but H3O+ is just the proton source). So for the first reaction, A is H3O+.

The second reaction is with 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile and reagent B (with H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is being converted into a carboxylic acid. How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed under certain conditions. The typical hydrolysis of nitriles can give amides, which under stronger conditions can go to carboxylic acids. Wait, but the conditions for this conversion. For nitrile to acid, you usually have strong acidic or basic conditions and heat. Alternatively, maybe using a strong acid and water.

Wait, actually, the hydroly
