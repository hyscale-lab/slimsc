Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about identifying an unknown compound based on its spectroscopic data: FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. The options given are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Alright, let's break down the information given.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretching. So maybe this compound has an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch. Hmm.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. The 1700 region is typically a carbonyl group (C=O). But wait, what about the 1650? That could be another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated one, or maybe an aromatic ring with substituents. Or perhaps it's an amide, but I don't see any N in the formula options, so probably not that.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So that means the compound has at least one double bond.

Mass spectrometry shows a fragment peak at m/z =45. Hmm, I need to think about what that could be. Common fragments include things like CH3O+ (which is 31), but 45 is a bit higher. Maybe it's a ketone group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2CH2O group? Wait, 45 is also the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2O or maybe a fragment involving a carbonyl group.

Let me think about each of the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible functional groups? Maybe ester or
