Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question is about the state of a system and measuring two observables, P and Q, in succession. The system's state at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, that doesn't look like a unit vector. Oh wait, maybe it's just given as a vector, but I might need to normalize it later because quantum states are usually represented by unit vectors.

The operator for P is a 3x3 matrix. The first row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row is (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and the third row is (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). I should write that down to visualize it better. Let me sketch it:

P =
[ 0          1/√2      0         ]
[1/√2       0        1/√2     ]
[ 0         1/√2      0         ]

And Q's matrix is:
[1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 -1]

So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. That probably means its possible measurement outcomes are 1, 0, and -1.

The question is, after measuring P then Q, what's the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no, the other way around. It says someone measures Q just after P. So first measure P, then measure Q. So the order is: first, measure P, then Q. So the state after measuring P will affect the state before measuring Q.

Wait, but the way measurements work is that when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the observable. So when we measure P first, the state collapses into an eigenstate of P. Then, when measuring Q, we're measuring the new state after that collapse.

But wait, another point: the initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). That's a vector, but it's not a unit vector. So I think I need to normalize it first. Let me compute its norm.

The vector is v = [-1, 2, 1]^T.
