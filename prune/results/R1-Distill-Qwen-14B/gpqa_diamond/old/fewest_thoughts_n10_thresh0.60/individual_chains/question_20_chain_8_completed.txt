Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about nuclear physics, specifically about the impulse approximation in many-body calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is an assumption made in some models where nucleons are treated almost like they're free particles. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let's think through this.

The question asks which four assumptions together imply this "impulse" approximation. The options are numbered 1 to 4, and the choices are combinations of them. Let me go through each point one by one.

First, the question says that in this approximation, nucleons behave as if they're free. That makes me think of the independent particle model, where each nucleon moves in an average potential without much interaction with others. But impulse approximation is a bit different; I think it's more about the treatment of interactions. Oh right, impulse approximation is often used in the context of, say, electron-nucleus scattering. In that case, the idea is that the nuclear interactions are so brief (impulse) that the nucleons don't have time to respond collectively, so each behaves almost as if it's free.

So the assumptions that lead to this would be: the interactions are so short that nucleons don't see each other during the interaction, meaning their binding forces don't affect the process much. Also, each nucleon is treated individually, not considering their mutual interactions.

Looking at the options:

1. The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. That sounds like the interaction is with each nucleon separately, not collectively. So this supports the idea that each nucleon acts independently. So probably this assumption is part of the impulse approximation.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon. Wait, transparent? Oh, maybe like in electron scattering, the nucleus is mostly transparent except for the nucleon being hit. So when an external force (like an electromagnetic interaction) acts on a nucleon, the rest of the nucleus doesn't significantly affect the process. So the other nucleons don't participate or have negligible effect. That would mean the interaction is only with one nucleon, and the others don't influence it. So this assumption aligns with the impulse approximation.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic. Hmm, this is about the internal structure of the nucleon. If the quarks are non-relativistic, that might imply that their motion is not highly relativistic, so maybe the binding within the nucleon is treated in a simple way. But does this relate to the impulse approximation? I'm not so sure. The impulse approximation is more about the interactions between the external force and the nucleon, rather than the internal dynamics of the nucleon. Unless treating quarks as non-relativistic makes the nucleon's internal binding weaker, but I don't think this directly contributes to the impulse approximation. Maybe this isn't one of the assumptions needed for the impulse approximation.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces. Oh, this makes sense. If the nucleon is experiencing no binding forces during the interaction, it behaves as a free particle—so that's a direct implication of the approximation. So assumption 4 is definitely part of it.

So the assumptions that matter are 1, 2, and 4. Let's see the options:

Option A: 1,2,4 → That includes all three. Option B: 2,3,4 → Includes 3, which I'm not sure about. Option C: 1,2,3 → Excludes 4, which I think is crucial. Option D: 1,3,4 → Excludes 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So, the nucleus being transparent apart from the selected nucleon (assumption 2) would mean that only that one nucleon interacts. So in terms of the impulse approximation, the other nucleons don't contribute, so their binding doesn't affect the process. But perhaps assumption 2 is a way of saying that the rest of the nucleus doesn't influence the interaction. So the approximation involves treating each nucleon as if it's free, meaning the binding forces (from the nucleus) are ignored. So assumption 4 says that the selected nucleon feels no binding forces, but assumption 2 might be a way of saying the nucleus is transparent, so the interaction is only with that one nucleon. 

So the four assumptions are (1, 2, 4), which is option A. But wait, what about assumption 3? I don't think it's required for the impulse approximation. The impulse approximation is about the external interaction with the nucleus, not about the internal structure of the nucleon. So assumption 3 probably isn't part of the assumptions leading to the impulse approximation.

So the correct combination is 1, 2, 4 → option A.


The impulse approximation in nuclear physics assumes that nucleons behave as free particles during an interaction, such as in electron-nucleus scattering. This approximation arises when the interaction is so brief that nucleons do not experience the collective effects of the nucleus or binding forces. Let us analyze the given assumptions:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This assumption aligns with the impulse approximation because it treats each nucleon as interacting independently, without considering collective effects.  
2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This implies that only one nucleon interacts with the external force, while the rest of the nucleus has negligible influence. This supports the idea that the interaction is localized and the nucleon behaves as if it is free.  
3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: This assumption pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon and does not directly relate to the impulse approximation, which focuses on the interaction with the nucleon as a whole rather than its internal dynamics.  
4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This directly implies that the nucleon behaves as a free particle during the interaction, which is a key aspect of the impulse approximation.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: A
