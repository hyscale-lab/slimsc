Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to these reaction mechanisms, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question involves two reactions and asks which reagents (A and B) are suitable for them. The options are A, B, C, D, each pairing different reagents.

First, let me look at the reactions.

The first reaction is:
butan-2-one + NaCN + A â†’ 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, right? So that's methylacetone. I remember that ketones can undergo various nucleophilic additions. The presence of NaCN suggests that maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. So perhaps the cyanide ion (CN-) is adding to the carbonyl group.

But wait, butan-2-one reacting with NaCN. Wait, but I think when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, it usually undergoes an addition to form a cyanohydrin. Oh right, that's it. The cyanide adds to the carbonyl, making a secondary alcohol when the nitrile is attached.

So the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me check the structure. Butanone is (CH3)2CO. Adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanenitrile? Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-
