Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that an unknown compound was prepared and characterized using FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. They've given me data from each of these techniques, and I need to figure out the chemical formula from the options provided.

Alright, let's break down each piece of information one by one and see what they tell us about the compound.

First, the FTIR spectrum shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm⁻¹. Broad peaks in IR usually correspond to O-H stretching. A very broad peak suggests it's an alcohol (since alcohols have broad O-H stretches) or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have a very strong and broad O-H stretch, often around 2500-3300 cm⁻¹. But the peak here is at 3000. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol. Also, other possibilities like phenols could have broad O-H stretches, but they usually are a bit lower in wavenumber perhaps? I might not be certain about that. But a broad peak around 3000 is definitely O-H.

Then, there are two other strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. These are lower in wavenumber than the O-H. 1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group (C=O). For example, in ketones, aldehydes, or esters. The peak at 1650 is a bit lower. That could be conjugated with something else, maybe an aromatic ring or another carbonyl group in a different environment. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds (like C=C in an aromatic ring), but I'm not sure. Wait, but the 1700 is probably a carbonyl. So maybe the compound has two carbonyl groups? Or maybe one carbonyl and another functional group.

Wait, wait.
