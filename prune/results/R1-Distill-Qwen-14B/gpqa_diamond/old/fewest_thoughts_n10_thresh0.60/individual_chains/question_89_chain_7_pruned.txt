Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. I remember that when vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons) react with a strong base like KOH, they undergo an elimination reaction, specifically dehydrohalogenation, to form an alkene. So heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH would likely produce an alkene. But wait, since adamantane is a diamondoid structure, maybe it's a bridgehead elimination? Hmm, no, wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have two bromines on adjacent carbons in the adamantane structure. So when KOH is added in excess and heated, they eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a double bond. So the product 1 would be 1,3-adamantadiene? Or maybe 1,2-diene? Wait, no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so elimination would form a double bond between carbons 1 and 2, making 1,2-adamantadiene? Or perhaps another diene? Wait, wait, the product is a light yellow solid. Maybe it's an epoxide? No, because the IR shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm-1, which is indicative of an ester or ketone or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, no,
