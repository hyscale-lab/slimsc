Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology, and I need to find the incorrect statement. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the question says all the statements are correct except one. My goal is to find that one incorrect statement.

Looking at the options, A, B, C, D. Let me tackle each one.

Option A: SARS-CoV-2 nsp10/nsp14-ExoN operates as heterodimers in a mismatch repair mechanism. The N-terminal ExoN domain of nsp14 could bind to nsp10 making an active exonuclease complex that prevents the breakdown of dsRNA.

Hmm. I remember that nsp10 and nsp14 are part of the replication machinery. They form a heterodimer, right? ExoN is involved in the proofreading function, which is the 3’ to 5’ exonuclease activity. So ExoN is part of the RNA polymerase complex, maybe for error correction. Wait, but if it prevents the breakdown of dsRNA, that doesn't sound right. Or does it? Because exonucleases usually break down RNA. Wait, no, the ExoN domain is an exonuclease, so it would break down RNA. Oh, wait, wait: the statement says it prevents the breakdown of dsRNA. That might be incorrect. Because the exonuclease would actually contribute to the breakdown. Or maybe I'm mixing up the functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the exonuc
