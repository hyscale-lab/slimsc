Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

The problem gives a Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ̄ f (y) (upsilon + X(y)) ψ_f (y). Hmm, I think I remember that the Lagrangian tells us about the interactions in the theory. So the boson X is interacting with fermions, right?

The mass of the boson X is given as 6 GeV. The question is asking about the kinematically allowed decays of X at the lowest order. So, I need to figure out which fermion-antifermion pairs the X boson can decay into.

Wait, kinematically allowed means that the energy of the boson must be sufficient to produce the fermions. So the mass of X must be at least twice the mass of the fermions involved because each fermion gets some energy, and they have to have enough to create them from the rest mass.

First, I should recall the masses of the known fermions. Let's list the fermions and their approximate masses. I think the masses are as follows:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): around 0.1 GeV
- Tau (τ): about 1.77 GeV
- Up quark (u): very light, like 0.002 GeV
- Down quark (d): around 0.004 GeV
- Strange (s): about 0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): around 1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): about 4.1 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV

Wait, but wait. The mass of the X boson is 6 GeV, so for pair production, the sum of the two fermions' rest masses must be less than or equal to 6 GeV. Because in the rest frame of X, the fermions must each have at least their rest mass energy. So for any fermion f, 2m_f ≤ m_X.

So, for each possible fermion pair (like b and anti-b), we need to check if 2m_f is less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Let me compute 2m_f for each fermion:

- e: 2 * 0.0005 ≈ 0.001 GeV → way below 6
- μ: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 GeV
- τ: 2 * 1.77 ≈ 3.54 GeV
- u: 0.004 → 0.008 GeV
- d: 0.0
