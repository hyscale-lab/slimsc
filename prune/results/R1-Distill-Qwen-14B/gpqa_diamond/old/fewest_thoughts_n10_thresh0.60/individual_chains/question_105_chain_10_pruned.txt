Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stars with spots and exoplanets causing brightness variations. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see.

The question says that a star with the same radius as the Sun has one hemisphere covered in dark spots. The filling factor is 20%, which I think means the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000K, and the spots are cooler by 1000K, so they're at 5000K. But the star isn't actually being blocked by a planet; instead, the spots modulate the brightness as the star rotates. However, this setup creates a signal similar to an exoplanet. The question is asking, what radius of a planet would produce the same brightness variation as these spots.

Wait, I remember that when a planet transits a star, it blocks some light. The change in brightness (the dip) depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. Oh right, the formula for the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius, Rstar is the star's radius. But wait, this is a different situation because spots are causing the variation when the star rotates.

So the star's brightness varies as the spots rotate into and out of view. Since only one hemisphere is spotty, as the star spins, the spots come into the line of sight and then go away. But how does this compare to a planet transiting?

Let me think about the maximum dip in brightness. For the planet, the maximum dip is when it's directly in front of the star, blocking as much light as possible. So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the total brightness. But for the spots, the situation is a bit different.

The star's brightness without any spots would be based on its effective temperature. Spots being cooler would lower the overall brightness when they're facing us. The filling factor is 20% for one hemisphere. Wait, but the star is a sphere, so the hemisphere is half the star. If the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere, then the total area covered by spots when facing us is 0.2 * (Ï€ Rstar^2) * (1/2 hemisphere), but wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Let me formalize this. The star
