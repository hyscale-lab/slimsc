Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about selecting the right reagents for two reactions. I remember from my studies that reagents are crucial in determining the pathway of a reaction.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and something called reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Wait, butan-2-one is a ketone, right? So ketone plus NaCN... I think that's an example of a nucleophilic addition. Oh yeah! When a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion (from NaCN), it undergoes addition. But wait, that's usually under certain conditions. I remember that in the presence of an acid, the cyanide can act as a nucleophile. So maybe A is an acid. Because the product is a secondary alcohol turned into a nitrile?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. Adding NaCN would form (CH3)2C(OH)CN? No, wait, the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me write the structures. Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When it adds CN-, I think the product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me see: butanenitrile is CH2CH2CN, but here it's 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which is CH(CH3)(OH)CH2CN? Or wait, maybe the structure is CH2(CN)C(OH)(CH3). Hmm, maybe I should count the carbons. Butanenitrile is four carbons with CN. So 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile would have the OH and methyl on the same carbon as the CN. So the structure is CH2CN-C(OH)(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but butanenitrile is CH2CH2CH2CN, but butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. So when it reacts with NaCN, the product is (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the formula is (CH3)2C(OH)CN, which
