Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question about the distribution of stars based on their parallax. Hmm, let me think. I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (in arcseconds) is inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So plx = 1/distance, right? So if a star is farther away, its parallax is smaller.

The question is asking how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with plx. Wait, I think it's about the density or the number of stars in a certain range of parallax. So, like, if I pick a small range of parallax values, how does the count of stars in that range depend on the parallax.

I remember something about this from my notes. The number of stars in a given volume of space depends on the volume. Oh, wait, the number density of stars might be uniform, assuming stars are uniformly distributed, as the question says. So maybe if the volume increases, the number of stars would increase proportionally.

But wait, wait. Parallax relates to distance. So for a small change in parallax, how does the distance change? Let's see, plx is p = 1/d, so d = 1/p. So if I have a parallax range from p to p + dp, the corresponding distance range would be from d = 1/p to d = 1/(p + dp). Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go. Maybe I should think about the number of stars in a shell between distance d and d + dd.

If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density n is constant. The volume of a spherical shell at distance d with thickness dd is 4πd² dd. So the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4π d² dd. 

But since plx p = 1/d, then d = 1/p. Let's substitute that in. So d² becomes (1/p)² = 1/p². And dd is the change in distance, but wait, in terms of p, how does dd relate to dp? Let's see, since p = 1/d, then dp = - (1/d²) dd. So dd = - (d²) dp. But since p is small (parallax is usually a fraction of an arcsecond), and we're considering small dp, maybe the negative sign just indicates direction, which we can ignore for the magnitude. So dd is proportional to (1/p²) dp.

Putting it all together, the number of stars in a parallax range dp is proportional to n * 4π (1/p²) * (1/p²) dp. Wait, wait, let me think again. The shell volume is 4π d² dd. So in terms of p, d = 1/p, so d²
