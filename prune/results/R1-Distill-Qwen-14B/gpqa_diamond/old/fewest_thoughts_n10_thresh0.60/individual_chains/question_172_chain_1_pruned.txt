Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitement of iron atoms. Hmm, let me think. The question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And since the photospheres are in LTE, I remember that LTE stands for Local Thermal Equilibrium, which probably means we can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, the Boltzmann equation relates the population of different energy levels in a gas. The formula I think is n_i / n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ). Here, n_i is the number of atoms in a higher energy level, and n_j in a lower one. The ratio depends on the temperature T and the energy difference E between the levels.

In this problem, the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited as those in star_2. I'm guessing that means the ratio of the excited state to the ground state (or another state) is twice as high for star_1. Let's call the energy levels E1 and E2, but wait, the energy difference is given as 1.38e-23 J between the two levels. So ΔE = E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J.

So for star_1, the ratio is (n2/n1)_1 = 2. For star_2, (n2/n1)_2 = 1, since they're half as excited? Or wait, maybe star_2 is less excited, so the ratio is something else. Wait, the exact wording: "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So for the same energy level, the excitation is higher in star_1. So the number of atoms in that higher energy level divided by the lower is higher in star_1.

So for each star, their own Boltzmann factors apply. Let me set this up. Let's say for each star, the ratio of the excited state to the lower state is given by the Boltzmann factor. So for star 1, the ratio is n1/n2 = (n1)_1/(n2)_1 = exp(-ΔE/(k*T1)).

Wait, wait, maybe I should think of it as the population in the higher state (i) compared to the lower (j). So n_i/n_j = exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k T) ). So if star_1 has twice as many in the excited level, that ratio is 2. For star_2, it's 1? Or wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the question says "twice as excited", so perhaps star_1's n_i is twice that of star_2's n_i in the same energy level. Wait, no, perhaps the ratio n_i/n_j for star_1 is twice that of the same ratio for star_2. Or maybe not. Let me try to clarify.

Let me define:

For star_1: (n_i)/(n_j) = 2 * (n_i' /n_j') , where the primes are for star_2. Or
