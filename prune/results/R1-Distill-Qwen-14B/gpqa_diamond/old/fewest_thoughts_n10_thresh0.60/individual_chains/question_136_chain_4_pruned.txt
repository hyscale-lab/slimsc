Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about vector fields and integrals. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think it through. The question says that we've got a vector field f(r) that falls off radially as 1/r². Oh wait, and it only has a radial component in spherical coordinates. I remember that in spherical coordinates, a vector can have components in the radial (r), theta (θ), and phi (φ) directions. But here, only the radial part is non-zero.

The problem asks us to evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of this field inside a sphere of radius R. So mathematically, I think that's written as ∫∫∫ (∇ · f) dV over the volume of the sphere. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one.

Wait, I think the divergence theorem might be useful here. From what I remember, the divergence theorem relates the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field to the flux through the surface. So the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

So, applying the divergence theorem, I can instead calculate the flux of f through the sphere of radius R. That might be easier because I can compute the dot product of f and the normal vector (which in this case is radial, so it's in the same direction as f) over the surface area.

But wait, what's f like on the surface of the sphere? Since the field is radial and falls off as 1/r², at r=R, the magnitude is f(r) = 1/R². So the vector field at any point on the sphere is (1/R²) r_hat, where r_hat is the radial unit vector.

The flux Φ is the integral of f · n dA over the surface. Since f is in the radial direction and n is also radial, their dot product is just the magnitude of f times the magnitude of n. The magnitude of the flux element is (1/R²) * 1 * dA. So the integral becomes (1/R²) times the surface area of the sphere.

The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So the flux is (1/R²) * 4πR² = 4π. Oh wait, that's option A.

Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the divergence of f first and then integrate. Let's think about that approach. In spherical coordinates, the
