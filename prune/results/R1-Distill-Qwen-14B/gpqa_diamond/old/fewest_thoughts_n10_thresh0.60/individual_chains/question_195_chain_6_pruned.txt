Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to figure out the maximum orbital period of a second planet that will show both transit and occultation events. Hmm, let's break this down.

Alright, the first planet has a radius of 1 Earth radius. It's orbiting a star with a radius 1.5 times the Sun. The orbital period is 3 days. The transit impact parameter is 0.2. The second planet is bigger—2.5 Earth radii. I need to find its maximum period so that both transit and occultation occur.

Wait, what's a transit and occultation? Oh right, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, blocking some light. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star, so the planet's light is blocked, causing a dip in brightness if the planet emits or reflects light. But for this problem, I think the key is about the orbital periods and orbital distance.

So, for a planet to transit, its orbital plane must be aligned so that it passes in front of the star. Similarly, for occultation, the planet must pass behind the star, so the alignment must also allow that. Both events require that the orbital plane is edge-on enough for both transits and occultations. Wait, actually, no—if the first planet transits, then the system's inclination is such that transits are possible. The second planet must be in the same orbital plane, so it should also transit. But the question is about both transit and occultation events being observed.

Wait, but occultation events (when the planet is behind the star) would only be detectable if the planet is larger than the star, right? No, wait, no. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star from our point of view. So, when the planet is transiting (in front), we see a dip due to blocking starlight. When it's occulting (behind), if the planet emits its own light (like reflected starlight or its own thermal emission), it would cause a dip as well. But for Earth-sized planets, this is hard to detect because their brightness is negligible. However, in exoplanet terms, occultation is often about when the planet is behind the star, causing a decrease in the combined light (since the planet's light isn't reaching us). But perhaps for this problem, it's more about the orbital mechanics.

Wait, perhaps the
