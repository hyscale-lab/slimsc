Alright, so I've got this physics problem to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about finding the energy of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) such that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. The nucleus X is Li with 3 neutrons. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to figure out what nucleus X actually is. Li is lithium, and if it has 3 neutrons, that means it's Li-6 because lithium typically has 3 protons. So Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons, making its mass number 6. So the nucleus is a Li-6 ion.

Next, the problem is about relativistic energy. The speed is given as 0.96 times the speed of light, which is pretty high. I remember that at such speeds, relativistic effects become significant, so I probably need to use the relativistic energy equations.

I think the key formula here is the total energy of a particle, which is gamma times the rest mass energy. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, right? The formula for gamma is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So I need to calculate gamma first. Let's plug in v = 0.96c. That would make v^2/c^2 equal to (0.96)^2. Let me compute that: 0.96 * 0.96. 0.96 squared is 0.9216. So 1 - 0.9216 is 0.0784. The square root of 0.0784 is... let's see, sqrt(0.0784). Hmm, 0.28 because 0.28 squared is 0.0784. So sqrt(0.0784) is 0.28. Then gamma is 1 / 0.28, which is approximately 3.5714.

Wait, but I should double-check that calculation. Let me compute 0.96 squared again. 0.96 * 0.96: 96 * 96 is 9216, so 0.96² is 0.9216. Subtracting from 1 gives 0.0784. Square root of 0.0784 is indeed 0.28 because 0.28 * 0.28 = 0.0784. So gamma is 1 / 0.28 = 3.57142857... approximately 3.5714.

So gamma is approximately 3.5714. Now, the total energy E is gamma multiplied by the rest mass energy. The rest mass energy is mc². So I need to find the rest mass of the Li-6 nucleus.

Wait, how do I get the rest mass of Li-6? I think the atomic mass of Li-6 is known, but maybe I should look it up or find an approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the mass of a proton and neutron, since the nucleus is made up of protons and neutrons.

Li-6 has 3 protons and 3 neutrons. So the mass of Li-6 is approximately 3*(mass of proton) + 3*(mass of neutron). But wait, the mass of a neutron is slightly higher than the proton. Let me recall the approximate masses: a proton is about 938 MeV/c², and a neutron is about 939.565 MeV/c².

So for Li-6, the total rest mass would be 3*(938) + 3*(939.565). Let me compute that.

3 * 938 = 2814 MeV.
3 * 939.565 = 28
