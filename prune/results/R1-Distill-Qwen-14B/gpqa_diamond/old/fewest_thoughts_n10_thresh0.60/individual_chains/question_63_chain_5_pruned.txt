Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about a diatomic molecule moving from one state to another when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, let's see. The molecule is modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, non-rigid rotor is a model that accounts for the bond length changes during rotation, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Anyway, the question is about the fundamental state and the next state with the lowest energy.

The problem gives me masses of the two atoms, X and Y. Mx is 20 amu and My is 2 amu. Oh right, amu stands for atomic mass unit. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. The angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. The options are about the momentum p of the photon.

Wait, the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it to switch to the next state with the lowest energy. So I think this is about a transition in both rotation and vibration, but I'm not entirely sure.

In the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized for both rotation and vibration. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which would correspond to the lowest vibrational state (n=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest energy would probably be the next vibrational state (n=1) with the same J, or the next rotational state (J=1) with the same n. But wait, the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is probably the (v=0, J=0) state. The next lowest energy would be either (v=1, J=0) or (v=0, J=1). But I'm a bit fuzzy on which transition would require less energy.

Wait, the energy levels for rotation are given by E_rot = B * J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. And for vibration, E_vib = (n + 1/2) h w. So the transition from v=0, J=0 to the next state could be either increasing v by 1 (v=1, J=0) or increasing J by 1 (v=0, J=1).

But which of these has a lower energy? Let me calculate both possible photon energies and see which one requires a smaller photon energy. Because the question is about
