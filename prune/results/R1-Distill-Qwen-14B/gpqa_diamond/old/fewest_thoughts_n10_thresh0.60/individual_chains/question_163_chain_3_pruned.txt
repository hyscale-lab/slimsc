Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this chemistry problem. Let me read it again. We need to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, determine the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required, and find the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A to D. Hmm.

First, I think I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 we're dealing with. Fe(OH)3 is iron(III) hydroxide. Its molar mass would be helpful. Iron has an atomic weight of about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3, that's 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol. Wait, wait, no: wait, Fe(OH)3 has the formula Fe(OH)3, so it's Fe^3+ and 3 OH^- ions. So the molar mass is Fe (55.85) + 3*(O (16) + H (1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol. Right.

So 0.1 grams is how many moles? Moles = mass / molar mass. So 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me calculate that more accurately: 0.1 / 106.85. Let me see, 106.85 times 0.0009 is 0.096165, so 0.000936 mol is approximately 9.36e-4 mol.

When Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a strong acid, the acid will react with the hydroxide. Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and will react with a strong acid. The reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ ions (from the strong acid) for complete dissolution.

So the moles of H+ needed are 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Now, the strong acid is monobasic, so it's providing one H+ per molecule. So the acid is like HCl, HNO3, etc. So the concentration of the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume needed (V) would be moles / concentration = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So that's the volume needed. But wait, is this the minimum volume needed? Because sometimes when you add the acid, the solution's volume might change, but I think the question is assuming that the total volume is 100 cm³, but wait, the volume of acid added plus the solution? Wait, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. Wait, no, the question says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the initial solution is 100 cm³. So when you add the acid, which is V cm³, the total volume becomes 100 + V. But wait, no, the problem says the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, that might not be correct. Wait, the problem says: "dissolve (at 25°С) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total volume is 100 cm³. So when we add V cm³ of acid, the solution's volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, but that can't be, because if you add V cm³ to 100 cm³, the total would be 100 + V. So perhaps the problem is that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, and the acid is added to make up the volume? No, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says that we
