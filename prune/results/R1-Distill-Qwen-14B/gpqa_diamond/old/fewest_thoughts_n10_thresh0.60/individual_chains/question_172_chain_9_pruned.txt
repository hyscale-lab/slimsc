Okay, so I have this problem about two stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I remember from my studies that the excitation of atoms in a star's atmosphere relates to the temperature. Oh right, this must be about the Boltzmann distribution.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming LTE, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds. So the Boltzmann factor applies here.

I think the Boltzmann equation relates the number of atoms in two energy levels. The ratio should be something like N2/N1 = exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) ), where E2 is higher than E1. Wait, in this case, which one is higher? The problem states that in star_1, the atoms are twice as excited. So if E is the higher energy level, then N_upper/N_lower would be higher when T is higher.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say the two energy levels are E_high and E_low. The excitation is higher in star_1, so in star_1, the number of atoms in E_high is twice that of star_2. So for star_1, N_upper = 2 * N_lower. But wait, no, the ratio is N_upper/N_lower. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the question says the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So the exc
