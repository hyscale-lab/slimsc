Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see. I need to figure out the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. The options are triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, or pentet. Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, very rigid with multiple bridgehead carbons. So 1,3-dibromo would have bromine atoms on two bridgehead carbons, probably across from each other.

Heating this with KOH in excess. KOH is a strong base, and when dibromides are treated with a base like KOH, usually an elimination reaction happens. So probably an E2 mechanism. For each Br, the base abstracts a proton that's anti to Br, leading to the formation of double bonds. But wait, adamantane is a fused ring structure, so elimination might form a more substituted double bond.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If the Brs are on adjacent bridgeheads? No, 1 and 3 would be next? Or perhaps in positions across the ring? Wait, the structure of adamantane is like four cyclohexane rings fused together. So positions 1 and 3 are adjacent? Or maybe not. Hmm, maybe the structure is such that when KOH is added, each Br is eliminated, but since it's 1,3, perhaps two double bonds form? Or maybe a more complex structure.

Wait, the product after KOH is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR shows 4.79 ppm for 2H, which is probably an OCH2 group or something else. Wait, 4.79 is usually around where you see -OCH2- or maybe a carbonyl adjacent to CH2. Also, IR at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl, maybe a ketone or ester or something. But wait, after KOH and elimination, perhaps it's a diol? No, because IR for OH would be around 3300, but here it's 1720, which is more like a carbonyl. So maybe elimination forms a ketone.

Oh wait, no. Let me think again. Heating 1,3-dibromoadam
