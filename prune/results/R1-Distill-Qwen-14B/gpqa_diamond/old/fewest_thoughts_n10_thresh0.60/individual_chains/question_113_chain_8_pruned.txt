Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, the question is about identifying an unknown compound based on its FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry data. The options are four different chemical formulas: C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, and C6H12O.

Let me go through each piece of data one by one.

First, the FTIR. It shows a very broad absorption peak around 3000 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region typically indicate O-H groups. Like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Wait, but carboxylic acids have a very broad and strong O-H stretch around there. Also, the other peaks: 1700 and 1650 cm^-1.

1700 is a strong peak, which could be a carbonyl group. So maybe a ketone or an ester or something like that. The 1650 cm^-1 is a bit lower, which might correspond to conjugated carbonyls, maybe like an aromatic ring or maybe an amide? But wait, the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, so maybe a vinyl group is present.

Wait, let me think. The 1700 peak is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone or ester. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyl, like an aromatic ketone or maybe an ester adjacent to a conjugated system. Or maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl.

Next, the NMR. They mentioned peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to a double bond, like in alkenes. So the compound has an alkene group. That suggests maybe a double bond somewhere in the structure, like an alkene.

The Mass Spec shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm. 45 is a common fragment. Let me think: what has a mass of 45? Well, that's the molecular weight of CH3O (3
