Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average value you'd expect to measure in an experiment. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so let me think this through.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? So the spin state is a column vector with components [3i, 4] or maybe [4, 3i]? Wait, no, the notation might be (3i, 4), so that would be the first component 3i and the second 4. So the state vector is:

ψ = [3i; 4]

I think the expectation value of an operator is given by the bra-ket notation: <ψ|Ô|ψ>, where Ô is the operator. Oh right, and for spin in the y-direction, the operator is σ_y multiplied by ħ/2. Because I remember the Pauli matrices are involved in spin operators, right? So the spin operator S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by the Pauli matrix σ_y.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So the operator S_y would be (ħ/2) times that. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

So to find the expectation value, I need to compute <ψ| S_y |ψ>.

Let me break it down. First, I'll write out the components. The state ψ is [3i; 4], so the bra vector is [3i*, 4*], which is [-3, 4], since the complex conjugate of 3i is -3 (because (3i)* = 3*(-i) = -3i, but wait, wait, wait: 3i is a purely imaginary number. So the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, right? So 3i* is -3i, but in the bra vector it's a row vector, so [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait, no, wait, the original vector is (3i, 4), so the components are 3i and 4. The conjugate transpose would make the first component 3i* and the second 4*, which
