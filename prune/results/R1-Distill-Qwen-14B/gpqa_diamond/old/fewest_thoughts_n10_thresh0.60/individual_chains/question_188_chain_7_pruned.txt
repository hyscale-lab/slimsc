Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what I remember.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that interplanar distance, d, is calculated using the formula derived from the Miller indices. The formula is d = a / √(h² + k² + l² + ... something) but wait, I think I might be mixing it up. Oh right, for a cubic system, the formula is d = a / √(h² + k² + l²). But wait, this is a rhombohedral crystal, which isn't cubic, right? So I think the formula for rhombohedral is a bit different.

Rhombohedral systems have all sides equal (a = b = c) but the angles between them are not 90 degrees. Oh, right, the formula for the interplanar distance in a rhombohedral system might involve the angles. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think.

I recall that in the case of a general crystal system, the interplanar distance is given by the formula involving the unit cell parameters and the Miller indices. For a rhombohedral system, since a = b = c and the angles are the same (α = β = γ), the formula might be a bit simplified.

Wait, I think the
