Okay, so I've got this ChIP-seq question here, and I need to figure out where the peaks are disappearing. Let's see what I remember about ChIP-seq and the fixing methods.

So, the question says that when they did ChIP-seq on a PFA-fixed sample with an antibody for IKAROS, they got some peaks. But when they used PFA+DSG fixation, those peaks disappeared. Hmm, I need to think about what this means.

I remember that PFA, which is paraformaldehyde, is a crosslinker. It fixes the proteins to DNA by forming covalent bonds. But wait, isn't there another crosslinker called DSG (disuccinimidoglycoluril)? I think DSG is a more efficient crosslinker, especially for proteins that are harder to fix because they're not as exposed. Oh, right, PFA is usually used for cell fixation before lysis, but sometimes if the proteins are not crosslinked efficiently, DSG is used in addition, especially for proteins like transcription factors that might be transiently associated or in a less accessible location.

Wait, but why would the peaks disappear when adding DSG? In the first case, they used PFA alone, and there were peaks. When they added DSG, the peaks went away. That suggests that the peaks in the PFA-only sample might be capturing non-specific bindings. Because if DSG is a stronger crosslinker, it might stabilize true interactions, whereas PFA might not hold some of the proteins as tightly, leading to noise.

So,
