Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right approach. Let's see what the question is about. Oh right, it's about identifying an unknown compound using its spectroscopic data. I remember that FTIR, NMR, and Mass Spectrometry are important tools for this.

The question gives me the data: FTIR shows a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which I think is usually O-H stretching. Wait, but wait, the broad peak is around 3000, so that could be either an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Hmm, but then it also mentions two other strong peaks at 1700 and 1650. Those are in the range for carbonyl groups, like C=O. 1700 is maybe an ester or ketone, and 1650 could be an aromatic ring with conjugated carbonyls, like an aromatic ester or something with conjugated double bonds.

In the 1H NMR, there are peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones attached to double bonds, so that suggests the compound has a double bond. Like maybe a substituted ethylene or something more complex like a styrene group.

The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z 45. I'm trying to think what that could be. The molecular ion peak itself might not be given, but the fragment at 45... Let me think: 45 is a common mass for certain functional groups. Like, maybe a methyl group attached to an oxygen? Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of something like (CH3)2O, but wait, no, that's 32. Oh, wait, maybe CH3CO (which is 43?), no. Or maybe the fragment is a ketone or an ester group. Another thought: 45 is the molecular weight of C3H7O? Or wait, 45 could be the mass of a methoxy group attached to something else. Or perhaps the fragment is a CH2=CH group losing something. Alternatively, maybe the fragment comes from an acetyl group. Or wait, another approach: 45 could be the mass of a carbonyl-containing group. Let's calculate the possible fragments. For example, if the compound has an ester group, the ester can break into the acid and alcohol parts. Alternatively, a ketone might not break into 45, but an ester could.

Now, looking at the possible chemical formulas: the options are C6H12O, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O2. So the degrees of unsaturation might help. The formula for degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or X, it's (2C +2 - H)/2. Let's compute for each option.

Option A: C6H12O2. So C=6, H=12. So (2*6 +2 -12)/
