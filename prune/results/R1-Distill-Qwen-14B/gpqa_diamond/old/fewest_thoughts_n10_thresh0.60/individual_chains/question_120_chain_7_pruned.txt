Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question says that stars are uniformly distributed, and I need to find how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with the parallax itself. The options are various inverse powers of parallax.

Wait, parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. I remember that parallax (p) is inversely proportional to distance (d), like p = 1/d, but wait, no, actually it's p = 1/d in parsecs. So the bigger the distance, the smaller the parallax.

The question is about the number of stars per unit parallax range. So, how does N depend on plx? Let me think about the distribution. If the stars are uniformly distributed in space, that probably means their number density is constant. So maybe the number of stars in a certain volume depends on the size of that volume.

But wait, we're considering a range of parallax. Parallax is related to distance, so a change in parallax corresponds to a change in distance. So if I have a unit change in parallax (like from plx to plx + dplx), what does that mean for the distance? Since plx is 1/d, a small change in plx would correspond to a certain change in d.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of differential number of stars. Let's say we're considering a thin shell at distance d, with thickness dd. The volume of that shell is approximately 4πd² dd. If the number density of stars is n (constant), then the number of stars in that shell would be n * 4πd² dd.

But parallax p is 1/d, so d = 1/p. Let me substitute that. So, d = 1/p → dd = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, but since p is decreasing as d increases, when d increases, p decreases. So when considering a small increase in p (dp positive), that would correspond to a decrease in d. Hmm, but I think I should take absolute values to avoid confusion.

So, substituting d =1/p, the number of stars in a shell would be n
