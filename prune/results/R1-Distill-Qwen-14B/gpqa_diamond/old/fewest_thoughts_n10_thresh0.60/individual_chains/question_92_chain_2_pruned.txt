Okay, let me try to figure out this enthalpy of formation problem. Hmm, so the compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a bit complex, but I think I can break it down.

Wait, enthalpy of formation is the change when 1 mole of a substance is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, I need to calculate the formation enthalpy using bond energies.

The formula I remember is ΔH°f = [sum of bond energies of reactants] - [sum of bond energies of products]. But wait, wait. No, wait. Actually, it's the other way around. The products are the bonds formed, and the reactants are the bonds broken. So, the enthalpy of formation is calculated by considering the energy required to break bonds in the reactants and the energy released when forming bonds in the products.

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So, for a hydrocarbon, that would be from carbon and hydrogen.

So, for the formation of a molecule like this, we can think of it as all the bonds in the molecule being formed from their respective atoms. So, I need to calculate the sum of all the bond energies in the molecule and then subtract the sum of the bond energies of the elements (
