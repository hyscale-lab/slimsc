Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's think through this step by step.

The problem states that there are two astronauts. The first has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c in the positive x-direction. The second has a mass of 3m and is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed. Oh right, in special relativity, you can't just subtract their velocities like you would in Newtonian mechanics. Because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you have to use the relativistic velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1v2)/c²), but wait, wait, wait—I should double-check that. Oh right, if both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed would be (v1 - v2)/(1 + (v1v2)/(c²))? No, wait, no. Wait, the formula for the relative speed when moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - v1v2/c²) when they're moving in opposite directions, but wait no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let me get this straight. If one object is moving at speed u in the lab frame, and another at speed v in
