Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure I understand the setup. The glass is moving towards the observer, but the light beam is also moving in the same direction as the glass. So the glass is moving, say, to the right, and the light is moving to the right within the glass. But the glass is moving towards the observer, which I think means the observer is to the left of the direction the glass is moving. Hmm, maybe I should draw a diagram.

So in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v. The light beam is inside this glass, moving in the same direction as the glass. So from the lab's point of view, how fast is the light going?

I remember that the speed of light in a medium is v = c/n, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. So normally, in the glass, the speed is 1/n because c is 1 here. But wait, but the glass itself is moving. So does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light inside it as observed from the lab?

I think about Galilean relativity here. If you're moving along with
