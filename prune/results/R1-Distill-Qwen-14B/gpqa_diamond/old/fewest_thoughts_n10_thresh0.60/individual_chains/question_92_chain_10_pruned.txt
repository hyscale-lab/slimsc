Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That looks like a pretty complex alkene structure with multiple double bonds and substituents. Oh wait, actually, let me count the double bonds. I think there are two double bonds in this molecule. Let me see: the first part is (CH3)2C=CH-, which is one double bond, and then later there's another CH=C(CH3)2. So that's two double bonds in total. So the molecule has two double bonds.

The question gives me some bond energies. Enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. I remember that the enthalpy of atomization is the energy required to break a bond in an element and form atoms. So for carbon, it's the energy to break a C-C bond into two C atoms.

The bond energies given are:
- H-H: 100 kJ/mol
- C-C: 200 kJ/mol
- C=C: 300 kJ/mol
- C-H: 400 kJ/mol

Wait, but wait. The problem is asking for the enthalpy of formation. Oh right, the enthalpy of formation is the change in enthalpy when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So the formula is:

ΔHf° = [Sum of bond energies of bonds broken in reactants] - [Sum of bond energies of bonds formed in products]

But wait, when you form a molecule from elements, you have to consider all the bonds broken in the reactants (the elements) and all the bonds formed in the product.

Wait, but in this case, the product is the given molecule. So the reactants would be carbon (in its standard state, which is graphite or diamond, but probably graphite) and hydrogen in H2 gas.

So, the approach should be: calculate the total bond energies of all the bonds broken in the elements (C and H2), subtract the total bond energies of all the bonds formed in the product molecule.

Wait, but wait. I think another way to think about
