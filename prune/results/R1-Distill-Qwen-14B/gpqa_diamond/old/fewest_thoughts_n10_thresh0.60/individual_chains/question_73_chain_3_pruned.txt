Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about. 

The problem says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. They're moving at relativistic speeds of 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each giving a possible relative speed and energy.

Hmm, right, I remember that when dealing with relative velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like in classical mechanics. Oh wait, right, you have to use the velocity addition formula from special relativity. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (u*v)/c²), but wait, actually I think it's (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)), but I might be mixing up the signs. Wait, no, let me get that straight. Because if both are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference divided by 1 minus the product of their speeds over c squared.

Wait, but wait. Oh! Because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed that one sees the other moving at would be (v1 - v2) divided by [1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)]. Let me make sure I get the formula right. So, if astronaut A is moving at v1
