Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure out what's going on. Let me think through it step by step.

The question is about a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except for two peaks that are from the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So each is about half the height, maybe? And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Hmm, wait. If it's the same proton, then why two peaks? Spin-spin coupling usually splits a peak into multiple, but if it's the same proton, maybe it's something else like a diastereotopic situation?

Then the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass, which matches the expected molecule. So it's not a different compound, but two forms of the same mass. Since the mass is the same and the retention times are different, perhaps they're diastereomers or enantiomers. But wait, enantiomers are mirror images, so in some chromatography methods, they might not separate. But if the LC-MS is showing two peaks, maybe it's a chiral column? Or perhaps the method separates them.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different. But the mass spec says same mass, so A is probably not right.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers have same mass, same retention time on some columns but not all. If the LC-MS shows two peaks, perhaps the column is chiral and can separate enantiomers. But wait, the question says the LC-MS analysis was done at elevated temperature. I'm not sure if that affects chiral separation. Also, in NMR, enantiomers would look the same because the NMR can't distinguish them unless the sample is chiral and has a chiral environment. But if the molecule itself is achiral, then the NMR wouldn't split. Alternatively, if the molecule is chiral, you might see some splitting, but I'm not sure how that would result in two peaks for the same alpha proton. Maybe if it's a diastereomer, but that's another option.

Option C
