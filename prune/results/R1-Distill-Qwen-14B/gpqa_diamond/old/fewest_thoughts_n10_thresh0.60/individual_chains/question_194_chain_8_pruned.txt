Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Hmm, partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right?

Wait, each spin is either +1 or -1. So for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible states. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. But calculating each state's energy and then summing their Boltzmann factors might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the number of states with a particular energy and then compute the partition function based on that. Let's think about how the energy depends on the spins.

The energy E is proportional to the sum of the products of each pair. Let me denote the sum as S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J * S. Therefore, each state contributes a factor of exp(β J S), because E is negative that, so -β E is β J S.

Wait, because E = -J S, so β E = -β J S, so exp(-β E) is exp(β J S). Or wait, no: the Boltzmann factor is exp(-β E), so substituting E gives exp( J β
