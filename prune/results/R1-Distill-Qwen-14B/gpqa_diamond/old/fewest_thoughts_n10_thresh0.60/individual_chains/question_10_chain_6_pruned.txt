Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking which exoplanet has the highest density. The options are a, b, c, d. The choices given are letters A to D, each corresponding to one of the options a-d.

Let me read the question again. Each option describes a planet's mass and radius or some other characteristic.

Option a) is an Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So same as Earth. I know Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, which is average for rocky planets.

Option b) has 2 Earth masses and a density of 5.5 g/cm³. Wait, if the density is given, then maybe we don't need to calculate. But I'm not sure if that's the correct way to approach it. Wait, no. Because density is mass divided by volume. So if the planet has more mass but same density, its volume must be bigger. Because density is mass/volume. So if density is same as Earth, and mass is 2 Earth masses, then the volume would be 2 times that of Earth. Since volume scales with radius cubed, the radius would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But the question isn't about radius; it's about density, so in this case, the density is 5.5 g/cm³, same as Earth. So how does this compare to the other options?

Option c) is a planet with same composition as
