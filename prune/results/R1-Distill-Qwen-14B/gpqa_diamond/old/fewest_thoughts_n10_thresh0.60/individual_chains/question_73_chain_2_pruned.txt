Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things are a bit different from classical mechanics. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the problem states that there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I need to find two things: the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the speeds like in classical mechanics. Oh right! I think the formula for adding velocities in relativity is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/(c²)). But wait, are they moving in the same direction? Yes, both positive x, so one's speed is higher than the other. So the relative speed would be the difference divided by that factor.

Let me write down the formula. The relative speed u would be (v1 - v2) / (1 - (v1*v2)/(c^2)). So plugging in the numbers: v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c. So numerator is 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²) )= 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) )= 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So u = (0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c, which is about 0.14c. So looking at the options, I see option C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So the relative speed part would narrow it down to C or D.

Now, what about the total energy? The system's energy would be the sum of each astronaut's relativistic energy. Relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c), calculate gamma1:

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2/c² ) = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) ) = 1/sqrt(0.64) )= 1/0.8= 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 mc².

Wait, wait, actually, it's 2m multiplied by gamma1, so 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m, so E1 = 2.5 m c².

Wait no, wait: wait, no, the astronaut's mass is 2m, so their energy is gamma * (2m) c². So 2m * gamma1 * c². So yeah, that's 2.5
