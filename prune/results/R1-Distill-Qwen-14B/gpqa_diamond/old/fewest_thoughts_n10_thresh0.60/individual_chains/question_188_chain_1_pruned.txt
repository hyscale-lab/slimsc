Okay, so I've got this problem about a rhombohedral crystal, and I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distances are important in crystallography, especially when dealing with X-ray diffraction. But wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's one where all the edges are the same length, but the angles between them aren't necessarily 90 degrees. In this case, all angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Oh, so it's a special case where the lattice is rhombohedral with all angles equal.

The interatomic distance is given as 10 angstroms. Wait, interatomic distance usually refers to the distance between adjacent atoms along the lattice vectors. So I think that would be the edge length 'a' of the rhombohedral unit cell. So a = 10 angstroms.

The question is about the (111) plane. I need to find the interplanar distance, which is the distance between adjacent planes in that direction. The formula for interplanar distance d_{hkl} is given by d = a/(sqrt(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2lh cos γ)) ), but wait, I'm mixing up the formula. Oh wait, I think the general formula when the unit cell isn't cubic is more complicated. Alternatively, when all sides are equal and angles
