Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition state, which is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. The states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. We need to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz + 5σx.

Hmm, okay. I remember that the expectation value of an operator in a given state is calculated using the formula ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So in this case, O is 10σz +5σx.

Wait, but σz and σx are the Pauli matrices. Right, Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices. For a spin-1/2 particle, the states |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ correspond to eigenstates of σz. So |↑⟩ would be [1; 0] and |↓⟩ would be [0; 1], if we write them as column vectors.

Wait, but the state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me check if that's normalized. So the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. The squares would be (0.5)^2 = 0.25 and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, which is 0.75. Adding these gives 1, so it's normalized. Good.

So the state ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) in the |↑⟩, |↓⟩ basis.

Now, to find the expectation value of 10σz +5σx, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. Because expectation values are linear, right? So I can calculate each expectation separately and add them multiplied by their coefficients.

Let's first find ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, this should be straightforward. The eigenvalues for σz when applied to |↑⟩ is +1 and for |↓⟩ is -1.

So ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ would be |0.5|^2 *
