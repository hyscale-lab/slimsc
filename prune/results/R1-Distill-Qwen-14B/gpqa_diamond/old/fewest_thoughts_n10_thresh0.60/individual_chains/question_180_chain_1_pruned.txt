Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let's try to break it down step by step. Hmm, it's about electric potential energy in an isolated system of charges. Alright, I remember from my classes that electric potential energy between point charges has a specific formula.

The problem says there are 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. Since e is the elementary charge, that's 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge is 2 * 1.602e-19 = 3.204e-19 C.

Twelve of these charges are constrained to stay at 2 meters from a point P. The thirteenth charge is fixed at P. Wait, so the 13th is at P, and the other 12 are each 2 meters away from P. So the setup must be that the 13th is at the center, and the others are on the surface of a sphere with radius 2 meters around P.

The question asks for the minimum energy of the system. I think the minimum energy would correspond to the most stable configuration, but in this case, since the charges are fixed except for the 13th, which is fixed as well. Wait, no, the 12 are fixed at 2 m, and the 13th is fixed at P. So all charges are fixed, so the system can't move. Hmm, but wait, the potential energy is based on their arrangement. But here, their positions are fixed, so maybe we're just calculating the potential energy of this configuration.

Wait, but the problem says "minimum energy." Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Perhaps the 12 charges are arranged in a way that's fixed, but perhaps the way they're arranged affects the potential energy. But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the 12 charges are all at the same point 2 meters from P, but that's not possible because they can't all be at the same point if they have the same charge (like if they repel). Oh wait, but the problem states they are constrained to stay at 2m from P. So perhaps they're fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P. But their exact positions on the sphere might not matter for calculating the potential energy with the 13th charge. Because electric potential energy is a scalar quantity, depending
