Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let's see. The question gives a Lagrangian that describes the interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of the boson X is 6 GeV, and I need to find out which decay channels are kinematically allowed at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Hmm, wait, that might not be right. Oh wait, actually, the way it's written might be a typo. Because in the standard notation, the interaction term for a Yukawa coupling would be something like λ ψ̄ ψ X, right? So maybe it's -λ f ψ_f (ῡ + X) ψ_f? Or perhaps it's more like λ ψ_f^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Hmm, but I think the key point is that X couples to fermions, so the decay of X would produce a pair of those fermions.

Wait, but in the Lagrangian, I think the term would be something like L_int = λ ψ_f^dagger X ψ_f. Because X is a boson, so the interaction term would involve the fermions ψ_f and the boson X. So the interaction term is proportional to ψ† X ψ, which means that X can decay into two fermions of the same type.

So the boson X can decay into pairs of fermions. The possible decay products are pairs like ff-bar, where f is a fermion. But the mass of X is 6 GeV, so the decay products must each have a mass less than 3 GeV each because the total mass of the decay products cannot exceed the mass of the parent particle.

Wait, wait, actually, the mass of the fermion pair must be less than the mass of X. Each fermion has a rest mass, so the sum of their masses must be less than X's mass. But since they're produced as a pair, each has mass m, so 2m ≤ M_X.
