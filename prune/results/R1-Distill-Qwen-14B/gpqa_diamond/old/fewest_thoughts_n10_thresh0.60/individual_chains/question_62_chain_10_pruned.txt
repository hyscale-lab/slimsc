Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using the right sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

First, I need to figure out what the target molecule looks like. The name suggests it's a cyclohexane ring attached to a methyl group, which itself is attached to both a hydroxyl group (OH) and another cyclohexyl group. Additionally, there's a carbonyl group (carbaldehyde) on the cyclohexane.

Wait, wait. Let me visualize it. The main structure is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a CH₂CHO group attached. But the substituent on the cyclohexane is more complicated: it's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, it's like a substituent where a methyl group is attached to both a cyclohexyl group and an OH group. So, the structure is cyclohexyl-C(OH)-CH₂-cyclohexanecarbaldehyde? Or wait, maybe the substituent is attached to the cyclohexane at position 1, so the substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the synthesis steps. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond attached). So, the structure is cyclohexane-C≡CH.

I need to find the pathway to get to the target molecule. Let's think about possible reactions.

So, ethynylcyclohexane: maybe I can perform some kind of functional group transformation. One approach might be to convert the triple bond into something else. For example, hydrogenation could add hydrogen across the triple bond. But wait, under different conditions, hydrogenation can give either cis (if done with Lindlar catalyst) or trans (if using Na/NH3) addition.

Alternatively, another approach is to perform a hydration of the alkyne. But the problem is,
