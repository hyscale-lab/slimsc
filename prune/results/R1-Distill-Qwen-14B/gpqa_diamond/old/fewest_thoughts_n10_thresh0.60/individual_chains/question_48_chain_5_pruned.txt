Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll take it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question involves a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone. I need to track the changes through each step and then find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are in the final product, product 4.

First, let's break down each reaction step by step.

Step 1: Cyclohexanone is treated with bromine, forming product 1. Hmm. I remember that cyclohexanone has a ketone group. When ketones react with bromine, it's typically a bromination reaction. Wait, no, wait. Bromine in what conditions? Oh, wait, I think when ketones are treated with bromine, it's a dihydroxylation if it's an alkene. But wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Oh, wait no, wait a second. Another possibility is that bromine could add to the carbonyl group. Wait, but cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe bromine is adding via some other mechanism.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts bromination? No, because cyclohexanone is a ketone and not an aromatic ring. Oh wait, perhaps it's a bromination of the carbonyl group. Wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have any hydrogen on the carbonyl, because the carbonyl is a C=O. So maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another thought. Maybe it's a nucleophilic addition. Wait, but bromine as Br2—could it be adding across the carbonyl group? Oh wait, no. Oh, wait, maybe it's a halogenation via some other pathway. Alternatively, perhaps it's an enolate formation. Wait, but when you treat a ketone with bromine, considering it's a dienophile perhaps? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Maybe cyclohexanone under certain conditions reacts with bromine. Oh! Wait a second. I think I remember that when a ketone is treated with an excess of bromine, it undergoes a reaction where the carbonyl group is converted into a geminal dibromide. So, cyclohexanone (which is (CH2)5CO) would react with Br2 to form (CH2)5C(OBr)2. But wait, wait—
