Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem presents two reactions and asks which reagents (A and B) are suitable for each step. The options are given as A, B, C, or D. 

First, let's break down the reactions.

Reaction 1: Butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO) reacts with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. 

Reaction 2: The product of Reaction 1, which is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile, reacts with reagent B (H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid.

So I need to figure out what reagents A and B are. The options are combinations of H3O+ (probably sulfuric acid as a catalyst?), NaHSO3 (sodium bisulfite?), and either HCl or acetic acid as B.

Let me think about each reaction.

Starting with Reaction 1. Butan-2-one reacting with NaCN. I remember that ketones can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. NaCN is a source of cyanide ions, which are good nucleophiles. So, perhaps this is a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, but the product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw the structures.

Butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. The product would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. Wait, so the cyanide has added to the carbonyl. So the carbonyl becomes a cyanide group, and the oxygen becomes hydroxide. So that's an addition of CN- to the ketone, followed by protonation?

Wait, but in the product, the oxygen is -OH. So in the mechanism, the ketone is attacked by the cyanide nucleophile, adding to the carbonyl carbon. Then, the oxygen has a negative charge, which would pick up a proton. But in the presence of what reagent?

Wait, if the reaction is done in an acidic condition, maybe. Because sometimes in nucleophilic additions, especially with ketones, you might need some acid catalysis.

So for the first reaction
