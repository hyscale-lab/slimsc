Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

So, the setup is an isolated system of 13 identical particles, each with charge 2e. All right, e is the elementary charge, which is about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So each charge here is 2 times that, so 3.204 x 10^-19 C each.

Now, out of these 13 charges, 12 are constrained to stay at a distance of 2 meters from a point P. The 13th charge is fixed at point P. The question is asking for the minimum energy of this system, correct to three decimal places.

Hmm, energy in an electrostatic system usually refers to the electrostatic potential energy. Right, because we're dealing with charges and their interactions. So I need to calculate the potential energy of this system.

Wait, but how do you calculate the potential energy for a system of multiple charges? I remember that the formula for the potential energy (U) between two point charges is U = k * (q1 * q2) / r, where k is Coulomb's constant, which is approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C².

But in a system with multiple charges, the total potential energy is the sum of the potential energies of each pair of charges. Oh right, because each pair contributes to the total energy. So for each charge, I need to find every other charge it interacts with and sum all those contributions.

Wait, but the problem says the system is isolated, so maybe we don't have to worry about external fields or anything. But since all the charges are either at point P or at 2 meters from P, I need to figure out all the pairwise interactions.

Let me break it down. There are 13 charges in total, 12 at 2m from P, and the 13th is at P. So let's call the charge at P as Q, and each of the other 12 as q.

Each of the 12 charges at 2m will interact with the charge at P. So each of these 12 q's will have a potential energy due to their interaction with Q.

Additionally, the 12 charges at 2m are all at the same distance from P, but are they fixed in space relative to each other? Or are they allowed to move as long as they stay 2m from P? The question says 12 are constrained to stay at 2m, so their positions relative to each other might not matter because they're fixed in that configuration. So their mutual interactions would contribute to the potential energy as well.

Wait, but if they're all fixed on a sphere of radius 2m around P, their mutual distances vary. Calculating each pair among them would be complicated. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is assuming that all the 12 are at the same distance from each other? Or maybe it's a simpler case.

Wait, the problem says "the minimum energy of this system". To minimize the potential energy, the configuration would depend on whether the charges are positive or negative. Wait, wait, the charges are 2e each. What's the sign
