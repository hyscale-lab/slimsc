Okay, so I've got this problem about two planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my planetary science, but let's try to think this through.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature is the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium. It depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh wait, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), right? But wait, albedo is the same for both planets here, so that part cancels out. So I don't need to worry about albedo in the ratio.

The star's properties are given: mass 1.5 solar, radius 1.2 solar, Teff 6300 K. Both planets have circular orbits, which means their distance from the star is constant. But the problem is, I don't know the actual distances of the planets. Wait, but maybe the RV (radial velocity) method gives us information about the planet's mass and the star's velocity. Oh, and the transit method gives the radius.

Wait, the question gives us two different shifts in the forbidden line [OI] at 6300 Å. Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 Å, and Planet2 up to 0.04 Å. Oh, wait, I think the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which relates to the star's velocity due to the planet's gravitational pull. The formula for the Doppler shift is something like v = (lambda shift) / lambda_0 * c, but I'm a bit confused about the exact formula.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is usually delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. But wait, the problem mentions periodic shifts in the forbidden line. Hmm, wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star towards and away from us due to the planet's orbit. So the velocity amplitude (K) is related to the Doppler shift.

Alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by ( (2π G) / (P) )^(1/3) ) * (M_planet sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) ). But since the orbits are circular (e=0), and M_planet << M_star, it simplifies to K ≈ ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/1) )? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, I've heard that K is proportional to (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) ), but again, not certain.

Wait, but maybe the given Doppler shifts can be related to the mass and the orbital period. But wait, the problem doesn't give the orbital periods of the planets. Oh wait, right. The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance (orbital period and distance are linked through Kepler's third law). So maybe I can find the ratio of the orbital distances based on the RV data.

Wait, the RV shift is related to the star's velocity. The velocity of the star (v) is given by (M_planet / M_star) * v_planet. But I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) * (2π) ) ) )^(1/3) )

But since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, and e=0, this simplifies. Let's see the approximation.

K ≈ (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )

Wait, but I don't have the periods. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities of the two stars due to their respective planets.

Wait, the problem gives the shifts as 0.03 Å and 0.04 Å. So the velocity of the star can be found using the Doppler shift formula. The shift is delta_lambda, so delta_lambda / lambda = v / c. So v = c * (delta_lambda / lambda).

Wait, but the forbidden line is at 6300 Å. So for Planet1, delta_lambda is 0.03 Å, so v1 = c * (0.03 / 6300). Similarly, v2 = c * (0.04 / 6300). So the velocity semi-amplitude K for each planet is given by these values.

Wait, but wait, the RV method gives the velocity of the star, which is K. So K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) P^(1/3) ), which I think I saw somewhere. Alternatively, maybe K depends on (M_planet) * sin i / (M_star^(1/3) ) * (1 / sqrt(1-e²) ) ) etc. But since both planets are orbiting the same star, and the problem doesn't mention inclination, perhaps we can assume sin i is the same for both, and e=0 for both. So for the purposes of the ratio, sin i and e won't affect the ratio.

So, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by v = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(2/3) * (1 - e²)^(1/2) * P^(1/3) ) )

But since M_planet << M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / (M_star^(2/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i / (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of Kepler's third law. The period P is related to the semi-major axis a by P² = (4π² G) / (M_star) * a³. Since M_star is given (1.5 solar masses), the period is related to a.

But without knowing the periods, maybe I can find the ratio of the velocities (from RV data) and then relate that to the ratio of the mass and the cube root of the period, or something.

Wait, let's think about the velocities. K is the velocity of the star due to the planet. From the RV semi-amplitude, K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) ), because from Kepler's law, P^2 = (4π² a^3)/(G M_star), so a^3 = G M_star P²/(4π²). So a = [ (G M_star P²)/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3) )

Putting that into the expression for K.

Alternatively, I know that the velocity of the star is related to the planet's orbit. The star's velocity is v = (2 π a) / P * (M_planet / (M_star + M_planet)) ). Since M_planet is much smaller than M_star, it's approximately (2 π a) / P * (M_planet / M_star).

But from Kepler's third law, a³ = G (M_star + M_planet) P²/(4 π²). Again, M_planet can be neglected, so a³ ≈ G M_star P²/(4 π²). So a = [ G M_star P²/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting a into v:

v ≈ (2 π [ G M_star P²/(4 π²) ]^(1/3 ) ) / P ) * (M_planet / M_star )

Simplify this:

v = (2 π) / P ) * [ G M_star P²/(4 π²) ) ]^(1/3 ) * (M_planet / M_star )

Let me compute the exponents:

Take the cube root of [ G M_star P²/(4 π²) ]:

= [ G M_star ]^(1/3) * [ P² ]^(1/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3 )

So, simplifying:

v ≈ (2 π / P ) * [ G M_star ]^(1/3) * P^(2/3) / (4 π²)^(1/3) ) * (M_planet / M_star )

Let me collect the terms:

The denominator is (4 π²)^(1/3) = (2^2 π^2 )^(1/3 ) = 2^(2/3) π^(2/3 )

The numerator has (2 π) * [ G M_star ]^(1/3 ) * P^(2/3) * (M_planet / M_star )

So substituting all:

v = [ (2 π) * ( G M_star )^(1/3 ) * P^(2/3) * M_planet ) ] / [ P * M_star * 2^(2/3) π^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify the terms:

2 π in numerator, 2^(2/3) in denominator.

2 π / 2^(2/3) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) * π = 2^(1/3) π.

Similarly, M_planet remains, M_star in denominator is M_star^(1) from the denominator. The numerator has M_star^(1/3 ), so M_star^(1/3) / M_star = M_star^(-2/3 )

P^(2/3) in numerator, P in denominator: P^(2/3 - 1) = P^(-1/3 )

So putting it all together:

v = [ 2^(1/3) π * M_planet * G^(1/3) * M_star^( -2/3 ) * P^(-1/3) ) ] / 1

Hmm, perhaps that's not the most straightforward approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the relation between the RV velocities and the planet's mass and orbital period.

Wait, alternatively, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) * ( (2π) / (P) ) )^(1/3 )

But because M_planet is much smaller than M_star, this simplifies to K ≈ ( ( G M_planet ) / M_star )^(1/3 ) * ( 2π / P )^(1/3 )

So, K = ( ( G M_planet )/( M_star ) )^(1/3 ) * (2 π / P )^(1/3 )

Let me write that as K = [ ( G M_planet )/( M_star ) * ( 2 π / P ) ]^(1/3 )

But from Kepler's third law, P² = (4 π² a³)/( G M_star )

So P = sqrt( (4 π² a^3 ) / (G M_star) ) )

Thus, 1/P = (G M_star )^(1/2) )/( 2 π a^(3/2) )^(1/2) ) ) Hmm, perhaps it's better to express 2π/P in terms of a.

Wait, from P² = (4 π² a³)/(G M_star ), rearranging, 2π/P = (2 π) * (G M_star )^(1/2) )/( 2 π a^(3/2 )) ) )

Wait, let me compute 2π / P:

P = (4 π² a^3 / (G M_star ))^(1/2 )

So 1/P = (G M_star )^(1/2) )/( 2 π a^(3/2) ) )

Multiply by 2 π: 2 π / P = (G M_star )^(1/2) )/( a^(3/2) )

So, 2π/(P) = (G M_star )^(1/2) )/( a^(3/2) )

Putting this into the K equation:

K = [ ( G M_planet / M_star ) * (G M_star )^(1/2) / a^(3/2) ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify the terms inside the cube root:

G M_planet / M_star * (G M_star )^(1/2) ) = G^(3/2) M_planet M_star^(-1 + 1/2 ) ) 

Wait, M_star in the denominator is M_star^1. Then, (G M_star )^(1/2 ) is G^(1/2) M_star^(1/2 ). So when multiplied by (G M_planet ) / M_star, which is G * M_planet / M_star, the total is:

G * M_planet / M_star * G^½ M_star^½ = G^(3/2) M_planet M_star^(-1/2 )

So the expression inside the cube root becomes:

[ G^(3/2) M_planet M_star^(-1/2) ) ] / a^(3/2 )

So K = [ ( G^(3/2) M_planet M_star^(-1/2 ) ) / a^(3/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Which simplifies to:

K = [ G^(3/2) ]^(1/3 ) * [ M_planet ]^(1/3 ) * [ M_star^(-1/2 ) ]^(1/3 ) * [ a^(-3/2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplifying exponents:

G^(1/2 ), M_planet^(1/3 ), M_star^(-1/6 ), a^(-1/2 )

So,

K = G^(1/2 ) * M_planet^(1/3 ) * M_star^(-1/6 ) * a^(-1/2 )

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Maybe I should approach this differently. Since both planets are orbiting the same star, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) a^(1/2) ) )

Wait, because a is the semi-major axis, and from Kepler's law, a³ is proportional to P² M_star. But maybe I can relate a to the RV velocity.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the Doppler shifts given. The problem says that the shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So the RV velocities are proportional to these shifts, assuming the same line wavelength.

So, v1 = 0.03 / 6300 * c, and v2 = 0.04 / 6300 * c. So v2 is larger than v1.

But since the RV velocity K is proportional to (M_planet) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) a^(1/2) )

Wait, but from earlier, K is proportional to M_planet / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/3) )

Hmm, let me write that as K ∝ (M_p) / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's third law, a^3 ∝ (M_star * P^2 )/( (M_star + M_p) )

Since M_p is much less than M_star, a^3 ∝ M_star P². So a ∝ ( M_star )^(1/3) P^(2/3 )

So a^(1/2 ) ∝ ( M_star )^(1/6 ) P^(1/3 )

Substituting back into K:

K ∝ M_p / ( ( M_star^(1/6 ) P^(1/3) ) * M_star^(1/3) ) )

Simplify denominator:

M_star^(1/6 + 1/3 ) = M_star^(1/2 )

So K ∝ M_p / ( M_star^(1/2 ) P^(1/3) )

But from Kepler's law, P² ∝ a^3 / M_star. So P ∝ a^(3/2) / M_star^(1/2 )

Wait, perhaps I can substitute P into the K equation.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider the ratio of the velocities K1 and K2.

Let me denote the RV velocities as K1 and K2 for Planet1 and Planet2.

The shifts are 0.03 and 0.04 Å. So K1 = (0.03 /6300 ) * c, K2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * c.

So K2/K1 = 0.04 / 0.03 ≈ 1.333.

So K2 = (4/3) K1.

But from the earlier expression, K ∝ (M_p) / ( a^(1/2) M_star^(1/3) )

So K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2^(1/2) / a1^(1/2) ) ) * ( M_star^(1/3 ) / M_star^(1/3 ) )

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have K1/K2 = 3/4 (since K2/K1 is 4/3).

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Wait, because Planet1 has mass 7 Earth masses, Planet2 has 5 Earth masses. So M_p1 =7, M_p2=5.

So,

3/4 = (7/5 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Let me rearrange:

sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = (3/4 ) * (5/7 ) ) = (15/28 ) ≈ 0.5357

So,

a2 / a1 = (15/28 )^2 ≈ (225/784 ) ≈ 0.2869

So a2 is about 0.2869 * a1.

So the ratio a1/a2 ≈ 1/0.2869 ≈ 3.483.

So Planet1 is about 3.5 times farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but I need the ratio of equilibrium temperatures. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Since albedo is same for both, that factor cancels out when taking the ratio. So,

(T_eq1 / T_eq2 ) = sqrt( (a2) / (a1) ) * sqrt( R_star / R_star ) )

Wait, because the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ), so when taking the ratio, T_eq1/T_eq2 = sqrt( (a2)/(a1) ) * (R_star same, so 1 )

Wait, no, wait: T_eq is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(a) ), so for each planet, T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) )

But when taking the ratio T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( ( R_star/(2 a1) ) / ( R_star/(2 a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We found that a2/a1 ≈ 0.2869, so sqrt(0.2869 ) ≈ 0.5357.

So T_eq1 / T_eq2 ≈ 0.5357, which is approximately 0.536. So the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is about 0.536 times that of Planet2.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If a2 is smaller than a1, then Planet2 is closer to the star, so its equilibrium temperature should be higher than Planet1.

So, T_eq1 < T_eq2, which matches the ratio being around 0.536.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close.

Wait, let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

We have K2/K1 = 4/3.

K_ratio = 4/3 = ( M_p2 / M_p1 ) * sqrt( a1 / a2 )

Wait wait, earlier I wrote K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

But perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me double-check.

Original formula:

K1/K2 = (M_p1 / M_p2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because K is proportional to (M_p / a^(1/2) ), so K1/K2 = (M_p1/M_p2) * (a2/a1 )^(1/2 )

So,

3/4 = (7/5) * sqrt( a2/a1 )

So sqrt(a2/a1 ) = (3/4) * (5/7) ) = 15/28 ≈ 0.5357

So a2/a1 = (15/28 )^2 ≈ 0.2869.

Thus, a1/a2 = 1/0.2869 ≈ 3.483.

So, the ratio a2/a1 is approximately 0.2869.

So, T_eq1 / T_eq2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) ≈ sqrt(0.2869 ) ≈ 0.5357, about 0.536. So the ratio is approximately 0.536, which is ~0.53. So option C is ~0.53.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by recalling the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T_{\text{eq}} \propto T_{\text{star}} \sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{star}}}{a}}
\]

Here, \(T_{\text{star}}\) and \(R_{\text{star}}\) are the effective temperature and radius of the star, respectively, and \(a\) is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit. Since both planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on the ratio of their orbital distances:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The problem provides the radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes for both planets, which are proportional to the Doppler shifts of the forbidden [OI] line at 6300 Å. The shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. Since the RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance, we have:

\[
\frac{K_2}{K_1} = \frac{M_{\text{p2}}}{M_{\text{p1}}} \sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}}
\]

Substituting the given masses (\(M_{\text{p1}} = 7 M_{\text{Earth}}, M_{\text{p2}} = 5 M_{\text{Earth}}\)) and the RV shift ratio (\(K_2/K_1 = 0.04/0.03 = 4/3\)):

\[
\frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{7} \sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}}
\]

Rearranging for \(\sqrt{a_1/a_2}\):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_1}{a_2}} = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{7}{5} = \frac{28}{15} \approx 1.8667
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{28}{15}\right)^2 \approx 3.483
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{3.483} \approx 0.2869
\]

Now, substituting this into the equilibrium temperature ratio:

\[
\frac{T_{\text{eq1}}}{T_{\text{eq2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.2869} \approx 0.536
\]

This means Planet1's equilibrium temperature is approximately 0.536 times that of Planet2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.53**.
