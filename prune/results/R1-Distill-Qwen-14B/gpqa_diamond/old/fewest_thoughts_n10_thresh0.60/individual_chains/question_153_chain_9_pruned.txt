Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about the Michael addition reaction. Hmm, I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophilic attack on an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. It's a conjugate addition, right? So the nucleophile attacks the beta carbon, which is the more substituted and more electrophilic position because of the resonance stabilization.

The question has three parts: A, B, and C. Each is a Michael addition reaction, and I need to find out the major products. Let me take them one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate plus methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH. So, NaOEt is a strong base, probably deprotonating something to form an enolate.

Dimethyl malonate is a good Michael donor because it's a diethyl acetoacetate analog. It has two ester groups, so it can form an enolate at the central carbon. When it forms the enolate, the negative charge can resonate between the two carbonyl carbons.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate is the Michael acceptor here. The structure is CH2=CH-COOR, but wait, no. Wait, (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would have the double bond between carbons 2 and 3. So, structure would be CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but with the substituents on the double bond. Wait, wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the acrylate has the structure CH2=CH-CO-OCH3. Oh wait, no, wait: acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-, so in the (E) configuration. So the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2 of the acrylate. So for 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate: the structure is CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the double bond is between the first and second carbon, and the third is the carbonyl. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me draw it.

Acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-.
