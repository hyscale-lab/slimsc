Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars changes with the parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance, right? Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So if we measure parallax, we can figure out how far away the stars are.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means they're spread out evenly in all directions and distances. So, the number of stars should depend on the volume of space they occupy. Oh wait, because if space is uniform, more volume should mean more stars. But wait, how does parallax come into play here?

Parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. The formula I remember is plx = 1/distance (parsecs) or something like that. So plx in arcseconds equals 1 divided by the distance in parsecs. So as distance increases, parallax decreases.

Now, the problem is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So we're looking at how the count changes when plx changes by a certain amount. Since the stars are uniformly distributed, the number should depend on the volume of a spherical shell at a certain distance, but each shell's thickness corresponds to a certain change in parallax.

Wait, let me think. Imagine we're considering a thin shell at a distance d, with a thickness dr. The volume of that shell is 4πr² dr. But since parallax is 1/r (because plx = 1/d, where d is in parsecs, which is r), so r =
