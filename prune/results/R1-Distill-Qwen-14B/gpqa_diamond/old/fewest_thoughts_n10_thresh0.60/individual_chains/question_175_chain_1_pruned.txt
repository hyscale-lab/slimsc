Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped, with its symmetry along the z-axis. The question is about the radiation it emits, specifically the power per unit solid angle and how it depends on wavelength and angle.

Hmm, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation. The problem mentions the radiation zone, which I think is where the fields behave like plane waves, so radiation fields dominate. The power radiated in a particular direction would depend on the angle theta from the z-axis and the wavelength lambda.

The question is asking for two things: the fraction of the maximum power A that's radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and the possible form of the function f in terms of lambda.

I think the function f would be the radiation power per unit solid angle as a function of theta and lambda. So f(λ, θ) would give P per steradian.

Wait, I remember that the radiation from a dipole antenna is a common example. The power radiated by a dipole varies with cos^2(theta), but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Also, the total power depends on the square of the frequency or inversely on the fourth power of the wavelength, because lambda is inversely proportional to frequency (f = c/lambda), so lambda^4 would be (c/f)^4, but when you square something like (f squared), you get f^4, which would be 1/lambda^4.

Wait, the power radiated by an accelerating charge is given by the Larmor formula. The power (P) is proportional to (q^2 a^2) / (6πε₀ c³). But in the context of oscillations, a is the acceleration, which depends on the frequency. For a dipole oscillator, the maximum power would depend on the square of the frequency, so since frequency f is c/lambda, that would make P proportional to 1/lambda^4.

But wait, the problem is about the power per unit solid angle. So the total power over all solid angles is the integral of f(λ,θ) over all angles. The maximum power A would be the maximum of f(λ,θ) multiplied by the solid angle it's emitted in? Or wait, maybe A is the total power, and the function f is the power per solid angle. So in that case, the integral of f over all solid
