Okay, let's tackle this quantum mechanics problem. So, the question is about finding the expectation value of an operator for a spin-1/2 particle in a given superposition state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values involve calculating the average outcome of an observable over many measurements. 

The particle's state is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And we're told that |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the Pauli z-matrix. So, first, I should probably write down the state vector. 

Wait, I should check if the coefficients are normalized. Let's see: 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4), so adding them gives 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Yep, so it's a valid quantum state.

The operator we're interested in is 10σz + 5σx. To find the expectation value, I think I can compute the expectation of each term separately and then add them together. Because expectation values are linear, right? So ⟨A + B⟩ = ⟨A⟩ + ⟨B⟩.

So let's break it down. First, compute ⟨σz⟩ and then ⟨σx⟩, multiply each by their coefficients (10 and 5 respectively), and sum the results.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it's easier. The expectation value of σz is just the weighted sum of the eigenvalues. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The state is 0.5|↑⟩ + (√3/2)|↓⟩. So the probability of being in |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25, and for |↓⟩ it's |√3/2|^2 = 3/4 = 0.75.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

Then, the contribution from the 10σz term is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Oh wait, σx is the Pauli x matrix. The eigenstates of σx are different. They are not |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, so I can't directly compute the expectation like with σz. I think I'll have to calculate it using the state's components.

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, for a general state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is |a|^2 + |b|^2? Wait, no. Let me think. Oh right, the general formula is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩.

So, let's compute that. Our state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. So ψ can be written as a column vector [0.5; √3/2]. 

σx as a matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when we calculate ψ† σx ψ, which is the expectation value, we'll do:

[0.5* , (√3/2)* ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; (√3/2)].

Since the coefficients are real, the complex conjugate doesn't change anything. So the calculation becomes:

(0.5 * 0 + (√3/2) * 1) * 0.5 + (0.5 * 1 + (√3/2 * 0)) * (√3/2).

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute it as (a b) [σx] (a b)T, where a=0.5, b=√3/2.

Wait, no, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you do ψ† σx ψ, it
