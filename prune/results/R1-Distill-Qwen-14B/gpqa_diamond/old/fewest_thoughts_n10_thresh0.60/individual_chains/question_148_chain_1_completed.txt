Okay, let's try to tackle this chemistry problem. Hmm, it's a bit tricky, but I'll break it down step by step.

So, the question involves binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds. The substances A1 to A5 are these compounds or products formed from reactions involving them.

First, let's parse each part of the question carefully.

The first part says A1 decomposes at 293 K (which is 20°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state of F) is 31.96% for A2. Wait, oxidation states are usually in whole numbers, so maybe that's a percentage of a certain value? Or perhaps it's the actual oxidation state number. Let me think. 31.96% sounds close to 32, which is 32 divided by 100. Hmm, but 32 is a high oxidation state for fluorine. Wait, fluorine usually has an oxidation state of -1. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the molar percentage or something else. Oh, wait, maybe oF is the oxidation state... so if A2 has an oF of 31.96%, maybe that's the oxidation state? But that can't be right because fluorine's oxidation state is usually -1, or sometimes positive in certain compounds, but 31 seems way too high. Wait, maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's the oxidation state of Y? Or maybe it's the percentage of fluorine by mass.

Wait, another thought. The symbol given is ɷF, maybe it's the standard molar entropy? No, entropy is usually denoted by S. I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the oxidation number. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the compounds. Binary compounds of fluorine and Y. So Y could be another element, possibly a halogen. Wait, fluorine tends to form binary compounds with many elements, but if Y is another halogen, like chlorine or something else.

Wait, the first clue: A1 decomposes into A2 and fluorine. So A1 is a binary compound (YF_x) that breaks down into another binary compound (A2, which is possibly YF_y) and F2 gas.

Wait, but fluorine is F2. So, for example, a decomposition reaction might look like YF3 → YF + F2? Not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe A1 is a more complex compound.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal, and the compounds are YF, YF2, YF3, etc. So, decomposition of A1 would produce another YF compound plus F2. But I'm not sure.

Another clue: A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, and it's usually unreactive, but fluorine can oxidize it. Wait, when fluorine is in a high oxidation state, maybe it can act as an oxidizing agent. So perhaps A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

Wait, another thought: A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y reacts with fluorine to form A3. So A3 is perhaps YF_x. It can also interact with xenon, which suggests it's a reactive compound, possibly an oxidizing agent.

Then, A4 is a solution. Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4 gives A5. Then, A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

Hmm. Let me think about possible structures.

Wait, perhaps Y is chlorine? Because fluorine and chlorine can form some binary compounds. Alternatively, Y could be another non-metal, perhaps oxygen? But fluorine and oxygen can form OF2, O2F2, etc.

Wait, but the problem states that there are five binary compounds, which suggests Y is a diatomic element. Let me think about elements that form five binary fluorides.

Wait, let's think of possible elements. Chlorine can form ClF, ClF3, ClF5, etc. Wait, but how many? Let me count. ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7? That's four. Hmm, maybe I'm missing one. Alternatively, perhaps Y is oxygen. Oxygen can form OF2 and O2F2. That's two, so that's not enough. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y is iodine. Iodine can form IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. That's four. Plus perhaps another? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: considering the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2.

Let me write a possible reaction. Suppose A1 is YF3. It decomposes into A2 (YF) and F2.

So YF3 → YF + F2. Let me check the balance. Let's see: on the left, we have 3 Y and 3 F. On the right, 1 Y, 1 F in YF, and 2 F in F2. So total F is 3 (1+2*2=5? No, wait, F2 is two F atoms per molecule. So 1 YF gives 1 F, and F2 gives 2 F. So total F on the right is 1*(1) + 1*(2) = 3. So each side has 3 F. The Y: 1 on the left, 1 on the right. So the equation is balanced as YF3 → YF + F2.

But wait, the stoichiometry might not be right. Let me see: YF3 → YF + F2.

Multiply YF by 1, F2 by 1.

Left: YF3 → YF + F2.

But the number of F on the left: 3 per molecule. On the right: 1 (from YF) + 2 (from F2) = 3. So yes, the equation is balanced as 1 YF3 → 1 YF + 1 F2.

Wait, that's possible. So A1 is YF3, which upon decomposition gives A2 (YF) and F2 gas.

In that case, YF3 has a certain oxidation state of Y. Let's calculate the oxidation state of Y in YF3. Fluorine is -1, so Y + 3*(-1) = 0 → Y = +3.

In YF, Y would be +1 oxidation state. So the oxidation state of Y decreases from +3 to +1 in this decomposition. But wait, decomposition usually involves breaking bonds, but the oxidation states could vary. Hmm.

Wait, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon is usually in 0 oxidation state. Fluorine is a strong oxidizing agent, so perhaps A1 contains F in a high oxidation state. Wait, but if A1 is YF3, and Y is in +3, then F is -1. So the F is in -1. That's not a particularly high oxidation state. Alternatively, maybe Y is in a higher oxidation state.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A1 is ClF3. Cl in +3 oxidation state. ClF3 is a known compound. It is a strong oxidizing agent.

When ClF3 decomposes, what happens? Let me think. ClF3 can decompose into ClF and F2. So:

ClF3 → ClF + F2.

Yes, that's a known decomposition. So A1 could be ClF3.

In that case, A2 would be ClF, and F2.

So the oF (oxidation state) of F in A2 (ClF) would be -1, same as in A1. Wait, but the question says that in A2, the oF is 31.96%. Hmm, that doesn't make sense because F is -1.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding what oF refers to. Oh, wait, maybe it's the oxidation state of Y? Because in A2, Y is Cl in ClF.

So, in A2 (ClF), Y (Cl) has an oxidation state of +1. So 31.96% of what? Maybe the percentage of the oxidation state relative to something else? Or perhaps it's the percentage of Y in A2 by mass.

Wait, the question says oF=31,96% for A2. So perhaps it's the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2. Let's calculate that.

If A2 is ClF, molecular weight is Cl (35.45) + F (19) = 54.45 g/mol.

Fluorine percentage: (19 / 54.45) * 100 ≈ 34.87%. Hmm, that's close to 31.96%, but not exactly. Hmm, maybe it's another compound.

Wait, maybe A2 is not ClF, but something else. Let me think of another possibility.

Wait, maybe Y is oxygen. If Y is O, then A1 might be O2F2 (dihydrogen monofluoride? No, wait, O2F2 is a known compound. O2F2 is called oxygen difluoride.

But when O2F2 decomposes, it would produce O2 and F2. Let me see: O2F2 → O2 + F2. So A2 would be O2, but O2 is a diatomic molecule. But that doesn't fit with the earlier part where A2 is a binary compound of F and Y. No, because O2 is O2, not a binary with F anymore.

So that might not fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is iodine. Let's see. A1 could be IF3, which decomposes into IF and F2.

IF3 → IF + F2.

The molecular weight of IF3 is I (126.9) + 3*F (19*3=57) → 183.9 g/mol.

IF has I (126.9) + F (19) → 145.9 g/mol.

In A2 (IF), F's mass is 19/(145.9) *100 ≈ 13%. That's not close to 31.96%.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, maybe A2 is FCl (if Y is Cl). No, but FCl is not a stable compound. Wait, perhaps A2 is ClF3? No, that's the same as A1.

Wait, perhaps Y is a metal. Let's think about metals that form multiple fluorides. For example, aluminum forms AlF3, but that's only one. Maybe iron forms FeF2 and FeF3. But how many binary fluorides would a metal form? Let me think: probably up to two or three, not five. So perhaps Y is a non-metal.

Wait, another approach: the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2.

If A1 is a binary compound, YF_x → YF_y + F2.

The stoichiometry must balance. Let's write the general equation.

YF_x → YF_y + F2.

So, the F atoms on each side:

Left: x F per Y.

Right: y F (from YF_y) + 2 * 2 F (from F2) → y +4 F atoms.

So, x = y + 4? Because each molecule of YF_x contributes x F, and each molecule of YF_y contributes y F, plus 2 F from F2.

Wait, no, the way to balance is: x = y + 2 * 2.

Because for each molecule of YF_x, you get x F. On the right, each YF_y gives y F, and each F2 gives 2 F atoms. So the total F on the right is y + 2 * (number of F2 molecules).

Wait, perhaps the equation is YF3 → YF + F2.

Which gives x=3, y=1. So 3 F on the left, 1 (YF) + 2*2 (F2) = 5 F on the right. Wait, that's not balanced. So 3 F on left, 5 on right. So that's unbalanced.

Hmm, perhaps the correct equation requires multiple molecules. Let me try:

a YF_x → b YF_y + c F2.

Total Y: a = b.

Total F: a x = b y + 2 c.

We need to find integers a, b, c, x, y that satisfy this, with x > y.

Let me try with x=5, y=3.

So, 5a = 3b + 2c.

But a = b, so 5b = 3b + 2c → 2b = 2c → b = c.

So the equation could be YF5 → YF3 + F2.

But for a=1, 5 =3 + 2 → 5=5. So 1 YF5 → 1 YF3 + 1 F2.

Yes, that works. So YF5 decomposes into YF3 and F2. Wait, but then A1 is YF5, and A2 is YF3. But the question says A2 has oF=31.96%. So let's calculate F's percentage in YF3.

Assuming Y is Cl (atomic weight 35.5), YF3 would be 35.5 + 3*19 = 35.5 + 57=92.5 g/mol. F's percentage is (57/92.5)*100 ≈ 61.6%. That's not matching 31.96%.

Hmm, perhaps Y is a different element.

Wait, let's try Y as Br (atomic weight ~80). YF3 would be 80 +57=137 g/mol. F's percentage is 57/137 ≈41.6%. Still not 31.96%.

Wait, maybe Y is something else. Let's think of Y as S (sulfur, ~32). YF3 would be 32 +57=89 g/mol. F percentage 57/89≈64%. No.

Wait, maybe Y is O. YF3 would be 16 +57=73 g/mol. F is 57/73≈78%. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps the approach is incorrect. Maybe A2 is a different compound, not YF_y. Maybe it's YF with some other structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the oF refers to the oxidation state of F in A2. So if the oxidation state is 31.96, that can't be right because F rarely has such high positive states. Wait, perhaps the oF is the oxidation state of Y.

Wait, the question says ɷF=31,96%. So maybe it's the oxidation state of Y. For example, if Y is in +31.96, which is impossible. So that can't be right. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2. Let's think about which compound has F at 31.96%.

Say A2 is YF. Let's compute F's percentage.

If YF has F at ~32%, then the formula weight is Y + 19 = (19 / (Y +19)) * 100 ≈32.

So,

(19)/(Y+19) = 0.32 → 19 = 0.32(Y +19) → 19 = 0.32Y +6.08 → 12.92 = 0.32 Y → Y ≈40.375.

Looking for an element with atomic weight around 40. That would be Zr (zirconium, ~91), no. Wait, 40 is between K (39) and Ca (40). Wait, K is 39, Ca is 40, but they are metals. Wait, perhaps Y is Ca? If Y is Ca (40), then YF is CaF.

CaF: molecular weight 40 +19=59. F percentage is 19/59≈32.2%. Oh! That's very close to 31.96%. So A2 is CaF.

So, in that case, A1 would be CaF3, which decomposes into CaF and F2.

Wait, but CaF3 is not a stable compound. Calcium typically forms CaF2. So that might not fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is not a metal. Let's think of another element. Let's see, if Y is As (atomic weight ~75). YF: 75 +19=94. F% is 19/94≈20.2%, not 32%.

Wait, perhaps A2 is not YF. Maybe it's YF2. Let's try that.

If A2 is YF2, then F% is (2*19)/(Y +38) ) *100 =31.96.

So,

(38)/(Y +38) =0.3196 → 38 =0.3196 Y + 0.3196 *38 → 38 =0.3196 Y +12.1448 → 25.8552 =0.3196 Y → Y≈80.8.

Which is near Br (80). So Y would be Br.

So A2 is BrF2. Let's check: Br (80) + 2 F (38) → 118 g/mol. F% is 38/118 ≈32.2%, which is close to 31.96%. So A2 is BrF2.

So, what is A1? It's a binary compound that upon decomposition gives BrF2 and F2.

So let's write the equation: YF_x → BrF2 + F2.

Assuming Y is Br (since A2 is BrF2), then A1 is perhaps BrF3 or BrF4.

Wait, for BrF3: decomposition would be BrF3 → BrF2 + F2.

Let me check the stoichiometry. BrF3 → BrF2 + F2.

Br: 1 each.

F: 3 on left, 2 (BrF2) + 2*2 (F2) =2+4=6 F on right. Not balanced.

So 3 F on left vs 6 on right. So perhaps:

BrF3 → BrF2 + (1/2) F2.

But that gives half a molecule, which isn't ideal. Alternatively, multiply both sides by 2:

2 BrF3 → 2 BrF2 + F2.

Yes, that works. So for each 2 moles of BrF3, you get 2 moles BrF2 and 1 mole F2.

So, A1 is BrF3, which decomposes into BrF2 and F2.

But wait, BrF3 is a known compound? I'm not sure; more commonly, bromine forms BrF, BrF3, BrF5, etc. So perhaps BrF3 is a possibility.

So, moving on, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So Y (which is Br) reacts with fluorine to form A3. So A3 could be BrF or BrF5, but let me think.

Wait, when a non-metal is fluorinated, it can form multiple fluorides. For example, Br can form BrF, BrF3, BrF5. So A3 is one of these.

But the question says A3 can interact with xenon. Xenon is a noble gas, so perhaps A3 is a fluorine-rich compound that can act as an oxidizing agent, reacting with Xe.

So, for example, BrF5 is a strong oxidizing agent. It can oxidize Xe to XeF2 or XeF4, etc. So A3 could be BrF5.

Now, A4 is a solution. Adding Y (Br) in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot concentrated colorless solution of A4 gives A5.

Wait, what is A4? It's a binary compound of F and Br. Let's consider possible compounds.

If A4 is BrF, but it's a gas, not a solution. Hmm. Or perhaps A4 is HBrF2 or something else, but that's not a binary compound. Wait, A4 must be a binary compound of F and Y (Br), so it's BrF_x.

Wait, possible BrF_x compounds that are in solution. For example, HBrO is not a binary compound of F and Br. Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrF, but that's not a binary compound of Br and F. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt. Wait, but the question says A4 is a binary compound, so it's only Br and F. So, perhaps A4 is BrF3 dissolved in something, but that's not a binary compound of Br and F with other elements. Or maybe A4 is BrF5, which is a liquid or solid? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrF2, but that includes hydrogen, which isn't part of the binary compounds (which are Y and F only).

Wait, another approach. When Y (Br) is added to a solution of A4 in a 1:1 molar ratio, it forms A5. So A4 must have a structure that when Br is added, it changes.

Wait, perhaps A4 is BrF, and adding Br gives Br2 and F2? No, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, A4 could be BrF3. If we add Br, perhaps it forms BrF5?

Wait, but that would require adding Br in a 1:1 ratio. Let me think about the reaction.

BrF3 + Br → ?

Hmm, but maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of a salt, but again, A4 is a binary compound, so it's just Br and F.

Wait, another thought: perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrF2, but that's a ternary compound, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of HBrO, but that's not a binary F compound.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about A5. When A5 is added to water, it decomposes into two substances. So, it's likely a salt that breaks down into a strong acid and another substance.

For example, if A5 is CaF2, it would decompose into Ca^2+ and F^- ions, but in water, perhaps it would hydrolyze. Alternatively, if A5 is a fluoride that reacts with water to form HF and another product.

Wait, but in the reaction when Y (Br) is added to A4's solution, perhaps a double displacement occurs, producing a precipitate or a new compound.

Wait, perhaps A4 is HBrO4, but that's not a binary F compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a solution of BrF5. But BrF5 is a liquid, so maybe it's not. Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of NaBrF, but that's a salt, a binary compound of Na, Br, and F.

Wait, I'm stuck on A4. Let me try to think of possible compounds.

Wait, another approach: considering that when Y (Br) is added to A4's solution, it produces A5. Given that they are in a 1:1 molar ratio, perhaps it's a neutralization reaction.

But A4 is a solution of a binary compound, so perhaps it's a solution of HBrF (but H is not part of the binary compounds). Alternatively, maybe A4 is a solution of HBrO (but that's not a F compound).

Wait, perhaps A4 is a solution of BrF3. If Br is added, perhaps it forms BrF5:

BrF3 + Br → BrF5.

But the molar ratio would be 1:1. So for each BrF3 molecule, add one Br to get BrF5.

Yes, that makes sense. So A4 is BrF3 in solution. When Br is added, it forms BrF5.

So A5 would be BrF5.

Then, when BrF5 decomposes in water, what happens? BrF5 is a strong oxidizing agent and can react violently with water, producing HF, Br2, and O2 or other products. The decomposition might produce HBrO, HBr, and HF, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the reaction might produce Br2, HF, and O2.

But the question says that A5 decomposes into two substances. So perhaps it's a decomposition into two products.

But regardless, I'm more interested in the molecular weight of A4. A4 is BrF3. The molecular weight would be Br (80) + 3 F (19*3=57) → 137 g/mol.

Looking at the options, the options are A) 140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

So 137 falls into option D (110-130). But wait, I thought A4 was BrF3, which is 137. So the molecular weight of A4 is around 137, which fits option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is BrF3 a known compound? I recall that BrF3 is a known compound, a colorless liquid, but I'm not certain about its properties in solution.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying Y as Br. Let me think again.

Wait, if Y is chlorine, what would happen?

If Y is Cl, then A2 would be ClF. Cl atomic weight is ~35.5. So ClF's molecular weight is 35.5 +19=54.5 g/mol. F percentage: 19/54.5≈34.8%, close to 31.96%, but not exact. Maybe it's another element.

Wait, another element with Y such that YF has F% around 32%. Let me calculate:

F% = (19)/(Y +19) *100 =31.96 → 19/(Y+19) =0.3196 → Y+19=19/0.3196≈59.47 → Y≈59.47-19=40.47.

So Y would have an atomic weight of about 40.47. Looking at the periodic table, K is 39, Ca is 40. So Y could be Ca.

So if Y is Ca, A2 is CaF. Then A1 would be CaF3, which would decompose into CaF and F2.

But Ca typically forms CaF2, not CaF3. So CaF3 is not a known compound, I think.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. But based on the earlier calculation, if A4 is BrF3 with a molecular weight of 137, the option is D (110-130).

Alternatively, if A4 is ClF3, molecular weight would be Cl (35.5) +3*19=35.5+57=92.5. That falls into option D as well (110-130? No, 92 is lower than 110. So option D is 110-130. 92 is below that, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, that's a problem. So earlier, if Y is Cl, A4 would be ClF3, which has molecular weight 35.5 +57=92.5. So that would fall below option D (110-130). So if Y is Cl, this wouldn't fit. So perhaps Y is Br, making A4 BrF3 with molecular weight 137, which fits option D.

But earlier, when I considered A4 being BrF3, I had some doubts about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Let me summarize:

- A1: YF_x → decomposes into A2 (YF_y) and F2.

- A2 has oF=31.96% → possibly YF where F is 32% by mass. This led me to Y being Ca (atomic weight ~40), but Y is more likely Br because BrF2 has F% about 32%.

Wait, if Y is Br, and A2 is BrF2, then A1 would be BrF3. So A1 is BrF3, which upon decomposition gives BrF2 and F2.

So A4 is BrF3, molecular weight 80 +57=137. So the answer would be D) 110-130.

But let's check the other parts. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Br), so A3 could be BrF5, which can react with Xe.

When BrF5 reacts with Xe, it can produce XeF2, XeF4, etc. So that fits.

Then, adding Y (Br) to a hot concentrated solution of A4 (BrF3) in a 1:1 molar ratio gives A5. So perhaps the reaction is:

BrF3 + Br → BrF5.

So A5 is BrF5. In water, BrF5 reacts violently, decomposing into HBrO, HBr, HF, and possibly Br2. So it's decomposing into two substances? Hmm, maybe HBrO and HBr, but that's more than two. Alternatively, maybe it's HBrO3 and HF, but I'm not sure.

But regardless, the key point is the molecular weight of A4.

So A4 is BrF3, molecular weight 137. The options are: D is 110-130. 137 is within 110-130? No, because 137 is above 130. So option D is 110-130. So 137 would be just outside. Wait, that's a problem.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A4 is not BrF3 but another compound. Let me think.

If Y is Cl, then A2 would be ClF (F% ~34.8%), but that's not matching 31.96%. Hmm.

Wait, what if Y is As (atomic weight ~75). Then YF would have F% 19/(75+19)=19/94≈20%, which is lower than 31.96%. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is S (32). YF would have F% 19/(32+19)=19/51≈37.25%. No, higher than 31.96.

Hmm. Maybe I need to reevaluate. Another approach: think about the five binary compounds.

Y and F can form up to five binary compounds. Which elements form five or more binary fluorides?

I think it's elements like oxygen (O), which forms OF2 and O2F2. Wait, that's only two. Chlorine forms ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7. That's four. Plus ClF2? No, ClF2 is unstable. So maybe four is the maximum for Cl.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Y is sulfur, which can form SF, SF2, SF4, SF6. That's four.

Wait, maybe Y is iodine. I can form IF, IF3, IF5, IF7. That's four.

Hmm, maybe another element. Wait, perhaps Y is a transition metal. For example, lead can form PbF2, PbF4. Not five.

Wait, perhaps Y is phosphorus. P can form PF3, PF5, maybe others. Let me see: PF3, PF5, and perhaps P2F7 and other polymeric forms. Maybe that's five.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a noble gas, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps Y is nitrogen. N can form NF3 and others. Hmm, not five.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is carbon. CF4 is a known compound. But again, not five.

Wait, maybe the element is oxygen. Wait, O and F can form OF2, O2F2, and possibly others. But that's only two or three. So not five.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck on the first part. Let's think about A3. A3 can interact with xenon. So A3 is a fluoride that can react with Xe. For example, Xe can be oxidized by a fluoride to form a XeF compound.

So A3 could be ClF5, which is a strong oxidizing agent. It can react with Xe to form XeF2 or XeF4.

So if A3 is ClF5, then Y is Cl.

So, let's go back. If Y is Cl:

A1 is a binary compound of Cl and F that decomposes into A2 (ClF) and F2. So the decomposition reaction is ClF3 → ClF + F2.

Wait, ClF3 is a known compound, a colorless liquid, and it decomposes into ClF and F2 upon heating.

So A1 is ClF3, which decomposes into A2 (ClF) and F2.

In A2 (ClF), the F percentage is (19)/(35.5+19)=19/54.5≈34.88%, which is close to 31.96% but not exact. Hmm, perhaps this is an approximation.

Then, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Cl) with F2. So if Y is Cl, fluorinating it could give ClF, ClF3, ClF5, ClF7. But A3 is a compound that can react with Xe. So perhaps A3 is ClF5.

When ClF5 reacts with Xe, it can oxidize Xe to XeF2 or higher fluorides.

So A3 is ClF5. Then, A4 is a binary compound of Cl and F, and a solution. Adding Cl (Y) in 1:1 ratio to A4's solution produces A5.

So, what is A4? Let's think. A4 is a binary ClF compound. When Cl is added, perhaps a reaction occurs.

Wait, if A4 is ClF, adding Cl might not do much, as ClF is a gas. Alternatively, A4 could be ClF3. When Cl is added, perhaps it forms ClF5.

So A4 is ClF3 (molecular weight 35.5 +3*19=35.5+57=92.5 g/mol). So the molecular weight of A4 is 92.5, which falls into option D (110-130)? No, 92 is below 110. So option D is 110-130, so 92 would be in option D? No, because 92 is below 110. So if A4 is ClF3, the molecular weight is 92.5, which would fall into option D only if the option starts at 92.5, but option D is 110-130. So 92.5 is below that.

Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to put it all together.

If Y is Cl:

- A1 is ClF3 → decomposes into ClF (A2) and F2.

- A3 is ClF5, which can react with Xe.

- A4 is ClF3 (solution?), adding Cl in 1:1 ratio gives ClF5 (A5).

- A5 (ClF5) decomposes in water into HClO3, HCl, and HF? Or something else.

But the molecular weight of A4 (ClF3) is about 92.5, which doesn't fit any option except D (110-130) if 92 is included. But 92 is below 110, so that would not be in option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe A4 is ClF5. Then, adding Cl would produce ClF7, but that's not a known compound. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF. Adding Cl would not make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF5. But adding Cl in a 1:1 ratio might not form anything.

Wait, perhaps A4 is HClF2, but that's a ternary compound, so it's not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach.

The question is about the molecular weight of A4. The options are A)140-160, B)220-240, C)160-180, D)110-130.

If A4 is ClF3, molecular weight 92.5 → doesn't fit any option.

If A4 is BrF3, molecular weight 137 → D (110-130) is up to 130. 137 is just above, so doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is not Cl or Br, but another element. Let's think of Y as I (iodine).

A2 is IF with F% 31.96%. So:

(19)/(127 +19)=19/(146)=13.01%. Not matching. So no.

Hmm. Maybe Y is a transition metal that forms multiple fluorides. Let's think of Y as Fe. Fe can form FeF2 and FeF3. But that's only two binary compounds. Not five.

Wait, perhaps Y is molybdenum (Mo). Mo can form MoF6, but that's only one. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a diatomic element that forms multiple fluorides, like O2. But that's not likely.

Wait, perhaps Y is a diatomic element, but I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, considering the decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. Let me think of another possible decomposition. For example, O2F2 → O2 + F2. But O2F2 is a binary compound. So A1 would be O2F2, which decomposes into O2 and F2. But then A2 is O2, which isn't a binary compound. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a metal like sodium. But sodium forms NaF, and maybe others, but only a few.

Hmm. I'm not making progress, so perhaps I should proceed with the earlier conclusion that Y is Br, making A4 BrF3 with molecular weight 137. So the answer would be option D (110-130), but 137 is just over 130. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the molecular weight of A4, which is BrF3 (137), but the options D is 110-130. 137 is just outside. So perhaps Y is not Br.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is a different compound. Let me think again. If Y is Cl, and A4 is ClF3 (92.5), which doesn't fit any option. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying A2. Let's think differently. What if A2 is not YF, but YF3, and the oF is the oxidation state of Y.

Wait, if A2 is YF3, then the oxidation state of Y is +3. So oF (which could be the oxidation state of Y) is +3. 31.96% of what? Hmm, maybe the percentage of Y in A2.

So, Y is in +3 oxidation state, F is -1. So in A2, YF3, the percentage of Y would be (Y)/(Y +3*19) *100 =31.96.

So,

(Y)/(Y +57) =0.3196 → Y =0.3196 Y +0.3196 *57 → Y -0.3196 Y =0.3196*57 → 0.6804 Y =18.1752 → Y≈26.7.

So Y would have atomic weight ≈26.7, which is close to Mg (24.3) or Al (27). Hmm, Al is 27. So Y could be Al.

So A2 is AlF3.

If Y is Al, then A1 is AlF5? Wait, Al typically forms AlF3. So AlF3 decomposes into what? Maybe AlF + F2.

So reaction: AlF3 → AlF + F2.

Let me balance:

AlF3 → AlF + F2.

Al: 1 each.

F: 3 on left, 1 (AlF) + 2*(F2) =5 F on right. So to balance F:

2 AlF3 → 2 AlF + 3 F2.

Yes. So A1 is AlF3, which decomposes into AlF (A2) and F2.

In A2 (AlF), the percentage of Al is (27)/(27 +19)=27/46≈58.7%. But earlier calculation suggested Y is 26.7, which is around Mg, not Al.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck again. 

But the key point is that the molecular weight of A4 is to be determined. If Y is Al, then A4 would be a solution of AlF3. Molecular weight of AlF3 is 27 +57=84. So that's even lower than 110, not fitting any option.

Hmm, perhaps I need to make an educated guess based on the earlier reasoning. If Y is Br, A4 is BrF3 (137), which is option D (110-130). Wait, but 137 is higher than 130, so it's outside the range. So perhaps the correct option is D if the range is 110-130 inclusive.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C (160-180) if Y is another element.

Wait, another approach: what if Y is antimony (Sb). Sb can form SbF3, SbF5. Maybe A4 is SbF5, molecular weight 121.8 (Sb) +5*19=121.8+95=216.8. That's in option B (220-240). So if A4 is SbF5, molecular weight ~217, which is in option B.

But I'm not sure if Sb forms five binary fluorides.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is phosphorus. P can form PF3 and PF5, but that's two. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is sulfur. It can form SF, SF2, SF4, SF6. That's four. So perhaps five if including others. I'm not certain.

But I'm running out of time. Based on earlier reasoning, the most plausible is that Y is Br, making A4 BrF3 with molecular weight 137, which is just outside option D (110-130). Since 137 is just beyond 130, perhaps the intended answer is option D, assuming the upper limit is inclusive.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps, and Y is another element leading to a different molecular weight.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps A4 is ClF5. Molecular weight 35.5 +5*19=35.5+95=130.5 g/mol. So 130.5 is within option D (110-130). So if A4 is ClF5, the molecular weight is around 130.5, which fits option D.

So, let's reevaluate:

If Y is Cl, A4 is ClF5 (130.5 g/mol).

Then, how would A4 fit into the earlier parts?

So, A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y (Cl) with F2, which gives ClF5 (A3). ClF5 can react with Xe.

Then, adding Y (Cl) in a 1:1 ratio to a hot concentrated solution of A4 (ClF5) would produce what? Wait, ClF5 is a liquid, so perhaps the solution is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps A4 is ClF5 dissolved in a solvent, but that's getting too speculative.

But the key is that if A4 is ClF5, its molecular weight is 130.5, which fits option D (110-130). So the answer would be D.

But earlier, I considered A4 as BrF3, which didn't fit exactly. So perhaps the correct answer is D.


The problem involves identifying the molecular weight range of substance A4, a binary compound of fluorine and element Y, based on the given reactions and properties. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information and Initial Assumptions**:
   - Five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y are known.
   - A1 decomposes at 293 K into A2 (ɷF = 31.96%) and fluorine gas (F2).
   - A1 oxidizes xenon, indicating it is a strong oxidizing agent.
   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y and can also react with xenon.
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine, and its solution reacts with Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to form A5.
   - A5 decomposes in water into two substances.

2. **Identifying Y and the Compounds**:
   - A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass. For a binary compound YF, this implies:
     \[
     \frac{19}{Y + 19} \times 100 = 31.96 \implies Y \approx 40.375
     \]
     This suggests Y could be bromine (Br, atomic weight ~80) or chlorine (Cl, atomic weight ~35.5), depending on the compound.

   - A1 is likely a higher fluoride of Y, such as YF3 or YF5, which decomposes into a lower fluoride (A2) and F2. For example:
     \[
     \text{YF3} \rightarrow \text{YF} + \text{F2}
     \]

   - A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y, suggesting it could be a higher fluoride like YF5, which is a strong oxidizing agent and can react with xenon.

3. **Determining A4**:
   - A4 is a binary compound of Y and fluorine, likely a solution of a fluoride such as YF3 or YF5.
   - Adding Y in a 1:1 molar ratio to A4's solution forms A5. For example:
     \[
     \text{YF3} + \text{Y} \rightarrow \text{YF5}
     \]

4. **Molecular Weight of A4**:
   - If Y is bromine (Br), A4 could be BrF3:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of BrF3} = 80 + 3 \times 19 = 137 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
     This falls just outside the range of option D (110–130).

   - If Y is chlorine (Cl), A4 could be ClF5:
     \[
     \text{Molecular weight of ClF5} = 35.5 + 5 \times 19 = 130.5 \, \text{g/mol}
     \]
     This fits within the range of option D (110–130).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the most plausible identity for A4 is ClF5, with a molecular weight of 130.5 g/mol, which falls within the range of option D (110–130).
