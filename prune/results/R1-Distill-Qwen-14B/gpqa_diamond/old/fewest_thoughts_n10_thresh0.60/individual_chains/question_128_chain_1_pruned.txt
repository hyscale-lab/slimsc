Okay, so I've just landed this job in a structural biology lab, and my first task is to produce and purify the Human P53 protein in E. coli BL21. The PI gave me the amino acid sequence, and there are four plasmid options to choose from. I need to figure out which one is the correct sequence for the P53 protein.

Hmm, I remember that when cloning a eukaryotic gene into a bacterial plasmid, certain modifications are made. E. coli doesn't process eukaryotic genes the same way, so the plasmid probably includes a promoter that E. coli can recognize, like the T7 promoter, which is commonly used with BL21 strains because they have the T7 RNA polymerase.

Looking at the options, each starts with ATG, which is the start codon methionine. That's good because it means they're all likely in frame. But what about the presence of introns? Oh wait, I think bacterial expression vectors don't include introns because bacteria don't process them. So the plasmid should have the coding sequence without introns.

Wait, the given amino acid sequence is a single continuous chain, so the plasmid should also be a single ORF without introns. So each option is a long string of letters, but I need to see which one correctly represents the coding sequence for P53.

Another thing I remember is that the plasmid should have appropriate restriction sites for cloning. The original question says the PI wants to produce it quickly, so maybe the plasmid has the right sites for easy insertion.

But
