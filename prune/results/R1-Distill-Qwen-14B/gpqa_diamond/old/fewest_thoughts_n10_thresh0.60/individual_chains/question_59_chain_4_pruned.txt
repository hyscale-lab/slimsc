Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). Hmm, sounds like a titration problem or something involving acid-base reactions.

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But since these are different types of acids and a strong base, I need to figure out the net reaction after mixing all three. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I should probably calculate the moles of each acid and base in the solutions. Because when you mix them, the moles will determine how much they react.

Let me start with each solution.

1. For CH3COOH: It's a weak acid. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters. Molarity is 0.1 M. Moles = M * V. So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH.

2. HCl: That's a strong acid. Volume is 400 mL = 0.4 L. Molarity 0.2 M. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles of HCl.

3. Ba(OH)2: That's a strong base. Its formula is Ba(OH)2, so each mole gives 2 OH- ions. Volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L. Molarity 0.3 M. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. But since each mole gives 2 OH-, the total moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, but when you mix them, the H+ from the acids will react with the OH- from the base. So I need to find out if there's excess H+ or OH- after the reaction.

So, the total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. Hmm, but in this case, when you mix everything, the strong acid HCl will dissociate completely, and the weak acid CH3COOH will partially dissociate. But when mixing with a strong base, maybe the H+ from both will react.

Wait, I think the way to approach this is to consider the total moles of H+ from all acids and the total moles of OH- from the base.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates. So 0.08 moles of HCl will contribute 0.08 moles of H+. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it'll contribute some H+ but not all. But since we're mixing it with a strong base, perhaps the strong base will neutralize the H+ from both the strong and weak acids. Hmm, but maybe I should calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, let me think. When you mix all three solutions, the total volume will be 500 + 400 + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, first, calculate total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

Then, the CH3COOH: since it's a weak acid, it contributes some H+. But when you add a strong base, which is OH-, which is a strong base, it will react with H+ first. So perhaps the OH- will react with the H+ from both HCl and CH3COOH.

Wait, but the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2
