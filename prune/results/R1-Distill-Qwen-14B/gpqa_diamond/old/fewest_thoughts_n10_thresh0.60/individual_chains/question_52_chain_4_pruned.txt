Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Alright, the question is about stars with dark spots and how that affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, sounds a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let's read the question carefully. So, there's this star with a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When there are no dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. 

The main part is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2). The ratio decreases when the star has spots. And the question is asking by what factor this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. Oh, and the transition between these levels is at about 1448 Ã…. Also, LTE is assumed, which means Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium holds.

Alright, so I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation. Because in LTE, the population of energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution. So the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (g2/g1) * exp(-(E2 - E1)/(k T)), where g's are the statistical weights and E's are the energies.

Wait, but the ratio observed is decreasing when there are spots. Hmm. Let me think. Oh, when there are spots, the overall photospheric temperature is lower. So the effective temperature drops from 6000 K to 5500 K. But wait, the spots are cooler, right? So when part of the surface is covered by spots, that area is cooler than the rest. But the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So does the entire photosphere cool? Or is the star a combination of hotter and cooler regions? Maybe the problem is treating the average temperature as 5500 K when 40% is spotted.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says the overall photospheric Teff is 5500 K when spots are present. So I think the
