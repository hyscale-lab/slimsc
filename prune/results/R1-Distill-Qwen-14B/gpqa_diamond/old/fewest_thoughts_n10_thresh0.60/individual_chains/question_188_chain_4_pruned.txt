Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that rhombohedral crystals have all sides equal and all angles equal, but wait, no, I think in a rhombohedral structure, the lattice parameters a, b, c are all the same, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma are all equal too. Right, so in this case, the angles are all 30 degrees.

The question is asking for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. I remember that the interplanar distance is given by the formula d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² + ... something with the angles ), but wait, I think the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal is d_{hkl} = a * sqrt( (h² + k² + l²) / ( (h^2)(sin^2 α) + (k^2)(sin^2 β) + (l^2)(sin^2 γ) ) ... no, wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, no, I think the correct formula for a general crystal system (triclinic) is d = (a² b² c² ) / ( (a² k² + b² l² + c² h²) - (a b c)( h^2 sin^2 γ + k^2 sin^2 α + l^2 sin^2 β ) + ... wait, no, that seems complicated. Or maybe I'm thinking of the reciprocal lattice? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for a rhombohedral crystal, since a = b = c and alpha = beta = gamma, maybe there's a simplified formula. Oh right, because in a rhombohedral system, the lattice parameters are a = b = c, and the angles are all equal, so maybe the formula simplifies.

I remember that the general formula for interplanar distance in any crystal system is given by:

d_{hkl} = (1/√(h² + k² + l² - 2hk cos α - 2kl cos β - 2hl cos γ))) ) * (a / √(1 + 2cos α cos β cos γ - cos² α - cos² β - cos² γ)) )

Wait, that sounds familiar
