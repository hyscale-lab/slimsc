Okay, so I have this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star that's similar in radius to the Sun. One hemisphere of this star is covered in dark spots, and the filling factor is 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe this star, its brightness will vary periodically as it rotates. This setup is compared to an exoplanet causing similar brightness variations. The question is asking what the radius of such an exoplanet would need to be relative to the star's radius to produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, okay. So I need to compare the brightness variations caused by the spots to those caused by a planet transiting the star.

Wait, but let's think about what each effect does. When a planet transits the star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the ratio of the planet's area to the star's area. The formula for the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, since it's the area that matters.

On the other hand, the star's spots are cooler regions. When the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. Since they are cooler, they make the star dimmer when they're facing us and brighter when they're not. So the net effect is a variation in brightness as the spots rotate into and out of our line of sight.

But wait, the problem says that the star's brightness variation due to the spots is similar to that of an exoplanet. So the question is, what's the radius of the exoplanet that would cause the same dip as the spots?

Wait, no, wait. The problem says, "to produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!)". So I think it's the other way around. Without the spots, what planet would cause the same dip as the spots do when they are present.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me re-read that part. The situation is that the star has spots, and this produces a certain variation. If the star didn't have spots, what planet would produce the same variation in brightness.

So the amplitude of the variation due to the spots is the same as the amplitude due to the planet. We need to find the planet's radius relative to the star to produce the same dip.

So first, I need to compute the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots.

The star has a radius Rstar = Rsun. The spots are covering one hemisphere, but not the entire hemisphere. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the area of the spots relative to the hemisphere. Wait, no, filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere's surface area covered by spots. Since the star is a sphere, a hemisphere is half its surface area. So the total area covered by spots is 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, the star's total surface area is 4πR². The hemisphere is 2πR². So the area of the spots is 0.2 * 2πR²
