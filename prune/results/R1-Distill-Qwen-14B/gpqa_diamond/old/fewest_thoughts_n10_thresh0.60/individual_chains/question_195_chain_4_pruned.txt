Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it carefully again.

So, there are two planets. The first one has a radius of 1 Earth radius and is in a circular orbit. Its transit impact parameter is 0.2, and it's around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this planet is 3 days. The question is about finding the maximum orbital period of a second planet, which is 2.5 Earth radii in size. Both planets are in the same system, same orbital plane, and the second one should also transit and occult the star.

Hmm. I need to find the maximum period of the second planet so that both transit and occultation events occur. Wait, transit is when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective, and occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so we can't see its light. For both to happen, the orbital period of the second planet must be such that its orbit is either inside or outside the first one's, but maybe that's not the main point here.

Wait, wait. The key here is that for both transit and occultation to be observed, the orbital period of the second planet must be shorter than the first. Because if it's longer, it would orbit more slowly, meaning that the first planet would always be in front or something. Or maybe it's the other way around. I think it's that the second planet's period must be longer to allow for it to sometimes be in front and behind, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods relative to the observation time. Oh, wait, maybe the main point is that the second planet must have an orbital period that allows for the two planets to line up such that one passes in front (transit) and then behind (occultation). 

But wait, the problem states that the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation events. So, for a planet to both transit and be occulted, its orbital period must be such that it's sometimes in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). That would mean that the orbital period of the second planet must be shorter than the first. Wait, or does it matter? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the main point is that for both events to occur, the second planet must be in a position that
