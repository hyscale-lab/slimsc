Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. Let me take it step by step.

The compound has the molecular formula C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X is 0. So it's (2*9 +2 -11 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could be like a benzene ring (which accounts for 4, since it's a six-membered ring with three double bonds) plus a double bond or an amide or something.

Looking at the IR data: strong bands around 3420 and 3325 cm^-1. Those are usually N-H stretches. The medium to strong intensity suggests maybe two different N-H groups. Wait, but if it's a secondary amide, the N-H would be around 3300, and maybe a primary amine would have a broader peak. Also, the strong band at 1720 cm^-1. That's a carbonyl group, probably an ester or amide. So maybe an amide or an ester.

Now the 1H NMR:

1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H. That's probably a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group attached to something. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2 that's split into a triplet. So maybe an ethyl group attached to an oxygen, like OCH2CH3.

4.0 ppm, broad singlet (bs), 2H. Broad singlet could be an NH2 group, but wait, in some cases, like an OCH2 group. Or maybe it's an amide NH. Wait, the integration is 2H, so maybe it's two protons. Wait, if it's an NH group in an amide, the peak would usually be around 7-8 ppm. Hmm, unless it's a secondary amine, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, could it be a CH2 connected to an
