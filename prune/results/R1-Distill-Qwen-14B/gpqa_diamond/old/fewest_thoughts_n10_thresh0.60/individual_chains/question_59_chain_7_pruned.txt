Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem about finding the pH of a solution. Hmm, let's see what it says. Oh right, it's mixing three different solutions: acetic acid, hydrochloric acid, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. But wait, I'm a bit rusty on the exact steps, so let me think this through.

First, I need to figure out how much of each acid and base we're dealing with in terms of moles. Because concentrations and volumes are given, calculating moles makes sense. So for each solution, I can use the formula moles = Molarity Ã— Volume (in liters).

Starting with CH3COOH, which is acetic acid. The volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 liters, and the concentration is 0.1 M. So 0.5 * 0.1 = 0.05 moles of acetic acid. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but I think for this problem, I might need to consider it in the neutralization reaction.

Next, HCl: 400 mL is 0.4 liters, and 0.2 M. Moles = 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will completely dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions.

Then, Ba(OH)2: 300 mL is 0.3 liters, 0.3 M. So moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates completely into Ba^2+ and OH^- ions. But wait, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH^- ions. So the total OH- ions would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, I think the approach is to find out the net amount of H+ or OH- after mixing all these solutions. Because acids donate H+ and bases donate OH-, and they can neutralize each other.

So, first, I need to calculate the total moles of H+ from all the acids, and the total moles of OH- from the base.

Wait, but wait. Wait, acetic acid is a weak acid, but in the presence of a strong acid and a strong base, maybe it's negligible? No, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the strong acids and bases will react first, and the weak acid might not contribute much in that reaction. Or maybe the strong acids will react with the strong base, and then the weak acid will contribute any excess H+.

Let me think step by step.

First, mix all the solutions. So the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

But before that, let's compute the total H+ from the acids and the total OH- from the base.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles. Acetic acid contributes some H+, but since it's weak,
