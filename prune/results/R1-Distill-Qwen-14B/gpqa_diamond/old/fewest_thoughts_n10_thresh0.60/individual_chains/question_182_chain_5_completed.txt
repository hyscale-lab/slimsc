Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. Hmm, I remember that equation from my solid-state devices class. Let me think. The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions. Right, so when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the electric field is so strong that the charge carriers are getting screened by their own space charge.

The equation is given as J equals (9/8) times epsilon, mu, times V squared over L cubed. So J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I think ε is the permittivity or dielectric constant of the semiconductor, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device, maybe the thickness or something.

The question is about the validity conditions of this equation. The options are A to D. Let's go through each one.

First, I need to recall the assumptions behind the Mott-Gurney equation. From what I remember, the derivation assumes that the device has a single carrier type contributing to the current. Like, in a diode under reverse bias, you have electrons or holes but not both. That makes sense because otherwise, you'd have a more complicated model.

Another key assumption is that the space charge is so significant that it creates a region where the electric field is varying. This leads to the current being proportional to V squared. Oh right, because the electric field E is proportional to V/L, and current density J is proportional to E * μ * n, but when the space charge builds up, the density n affects the field, leading to J proportional to V squared.

Also, the equation assumes that the contacts are ideal, meaning they're Ohmic. Ohmic contacts don't have any barrier for carrier injection. So if the contacts were Schottky, like in a rectifying diode, you'd have a barrier, and the Mott-Gurney equation might not hold because the injection would be limited, not the space charge.

Wait, but wait. Ohmic contacts are when the work function of the metal and semiconductor match, so no barrier. So when a device has Ohmic contacts, that's ideal for the equation. If there's a Schottky contact, then you have a barrier, and the current might be limited by the injection across that barrier, which would be a different regime. So Mott-Gurney is for when the injection is not a problem.

Additionally, the equation assumes negligible drift current. Wait, no, wait. Because in the derivation, the current is due to the space-charge effect, which is a drift current. Oh, maybe I got that wrong. So maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps it's that the equation assumes that the current is dominated by the space-charge effect, which is the drift current, and diffusion currents are negligible. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let me think again. In the SCLC (space-charge limited current) regime, the current is primarily due to the electric field built up by the space charge. So the dominant transport is drift, because the electric field is strong. But wait, under what conditions is the current considered SCLC?

Oh, right. SCLC occurs when the electric field is so strong that the space charge dominates, and the current is limited by the space charge, not by other factors like diffusion or contact barriers.

So the Mott-Gurney equation is valid when the current is space-charge limited. For that, the device must be such that the space charge is the main limiting factor. So that implies that other factors like contact barriers (which limit current by not allowing carriers to flow) are not a problem. So you need Ohmic contacts because otherwise, the current would be limited by the barrier, not the space charge.

Wait, but the options are a bit tricky. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, but Mott-Gurney is when the current is dominated by drift. So if drift current is negligible, the equation wouldn't apply. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: Valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. Oh, no carrier injection barrier would mean Ohmic contacts. So that fits. And negligible diffusion current is because the dominant term is drift, so diffusion is not the main factor. So this might be correct.

Option C: Valid for a single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. No, because Schottky contact implies a barrier, which would limit the current, making it not space-charge limited. So the equation wouldn't hold here. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D: Valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Hmm, two-carrier would imply both electrons and holes contribute. I thought Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier. So D is probably incorrect.

Wait, does the equation hold for two-carrier devices? I'm not so sure. Let me think. In a two-carrier scenario, like in a forward bias, the current is due to both electrons and holes. But the Mott-Gurney equation is derived for a single carrier, because in the SCLC region, the space charge is built up by a single type of carrier. For example, in a diode under high reverse bias, the current is due to minority carriers (electrons in p-type material), but in a single-carrier device. So, for two-carrier, maybe the equation doesn't apply. So D is incorrect.

So narrowing it down, the correct statement is either B or A. Wait, in option B it says negligible diffusion current. But in SCLC, the dominant term is drift current, so maybe diffusion is negligible. So B's statement about negligible diffusion current would fit, because in SCLC, it's drift that's dominant.

Option A says negligible drift current, which doesn't make sense. So A is out.

So the correct answer would be B. But wait, let me double-check.

Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the current is due to space-charge limited drift. So that requires:

1. Single carrier type (so either electrons only or holes only).
2. Ohmic contacts to allow for free carrier injection (no barrier).
3. The current is limited by space charge, so negligible other limiting factors, like diffusion or injection barriers.

So in option B, it's a trap-free single-carrier device with no injection barrier (so Ohmic) and negligible diffusion current. That fits.

But wait, another point: the equation assumes that traps are negligible. Because if there are traps, the current could be affected by trapping and re-emission, which would complicate things. So the equation assumes a trap-free (or negligible trap) environment.

Looking at the options, A says trap-free. B also says trap-free. So both A and B have that.

But A also says negligible drift current, which can't be right because the equation itself relies on drift current being significant.

So, correct conclusion is that the correct option is B.


The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current-voltage behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. The equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), assumes that the current is dominated by drift due to the electric field created by the space charge. The validity of this equation depends on specific conditions:

1. **Single-carrier device**: The equation applies to a single type of charge carrier (electrons or holes) because the SCLC regime is fundamentally a single-carrier phenomenon. Two-carrier devices (e.g., with both electrons and holes contributing) do not fit the assumptions of the equation.

2. **Trap-free environment**: The derivation assumes negligible trapping effects, as traps would complicate the current behavior by introducing additional mechanisms like carrier recombination and emission.

3. **Ohmic contacts**: The equation assumes ideal Ohmic contacts, meaning there are no barriers to carrier injection. If the contacts are Schottky, the current would be limited by the injection barrier, and the SCLC regime would not apply.

4. **Negligible diffusion current**: In the SCLC regime, drift current dominates, and diffusion is assumed to be negligible. If diffusion were significant, the current behavior would deviate from the Mott-Gurney prediction.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible drift current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation relies on drift current being significant, not negligible.

- **Option B**: States that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (Ohmic contacts) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the assumptions of the equation, as drift current dominates, diffusion is negligible, and Ohmic contacts ensure no injection barrier.

- **Option C**: States that the equation is valid for a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because Schottky contacts introduce injection barriers, which would limit the current and prevent the SCLC regime from applying.

- **Option D**: States that the equation is valid for a two-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current. This is incorrect because the Mott-Gurney equation is derived for single-carrier devices, not two-carrier systems.

### Conclusion:
The correct statement is **Option B**, as it satisfies all the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation: a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contacts and negligible diffusion current.
