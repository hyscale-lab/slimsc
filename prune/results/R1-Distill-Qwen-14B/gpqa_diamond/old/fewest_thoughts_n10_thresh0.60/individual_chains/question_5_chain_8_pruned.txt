Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. 

Wait, the operator P is given in terms of its components P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each of these components is ħ/2 multiplied by a 2x2 matrix. I remember that for spin-1/2 particles, like the muon mentioned here, the Pauli matrices are used. So P_x is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Similarly, P_y is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Y matrix, which is [[0,-i],[i,0]], and P_z is (ħ/2) times the Pauli Z matrix, [[1,0],[0,-1]].

The operator P as a whole would be the vector dot product of n with these components. So, since n is in the x-z plane, it must have components (nx, 0, nz). So, the operator P is n · (P_x i + P_z k), since the y-component of n is zero. 

So, putting it together, P = nx P_x + nz P_z. 

Wait, but for the operator, the eigenvalue equation is P |ψ⟩ = (ħ/2) |ψ⟩. Because the eigenvalue given is +ħ/2.

So, I need to find the eigenvectors of the operator nx P_x + nz P_z, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Then, normalize it.

Hmm, let's write out the operator matrix. Since P_x is (ħ/2) σ_x and P_z is (ħ/2) σ_z, the operator P is (ħ/2)(n_x σ_x + n_z σ_z). 

Wait, but σ_x and σ_z are the Pauli matrices. So, let me write it as:

P = (ħ/2) (n_x [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z [[1,0],[0,-1]]) )

Which becomes:

P = (ħ/2) [ [n_z, n_x], [n
