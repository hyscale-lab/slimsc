Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but let's take it step by step. The question involves binary compounds of fluorine with another element Y. There are five such compounds, labeled A1 through A5. Let's break down each clue to figure out what Y is and then determine the molecular weight range for A4.

First, the problem says A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, about 25°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think that's the oxidation state or maybe oxygen-free? Wait, probably oxidation state. Because ɷF=31.96% is given. Oh wait, no, maybe it's the percentage composition by mass of fluorine in A2. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, the question says "ɷF=31,96%"—maybe that's the percentage of fluorine by mass in A2. Oh, but I'm not certain about that. Alternatively, ɷF might be the oxidation state. But 31.96% sounds more like a mass percentage. Let me see—fluorine's atomic weight is about 19 g/mol. So if a compound has 31.96% F by mass, that could be a clue.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. That suggests that A1 is a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine compounds that are strong oxidizing agents—like perhaps a fluoride with a
