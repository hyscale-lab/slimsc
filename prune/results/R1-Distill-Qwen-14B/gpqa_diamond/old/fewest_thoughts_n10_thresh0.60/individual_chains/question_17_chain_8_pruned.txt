Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

The problem says that there's a solution containing 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in this solution. They also give the formation constant, K_{Ca-EDTA} = 5x10^10, and say the pH is ideal, so I probably don't have to worry about the EDTA being in its protonated forms or anything like that.

Wait, okay, EDTA is a chelating agent, right? So it binds metal ions like Ca²+ and forms a complex. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, and it's in a 1:1 ratio, I think. So each Ca²+ is bound by one EDTA molecule.

The formation constant, K, tells us about the stability of the complex. A higher K means the complex is more stable. So K is the equilibrium constant for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²−. The K given is 5e10, which is pretty large, so the complex is stable and doesn't dissociate much.

But wait, the solution is 0.02 M in the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. But when it dissociates, it releases Ca²+ and EDTA
