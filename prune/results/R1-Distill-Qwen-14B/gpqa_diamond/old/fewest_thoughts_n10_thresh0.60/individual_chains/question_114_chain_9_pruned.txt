Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the correct reagents for two reactions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and some reagent A to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that nitriles can be formed from ketones via nucleophilic addition. Let me think—when a ketone reacts with a cyanide, like NaCN, it's probably an addition reaction. 

Wait, the product is a nitrile and a hydroxyl group. Oh right, when a ketone (like butan-2-one) reacts with a cyanide ion, it adds the CN- to the carbonyl carbon. But wait, that would give a cyanohydrin. So the general reaction is ketone + CN- → cyanohydrin.

The cyanohydrin formation involves the addition of CN- to the carbonyl, resulting in a compound with an -OH and a -CN group on the same carbon. So the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, which makes sense because the starting ketone is butan-2-one (which is (CH3)2CO), so adding CN- would give (CH3)2C(OH)CN—yes, that's the product.

But what's the role of reagent A here? I think for the formation of the cyanohydrin, the reaction is usually done under acidic conditions. Because
