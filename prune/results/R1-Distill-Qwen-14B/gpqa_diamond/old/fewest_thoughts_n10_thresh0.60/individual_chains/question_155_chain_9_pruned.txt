Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question is about finding the uncertainty in the operator P_z, given that the system is in a specific eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). 

Hmm, right. I remember that the uncertainty in an observable is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(<P^2> - <P>^2), where <P> is the expectation value of the operator P. So I'll need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for this state.

First, I should probably get the matrix representation of P_z. The question says that P_z has a matrix with first row (ħ, 0, 0), second row (0,0,0), and third row (0,0,-ħ). So P_z is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ħ, 0, -ħ. That makes sense because the basis vectors are eigenvectors of P_z. So each basis state is an eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ, I think.

The state given is |ψ> = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T. Wait, but wait a second, this is a column vector. So in quantum mechanics, the state is a column vector, and to compute expectation values, I need to compute <ψ| P_z |ψ> and <ψ| P_z^2 |ψ>.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm doing this correctly. The expectation value <P_z> is ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, this should be straightforward.

Let me write down the components of ψ. Let me represent ψ as a column vector:

ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So ψ has three components: ψ1 = -1/2, ψ2 = 1/√2, ψ3 = -1/2.

P_z is a 3x3 matrix:
[ [ ħ, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, -ħ ] ]

So when I compute <P_z>, it's ψ† P_z ψ. Since P_z is diagonal, each component is multiplied by the corresponding component of ψ and then summed.

Wait, more accurately, let me compute it:

< P_z > = ψ† P_z ψ = ( ψ1* , ψ2*, ψ3* ) * P_z * (ψ1, ψ2, ψ3 )^T.

But since P_z is diagonal, the matrix multiplication will just give:

( ψ1* * P_z(1,1) * ψ1 ) + ( ψ2* * P_z(2,2) * ψ2 ) + (
