Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct. Let's break it down.

First, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator has maximum speed given by v_max = ωA, where ω is the angular frequency and A is the amplitude. But this is a relativistic case, so things are different because of the speed limits imposed by relativity, like the speed of light c.

Wait, in relativity, the equations change because mass depends on velocity. Oh right, the relativistic mass is gamma times the rest mass. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the mass isn't constant anymore; it increases as the object speeds up.

The force in the oscillator is F = -kx, according to Hooke's law. But in relativity, Newton's law F = dp/dt, where p is the relativistic momentum. Momentum p is gamma*m*v, so F equals the derivative of gamma*m*v with respect to time.

Let me think about the energy. In the classical case, the total energy is (1/2)kA², and at maximum displacement, all energy is potential, and at equilibrium (x=0), all is kinetic. But relativistically, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/
