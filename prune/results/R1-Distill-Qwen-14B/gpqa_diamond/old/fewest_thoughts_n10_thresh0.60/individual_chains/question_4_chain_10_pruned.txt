Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a parallel universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, wait, in our universe, magnets can't have isolated poles, right? Like, you can't just have a single north or south pole; they come in pairs. That's why, for example, when you break a magnet, you just get two smaller magnets, each with both poles.

So the question is about how Maxwell's equations would change in such a universe. Maxwell's equations are four fundamental laws of electromagnetism. Let me recall what they are. The four equations are:

1. Gauss's Law for Electricity: ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: ∇·B = 0
3. Faraday's Law of Induction: ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition: ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t

Right. Now, in our universe, the second equation, Gauss's Law for magnetism, says that the divergence of B is zero. That reflects the fact that there are no isolated magnetic poles. Because if there were, ∇·B would not be zero. So in this parallel universe where isolated poles exist, that equation must change.

Wait, but the question is which Maxwell's equations are different. So in our case, equation 2 is different. But the other equations—what about them?

Let me think. The first equation is about electric charge. If there's an isolated magnetic pole, that's like a monopole. So perhaps Maxwell's equations would have to incorporate magnetic charge as well. In our universe, magnetic monopoles aren't observed, so the equations don't include them.

So, in this scenario, I guess the equations would need to account for magnetic charge. Let me think about how that affects each equation.

In our case, equation 2 is ∇·B = 0. If magnetic monopoles exist, then ∇·B would be proportional to the magnetic charge density, similar to how ∇·E relates to electric charge density in equation 1. So equation 2 would change.

What about equation 3 and 4? Faraday's Law and Ampère's Law. Well, Faraday's Law in our equations has the curl of E equal to the negative rate of change of B. If there's a magnetic current, maybe that would affect this equation. Similarly, Ampère's Law relates the curl of B to the current and displacement current.

Wait, but wait. Maxwell's equations are symmetric in a way when you include magnetic monopoles. So if you have magnetic charges, you might modify two of the equations. Let me think. 

In our universe, Gauss's Law for B is ∇·B = 0. Ampère's Law (equation 4) and Faraday's Law (equation 3) are the other two. If magnetic monopoles exist, perhaps both equation 2 and equation 4 would change? Or maybe equation 3 and equation 4?

Wait, no. Let me think again. If there's a magnetic
