Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutations. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a barley cultivar that's drought-resistant but has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and found some mutations in the first exon. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene's function.

So, the intact gene sequence is given, and four mutants. I need to look for which mutation would likely inactivate the gene. Since the gene's product is anti-nutritional, disrupting it would be good.

Looking at the sequences, the beginning of the exon area is where the changes are. Let's compare each mutant.

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: Ends with ...CGT…TGA. Let me look at the change. Comparing the first part:
Intact starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTC...
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTC...
Wait, so looking for the differences. Let me line them up:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG TCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, maybe I should align the sequences to see where the mutations are.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to look for where the amino acid changes occur because a change in the coding sequence might disrupt the protein.

The initial part is the start codon ATG, which is methionine. Let's see the next codons.

In the intact gene, after ATG, the next codons would be TTT (Phe), then CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), etc.

Looking at Mutant 1:

ATG is same. Then the next codons are TTT, then CTA? Wait, wait. Let me find the exact position of the change.

Wait, the intact gene and mutant1's sequences are:

Intact: starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant1: starts with ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

So the first few nucleotides:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TTC TGT GGA TGA ...

Wait, maybe I should look for where the nucleotides are different. Let me compare each part:

Intact: ATG TTT C T C G C T G G T A C
