Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Wait, the question is asking about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. From what I remember, dithiocyanato would mean that the complex has two SCN- ions attached. Oh right, the complexes are probably [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ where n is the number of SCN- ligands.

The problem gives me the stability constants β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, and β4=16. Stability constants are used to determine the concentration of metal complexes in solution. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So, the order of stability here is β3 (63) being the most, then β2 (40), β1 (9), and β4 (16) is a bit tricky because 16 is lower than 40 but higher than 9. Wait, maybe I should list them in order: β3=63, β2=40, β4=16, β1=9. Oh wait, no, β4 is 16 which is higher than β1=9 but less than β2=40. So the order is β3 > β2 > β4 > β1.

Each β corresponds to the formation of a complex with a certain number of SCN- ions. So β1 is the stability constant for the monomeric complex, say [Co(SCN)]^2+; β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2]^0; β3 for [Co(SCN)_3]^–; and β4 for [Co(SCN)_4]^2–. Wait, maybe I should double-check that. Because the charge on the complex depends on the number of SCN- and Co^2+. Each SCN- is –1, so for each complex:

- [Co(SCN)]^2+: 1 SCN, charge is 2+ (2+ from Co, minus 1 from SCN → 1+? Wait, no, Co is +2, one SCN is –1, so total charge is +1? Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think: Co^2+ + SCN^- → [CoSCN]^+.

So for each complex, the charge is (2+) – (n) where n is number of SCN- ions. So for n=1, charge is +1; n=2, 0 (neutral); n=3, -1; n=4, -2.

But I'm not sure if that's necessary for this problem. Maybe the key point is that each β corresponds to a different complex. The question is about the dithiocyanato, which is n=2. So β2=40.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex. Oh, but wait, some of these complexes might be blue. I remember that in the cobalt thiocyanate complexes, the color changes with the number of ligands. For example, [Co(SCN)]^2+ is blue, [Co(SCN)_2] is a different color, maybe pink, and [Co(SCN)_3]^– is another. But I'm not certain
