Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which planet the researchers should prioritize observing for transits. Both planets are Earth-like and have been detected via the RV method, which means we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. The question is about the transit probability, so I need to find out which planet has a higher chance of transiting.

From what I remember, the transit probability depends on the size of the planet relative to its star and the alignment of its orbit with our line of sight. Oh wait, but wait, more specifically, the probability that a planet transits its star is given by the formula P ≈ (R_p / R_s)², but I'm not sure if that's the exact formula. Or maybe it's the ratio of the planet's orbital distance and the star's radius? Hmm. Wait, actually, the probability of a planet transiting is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (a/(R_s))²? No, maybe that's not right.

Wait, I think the transit probability (the chance that the planet's orbit is edge-on enough for us to see it passing in front) is actually given by the formula P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but that doesn't sound right either. Oh wait, I'm confusing it with the probability formula. Let me think again.

I recall that the probability of a transiting planet is approximately (R_p / R_s)², but that might not capture the whole picture. Alternatively, the actual formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by some function of the orbital distance. Wait, no, I think it's (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(a)²), but more accurately, perhaps the probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (1/(a))². Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the relative sizes. The transit happens when the planet's orbital plane is aligned edge-on with respect to us. The probability of that is higher when the planet is closer to the star because the chances of the alignment are better. Alternatively, the probability might depend on the star's size relative to the planet's orbital distance. 

Wait, I think the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_star + R_planet) / a, but actually, when R_planet is much smaller than R_star, it simplifies to R_star / a. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up what I remember.

Oh right, another approach: the transit probability is the ratio of the area of the star that the planet can cover, divided by the area it must cover to transit. Alternatively, it's the probability that the planet's orbit is aligned such that it passes in front of the star. The formula for the transit probability (for an edge-on orbit) is (R_p / a)^2 multiplied by (1 / (e sin i)), but since the orbits are circular (e=0), that's not applicable here. Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up with other aspects.

Wait, I think the key factors are the planet's orbital distance and the star's radius. The probability of a transit is higher when the planet's orbital distance is such that it's more likely to cross our line of sight. So, the probability is higher when the planet's orbital plane is more likely to be aligned edge-on, which depends on the star's size and the planet's orbital distance.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes: The probability that a planet transits its star is approximately P = (R_p + R_s) / a, but since R_p is much smaller than R_s, this simplifies to R_s / (a * sqrt(1 - e^2)), but since e=0 for both planets here, it's R_s / a. So P is proportional to R_s / a. Wait, but that can't be right because if a is larger, the probability is lower. Because a planet further out has a smaller chance of transiting, since the orbital plane has a lower probability of being edge-on relative to our line of sight. Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, no, the probability actually depends on the angle between the orbital plane and our line of sight. For a random alignment, the probability that the planet’s orbital plane is edge-on enough for a transit is given by (R_s / a). Because the star's radius R_s and the planet's orbital radius a determine the solid angle where the transit can occur. So, the probability P is proportional to (R_s / a) multiplied by (something else?).

Alternatively, I think the transit probability is given by (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by the probability that the orbital inclination is such that the planet transits. So the probability of transit P is given by (R_p / R_s)^2 * [ (R_* + R_p) / a ] ... Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, I think the correct formula is P ≈ (R_p / R_s)² * (1 / a), but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, I've heard that the transit probability is roughly (R_p / a)^2, but that doesn't seem right because R_p is much smaller than a.

Wait, no, I think the correct way is that the transit probability is approximately (R_p / R_s)² multiplied by (R_* / a)^2. Or is there a different approach?

Alternatively, perhaps the key point is that the probability of the planet transiting is higher when the planet is closer to the star. Because when a planet is closer, there's a higher chance that its orbit is edge-on enough for a transit. So, for a given star, a planet with a shorter orbital period (and hence closer in) would have a higher transit probability.

In the problem, Planet_1 has a shorter orbital period than Planet_2. So it's closer to its star. If the transit probability is higher for closer planets, then Planet_1 might have a higher probability to transit.

But wait, the host stars have the same radius, as given in the problem. Because both host stars have the same radii. So R_s is same for both stars.

So P is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 * (R_s / a)^2? Or wait, maybe the other way around.

Wait, another approach: The transit probability is the ratio of the planet's orbital distance over the star's radius. Because the area where the planet can transit (a circle of radius R_s + R_p) is compared to the area of the star. Hmm, no, perhaps it's the solid angle. The probability is given by (R_s / a)², since the solid angle is proportional to (R_s / a)^2.

Wait, no, the solid angle is 2π(1 - cos θ), where θ is the angle subtended by the star. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is within θ of our line of sight. The area where the planet can be in a transiting orbit is a circle on the celestial sphere with radius θ. The total possible orientations are the entire sphere, so the probability is (2π(1 - cosθ)) / (4π) ) = (1 - cosθ)/2. But θ is approximately R_s / a, so for small θ, cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2, so 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2. So the probability becomes approximately (θ²/2) / 2 = θ² /4. And θ is R_s/a, so θ² = (R_s/a)^2. So the probability is approximately (R_s/(2a))². So P ~ (R_s^2)/(4a²). But since R_s is same for both stars, it's inversely proportional to a squared. So for a smaller a (Planet_1), a^2 is smaller, so P is higher.

Wait, so the transit probability is higher for planets with smaller a, i.e., closer in. Because P is proportional to (1/a²). So Planet_1, being closer to its star (since its orbital period is shorter than Planet_2's), would have a higher a^{-2}, so higher P.

But wait, in the problem, the host stars have same R, so R_s is same for both. So the only variables are a for each planet.

Wait, but wait, Kepler's third law says that (a^3) / (P^2) = G(M_s) / (4π²). So a^3 = (G M_s P^2)/(4 π²). So a is proportional to (M_s * P^2)^(1/3).

So for each planet, a depends on the mass of the host star and the orbital period.

Given that Planet_1 has P1 = P, and Planet_2 has P2 = 3P. The host star of Planet_1 has mass M1 = 2 M2, where M2 is the mass of the host of Planet_2.

So let's compute a1 and a2.

a1 = [ G M1 P1^2 / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)
a2 = [ G M2 P2^2 / (4 π²) ]^(1/3)

Since G, 4π² are constants, we can write a1/a2 = [ (M1 / M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2) ) ]^(1/3)

M1 is 2 M2, so M1/M2 = 2.

P1 is P, P2 is 3P, so (P1^2 / P2^2) = (P^2)/(9 P^2) )= 1/9.

So a1/a2 = [ 2 * (1/9) ) ]^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3) ≈ 0.606.

So a1 is approximately 0.606 times a2.

Wait, so a1 = a2 * (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ a2 * 0.606.

So a1 is smaller than a2. So Planet_1 is closer to its star.

Since the transit probability is higher for smaller a, as we had earlier, Planet_1's probability to transit is higher than Planet_2's.

But wait, how much higher? Because the transit probability is proportional to (R_s / a)^2. Since R_s is the same for both, the ratio of their probabilities is (a2 / a1)^2.

Because P1 is proportional to (R_s/a1)^2 and P2 is (R_s/a2)^2. So P1/P2 = (a2/a1)^2.

We have a1 = a2 * 0.606, so a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

So P1/P2 = ( (a2)/a1 )^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

Wait, that would mean that Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the probability of transiting compared to Planet_2.

But wait, let me double-check the math.

Let me compute a1 and a2 more accurately.

Compute a1/a2:

a1/a2 = [ (M1/M2) * (P1^2 / P2^2) ) ]^(1/3) = (2 * (1/9) )^(1/3) = (2/9)^(1/3).

2/9 is approximately 0.2222. The cube root of 0.2222 is approximately 0.606. So a1 = 0.606 a2.

So a2 = a1 / 0.606 ≈ 1.65 a1.

Then, since P is proportional to 1/a^2, because transit probability is proportional to (R_s/a)^2. So P1 = (a2/a1)^2 * P2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. P is proportional to (R_s/a)^2. So P1 ∝ (R_s / a1)^2, P2 ∝ (R_s/a2)^2.

So P1/P2 = (a2^2)/(a1^2) = (a2/a1)^2.

Since a2 = a1 * (1 / 0.606) ≈ a1 * 1.65, then a2/a1 = 1.65.

So (a2/a1)^2 = (1.65)^2 ≈ 2.72.

So P1 is about 2.72 times higher than P2.

Therefore, the probability to transit is higher for Planet_1. So the researchers should choose Planet_1. Looking back at the options:

Option C says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~1.65 times higher.

Option D says Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher.

So based on our calculation, the correct answer is D: Planet_1 is preferred due to ~2.7 times higher probability.

But wait, wait a second. Let me double-check whether the transit probability is indeed proportional to (R_s/a)^2.

Another source I recall says that the probability of a planet transiting is approximately (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s/a)^2. Wait, that would make it P = (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (R_s^2 a^2) ) = (R_p^2) / a^2. But that can't be right because it would ignore the star's size.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for the transit probability is (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (R_s / a)^2. So P = (R_p^2 R_s^2) / (R_s^2 a^2) ) = (R_p^2) / a^2. No, that doesn't make sense either.

Wait, I think I'm getting mixed up with different factors. Let me try to find the correct formula for transit probability.

Upon checking, the transit probability (the chance of the planet transiting the star from our perspective) is given by:

P ≈ (R_p + R_s) / a

But since R_p << R_s, this approximates to (R_s / a).

So P is proportional to R_s / a.

Wait, but that would mean P is proportional to R_s / a, not (R_s / a)^2.

But earlier, I thought it's (R_s / a)^2. Hmm, which is correct?

Alternatively, I found a source that says the probability is (R_p + R_s) / (a) multiplied by (some function), but perhaps it's (R_p + R_s) / (a).

Wait, let me think in terms of geometry. The transit occurs when the planet's orbital plane is within a certain angle of our line of sight. The critical angle is determined by the star's radius and the planet's orbital radius.

The angle θ is given by θ = (R_s) / a.

The probability that the planet transits is the ratio of the area where the inclination is within θ to the total possible area for the inclination, which is 2π steradians (since the inclination can range from 0 to π radians). Wait, no, the area for a given angle is a circle on the celestial sphere, which has a solid angle of 2π(1 - cosθ).

So the probability is (2π(1 - cosθ)) / (4π) ) = (1 - cosθ)/2.

But for small θ, θ is R_s/a, so cosθ ≈ 1 - θ²/2. So 1 - cosθ ≈ θ²/2. So the probability becomes approximately (θ²/2) / 2 = θ²/4.

But θ is R_s/a, so θ² = (R_s/a)^2.

Thus, the probability P ≈ (R_s/a)^2 /4.

Wait, but that would make P proportional to (R_s/a)^2.

So in this case, since R_s is same for both stars, P is proportional to 1/(a^2).

Ah, so I think the initial approach was correct. So the transit probability is proportional to (R_s/a)^2.

So for each planet, since the host stars have same R_s, the probability is inversely proportional to a squared.

So, the planet with smaller a (Planet_1) will have higher P.

We found that a1 = approx 0.606 a2. So a1 is smaller, so (a2/a1) is about 1.65.

Thus, P1 = (a2/a1)^2 * P2.

Which is (1.65)^2 = 2.72 times higher.

So the probability for Planet_1 is about 2.7 times higher than Planet_2.

So the researchers should choose Planet_1, as it's more likely to transit.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1.65 times higher (that would be if a ratio was 1.65, but we have a square of 1.65, so 2.7 times.)

Option D: 2.7 times higher, so that's correct.


To determine which planet researchers should prioritize observing for transits, we analyze the transit probability for each planet. The transit probability depends on the alignment of the planet's orbital plane with our line of sight and is proportional to:

\[
P \propto \left(\frac{R_s}{a}\right)^2
\]

where \(R_s\) is the radius of the host star and \(a\) is the orbital distance of the planet. Since both host stars have the same radius (\(R_s\)), the transit probability is inversely proportional to \(a^2\). Thus, planets with smaller orbital distances (\(a\)) have higher transit probabilities.

### Step 1: Orbital Distance Ratio
Using Kepler's third law, the orbital distance \(a\) is proportional to:

\[
a \propto \left(M_s \cdot P^2\right)^{1/3}
\]

where \(M_s\) is the mass of the host star and \(P\) is the orbital period of the planet. For Planet_1 and Planet_2:

- Planet_1: \(M_{s1} = 2M_{s2}\), \(P_1 = P\)
- Planet_2: \(M_{s2}\), \(P_2 = 3P\)

The ratio of their orbital distances is:

\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \left(\frac{M_{s1} \cdot P_1^2}{M_{s2} \cdot P_2^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2 \cdot P^2}{1 \cdot (3P)^2}\right)^{1/3} = \left(\frac{2}{9}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.606
\]

Thus, \(a_1 \approx 0.606a_2\), meaning Planet_1 is closer to its star than Planet_2.

### Step 2: Transit Probability Ratio
Since the transit probability is proportional to \((R_s / a)^2\), the ratio of the transit probabilities for Planet_1 and Planet_2 is:

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^2
\]

Substituting \(a_2 = a_1 / 0.606\):

\[
\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \left(\frac{1}{0.606}\right)^2 \approx (1.65)^2 \approx 2.72
\]

Thus, Planet_1 has approximately 2.7 times the transit probability of Planet_2.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The researchers should prioritize observing Planet_1, as it has a significantly higher probability of transiting (~2.7 times higher than Planet_2).

### Final Answer:
Answer: D
