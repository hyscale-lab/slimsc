Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy problem. Let's read it again. So, there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. And the mass of Star_1 is also 1.5 times bigger. Wait, but how does mass relate to luminosity? Hmm. I remember that for stars, the luminosity isn't just about size; it also depends on temperature. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴. So without knowing the temperatures, maybe I need another approach.

The problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, that's the peak wavelength. I remember Wien's law, which says λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is the same for both stars, then their temperatures must be inversely proportional. Because if λ_max is the same, T is same? Wait no, Wien's law is λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if λ_max is same, then T is same. Oh, because Star_1 and Star_2 have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. That's an important point.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars' radial velocities are 0 and 700 km/s, respectively. Radial velocity is the speed towards or away from us. Oh, but when we observe stars, their Doppler shift affects the wavelengths we
