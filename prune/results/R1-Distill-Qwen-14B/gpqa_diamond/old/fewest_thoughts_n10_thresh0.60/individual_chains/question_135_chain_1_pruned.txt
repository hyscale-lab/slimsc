Okay, so I have this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step. I remember that when a particle decays, the products must satisfy certain conditions, like conservation laws and energy considerations. 

The question gives me a Lagrangian interaction term: L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (ῡ + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, wait, maybe I should parse this correctly. Oh, right, the interaction term is -λ f times the product of ψ_f, the fermion field, and (ῡ + X), which maybe is the Yukawa coupling term. So this term tells us which fermions the boson X interacts with. 

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So I need to find which fermions it can decay into. The possible decay products are pairs of fermions because X is a boson, which is a spin-0 particle, so it should decay into two particles. 

Looking at the options, each lists a set of possible decay pairs. The key is to figure out which fermions X can couple to. The Lagrangian term I'm looking at is -λ f ψ_f^dagger (ῡ + X) ψ_f. Wait, maybe I'm getting the notation wrong. Let me think again: the term might be something like λ f ψ_f^dagger X ψ_f, but the exact form isn't crucial as long as I remember that the coupling is proportional to the fermion masses. Oh wait, the standard Yukawa interaction is L = -g f ψ^† ψ X, where g is the coupling and f is the fermion mass. So if X is the boson, then the interaction is proportional to the mass of the fermion. 

That means that the coupling strength depends on the fermion mass. But for decay purposes, the important thing is whether the fermion is light enough that the boson X can decay into it. The mass of X is 6 GeV. So each decay product must have a combined mass less than or equal to 6 GeV.

Wait, but in pair production, each fermion has
