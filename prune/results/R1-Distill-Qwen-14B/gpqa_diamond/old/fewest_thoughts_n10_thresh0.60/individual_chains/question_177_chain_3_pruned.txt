Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and its mass is also 1.5 times larger. So, both radius and mass are scaled by the same factor. Then, the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, I remember that the peak wavelength of a black body emission is related to its temperature. The formula for that is Wien's Law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. So if the λ_max is the same for both stars, their temperatures must be the same. Because if λ_max is same, then T would be same since T is inversely proportional to λ_max. So both stars have the same temperature.

Next, the radial velocities are given. Star_1 has 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. But wait, how does radial velocity affect this problem? Oh, wait, the question is about luminosity. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness of a star, which depends on its radius and temperature. Radial velocity probably comes into play in some way, but maybe it's a red herring here because the problem says the stars radiate as black bodies and they computed the luminosity based on that. So perhaps the radial velocity is not directly affecting the calculation of luminosity in this context. Or maybe it's about Doppler shift affecting observed wavelength, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. That could imply that any Doppler shifts have been accounted for, so the peak wavelengths are the same in rest frames, which would mean same temperature.

So, the main factors affecting luminosity are radius and temperature. The formula for luminosity of a star (as a black body) is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both R and T are important, let's compute the luminosity ratio.

Wait, wait a minute. Star_1 has radius 1.5 times that of Star_2, R₁ = 1.5 R₂. And we just concluded that T₁ = T₂ because λ_max is same. So let's plug into the luminosity formula.

L₁ = 4π (R₁)^
