Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let me try to think it through. The question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they're asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of the function f.

Wait, I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the power distribution depends on the angle. For a dipole radiator, I think the radiation pattern has a specific dependence on θ. Oh right, the radiation from a dipole is maximum at the equator, which is θ=90 degrees, and it falls off as you move towards the poles (θ=0 or 180). The intensity pattern for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but wait, no, wait. Wait, that's the radiation pattern for an electric dipole. So the intensity is maximum at θ=90 degrees, and the intensity is zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180). But wait, in this problem, the charge distribution is spheroidal. Maybe it's approximated as a dipole? Or is it a quadrupole or something else?

Wait, the problem says it's oscillating and spheroid in shape. Spheroidal suggests that it's a prolate or oblate spheroid. But I think for oscillations along the axis, like a dipole, the radiation would be similar to a dipole's radiation. So perhaps we can model this as a dipole radiator.

The power per unit solid angle is f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A. So I need to find the fraction at θ=30 degrees. Let's think about the dipole radiation pattern. The intensity (or the power per unit solid angle) for a dipole is given by I(θ) proportional to ( (d^2φ/dθ^2 )^2 ) where φ is the potential, but more simply, the standard formula for the radiation intensity from a dipole is I ∝ (1 + cos²θ) / sin^4
