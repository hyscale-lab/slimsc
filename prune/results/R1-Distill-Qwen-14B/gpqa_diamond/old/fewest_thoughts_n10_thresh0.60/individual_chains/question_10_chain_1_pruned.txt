Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it. The question is asking which of the given exoplanets has the highest density. There are four options, a to d, and the choices are A to D, each corresponding to one of the options.

Wait, let me make sure I read the question right. It says, "Among the following exoplanets, which one has the highest density?" So I'm looking for the planet with the highest density value.

Looking at the options:

a) An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet. So this planet has the same mass and radius as Earth. Since Earth's density is known, this one's density should be the same as Earth's. Earth's density is about 5.5 g/cm³, I remember that from school.

b) A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³. Oh wait, but this one's density is given as 5.5 already. So it's less than Earth's? No, wait, Earth is 5.5, so this is same as Earth. But the mass is double. Hmm, but density is mass over volume. So if the mass is 2 Earth masses, but the density is same as Earth, then the volume must be double as well. So radius would be larger. But what's important here is the given density is 5.5, same as Earth's. So this planet's density is 5.5.

Wait
