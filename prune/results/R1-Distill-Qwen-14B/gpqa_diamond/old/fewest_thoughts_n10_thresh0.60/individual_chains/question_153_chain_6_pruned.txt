Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about Michael additions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through it step by step. 

The question has three parts (A, B, C) and I need to find the products for each, then match them with the options given. Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with reaction A: dimethyl malonate + methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate in the presence of NaOEt (sodium ethoxide) and EtOH (ethanol). I remember that the Michael addition involves a nucleophile attacking an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound. 

Wait, dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because of the enolate it can form. The enolate acts as the nucleophile. The other compound is an alpha-beta unsaturated ester. So the malonate's enolate would attack the beta position of the acrylate.

So the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate must be something like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OCH3. When the enolate from dimethyl malonate attacks the beta carbon (the CH2 part), it adds across the double bond. 

After the attack, the acrylate would have the malonate group added to it. So the product would have a new carbon-carbon bond between the malonate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the acrylate. 

Wait, what's the structure of dimethyl malonate? It's (CH2COOCH3)2, right? So the enolate would form at the central carbon. When it attacks, the two methyl groups from the dimethyl malonate would end up on adjacent carbons.

So the product should be a triester. Let me think: the acrylate has a p-tolyl group. After the addition, the product might have the structure where the malonate's two methyl esters are attached. Wait, maybe it's something like CH2-COOCH3 connected to another COOCH3 and the p-tolyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the structure becomes trimethyl 2-(p-tolyl)propane-1,1,3-tricarboxylate. That would make
