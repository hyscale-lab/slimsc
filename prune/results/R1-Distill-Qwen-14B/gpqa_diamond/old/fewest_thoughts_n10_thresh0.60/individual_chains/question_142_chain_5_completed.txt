Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in qubit space. The density matrix provided is ρ equals 1/2 times (|0><0| + |1><1|). The options are four points in a three-dimensional space, labeled A to D.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ><ψ|, but here it's a mixed state because of the 1/2 factor. Wait, no, actually, wait a second. Let me think again. If you have a density matrix that's a mixture of two projectors, each with a certain weight, then it's a mixed state.

Wait, the given ρ is actually (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. So that's the same as (|0><0| )/2 + (|1><1|)/2. So each term has a weight of 1/2. That would mean that the state is a classical mixture of the states |0> and |1>, each with 50% probability. But wait, are |0> and |1> orthogonal? Yes, they are, so the density matrix is a diagonal matrix with 1/2 in the (0,0) and (1,1) positions, and zeros elsewhere.

I think the question is about where this state lies geometrically in the Bloch sphere representation. Because for a single qubit, the state can be represented as a vector on the Bloch sphere. For pure states, the vector has a length of 1. Mixed states would be inside the Bloch sphere.

Wait, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. Each pure state is a point on the surface of a unit sphere. Mixed states are represented as points inside the sphere, with the distance from the origin representing the purity of the state. But how does the density matrix relate to the Bloch vector?

I recall that any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Pauli matrices. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where r is a vector in R^3 (the Bloch vector) and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. So for a given ρ, we can find r by this equation.

Let me write that down:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z) / 2.

So if I can express the given ρ in terms of I and the Pauli matrices, then I can find the components of r.

The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute this. The |0><0| matrix is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. So ρ is (I)/2.

Wait a second, so ρ = I/2. Now, according to the general form, ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So we have I/2 = (I + r·σ)/2.

Subtracting I/2 from both sides gives 0 = (r·σ)/2. So r·σ must be zero, meaning r is the zero vector. Because if a vector dotted with σ is zero, each component must be zero.

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check. The state ρ is a completely mixed state. In the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the origin, which has r=(0,0,0). Because the density matrix I/2 represents maximal mixing, so the Bloch vector should have zero magnitude.

Yes, that makes sense. So the geometrical position in the qubits space (the Bloch sphere) is at the origin.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a classical mixture of the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), each with a probability of \(1/2\). To determine its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a single qubit, the Bloch vector \(r = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is related to the density matrix by the formula:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + r_x \sigma_x + r_y \sigma_y + r_z \sigma_z \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix and \(\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z\) are the Pauli matrices. Substituting the given \(\rho\) into this formula, we find:

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right) = \frac{I}{2}.
\]

Comparing this with the general form, we see that \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\) implies \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\). Thus, the Bloch vector \(r\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the origin in the Bloch sphere. This represents the completely mixed state, which is consistent with the given density matrix.

From the options provided:
- **A)** \(r = (1, 1, 0)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.
- **B)** \(r = (0, 0, 1)\): Incorrect, as this would represent a different state.
- **C)** \(r = (0, 0, 0)\): Correct, as this matches the completely mixed state.
- **D)** \(r = (1, 1, 1)\): Incorrect, as this does not correspond to the given density matrix.

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.

Answer: C
