Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it carefully.

The question says that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. Also, Star_1's mass is 1.5 times that of Star_2. The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. They also measured the radial velocities as 0 and 700 km/s for Star_1 and Star_2 respectively. The question is about the factor by which Star_1's luminosity is greater than Star_2's. And they assume the stars radiate as black bodies.

Hmm. So, I remember that the luminosity of a star can be determined using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, which is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the effective temperature, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. Since both stars are black bodies, this should apply.

But wait, the problem gives us the wavelengths where they appear brightest. Oh right, for a black body, the wavelength at which the emission is a maximum (λ_max) is given by Wien's law: λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant (~2.8977719×10^-3 m·K). So, if both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. So T1 = T2. Interesting.

Wait, but wait a minute. The radial velocities are given, 0 for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. How does that come into play here? Oh, radial velocity might affect the observed wavelength due to the Doppler effect. Because if a star is moving towards or away from us, the observed wavelength shifts. But in this case, since the question says the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same, I think that refers to their emitted wavelengths, not the observed ones. Or maybe it's the observed wavelengths. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says, "the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same." So that's the observed maximum emission wavelength. So, if a star is moving, it would cause a shift in the observed wavelength. So if Star_2 is moving towards us at 7
