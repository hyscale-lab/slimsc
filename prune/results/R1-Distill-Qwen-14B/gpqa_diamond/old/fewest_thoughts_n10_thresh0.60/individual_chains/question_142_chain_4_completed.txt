Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). Wait, that looks familiar. I think this is the maximally mixed state for a qubit. So, in the Bloch sphere representation, which I think is a geometric way to visualize qubit states, the maximally mixed state would correspond to the completely depolarized state, right?

I recall that pure states are on the surface of the Bloch sphere, while mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state, which maximizes the mixture, would be at the center of the sphere. Because if you have a completely mixed state, it's like being in a completely random direction, so the vector points to the origin.

So, the Bloch vector representation comes into play here. I remember that any single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector components. The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices and r is the Bloch vector (rx, ry, rz). 

Let me write out the given ρ. It's (|0><0| + |1><1|)/2. Let's compute each term. |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. So ρ is (I)/2. 

Wait, but the general form is (I + r·σ)/2. So setting ρ equal to that, I get (I + r·σ)/2 = I/2. So that implies that r·σ must be zero. Because when I subtract I/2 from both sides, I get (r·σ)/2 = 0, so r·σ = 0 matrix. 

What does r·σ equal? The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So r·σ = rxσx + ryσy + rzσz. For this to be zero, each component must be zero. So rx = ry = rz = 0. Therefore, the Bloch vector is (0,0,0), which is the origin.

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0), so that must be the answer. That makes sense because the maximally mixed state is at the center of the Bloch sphere.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents the maximally mixed state for a single qubit. In the Bloch sphere representation, pure states lie on the surface of the sphere, while mixed states are inside. The maximally mixed state corresponds to the completely depolarized state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere, corresponding to the origin (0,0,0).

To confirm this, recall that any single-qubit density matrix can be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z)\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector. For the given \(\rho\), we have \(\rho = \frac{I}{2}\), which implies that \(\mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} = 0\). This requires \(r_x = r_y = r_z = 0\), so the Bloch vector is \(\mathbf{r} = (0,0,0)\).

Thus, the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space is at the origin.
