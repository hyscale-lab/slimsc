Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species in the solution. The solution has Co(II) ions and thiocyanate ions. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, wait. I think the stability constant (β) is the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex from its ions. So, for each complex, the higher the β, the more stable the complex.

So, the complexes would form stepwise. The first complex would be Co(SCN)_1^+, then Co(SCN)_2, Co(SCN)_3, and Co(SCN)_4. Each β represents the step from the previous complex. So β1 is K1, β2 is K2, etc.

But wait, another point: the problem is about dithiocyanato complexes, which I think means complexes with two SCN- ligands. So they're referring to Co(SCN)_2^+ perhaps? Or maybe Co(SCN)_3^2+? Wait, no, the problem says "dithiocyanato" which implies two SCN groups attached.

Wait, the blue complexes are usually the higher ones. For example, [Co(SCN)_6]^3- is the intensely colored one, but maybe in this case, the dithiocyanato is a specific complex. Oh well, the problem says 'blue dithiocyanato' so probably it's the Co(SCN)_2^+ complex, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The dithiocyanato would have two SCN- ions attached. So perhaps the blue complex is the one with two SCN- ligands, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different one, but the question is about the percentage of the blue ones, which are the dithiocyanato complexes.

Wait, okay, I think I should model the problem. The problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (probably with two SCN- ions) among all the Co species.

But wait, let me get the problem right. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So I'm assuming that the blue complex is a particular one, perhaps Co(SCN)_2^+ or Co(SCN)_3^2+ maybe. But maybe the problem just refers to any dithiocyanato complex, but perhaps it's the second one, with two SCN- ions.

Wait, the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each β represents the formation of a complex with n SCN- groups. So β1 is for CoSCN+ (n=1), β2 for Co(SCN)2^3+ (n=2?), wait no, wait, the charges would change based on the number of SCN- attached. Co^2+ has a +2 charge; each SCN- has -1. So for Co(SCN)_n^(2-n+). Wait, wait, no. Let me think: when you form a complex like Co(SCN)_n, the charge would be 2+ + n*(-1) = 2 -n.

Wait, so for n=1: Co(SCN)^+ (charge +1). For n=2: Co(SCN)_2^0 (neutral). For n=3: Co(SCN)_3^- (charge -1). For n=4: Co(SCN)_4^2- (charge -2). Hmm, but the stability constants are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So each step is adding another SCN- to the previous complex.

The overall formation constant for the nth complex would be the product of the β's up to that step. So for the first complex, K1=β1=9. The second complex, K2=β1*β2=9*40=360. For the third, K3=β1*β2*β3=9*40*63=22680. The fourth, K4=β1*β2*β3*β4=9*40*63*16= 9*40 is 360, 360*63=22680, 22680*16=362880.

Wait, but the formation constants would be for each successive complex, right. So the total concentration of all Co species would be the sum of each complex's concentration plus the free Co^2+.

But in this problem, the solution has Co^2+ and SCN- at certain concentrations, and we're to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So I think the dithiocyanato would be the Co(SCN)_2^0 complex, which has two SCN- attached. So that's the species we're interested in.

So the plan is to calculate the concentration of Co(SCN)_2^0 relative to all other Co species.

But wait, the problem says "the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt containing species." So all cobalt species include Co^2+ and all the complexes (n=1,2,3,4). So I need to compute the fraction of the [Co(SCN)_2^0] concentration relative to the sum of all Co species.

But how do I calculate the distribution of each species given the stability constants and the concentrations of Co^2+ and SCN^-?

I think it's a problem of log K's and using the formation constants to find the fraction of each species. Alternatively, perhaps using the method of successive approximations or the approximation based on the relative sizes of the formation constants.

Wait, but the approach would involve considering each complex's formation step by step and determining their concentrations relative to the free Co^2+.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formation constants and the concentrations to compute the fraction of each complex.

But this can get complicated because each stability constant affects the distribution.

Wait, another thought: the formation constants are given for each step. So the fraction of each complex can be determined relative to the free ion. But considering that each complex's formation depends on the concentration of SCN-.

Wait, the general approach is to express the fraction of each complex as a function of the formation constants and the ligand (SCN-) concentration.

But given that the ligand concentration is high (0.1 M), the higher complexes will tend to form more.

Each complex's concentration can be found using the formula:

[CoL_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [L]^n / (1 + sum over all m<=n of β_m [L]^m [Co^2+])

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the fraction of each complex relative to the free ion, considering the ligand concentration.

Wait, but given that the ligand concentration is much higher than the metal ion concentration, maybe the higher complexes are more prevalent. Let's see, the total [Co] is 1e-2 M, and [SCN] is 0.1 M, which is 10 times higher. So perhaps the higher complexes are more populated.

But to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex (n=2?), we'll need to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2^0] among all species.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to model the distribution using the stepwise approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each complex's concentration using the formation constants.

Let me outline the complexes:

n=0: Co^2+ (free ion)
n=1: Co(SCN)^+
n=2: Co(SCN)_2^0
n=3: Co(SCN)_3^-
n=4: Co(SCN)_4^2-

The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all these species: [Co^2+] + [Co(SCN)^+] + [Co(SCN)_2^0] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-} ] = 1e-2 M.

The thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M, but as SCN- is a ligand, each complex uses 'n' SCN- per Co.

But wait, the total SCN- concentration is given as 0.1 M. So in solution, most of the SCN- is uncomplexed, but some is tied up in the complexes.

Wait, but when calculating the distribution, perhaps it's better to consider the formation of each complex step by step, using the stability constants and the concentrations.

Wait, perhaps the idea is to use the formation constants and the given concentrations to compute the ratio of each complex. Let me think about the general approach.

The fraction of each complex can be calculated using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=0}^n β_m [L]^m )

But wait, no. Actually, the general expression is that for each complex, the fraction is (β_n [L]^n) divided by the sum of all β_m [L]^m for m from 0 to n, plus the free metal ion.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the fraction of each species is given by:

f_n = (β_n [L]^n ) / (1 + sum_{k=1}^n β_k [L]^k )

Wait, no, because for each complex, [CoL_n] = β_n [Co^2+] [L]^n / (1 + sum_{m=0}^n β_m [L]^m )

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Let me think: the total concentration of Co is [Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [CoL] + [CoL2] + ... + [CoLn].

Each [CoLn] can be written as β_n [Co^2+] [L]^n / (1 + sum_{m=1}^n (β_m [L]^m )) )

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the stepwise formation.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to consider the cumulative formation constants. Let me define K1=β1, K2=β1β2, K3=β1β2β3, K4=β1β2β3β4.

Then, the fraction of each species can be calculated as (K_n [L]^n) / (1 + sum_{m=0}^n K_m [L]^m )

Wait, but that's a bit unclear. Another approach is to use the approximation that when the ligand concentration is high, the higher complexes dominate, but perhaps in this case, with [SCN] = 0.1 M, and [Co] = 0.01 M, the complexes may not all form significantly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the fraction of each complex using the formula:

f_n = (β_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 β3 [SCN]^3 + ... )

But wait, I'm not sure. Another way is to model the distribution using the formation constants and the given concentrations.

Let me try to write expressions for each species. Let's denote:

[Co^2+] = c
[Co(SCN)^+] = c1 = β1 * c * [SCN]
[Co(SCN)_2^0] = c2 = β2 * c1 * [SCN] = β1 β2 c [SCN]^2
[Co(SCN)_3^-] = c3 = β3 * c2 * [SCN] = β1 β2 β3 c [SCN]^3
[Co(SCN)_4^2-] = c4 = β4 * c3 * [SCN] = β1 β2 β3 β4 c [SCN]^4

Wait, no, because each step is adding another SCN. So the formula would be:

c1 = β1 * c * [SCN]
c2 = β2 * c1 * [SCN] = β1 β2 c [SCN]^2
c3 = β3 * c2 * [SCN] = β1 β2 β3 c [SCN]^3
c4 = β4 * c3 * [SCN] = β1 β2 β3 β4 c [SCN]^4

But the denominator for each is the sum of all previous terms plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to write each [CoLn] as (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co^2+] [SCN]^n divided by (1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2...βn [SCN]^n )

Wait, that seems plausible. So the denominator is the sum from m=0 to m=4 of K_m [SCN]^m, where K_0=1, K_1=β1, K_2=β1β2, etc.

Because when you form each complex step by step, each new complex is formed by adding another SCN to the previous complex.

So the total concentration is:

[Co_total] = [Co^2+] + [CoL^+] + [CoL2^0] + [CoL3^-] + [CoL4^2-]

Which is:

c_total = c + c1 + c2 + c3 + c4

But each c1 is (β1 c [L])/(1 + K1 [L] + K2 [L]^2 + K3 [L]^3 + K4 [L]^4 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the fractions.

The fraction of each species is (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [L]^4 )

So for each n, the fraction f_n = (K_n [L]^n) / D, where D is the denominator sum.

So for the problem, [L] is 0.1 M. Let me compute each term in the denominator.

Compute K for each n:

n=0: K0 = 1
n=1: K1 = β1 =9
n=2: K2= β1 β2=9*40=360
n=3: K3=β1 β2 β3=360 *63=22680
n=4: K4=β1 β2 β3 β4=22680 *16=362880

Now, compute each term in the denominator: K_n [L]^n.

[L] =0.1, so [L]^n:

n=0: 1
n=1: 0.1
n=2: 0.01
n=3: 0.001
n=4: 0.0001

So:

Term for n=0: K0 [L]^0 =1 *1=1
n=1: K1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9
n=2: K2 [L]^2=360 * 0.01=3.6
n=3: K3 [L]^3=22680 *0.001=22.68
n=4: K4 [L]^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

Wait, but wait: let me compute each term:

For n=0, term=1 * (0.1)^0=1.

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: 360 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

n=3: 22680 * (0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68

n=4: 362880 * (0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288

So the denominator D is the sum of all these terms: 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = let's calculate:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468

So D=64.468.

Now, the fractions for each species are:

f0 = 1 / D = 1/64.468 ≈0.01551 (1.551%)

f1=0.9 / D≈0.9/64.468≈0.014 (approx 1.4%)

f2=3.6/D≈3.6/64.468≈0.05557 (~5.557%)

f3=22.68/64.468≈0.3519 (~35.19%)

f4=36.288/64.468≈0.5629 (~56.29%)

Wait, but wait a second. These fractions add up to 0.0155+0.014+0.05557+0.3519+0.5629 ≈ 0.9998, which is roughly 1, so that makes sense.

But wait, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. So which of these is the dithiocyanate? Well, the dithiocyanato would be the complex with two SCN- ligands, which is Co(SCN)_2^0. So that's n=2, which has f2≈5.557%.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest to 5.5% isn't one of the options. The options are A)42.3%, B)25.6%, C)38.1%, D)16.9%.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because according to this calculation, the dithiocyanato (n=2) has about 5.5% which is not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I got the wrong 'n' for the dithiocyanato complex. Let me think again. Dithiocyanato implies two SCN- ligands, so n=2. But maybe the blue complex is a different one, perhaps higher.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me double-check.

Wait, the denominator D sums the terms for each K_n [L]^n, which I calculated as 1 +0.9+3.6+22.68+36.288=64.468. Let me check each step:

n=0 term: 1.

n=1 term: β1*(0.1)=9*(0.1)=0.9.

n=2 term: β1*β2*(0.1)^2=9*40*(0.01)= 360 *0.01=3.6.

n=3 term: β1β2β3*(0.1)^3=9*40*63*(0.001)= 22680 *0.001=22.68.

n=4 term: β1β2β3β4*(0.1)^4=9*40*63*16*(0.0001)=362880 *0.0001=36.288.

Sum: 1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468. That's correct.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6/64.468≈0.05557, which is about 5.56%, which is not among the options. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe the β values are for the formation of the nth complex from the (n-1)th, but perhaps I'm using them correctly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the complexes are Co(SCN)_n^(2-n+), and the approach I'm using is correct, but perhaps the question is considering the dithiocyanato as the fourth complex or another.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the definition of 'dithiocyanato'. Wait, perhaps dithiocyanato refers to the complex with two SCN- ions, but perhaps it's a neutral complex, which would be n=2, but maybe the problem refers to a different one.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the fractions. Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is to calculate the ratio of [Co(SCN)_2] to the sum of all [Co species], including the free Co^2+.

Wait, but according to the calculation, f2 is about 5.5%, which is not matching the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding which complex is considered the blue dithiocyanato.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering any complex with two SCN- ions, regardless of charge, but that's the same as n=2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the Co(SCN)_4^2- complex as the blue one, but that would be n=4, which has a fraction of ~56%.

But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formation constants are given for the overall complex, not stepwise.

Wait, maybe I've misapplied the β values. Wait, the problem says the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So β1 is for Co(SCN), β2 is for Co(SCN)_2, etc. So the overall formation constant for Co(SCN)_n would be the product up to βn.

Wait, but in that case, the fraction for each complex would be:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n) / ( [Co^2+] + β1 [Co^2+][SCN] + β1β2 [Co^2+][SCN]^2 + ... + β1β2β3β4 [Co^2+][SCN]^4 )

But [Co^2+] is a common factor in numerator and denominator, so it can be canceled out. So the fractions are independent of [Co^2+], which makes sense because the stability is a function of ligand concentration.

Wait, but in any case, according to the calculation, the percentage of the dithiocyanato (n=2) is about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting which complex is the blue one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the dithiocyanato as the complex with four SCN- ions, perhaps. Or maybe it's the third complex.

Wait, perhaps the blue complex is the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which would be n=4. Then the fraction would be about 56%, but that's not matching the options either.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the Co(SCN)_3^- complex as the blue one. Let's see, the fraction for n=3 is about 35.19%, which would be around 35%, but the options don't include that either.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for the fractions. Maybe the fractions are calculated considering that each complex's concentration is the product of the previous β and the ligand concentration.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the fraction of the nth complex is:

f_n = (β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n) / (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [L]^n )

Which is what I did earlier. So the calculation seems correct, but it's not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator. Let me recompute the terms.

Wait, let's recalculate each term:

n=0: 1 *1 =1

n=1: β1 * [L] =9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: β1*β2 [L]^2=9*40 * (0.1)^2=360 *0.01=3.6

n=3: 9*40*63 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

n=4:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4= (9*40=360; 360*63=22680; 22680 *16=362880) * 0.0001=36.288.

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Denominator D=64.468.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468≈0.05557 or 5.557%.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something in the problem statement.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem states that the stability constants are for the complexes Co(SCN)_n^(n+2−), but perhaps I should consider the charges. Wait, but the way the problem is given, it's the β values for each step, so I think my approach is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the dithiocyanato complex as the one with four ligands, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the fractions. Let me check each step again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the first two complexes, but that doesn't seem to make sense.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is between the number of ligands and the number of steps. Because each β is the stepwise constant, so β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. So the dithiocyanate would be n=2.

But according to the calculation, the fraction is about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the denominator.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (1 + β1 [L] + β1 β2 [L]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [L]^3 + β1 β2 β3 β4 [L]^4 )

Which is exactly what I did. So I'm confident that the fractions are correct.

Hmm, so perhaps the problem is considering the Co(SCN)_3^- complex as the dithiocyanate? No, that's three ligands.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding. The question says "dithiocyanato" which means two SCN- groups. So the complex is Co(SCN)_2^0.

But according to the calculation, the percentage is about 5.5%, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the stability constants are given in a different way. Maybe β1 is the overall constant for the first complex, β2 for the second, etc. So maybe the formation constants are not cumulative, but for each step, but perhaps the approach is to multiply all the βs up to that point.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem expects the calculation of the fraction of the dithiocyanato complex considering only the first two complexes. Let me think: perhaps the sum is up to n=2, but that would make the denominator smaller.

Wait, but the denominator is sum from n=0 to 4, which includes all possible complexes. So I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of the dithiocyanato complexes, which includes both the n=2 and n=3? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong order of the βs. The problem gives β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. Wait, but β3 is higher than β2. Let me check: β1=9, β2=40. So β2=40 is higher than β1=9. Then β3=63, which is higher than β2, and β4=16, which is lower than β3.

Wait, perhaps this is an issue because the β4 is lower than β3. So the fourth complex is less stable than the third. So perhaps the [Co(SCN)_4^2-] is not as high as the third. But in my calculation, n=4 has a higher fraction because the K4 is much larger. But perhaps this isn't correct because β4 is lower.

Wait, no, because K4 = β1 β2 β3 β4 =9*40*63*16=362,880. Even though β4 is lower than β3, the product may still be larger than the previous terms.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that the β4 is lower than β3, which may cause the fourth complex to not be as prevalent as I thought.

Hmm, but according to the calculation, the fourth complex has the highest fraction at 56.29%, which seems high but possible given the high K4.

But the problem's options don't include any option near 5.5% or 56%.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of all dithiocyanato complexes, which could include n=2 and n=3 and n=4, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way the fractions are calculated. Wait, perhaps the formula should be (β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of all terms including [Co^2+].

Wait, perhaps I should model it as:

The fraction for each complex is (β1 β2 ... βn [Co^2+] [SCN]^n) / ( [Co^2+] ( 1 + β1 [SCN] + β1 β2 [SCN]^2 + ... + β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n ) )

Which simplifies to (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN]^n) / (1 + β1 [SCN] + ... + β1 ... βn [SCN]^n )

Which is what I did earlier. So perhaps the approach is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is not about the n=2 complex, but about the [Co(SCN)_4]^2- complex, which has a fraction of 56.29%, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the sum of n=2 and n=3, which is 5.557% +35.19% =40.74%, which is close to option A)42.3%. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the dithiocyanato is the [Co(SCN)_3]^− complex. So if the fraction is 35.19%, which is close to option C)38.1% but not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to consider only the first two steps, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator. Let me recompute the denominator.

Wait, let me recompute each term with the given βs:

n=0: 1 *1=1

n=1: 9 *0.1=0.9

n=2:9 *40 * (0.1)^2= 360 *0.01=3.6

n=3:9*40*63 * (0.1)^3=22680 *0.001=22.68

n=4:9*40*63*16 * (0.1)^4=362880 *0.0001=36.288

Sum:1+0.9=1.9; +3.6=5.5; +22.68=28.18; +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the percentage of the dithiocyanato and other higher complexes, but I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the number of ligands. Perhaps the dithiocyanato is the fourth complex, which has four ligands. But that would imply n=4, which has a fraction of 56.29%, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the dithiocyanato as the [Co(SCN)_3]^− complex, which is n=3, with a fraction of 35.19% (~35%), but the closest option is C)38.1%, which is a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the denominator.

Wait, let me recheck the denominator:

Sum = 1 + 0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288.

1+0.9=1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting us to calculate the fraction using a different approach, perhaps without considering all the terms beyond a certain n.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem assumes that only the first three complexes are significant, and the fourth can be ignored. Let me see what that would give.

So, the denominator would be 1+0.9+3.6+22.68=28.18.

Then,

n=2:3.6/28.18≈0.1277 or 12.77%.

n=3:22.68/28.18≈0.805 or 80.5%.

But that's still not matching any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the fraction of the dithiocyanato (n=2), considering only up to n=3.

Wait, but that would give a different denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miscalculating the [L]^n terms. Let me check again: [L]=0.1 M.

n=0: 1

n=1: 0.1

n=2: 0.01

n=3:0.001

n=4: 0.0001

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is referring to the n=3 complex as the dithiocyanato, but that doesn't make sense because it has three ligands.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the way the βs are used. Maybe the βs are given for each complex, not stepwise. For example, β1 is for the first complex (n=1), β2 for n=2, etc. So the fraction for each complex would be (β_n [L]^n) / (sum of all β_m [L]^m + 1 )

Wait, that would mean:

For n=0: 1

n=1: β1 [L] =9*0.1=0.9

n=2: β2 [L]^2=40*(0.1)^2=0.4

n=3: β3 [L]^3=63*(0.1)^3=0.063

n=4: β4 [L]^4=16*(0.1)^4= 16 *0.0001=0.0016

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

Now, the fraction for n=2 is 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, which is about 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but that approach uses each β as the overall constant for that complex, not the stepwise. But that's different from the earlier approach.

Wait, in this scenario, each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise. So for example, β1=9 is the formation constant for Co(SCN), β2=40 is for Co(SCN)_2, etc.

In this case, the denominator is sum of each βn [L]^n plus 1.

So let's compute this approach:

n=0:1

n=1: β1 [L] =9 *0.1=0.9

n=2: β2 [L]^2=40*(0.01)=0.4

n=3: β3 [L]^3=63*(0.001)=0.063

n=4: β4 [L]^4=16*(0.0001)=0.0016

Sum:1 +0.9=1.9; +0.4=2.3; +0.063=2.363; +0.0016=2.3646.

So the denominator D=2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is 0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, which is 16.9%, which is option D.

But wait, this approach assumes that each βn is the overall formation constant for the nth complex, not the stepwise. But in reality, stepwise βs are used for each addition. So which approach is correct?

The problem states that the stability constants are β1=9, β2=40, etc. So in the standard approach, these are stepwise βs, meaning β1 is for the first ligand, β2 for the second, etc. So the earlier approach should be correct, but that gives 5.5% for n=2, which isn't an option.

But using the overall βs for each complex (assuming β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2) gives a fraction of 16.9%, which is option D.

But that's a significant difference. So which approach is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the problem is using the βs as overall constants for each complex. Because the problem states "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63 and β4=16." So β1 is the overall constant for [Co(SCN)], β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

In that case, the denominator is sum (βn [SCN]^n) + 1, and the fraction for each complex is (βn [SCN]^n) / denominator.

So for n=2, β2=40, [SCN]^2=0.01, so 40 *0.01=0.4.

Denominator sum:1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016=2.3646.

So f2=0.4/2.3646≈0.169 or 16.9%, which is option D.

But this seems to be the case that leads to one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the βs as the overall constants for each complex, not stepwise. So in that case, the calculation would give 16.9% for the dithiocyanato (n=2) complex.

So perhaps that's the intended approach, even though in reality βs are stepwise.

Thus, the correct answer would be D)16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the distribution of cobalt species using the given stability constants and concentrations. The stability constants provided are β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16, which are interpreted as the overall stability constants for the complexes [Co(SCN)], [Co(SCN)₂], [Co(SCN)₃], and [Co(SCN)₄], respectively. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the thiocyanate concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Fraction of Each Complex**: The fraction of each cobalt species is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n [\text{SCN}]^n}{1 + \sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]
   where \([\text{SCN}] = 0.1 \, \text{M}\), and \(\beta_0 = 1\) (representing the free Co²⁺ ion).

2. **Terms in the Denominator**:
   - \(n = 0\): \(\beta_0 [\text{SCN}]^0 = 1\)
   - \(n = 1\): \(\beta_1 [\text{SCN}]^1 = 9 \times 0.1 = 0.9\)
   - \(n = 2\): \(\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2 = 40 \times (0.1)^2 = 0.4\)
   - \(n = 3\): \(\beta_3 [\text{SCN}]^3 = 63 \times (0.1)^3 = 0.063\)
   - \(n = 4\): \(\beta_4 [\text{SCN}]^4 = 16 \times (0.1)^4 = 0.0016\)

   The denominator is the sum of these terms:
   \[
   D = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]

3. **Fraction of the Dithiocyanato Complex**: The dithiocyanato complex corresponds to \(n = 2\), [Co(SCN)₂]. Its fraction is:
   \[
   f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [\text{SCN}]^2}{D} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
   \]
   Converting to a percentage:
   \[
   f_2 \times 100 \approx 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt-containing species is approximately **16.9%**.
