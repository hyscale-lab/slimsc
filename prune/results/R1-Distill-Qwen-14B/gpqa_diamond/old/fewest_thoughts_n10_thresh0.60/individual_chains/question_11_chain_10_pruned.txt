Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about SARS-CoV-2 molecular biology. It's a bit tough, but let me try to think it through. The question asks which statement is incorrect, so I have to find the exception among the options.

Let me start by reviewing each option one by one. I remember that SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus, so I should recall what I know about their structure and replication.

Option A: It says that nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN work as heterodimers in a mismatch repair. Wait, I remember that coronaviruses have a replication proofreading mechanism. The ExoN is an exonuclease, right? I think nsp10 usually pairs with nsp14 to form the exonuclease complex. Oh wait, the statement says nsp14's N-terminal ExoN binds to nsp10. So their complex prevents dsRNA breakdown. But I thought that the exonuclease activity is part of the replication machinery to correct errors. Wait, maybe the statement is wrong. Because I remember that nsp10 and nsp14 form a heterodimer, but ExoN is in nsp14. So the statement says that nsp10 and nsp14-ExoN are heterodimers, which is correct. But the next part says it prevents breakdown of dsRNA. Wait, the exonuclease should remove nucleotides, so maybe it's the other way around? Or perhaps I'm mixing up
