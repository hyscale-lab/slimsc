Okay, so I've got this physics question here about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that in our real world, magnets always have both poles, right? Like, you can't just have a single pole, you need both North and South. But in this question, that's not the case—they can have isolated poles.

Wait, Maxwell's equations... I think they describe how electric and magnetic fields work. There are four equations, right? Let me try to remember them. The four equations are about the divergence of E and B fields, the curl of E and B, and Gauss's laws for E and B.

In our universe, one of the Maxwell equations says that the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. So ∇·B = 0. That means there are no isolated magnetic poles because the sources (like monopoles) would contribute to this divergence. But in this universe, magnets can have isolated poles, so maybe that equation changes.

Wait, so if isolated magnetic poles (monopoles) exist, how does that affect Maxwell's equations? Oh right, because in our world, ∇·B = 0 because there are no monopoles. But if monopoles exist, that term would not be zero. So the equation would change to ∇·B = something, like rho_m (magnetic charge density), maybe?

So looking at the options, the first equation that would change is the one about the divergence of the magnetic field. But wait, the question is which equations are different. Because Maxwell's equations include both the divergence and the curl parts.

Wait, Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = rho/epsilon_0 (Gauss's law for electric fields)
2. ∇·B = 0 (no magnetic monopoles)
3. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's Law)
4. ∇×B = μ0 (J + epsilon_0 ∂E/∂t) (Ampère's Law with Maxwell's addition)

So if isolated magnetic poles exist, equation 2 would change. Now, for equation 3, Faraday's Law, which involves the curl of E. Does that also change?

Wait, if there are magnetic charges, maybe there
