Okay, so I've got this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember rhombohedral is one of the crystal structures, right? It's kind of like a cube that's been deformed or something. The question gives me some parameters: interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Wait, noâ€”rhombohedral usually has all angles equal, but I think in the case of a rhombohedral structure, it's either acute or obtuse. Oh well, the angles here are 30 degrees each.

The question asks for the interplanar distance of the (111) plane. Interplanar distance, right, that's the distance between adjacent planes in the crystal lattice. I remember that interplanar distances are calculated using the unit cell dimensions and the Miller indices of the plane.

Wait, but in a rhombohedral system, the unit cell is a rhombohedron, which has all edges equal and all angles equal. So for a rhombohedral crystal, the lattice is a special case of a hexagonal or something? Or is it a separate system? I think it's one of the seven crystal systems, so yeah, rhombohedral.

I think the formula for interplanar distance d(hkl) is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) - (h^2 + k^2 + l^2)(cos^2(alpha) + cos^2(beta) + cos^2(gamma))/2 + (cos(alpha)cos(beta)cos(gamma)) ) ).

Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Alternatively, I remember that for a cubic system, the formula is simpler because all angles are 90 degrees. The general formula for orthorhombic or any system is more complicated.

Alternatively, there's another formula that comes to mind. Oh right, for a crystal with lattice parameters a, b, c and angles between them (like alpha, beta, gamma), the interplanar distance is given by the reciprocal of the square root of the sum of the squares of the reciprocals multiplied by their respective coefficients. Wait, not sure. Oh, right, the formula is:

1/d^2 = (h^2
