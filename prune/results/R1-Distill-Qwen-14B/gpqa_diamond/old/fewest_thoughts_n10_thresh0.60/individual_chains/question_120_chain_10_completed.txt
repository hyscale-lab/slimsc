Okay, so I'm trying to solve this question about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh wait, parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So if a star has a larger parallax, it's actually closer to us. 

The question says stars are uniformly distributed in the sky. Uniformly distributed—so I think that means the number density of stars in space is constant. So in other words, the number of stars doesn't depend on where you look; it's the same everywhere. But wait, how does that relate to parallax?

Parallax (plx) is measured in arcseconds and is given by plx = 1/distance (in parsecs). So if I have two stars at different distances, their parallaxes are 1/d1 and 1/d2. But the question is about how the number of stars per unit parallax changes with plx.

Wait, the number per unit parallax. Let's think about the volume of space that corresponds to a certain range of parallaxes. Because the number of stars is uniform in space, the number in a given volume should depend on the volume. So for a small change in parallax, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the corresponding distance?

The distance is d = 1/plx. So if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d^2 dplx) ? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the volume element. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd would be proportional to the volume (4π d² dd), since a shell's volume is surface area (4π d²) times thickness (dd). 

But wait, the problem is about the number of stars per unit parallax. So I think I need to relate the change in parallax to the change in distance and then find how the number of stars in that range depends on parallax. 

Let me think again. The number of stars per unit volume is n (since it's uniform). So the number in a volume element dV would be n dV. Now, dV for a thin shell is 4π d² dd. So the number of stars in a shell at distance d is N = n * 4π d² dd.

But we need this in terms of parallax. Since plx = 1/d, d = 1/plx. So substituting, we get d = 1/plx. Then d² = (1/plx)^2. And dd would be the change in distance, which I need to express in terms of dplx.

Wait, d is 1/plx. So when plx changes by dplx, how much does d change? Let me compute dd. 

dd/dplx = derivative of d with respect to plx. d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) dplx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases. But since we're considering the absolute change in d, I think I can take the magnitude. So |dd| = (1/plx²) dplx.

So substituting back into N, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) dplx. Wait, because d² is (1/plx)^2, and dd is (1/plx²) dplx. So N = n * 4π (1/plx^2) * (1/plx²) dplx. So that's 4π n (1/plx^4) dplx.

Wait, but the question is about the number per unit range of parallax. So N is the number in a dplx range. So the number per unit parallax (dplx=1) would be the limit as dplx approaches 0, which is just the expression without dplx. So the number per unit plx is 4π n (1/plx^4). 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1/plx^4. So the answer would be ~1/plx^4, so option A. But wait, the question says 'number of stars per unit range of parallax', which is N per dplx. So yes, the expression I derived is N = (something) * (1/plx^4) dplx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4.

But wait another thing. Wait, the number of stars per unit volume is n, so for a thin shell, the number is n * 4π d² dd. But in terms of parallax, d = 1/plx, so dd = - d^2 dplx. So substituting, N = n * 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx^2) dplx. So N = 4 π n (1/plx^4) dplx. Thus, N/(dplx) is 4 π n (1/plx^4), so the number per unit plx is 1/plx^4.

But wait, the question asks how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So the number per unit plx is proportional to 1/plx^4. So the answer would be option A.


To determine how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx, we start by noting that stars are uniformly distributed in space, meaning the number density of stars is constant. Parallax is inversely proportional to distance: \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), where \( d \) is the distance to the star in parsecs.

The number of stars in a thin shell of radius \( d \) and thickness \( dd \) is proportional to the volume of the shell, which is \( 4\pi d^2 dd \). Since the number density of stars is constant, the number of stars in this shell is \( N = n \cdot 4\pi d^2 dd \), where \( n \) is the number density of stars.

To express this in terms of parallax, we use \( d = \frac{1}{\text{plx}} \). Substituting, \( d^2 = \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \) and \( dd = -\frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} d\text{plx} \). The negative sign indicates that as \( \text{plx} \) increases, \( d \) decreases, but we take the magnitude for simplicity. Substituting these into the expression for \( N \), we get:

\[
N = n \cdot 4\pi \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^2} \cdot d\text{plx} = 4\pi n \cdot \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \cdot d\text{plx}.
\]

The number of stars per unit range of parallax is obtained by dividing \( N \) by \( d\text{plx} \), resulting in:

\[
\frac{N}{d\text{plx}} \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4}.
\]

Thus, the number of stars per unit range of parallax decreases as \( \frac{1}{\text{plx}^4} \). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) ~ 1/plx^4**
