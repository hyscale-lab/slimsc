Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. It's about calculating the amount of non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I remember that Gaussian states are those that have Wigner functions which are Gaussian distributions, like coherent states or squeezed states. Non-Gaussian states, like cat states, are important because they exhibit quantum effects that Gaussian states don't.

The problem gives me a state |psi> which is a superposition of two coherent states: |alpha> and |-alpha>. The state is normalized by N. The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I think I need to compute the non-Gaussianity measure using the relative entropy formula provided.

Wait, the non-Gaussianity (nG) is defined as delta_b, which is the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho (the Schrödinger cat state) and the entropy of a reference Gaussian state tau. The formula is delta_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Oh right, but for the relative entropy, if the reference state is Gaussian, maybe I can find an expression for both entropies.

But wait, von Neumann entropy for a pure state is zero because rho is pure. Because the state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is a projection operator, and the entropy S(rho) would be zero. Because for a pure state, the density matrix is idempotent, so rho^2 = rho. Then, the entropy is tr(rho ln rho) = 0, since ln(rho) for idempotent rho would be such that the trace is zero.

So delta_b would be 0 minus the entropy of the Gaussian state tau. Wait, but that can't be right because the answer options don't have a negative value. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the formula.

Wait another thought: the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is sometimes defined as the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state. But in the given formula, delta_b is rho's entropy minus tau's. So for a pure state, rho's entropy is zero. So delta_b would be negative, but since non-Gaussianity is a positive measure, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe it's the entropy of tau minus rho, but that would be positive. Or perhaps
