Okay, I need to figure out which compound is C9H11NO2 based on the given spectroscopic data. Let's take it step by step.

First, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. The formula is C9H11NO2. The degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Here, X=0, so (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 =10/2=5. So five degrees of unsaturation: that could be a benzene ring (which accounts for 3), a double bond or ring, and maybe an amide or ester group (another ring or double bond).

The IR data shows strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. These are probably N-H stretches, like from an amide or amine. The strong band at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide. If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720. Amides have carbonyls a bit lower, like around 1650, but maybe if it's an aromatic amide, the carbonyl could be around 1700. Hmm, but 1720 is more ester-like.

Looking at the 1H NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (3H): This is likely a CH2CH3 group, so ethyl ester maybe? Because the triplet with 3H would be the CH3 in CH2CH3, next to a CH2.

- 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H): This could be an ethyl group adjacent to an electronegative atom. Maybe an OCH2CH3 (ethoxy group) or perhaps an NH2 group. But wait, the IR had N-H stretches, which are usually broad. If it's an NH2, the signal might be broad. But where else? If it's an ethyl ester, maybe the OCH2 is split into a singlet. Wait, OCH2CH3 as in ethoxy would have a quartet at around 1.2 and a triplet at 4.0. But wait, in the NMR, we have a triplet at 1.20 (probably the CH3 of ethyl), which would mean the adjacent CH2 is at 4.0, but that's a quartet. Wait, the data shows 4.0 as a singlet. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, let me think again. The 1.20 triplet (3H) is likely the ethyl group. So maybe the ethyl is attached via an oxygen (like ethoxy) or an ester. Let's think about each option.

The next peak is at 4.5 ppm, quartet (2H). A quartet suggests two adjacent protons. So maybe a CH2 group next to another CH2. Like in an ester, OCH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as quartet at around 4.0? Or maybe in the ester, the OCH2 would be a quartet. Wait, perhaps the 4.5 quartet is the OCH2? Because in ethyl esters, the OCH2CH3 would appear as a quartet from the OCH2. Let me recall: in ethyl esters, the CH2 next to O (OCH2CH3) is split into a quartet. Let me check typical shifts. OCH2CH3 in esters is usually around 4.1-4.3 ppm as a quartet. So maybe the 4.5 is something else.

Wait, the NMR data shows 4.0 ppm as a singlet (2H) and 4.5 as a quartet (2H). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is an NH2 group, but why singlet? NH
