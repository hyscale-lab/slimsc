Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has this anti-nutritional compound. That's bad because it makes the barley unusable for food. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. So, the plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and then look for changes in the gene sequence. The goal is to find which mutation would likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

The intact gene sequence is provided, and so are the mutant sequences. I need to look for which mutation disrupts the gene's function, probably by creating a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough that it doesn't produce the compound.

Looking at the sequences, each mutant shows some change in the first exon area. Exons are the coding regions, so mutations there could affect the protein.

Let me compare each mutant to the intact gene.

Starting with the intact gene:
5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Hmm, let's look at the differences. The first part is ATGTTTCTCGCT... In mutant 1, it's ATGTTCTACGCT... So, the original is TTTCTC, and mutant 1 has TCTAC. Wait, wait, maybe comparing each segment. Let me line them up.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC...

So, the third codon in the intact is TTT (Phe), and in mutant1 it's TTC (also Phe). Wait, same amino acid. Then the next codon: intact is CTC (Leu), mutant is TAC (Tyr). Oh, so a change from Leu to Tyr. Then GCT becomes GCT—no change. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up where the changes are.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at where exactly the changes are. Let me compare each position.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations are in the first exon, so maybe they are in the coding regions. So, each change could be a substitution.

Looking for frameshifts or nonsense mutations. Because if the mutation creates a premature stop codon, the protein would be shorter.

Wait, but looking at the sequences, the start (ATG) is the same in all mutants. So they all start with methionine.

Mutant 1: The first few bases are ATGTTCTACGCT
