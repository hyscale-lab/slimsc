Okay, so I have this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, I need to figure out how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. The options are A to D, each with different exponents. Let's see how I can approach this.

Wait, the question says stars are uniformly distributed. So I guess that means the same number of stars in each volume of space. Parallax is related to distance, right? Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. Like, the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. So the formula is plx = 1/distance (in parsecs), I think.

So, if stars are uniformly distributed, their number density (number per unit volume) is constant. Let's denote the number density as n. So in a small volume dV, the number of stars would be n * dV.

Now, I need to express this in terms of parallax. Because the question is about the number per unit range of plx. So I need to find how the number of stars depends on plx.

Let me think about the relationship between distance and parallax. Parallax plx = 1/d, where d is the distance in parsecs. So, d = 1/plx. The volume element in spherical coordinates is 4π d² dd. So for a given range of distance from d to d+dd, the volume is 4πd² dd.

But since plx is 1/d, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Wait, maybe I should express everything in terms of plx. Let me substitute d as 1/plx.

So d = 1/plx → dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. The negative sign indicates that as plx increases, d decreases, but since we're dealing with a small change, I can ignore the negative sign for the purposes of magnitude.

So the volume element dV is 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = (1/plx²) d plx, we get:

dV = 4π (1/plx)^2 * (1/plx²) d plx = 4π (1/plx^4) d plx.

Wait, wait
