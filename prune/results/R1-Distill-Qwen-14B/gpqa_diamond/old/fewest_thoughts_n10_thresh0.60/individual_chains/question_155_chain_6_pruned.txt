Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator for a given state. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²). Right, so I need to compute the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared for the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, so the matrix for P_z is diagonal because it's in its eigenbasis. That should make things easier since when you have a diagonal matrix, the expectation value is just the sum of the eigenvalues multiplied by the probabilities.

Wait, looking at the P_z matrix provided: the first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ, corresponding to the diagonal elements. So the basis vectors are along these eigenstates.

The given state is a vector with components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me make sure the vector is normalized. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the magnitudes. 

(-1/2)^2 + (1/√2)^2 + (-1/2)^2 = (1/4) + (1/2) + (1/4) = (1/4 +1/4) is 1/2, plus 1/2 is 1. So yes, it's normalized.

Now, to find <P_z>, the expectation value, I can compute the sum of each component squared times the corresponding eigenvalue. Because the state is already diagonal in the P_z basis.

So, the components are:

First component: (-1/2)² = 1/4, multiplied by eigenvalue ħ → (1/4)ħ.

Second component: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2, multiplied by 0 → 0.

Third component: (-1/2)^2 = 1/4, multiplied by (-ħ) → (1/4)(-ħ) = -ħ/4.

So <P_z> = (1/4)ħ + 0 + (-1/4)ħ = 0. Oh, that's convenient.

Next, I need to find <P_z²>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z squared is just the squares of the diagonal elements. So the eigenvalues of P_z squared are (ħ)^2, 0^2, (-ħ)^2 → which are ħ², 0, ħ².

So the expectation value <P_z²> would be the sum of each squared component times the squared eigenvalue.

So:

First component: (1/4) * ħ²,

Second component: (1/2) * 0 = 0,

Third component: (1/4) * ħ².

Adding them up: (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ². So <P_z²> is (ħ²)/2.

Now, the uncertainty is sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). Since <P_z> is zero, this simplifies to sqrt( <P_z²> ) = sqrt( (ħ²)/2 ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is ħ/sqrt(2), which matches. Option C is ħ/2, which is smaller. So the answer should be B.


To calculate the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the operator $P_z$, we use the formula:

\[
