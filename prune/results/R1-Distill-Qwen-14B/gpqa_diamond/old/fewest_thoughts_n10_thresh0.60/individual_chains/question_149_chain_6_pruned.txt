Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again.

So, the scenario is that I'm analyzing a small peptidic compound that was chemically synthesized. The 1H NMR spectrum looks mostly right, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. Oh, and the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass spectrum as expected.

Hmm, what could this mean? Let me break it down step by step.

First, the NMR part. Normally, each proton has a unique peak, unless something else is going on. Since the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, that suggests that the proton is split into two different environments. But wait, the integrals together are 1H. So maybe the molecule has some sort of symmetry or perhaps there's some kind of isomerism.

The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Spin-spin coupling would typically cause splitting into multiple peaks, like a doublet or a triplet, depending on the neighboring protons. But the question says that's not the case here. So probably not coupling with adjacent protons. Maybe something else is causing the peaks.

Now, looking at the LC-MS part. Two peaks, same mass, same intensity. That suggests two different entities with the same molecular weight. So when the sample is heated (elevated temperature), perhaps something is happening. But wait, LC-MS usually gives chromatographic separation. If both have same mass, they might be stereoisomers or something else that doesn't affect the mass.

So, possible explanations include isomerism. Let me look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. Well, a precursor would have a different molecular weight, right? Because it's the starting material before a reaction. But the LC-MS here shows same mass. So probably not A.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, if the compound is a racemic mixture, would the peaks split? In 1H NMR, enantiomers would have the same chemical shifts because they're not changing the environment of the protons. Wait, but if the molecule has no
