Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about the geometrical position of a density matrix in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's in a mixed state.

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). So, what does this look like? I think |0> and |1> are the standard basis states for a qubit. Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better.

The |0><0| matrix is a 2x2 matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere. Similarly, |1><1| has 1 in the (2,2) position. Adding them together would give a diagonal matrix with 1s on the diagonal. Then, multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2, and the off-diagonal elements are zero. So the matrix ρ is:

ρ = [[1/2, 0],
     [0, 1/2]]

Wait a second, that's a diagonal matrix. I think this is a maximally mixed state because it's completely uncertain; the qubit has equal probability of being in state |0> or |1>, and no coherence. Coherence is where the off-diagonal elements (the coherences) are non-zero, right?

Now, the question is about the geometrical position. Qubits are two-level systems, so they can be represented in a two-dimensional space. The density matrix for a qubit can be visualized in the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to represent all possible states of a qubit, where pure states are on the surface and mixed states are inside.

In the Bloch sphere representation, a density matrix ρ can be written as:

ρ = (I + r·σ) / 2

where I is the identity matrix, and σ is the vector of Pauli matrices. The vector r corresponds to the coordinates of the point on the Bloch sphere. For a pure state, the state is on the surface, so r would have a length of 1. For a mixed state, r's length is less than 1.

Breaking it down, the Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. So each component of
