Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms. Let's take it step by step.

The problem has two parts: Reaction 1 and Reaction 2. I need to figure out what each reaction produces and then match them with the options given.

Starting with Reaction 1: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH (which is potassium hydride), and then H+. What's happening here?

First, I remember that potassium hydride is a strong base. THF is a solvent, so probably it's a deprotonation reaction. The starting molecule is a spiro compound, which has two rings connected by a single atom. Wait, spiro[3.5]non... So the structure is two rings joined at carbon 1. The substituents are a vinyl group (CH2=CH-) and an alcohol group (-OH) on the same carbon.

So, the alcohol is an -OH group. When treated with a strong base like KH, it's likely that the -OH group is deprotonated to form an alkoxide. But wait, in THF, which is a polar aprotic solvent, that makes sense. Then, when H+ is added, perhaps it's an acid workup, but maybe the base is used to deprotonate, and then something else happens.

Wait, another thought: when an alcohol is treated with a strong base, sometimes it can lead to elimination if there's a possibility for that. But in this case, the molecule is a spiro alcohol. Deprotonating the OH would give an alkoxide, but what's next? Maybe an elimination reaction, but where would the H come from?

Alternatively, I've heard of the possibility of forming a ketone when an alcohol is deprotonated and undergoes some kind of cyclization. Wait, wait! I remember something about the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that requires an oxidizing agent. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that usually involves vicinal diols.

Wait another angle: When an alcohol is treated with a strong base, and if the molecule has adjacent double bonds or certain
