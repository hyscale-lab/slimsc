Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking for the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. The options are A to D, which include some pretty varied pH values, so I need to figure out whether it's acidic, basic, or neutral.

Hmm, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider neutralization reactions. Also, strong acids and strong bases will react completely, while weak acids or bases won't. So first, I think I should calculate the moles of each acid and base involved and see what's left after any possible reactions.

Let's break it down. 

First, calculate the moles for each component.

Starting with CH3COOH: that's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Molarity is moles per liter, so 500 mL is 0.5 liters. Moles = Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles of CH3COOH. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely.

Next, HCl: 400 mL of 0.2 M. 0.4 liters. 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. HCl is a strong acid, so it will dissociate completely into H+ and Cl- ions.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL of 0.3 M. 0.3 liters. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. Since it's Ba(OH)2, each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions when dissolved. So the moles of OH- would be 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, considering the reaction between the acids and the base. The H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. So the H+ from HCl will react first, probably, since it's a strong acid and will dissociate completely. Let me think about the neutralization.

The total H+ available from HCl and CH3COOH. But wait, CH3COOH is weak, so it won't contribute as much H+ as HCl. But in presence of a strong acid, maybe the weak acid doesn't dissociate much. Hmm, perhaps I should consider the strong acid first.

So, the H+ from HCl is 0.08 moles. The OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 moles.

So the H+ and OH- will combine to form water. The reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, total H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) because CH3COOH is weak and not fully ionized. Wait, no, I should probably calculate how much H+ is from each and subtract when they react.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the total moles of H+ and OH- in the solution before mixing, then see which is in excess.

So total H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. But CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it won't completely ionize. Alternatively, since HCl is a strong acid, its H+ will be fully available. CH3COOH will contribute some H+ but not all.

Hmm, maybe I should calculate the initial moles of H+ and OH-:

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of H+ from CH3COOH: Let's think. Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't dissociate completely. The Ka for acetic acid is about 1.8 × 10^-5. But maybe we can approximate if the solution is dilute enough. But wait, when we mix all these solutions, the concentrations will change. Maybe it's better to first find the total volume and then the concentrations after mixing.

Wait, but let me first find the total volume. The volumes are 500 mL, 400 mL, 300 mL. That sums up to 1200 mL, or 1.2 liters.

Wait, but before that, maybe the reaction between H+ and OH- will consume some of each. So let's figure that out.

Total H+ available: from HCl (0.08 mol) and from CH3COOH (let's call that x, but since it's weak, x is much smaller than 0.08, so maybe we can ignore it for the initial neutralization. But wait, the OH- is 0.18 mol, which is more than the H+ from HCl. So the OH- will react with H+ from HCl and any available from CH3COOH.

Wait, so perhaps:

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol
Moles of OH-: 0.18 mol

H+ and OH- will neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.08 mol H+ will neutralize 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

But wait, what about the CH3COOH? It's a weak acid, so it can donate some H+ as well. Let me calculate the H+ from CH3COOH.

Wait, when you mix the solutions, the concentration of CH3COOH will change because the volume increases. Let me first compute the concentrations after mixing.

Wait no, perhaps I should think of all the moles before mixing and then after.

Wait, the total moles of H+ in the solution before reaction are:

H+ from HCl: 0.08
H+ from CH3COOH: Let's say it's the same as the moles of CH3COOH, but no—since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully ionize. So in the initial solution, 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH has 0.05 moles. So when you mix, the concentration in the total solution is 0.05 / 1.2 liters ≈ 0.0417 M. But the H+ from CH3COOH is not 0.05 moles, it's much less because it doesn't fully ionize.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl, but when HCl is neutralized by OH-, then the remaining OH- can react with CH3COOH.

Wait, maybe I should proceed step by step.

Step 1: Calculate total moles of H+ from all sources before considering reactions. But HCl gives 0.08 mol H+, and CH3COOH (weak acid) gives some H+ which is negligible compared to 0.08. So total H+ is about 0.08.

Step 2: Moles of OH- is 0.18.

So, OH- will react with H+.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.08 mol H+ will react with 0.08 mol OH-, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol OH-.

But wait, the OH- is in excess, so the solution will be basic. But then, the excess OH- will react with the CH3COOH.

Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, it can act as an acid and donate H+ to neutralize the excess OH-.

So, the reaction is: CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, how much CH3COOH is available? Initially, 0.05 moles.

Excess OH- after reacting with HCl is 0.10 mol.

So, the OH- will react with CH3COOH. Let me see if all the OH- can be neutralized by CH3COOH.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

So, OH- is 0.10 mol. So CH3COOH can neutralize 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol OH-.

Wait, but wait: when OH- reacts with CH3COOH, it's a 1:1 reaction. So, 0.05 mol of OH- will react with 0.05 mol of CH3COOH, leaving the remaining OH- as 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So now, after all reactions, we have:

- Some CH3COO^- (from the reaction with OH-)
- Remaining OH-: 0.05 mol
- And the excess OH- will determine the pH.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, initially, H+ from HCl is 0.08, OH- is 0.18.

After H+ and OH- react, 0.08 H+ is neutralized, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 OH-.

Then, the OH- (0.10 mol) reacts with CH3COOH (0.05 mol). So it can only neutralize 0.05 mol of OH-, leaving 0.05 mol OH-.

So, the total moles of OH- left is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but what about the other products? The CH3COOH has been partially neutralized by OH- to form acetate ions and water.

So, what is the concentration of OH- in the solution?

The total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, moles of OH- remaining: 0.05 mol. So concentration is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because the OH- comes from Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base, so it's fully dissociated into Ba^2+ and OH^-.

But after neutralization, the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol.

Wait, but also, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so when some of it is neutralized by OH-, it becomes CH3COO^-.

So, in the solution, we have some acetate ions (from CH3COOH and the reaction with OH-), and excess OH-.

Wait, but the excess OH- will determine the pH. Because it's a strong base, it will dissociate completely, so the solution will be basic.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH is -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH would be 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other factors? Like, does the acetate ion from CH3COO^- affect the pH?

Because acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it can hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution more basic. So, I must consider that.

Ah, right! I completely forgot about that. So, when CH3COO^- is in solution, it can react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

This reaction will produce more OH-, increasing the pH.

So, the initial OH- concentration is from the excess OH- after neutralization and from the hydrolysis of acetate ions.

Hmm, so this complicates things. Because now, the solution's pH is influenced by both the excess OH- and the hydrolysis of acetate.

So, I need to calculate the total OH- concentration considering both sources.

But wait, let's see how significant each is.

First, let's calculate the initial OH- from the excess: 0.05 mol in 1.2 L gives [OH-] ≈ 0.0417 M.

Then, the acetate ion concentration comes from two sources:

1. The remaining CH3COOH that hasn't reacted with OH-.

Wait, no: the initial CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. 0.05 mol of it reacted with OH-, so the remaining is 0.05 - 0.05 = 0 mol. Wait, no—wait, the reaction is CH3COOH + OH- → CH3COO^- + H2O.

Wait, no, no. Let me think again. CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. OH- is 0.10 mol after initial neutralization. So, 0.05 mol of OH- reacts with CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol of CH3COO^- and using up all the CH3COOH. So no CH3COOH is left. So the only source of acetate is the 0.05 mol from this reaction.

So, the concentration of CH3COO^- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0417 M.

So, acetate will hydrolyze in water. The reaction is:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be calculated from the Ka of acetic acid. Since Ka = 1.8e-5, Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.8e-5) ≈ 5.56e-10.

So, Kb is 5.56e-10. The concentration of acetate is 0.0417 M.

We can set up the expression for Kb:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH- produced from hydrolysis:

x^2 / (0.0417 - x) ≈ Kb.

Since Kb is very small (≈5.56e-10), x will be much smaller than 0.0417, so we can approximate (0.0417 - x) ≈ 0.0417.

Thus, x^2 ≈ Kb * 0.0417 → x ≈ sqrt(5.56e-10 * 0.0417).

Calculate the product inside the square root:

5.56e-10 * 0.0417 ≈ 2.307e-11.

Square root of that is approximately sqrt(2.307e-11) ≈ 4.803e-6 M.

So, the OH- contribution from acetate is about 4.8e-6 M.

But wait, the initial OH- concentration from excess base was 0.0417 M, and this is adding about 4.8e-6 M. So, the total OH- would be approximately 0.0417 + 0.0000048 ≈ 0.0417048 M.

But wait, that's a very small addition. So, the main source of OH- is the excess from Ba(OH)2, and the hydrolysis of acetate contributes a tiny amount.

So, the total [OH-] ≈ 0.0417 M.

Wait, but I should think about whether it's necessary to consider the hydrolysis. Because 4.8e-6 is about 0.001% of 0.0417. So, the change is negligible.

In that case, the [OH-] is approximately 0.0417 M, so pOH is about 1.38. pH is 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62. So that would be the pH.

But wait, another thought: I'm not considering any activity coefficients or other factors, but for a problem like this, probably not necessary.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial calculation of moles.

CH3COOH: 500 mL * 0.1 M = 0.05 mol.

HCl: 400 mL * 0.2 M = 0.08 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 300 mL * 0.3 M = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2. Since each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-, so 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

So, initial H+ = 0.08, OH- = 0.18.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

Net OH- after reaction: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10.

Then, OH- reacts with CH3COOH: 0.10 mol OH- reacts with 0.05 mol CH3COOH, producing 0.05 mol CH3COO^- and leaves 0.05 mol OH-.

So, remaining OH- is 0.05 mol.

Total volume is 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.04167 M.

pOH = -log(0.04167) ≈ 1.38. So pH = 12.62.

Thus, the correct answer should be A) 12.62.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. The key steps involve calculating the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻, determining the excess after neutralization, and considering the contribution of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻) to the pH.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of each component
- **CH₃COOH**:  
  Moles = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
  CH₃COOH is a weak acid, so it does not fully ionize initially.

- **HCl**:  
  Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).  
  HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates into 0.08 mol of H⁺.

- **Ba(OH)₂**:  
  Moles = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
  Each Ba(OH)₂ molecule produces 2 OH⁻ ions, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻
The H⁺ from HCl reacts with OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂ in a 1:1 ratio:  
\[
\text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
\]  
- Total H⁺ = 0.08 mol.  
- Total OH⁻ = 0.18 mol.  

After neutralization:  
- \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺} \) reacts with \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \), leaving \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \).

### Step 3: Reaction of excess OH⁻ with CH₃COOH
The remaining OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
\[
\text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O}.
\]  
- Moles of CH₃COOH = 0.05 mol.  
- Moles of OH⁻ = 0.10 mol.  

The OH⁻ neutralizes 0.05 mol of CH₃COOH, leaving:  
- \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \) remaining.  
- \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{CH₃COO⁻} \) formed.

### Step 4: Calculate [OH⁻] in the solution
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of excess OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate pH
The pOH is:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Step 6: Consider acetate ion hydrolysis
CH₃COO⁻ hydrolyzes in water:  
\[
\text{CH₃COO⁻} + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH⁻}.
\]  
The \( K_b \) for CH₃COO⁻ is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10} \).  
The contribution of OH⁻ from hydrolysis is negligible compared to the excess OH⁻, so it does not significantly affect the pH.

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**.
