Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me read it through carefully. So, the setup is that there are ten thousand identical systems, each with a particle moving in a tube along the x-axis. Each particle's wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. And when they measured the position, none of the particles were found at x less than 1 or greater than 3. So the particles are only between x=1 and x=3.

The question is asking for the numerical value of 'a'. The options are A) 1.1, B) 0.85, C) 0.35, D) 0.6.

Hmm. So I remember that in quantum mechanics, the wave function must be normalizable. That means the integral of the absolute square of the wave function must equal 1. Because the total probability of finding the particle somewhere must be 100%.

Wait, but in this case, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Let me think: the wave function is a complex function, right? So the general form is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i. Or maybe I should write it as ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) * (1 - 0.5i). Not sure if that's relevant yet.

Wait, but the particles are only found between x=1 and x=3. So does that mean that the wave function is zero outside this region? Or is the wave function zero elsewhere, but the given expression is only valid within x=1 to x=3?

Wait, the question says: "each particle can move along a tube... each system has a particle that are the same and under the same conditions." So perhaps the wave function is zero outside of x=1 to x=3. Because when they measured, none were found outside that region. So the wave function is zero for x <1 and x>3, and given by that expression in between.

So the wave function is ψ(x) = (a / sqrt(1 + x)) - 0.5i when 1 <= x <=3, and zero elsewhere. But wait, that doesn't seem right because the wave function is a complex number, and the normalization would involve integrating |ψ(x)|² over all x.

Alternatively, perhaps ψ(x) is given as (a / sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, and it's non-zero only between x=1 and x=3. So to normalize it, we can integrate |ψ(x)|² dx from 1 to 3 and set that equal to 1.

Wait, but the wave function is given as a function that's valid in the region where the particle can exist, which is between x=1 and x=3. So the wave function is zero outside of this interval.

So the normalization condition is the integral from 1 to 3 of |ψ(x)|² dx = 1.

Let me write that out. |ψ(x)|² is ψ*(x) ψ(x). Since ψ(x) is (a/sqrt(1+x)) - 0.5i, the conjugate would be (a/sqrt(1+x)) + 0.5i. So multiplying them:

[(a/sqrt(1+x)) -0.5i] * [(a/sqrt(1+x)) +0.5i] = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) - (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) ) + (0.5i)^2*(-1), wait no, maybe better to do it as (a^2)/(1+x) + (0.5i)(a/sqrt(1+x)) + (a/sqrt(1+x))(0.5i) + (0.5i)^2*(-1)? Wait, maybe I should expand it correctly.

Wait, (A - Bi)(A + Bi) = A² + B². Oh right, because cross terms cancel. So in this case, A is (a/sqrt(1+x)), and B is 0.5. So |ψ|² = (a²)/(1+x) + (0.5)^2.

So |ψ(x)|² = (a²)/(1+x) + 0.25.

Wait, wait, wait. Because (0.5i)^2 is (0.5)^2 (i^2) = 0.25*(-1) = -0.25. But when you multiply (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B²? No, wait, (A - B)(A + B) = A² - B², but here B is 0.5i. So B squared is (0.5i)^2 = -0.25. So the expansion is A² - (B)^2 = (a²/(1+x)) - ( (0.5i)^2 ) = (a²/(1+x)) - (-0.25) ) = (a²/(1+x)) + 0.25. Oh, right. Because (0.5i)^2 is -0.25. So when you subtract that, it becomes plus 0.25.

So the integral from x=1 to x=3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So let's compute this integral.

Breaking the integral into two parts:

Integral [a²/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3 + integral [0.25] dx from 1 to3.

Compute each part separately.

First integral: a² * integral [1/(1+x)] dx from 1 to3.

Integral of 1/(1+x) dx is ln|1+x|.

Evaluated from 1 to 3 gives ln(4) - ln(2) = ln(4/2) = ln(2).

So first part is a² * ln(2).

Second integral: 0.25 * (3-1) = 0.25 *2 = 0.5.

So total integral is a² * ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.

So a² * ln(2) = 1 -0.5 = 0.5.

So a² = 0.5 / ln(2).

Compute ln(2): approximately 0.6931.

So 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213.

So a² ≈0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85 which is close. Option D is 0.6, which is smaller.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the initial setup.

Wait, the wave function is given as (a / sqrt(1 + x)) ) - 0.5i. So for each x, the wave function is a complex number.

But when I compute |ψ(x)|², I have to take the product of the complex conjugate and the wave function.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to consider that the wave function is a sum of two terms: a real term and an imaginary term.

Wait, ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i.

So ψ* (x) is [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (0.5)i.

Multiplying them:

[a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))*(0.5i) + (0.5i)*(a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (0.5i)*(0.5i)

Wait, expanding this:

The real parts are [a^2/(1+x)] and the other terms are imaginary. The last term is (0.5i)^2 which is -0.25.

So the real part is [a^2/(1+x)] -0.25. Because the middle terms are imaginary and when you multiply the cross terms, they would contribute to the imaginary parts, but when you integrate over x, the imaginary parts would integrate to zero because they are multiplied by dx (a real function). So the integral of the |ψ|² is the integral of [a^2/(1+x) - 0.25] dx from 1 to3.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Oh wait, did I make a mistake earlier?

Because in the expansion, the cross terms are (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) ) which equals 2*(a/(sqrt(1+x)))*0.5i = (a/(sqrt(1+x)))*i. But when you take the product, the cross terms are imaginary, and integrating them from 1 to3 would give zero because they are odd functions in some sense? No, wait, because x is a real variable, and the integrand is a real function plus an imaginary function. Wait, no, the wave function is complex, but when taking the square modulus, you end up with a real function. Because |ψ|² is real.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier. Let me recompute |ψ(x)|².

ψ(x) = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] - (0.5)i.

So ψ* = [a/(sqrt(1+x))] + (0.5)i.

Multiplying:

ψ* ψ = [a/(sqrt(1+x))]^2 + (a/(sqrt(1+x)))(0.5i) + (0.5i)(a/(sqrt(1+x))) + (0.5i)(0.5i).

The first term is a²/(1+x).

The second and third terms are each (0.5 a i )/(sqrt(1+x)), so adding them gives (a i * 0.5 * 2 )/(sqrt(1+x)) ) = (a i )/(sqrt(1+x)).

Wait, but when you integrate over all x, the integral of a real function times i is imaginary, which would have to be zero for the integral to be real (as it must be, since the integral of |ψ|² is a real number).

Wait, but wait. The wave function is ψ(x) = R(x) + I(x) i, where R(x) is real and I(x) is real. Then |ψ|² is R² + I², because (R + iI)(R - iI) = R² + I².

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. Let R(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)), and I(x) = -0.5. Then the wave function is ψ = R(x) + I(x) i. Then, ψ* is R(x) - I(x) i. So ψ*ψ is R² + I².

Because (R + i I)(R - i I) = R² - (i I)(R) + R ( -i I ) + (i I)(-i I). Wait, no, the correct expansion is R^2 + I^2, because the cross terms are (R)(-i I) + (i I)(R) ) which is -i R I + i R I= 0, and the last term is (i I)(-i I) ) = (-i^2) I² = (1) I².

So overall, |ψ|² = R² + I².

Wait, that's different from my first approach. So in this case, R(x) = a/(sqrt(1+x)), I(x) = -0.5. So |ψ|² = [a²/(1+x)] + (0.5)^2.

Which is [a²/(1+x)] + 0.25.

So that's the correct |ψ|².

So the integral from 1 to 3 of [a²/(1+x) + 0.25] dx = 1.

So integrating:

Integral [a²/(1+x) dx] from 1 to3 is a² [ln(1+x)] from 1 to3 → a² (ln4 - ln2) = a² ln(2).

Plus integral of 0.25 dx from 1 to3 → 0.25*(3-1)=0.5.

So a² ln2 + 0.5 =1 → a² ln2 = 0.5 → a² = 0.5 / ln2.

Compute ln2≈0.6931.

So a² ≈ 0.5 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.7213 → a ≈ sqrt(0.7213) ≈ 0.849.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.85, which is very close. So the correct answer is B) 0.85.


To solve the problem, we start by noting that the wave function is given as:

\[
\psi(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} - 0.5i,
\]

and the particle is only found between \(x=1\) and \(x=3\). This means the wave function is zero outside this interval. To normalize the wave function, the integral of \(|\psi(x)|^2\) over the interval \([1, 3]\) must equal 1.

### Step 1: Compute \(|\psi(x)|^2\)
The wave function is complex, so \(|\psi(x)|^2 = \psi^*(x) \psi(x)\). Taking the complex conjugate of \(\psi(x)\), we get:

\[
\psi^*(x) = \frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}} + 0.5i.
\]

Multiplying \(\psi(x)\) and \(\psi^*(x)\):

\[
|\psi(x)|^2 = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{1+x}}\right)^2 + (0.5)^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25.
\]

### Step 2: Set up the normalization condition
The normalization condition is:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} |\psi(x)|^2 \, dx = 1.
\]

Substituting \(|\psi(x)|^2 = \frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\), we have:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \left(\frac{a^2}{1+x} + 0.25\right) dx = 1.
\]

### Step 3: Split the integral
The integral can be split into two parts:

\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx + \int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 1.
\]

#### First integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} \frac{a^2}{1+x} \, dx = a^2 \int_{1}^{3} \frac{1}{1+x} \, dx.
\]

The integral of \(\frac{1}{1+x}\) is \(\ln|1+x|\). Evaluating from \(x=1\) to \(x=3\):

\[
a^2 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(2)\right] = a^2 \ln(2).
\]

#### Second integral:
\[
\int_{1}^{3} 0.25 \, dx = 0.25 \cdot (3 - 1) = 0.5.
\]

### Step 4: Combine the results
Adding the two parts:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) + 0.5 = 1.
\]

Simplify:

\[
a^2 \ln(2) = 0.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a^2 = \frac{0.5}{\ln(2)}.
\]

Using \(\ln(2) \approx 0.6931\):

\[
a^2 \approx \frac{0.5}{0.6931} \approx 0.7213 \quad \Rightarrow \quad a \approx \sqrt{0.7213} \approx 0.849.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the options
The closest option to \(a \approx 0.849\) is **B) 0.85**.
