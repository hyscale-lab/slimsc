Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I remember that mesons are subatomic particles, and they can decay into other particles. The question is asking about the mean decay distance of this particular meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are all different distances in meters, which are extremely small, as expected for such particles.

Wait, I think the mean decay distance has something to do with the particle's lifetime and its velocity. Oh right, the mean decay length is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. The formula I remember is distance L = γ c τ, where γ is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and τ is the proper lifetime.

But wait, first I need to find the lifetime τ. The width Γ is related to the lifetime by the uncertainty principle. The natural linewidth (Γ) is the total decay width, which is related to the mean lifetime by τ = ħ / Γ. Oh, but I have to be careful with units here.

So let me outline the steps. First, calculate the decay width Γ in units that will allow me to find τ. Then find the Lorentz factor γ using the energy and mass. Then compute the lifetime τ, then multiply by γ c to get the decay length.

Wait, the energy given is E_X =8 GeV. Hmm, E is the total energy, which includes rest mass energy. So the total energy is E
