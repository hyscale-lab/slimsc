Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five of them, and various reactions are described. I need to find the molecular weight range of substance A4.

Let me read each part carefully.

First, substance A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 20Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction would produce F2 gas. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing means it's acting as an oxidizing agent, so it's probably a strong oxidizing agent itself.

Then, A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating element Y with fluorine. Fluorinating Y would mean Y is combining with F2. So maybe YF or YF3 or something like that, depending on Y's valency.

Next, when Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, colorless concentrated solution of A4, A5 is obtained. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances. We need to find the molecular weight range of A4.

Wait, let's think about the possible elements Y could be. Since we're dealing with fluorine compounds, Y is probably a halogen. Wait, no, but fluorine is a halogen, but Y is another element forming binary compounds with F. Alternatively, it could be a metal. Let's think of elements that form multiple binary compounds with F. For example, tin (Sn) forms SnF2 and SnF4, but I'm not sure about exactly five. Or perhaps it's something like chlorine, but no, chlorine and fluorine would form ClF3, ClF, etc., but not sure about five.

Alternatively, let's think about the reaction details. A1 decomposes into A2 and F2. So the decomposition might involve the loss of fluorine. Let's think of a common red solid that decomposes to release F2. One possibility is KClO3, but that's not a fluorine compound. Wait, maybe it's KMnO4? No, that's not with F. Alternatively, perhaps it's a compound like AgF or something else?

Wait, another approach: What compounds of fluor
