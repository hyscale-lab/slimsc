Okay, so I need to find the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, and their eigenvectors correspond to possible states of the system. The eigenvalues are the possible measurement outcomes.

The operator P is given in terms of its components Px, Py, and Pz. Each of these is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator P as a whole would be the vector sum of these components in the direction of n, which lies in the x-z plane. 

Wait, the direction n is arbitrary in the x-z plane. So the operator would be along n, which can be expressed as n = (nx, 0, nz), since it's in the x-z plane. So the operator P acting along n would be P = nx Px + nz Pz.

But wait, the question is about the eigenvalue +ħ/2. I think the eigenvalues for spin-1/2 systems are ±ħ/2. So the eigenvector we're looking for is the one corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the operator P acting along an arbitrary direction, and find its eigenvectors. But the problem gives me Px, Py, Pz, so I can construct P in the direction of n.

Wait, n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so it can be written as (sinθ cosφ, 0, sinθ sinφ) but since it's in x-z plane, phi is either 0 or 180 or something. Wait, no—since it's arbitrary, maybe I'll just write n as (a, 0, b), with a² + b² = 1.

But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the spin matrices. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved here. The spin operator S for a spin-1/2 particle is (ħ/2) σ, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So for the operator P, it's similar to the spin operator.

Wait, in the problem, Px is given as (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0 1], [1 0]]. Oh wait, that's the Pauli X matrix. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i], [i, 0]] which is the Pauli Y matrix. Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1, 0], [0, -1]] which is the Pauli Z matrix.

So the operator P along an arbitrary direction n is P = (n_x Px + n_y Py + n_z Pz). But since n is in the x-z plane, n_y = 0. So P = n_x Px + n_z Pz.

But wait, since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_z² =1. Let me denote n_x = a, n_z = b, so a² + b² =1.

So P = a (ħ/2) σ_x + b (ħ/2) σ_z.

But to find the eigenvectors, perhaps I can write the matrix form of P first.

The matrix for P would be (ħ/2) times [ [b, a], [a, -b] ].

Because σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_z is [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So when multiplied by a and b respectively, the sum in matrix form is [[b, a],[a, -b]].

So P = (ħ/2) * [[b, a], [a, -b]]

We're looking for the eigenvector with eigenvalue +ħ/2. So, let's write the eigenvalue equation:

P |ψ> = (+ħ/2) |ψ>

Which in matrix terms is:

(ħ/2) [[b, a], [a, -b]] * [ψ1; ψ2] = (ħ/2) [ψ1; ψ2]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2:

[[b, a], [a, -b]] [ψ1; ψ2] = [ψ1; ψ2]

So the matrix equation is:

b ψ1 + a ψ2 = ψ1

a ψ1 - b ψ2 = ψ2

Let me write these equations:

1) (b - 1) ψ1 + a ψ2 = 0

2) a ψ1 + (-b -1) ψ2 = 0

So for non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero. Alternatively, we can set up the equations:

From equation 1: (b-1) ψ1 + a ψ2 = 0 → (1 - b) ψ1 = a ψ2 → ψ2 = [(1 - b)/a] ψ1

Similarly, equation 2: a ψ1 = (1 + b) ψ2 → ψ2 = [a/(1 + b)] ψ1

So setting these equal: (1 - b)/a = a/(1 + b)

Cross-multiplying: (1 - b)(1 + b) = a² → 1 - b² = a².

But since a² + b² =1 (because n is a unit vector), 1 - b² = a² is indeed true. So our earlier steps are consistent.

Therefore, from equation 1, ψ2 = (1 - b)/a ψ1.

Let me denote ψ1 as some constant, say c. Then ψ2 = (1 - b)/a * c.

So the eigenvector can be written as [c; (1 - b)/a c]

To normalize this, the sum of the squares of the components should be 1.

|c|^2 [1 + ( (1 - b)^2 / a² ) ] = 1

So c = 1 / sqrt( 1 + ( (1 - b)^2 / a² ) )

But perhaps it's easier to express in terms of a and b.

Wait, let me express a in terms of b. Since a² = 1 - b², a = sqrt(1 - b²). Let's assume a is positive for simplicity (since direction can be chosen accordingly).

So ( (1 - b)/a )^2 = ( (1 - b)^2 ) / (1 - b² ) )= (1 - 2b + b²) / (1 - b²) ) 

Which can be rewritten as [ (1 - b^2) - 2b + 2b^3 ]... Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express in terms of θ. Since the direction is in the x-z plane, let me parameterize it using spherical coordinates. Let me define θ as the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, in spherical coordinates, the direction vector would have components (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). But since we're in the x-z plane, phi is zero or pi? Wait, no, wait. The x-z plane has angles where phi is either 0 or pi because y=0. So if n is in x-z, then it can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis.

Wait, no. Let me think. When phi is 0, the direction is along the x-axis (since y=0, z=0). Wait no, the spherical coordinates are usually defined with polar angle θ from the positive z-axis, and phi being the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. So for a direction in the x-z plane, phi can be 0 or pi, but θ can vary.

So the unit vector n can be written as (sinθ cos0, 0, sinθ sin0 + cosθ) → Wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's better to write n as (sinθ, 0, cosθ) when phi is 0. Wait, no, because when phi is 0, the direction is along the x-axis. So let me correct:

Wait, no. Let me think again. The general spherical coordinates for a point on the unit sphere are (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ). So if the direction is in the x-z plane, then phi is 0 or pi, because y=0. So for phi = 0, the direction is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). For phi = pi, it's (-sinθ, 0, cosθ). But since n is arbitrary in the x-z plane, we can just take phi=0 for simplicity.

So, n = (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

Therefore, a = n_x = sinθ, and b = n_z = cosθ.

So our earlier expressions become:

ψ2 = (1 - b)/a * ψ1 = (1 - cosθ)/sinθ * ψ1.

Hmm, (1 - cosθ) is 2 sin²(theta/2), and sinθ is 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2). So:

(1 - cosθ)/sinθ = [2 sin²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)] ] = [ sin(theta/2) ] / [ cos(theta/2) ] = tan(theta/2).

So ψ2 = tan(theta/2) * ψ1.

So the eigenvector components are ψ1 and ψ2 = tan(theta/2) * ψ1.

Let me write the eigenvector as [1; tan(theta/2)], but normalized.

Wait, normalization: the sum of the squares is |1|^2 + |tan(theta/2)|^2 = 1 + tan²(theta/2) = sec²(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(sec²(theta/2))) ) * [1, tan(theta/2)].

Simplifying, 1/sqrt(sec²(theta/2)) is cos(theta/2), because sec(theta/2) = 1/cos(theta/2). So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Because tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2), so the second component is sin(theta/2) when multiplied by cos(theta/2).

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

The vector before normalization is [1, tan(theta/2)].

The normalization factor is 1 / sqrt(1 + tan²(theta/2)) ) = cos(theta/2), since 1 + tan² x = sec² x, so sqrt is sec x, so reciprocal is cos x.

So, the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but another way: [1; tan(theta/2)] multiplied by cos(theta/2) gives [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

So the components are cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2).

Wait, but these are complex numbers? No, because the eigenvectors so far are real. But in quantum mechanics, the eigenvectors can have complex phases, but for spin-1/2 systems, the eigenstates are often taken as real in the direction of the measurement axis.

Wait, but I think when considering the general case, the eigenvector might have a phase factor. But in this problem, the eigenvalue is real, so the eigenvector would have real components if the operator is Hermitian, which it is because it's a spin operator.

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D is (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2)), but that includes ħ, which I don't think is correct here because the eigenvectors are dimensionless. So perhaps the options have errors, but looking back:

Wait, the problem statement says that the components of the operator are in terms of ħ/2 multiplied by the matrices. But the eigenvectors are vectors in the Hilbert space, so they're dimensionless. So the options should be dimensionless. So why are options A and D involving ħ?

Oh wait, option A is (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ), which has units of ħ, which can't be correct for a vector. Similarly, option D has sqrt(2/3) ħ and sqrt(1/3) ħ. So perhaps the correct answer is option C, the one without ħ.

Wait, let's see the options again.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) hbar, sqrt(1/3) hbar) – vectors can't have units, so this is possibly incorrect.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)) – this looks like spherical coordinates, but I don't think it's the right form.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)) – which matches what I derived.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) hbar cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) hbar sin(theta/2)) – again with units, which is wrong.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the eigenvector. Wait, when the eigenvalue is positive, which direction does the spin point? The eigenvector I found is [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

Wait, another approach. The general form of spin eigenstates along direction n is |+> = e^{-i phi/2} ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), and |-> = e^{i phi/2} ( -sin(theta/2), cos(theta/2) ). But since the problem specifies the eigenvalue +ħ/2, the eigenvector would be proportional to [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ], with a possible phase factor.

But the options don't include a phase factor. Looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the correct answer should be option C. But wait, let me think again. The operator P is given as a vector in the x-z plane, so the parameterization would involve theta (polar angle from z-axis) and phi=0, since it's in x-z plane.

Wait, but earlier I considered the direction in the x-z plane as (sinθ,0,cosθ), which corresponds to phi=0. So the eigenvector components are [cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)].

So looking back at the options, option C matches this form.

Wait, but the options presented are:

A) (sqrt(2/3)ħ, sqrt(1/3)ħ)

B) (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta))

C) (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2))

D) (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2))

So the correct normalized eigenvector is option C. But wait, let me think if I have to include any phase factors. The eigenvector could also have a global phase, but the form in option C doesn't have any, so it's correct.

But wait, what if the direction is different? For example, if the direction is along the x-axis, then theta is 90 degrees (pi/2 radians). Then cos(theta/2) is cos(pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, and sin(theta/2)=sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)), which is correct for the +x eigenstate.

In that case, option C would give [cos(pi/4), sin(pi/4)] which is [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2], which is correct.

Another test: if the direction is along the z-axis, then theta is 0. cos(theta/2) is cos(0)=1, sin(theta/2) is 0. So the eigenvector is [1,0], which is correct for +z eigenstate.

Similarly, if theta is 180 degrees, then cos(theta/2) is cos(90) = 0, sin(theta/2)=sin(90)=1. So the eigenvector is [0,1], which is correct for the -z eigenstate, but wait, our eigenvalue is +ħ/2, so perhaps only the direction of n affects this. Wait, no, because if n is along -z, then the eigenvalue +ħ/2 would correspond to the [0,1] state, which is correct.

So all the tests check out, which makes me more confident that option C is correct.


To calculate the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we proceed as follows:

The operator $\vec{P}$ is constructed as $P = n_x P_x + n_z P_z$, where $\vec{n} = (n_x, 0, n_z)$ is a unit vector in the x-z plane. The components of $\vec{P}$ are given in terms of $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
P | \psi \rangle = \left(+\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) | \psi \rangle
\]

Substituting the matrix form of $P$ and solving the eigenvalue equation, the normalized eigenvector is found to be:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Here, $\theta$ is the polar angle defining the direction of $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane. This result is consistent with the general form of spin-1/2 eigenstates along an arbitrary direction.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$  
   This option includes $\hbar$, which is incorrect because eigenvectors are dimensionless.

2. **Option B**: $(\cos(\theta), e^{i\phi}\sin(\theta))$  
   This form does not match the derived eigenvector structure for a spin-1/2 system along an arbitrary direction.

3. **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This matches the derived normalized eigenvector and is consistent with the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$.

4. **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$  
   This option incorrectly includes $\hbar$ in the components of the eigenvector, which is dimensionally inconsistent.

### Conclusion:
The correct normalized eigenvector is given by **Option C**.
