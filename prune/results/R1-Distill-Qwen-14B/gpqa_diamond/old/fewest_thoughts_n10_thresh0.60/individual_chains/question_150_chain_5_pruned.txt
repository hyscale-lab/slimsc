Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because NMR problems can be tricky. Let's take it step by step.

The molecular formula given is C8H9NO. Hmm, that's interesting. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So, C=8, H=9, N=1, O=1.

Plugging in: (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2 = 10/2 =5. So five degrees of unsaturation. That could mean a couple of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which accounts for 4) and then a double bond or a ring plus something else.

Looking at the NMR data:

9.72 ppm (t, 1H). That's a high ppm, possibly an aldehyde proton. But wait, the integration is 1H, so maybe it's something else. Or maybe it's an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes they can be a bit higher, especially if there's deshielding.

6.98 ppm (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region. A doublet suggests coupling with one neighboring proton. Maybe part of a para-substituted benzene ring. Wait, but if it's a doublet of two protons, perhaps it's adjacent to another substituent. Maybe a meta substituent?

6.51 ppm (d, 2H). Also aromatic, another doublet. This might be another set of protons on the benzene ring, perhaps in a para-substituted position as well. The fact that these are two doublets suggests two different sets of aromatic protons, maybe from two different benzene rings.

6.27 ppm (bs, 2H). Broad singlet. That could be something like an enol proton or maybe an aromatic proton with no neighboring H (like para substitution), but the broadness makes me think it's not aromatic. Maybe it's an -OH group, but in the aromatic region? Wait, but phenol OH is usually around 5 ppm. Oh, but maybe it's an allylic proton? Or maybe an alpha proton to a carbonyl group.
