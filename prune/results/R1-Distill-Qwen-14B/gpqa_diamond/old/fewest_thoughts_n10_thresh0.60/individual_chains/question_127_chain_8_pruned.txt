Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to remember.

First, I need to visualize the structure of the starting molecule. The name is 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. Wait, but wait, butylnona... no, wait, no. Wait, butyl is a substituent, right? So, nona-2,6-diene means a nine-carbon chain with double bonds between carbons 2-3 and 6-7. And the substituent, butyl, is attached to carbon 5.

Wait, but butyl is four carbons. So, the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, wait no. Wait, nona is nine carbons. So the main chain is nine carbons, with double bonds at 2,3 and 6,7. The substituent is butyl at carbon 5.

Wait, let me draw it out. Nona means 9 carbons. So positions 1 to 9. Double bonds at 2 and 6. So positions 2-3 and 6-7 are double bonds. Then, the substituent is a butyl group on carbon 5.

So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH2CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Wait, carbon 5 is where the substituent is. So, the main chain is nine carbons: positions 1 (CH2), 2 (CH2), maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I have to number the main chain correctly. For nona-2,6-diene, the main chain must have double bonds at 2 and 6. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because nona-2,6-diene would have double bonds starting at carbons 2 and 6. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-
