Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because angular momentum can be tricky, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator Ay. Let me read the setup again. The operator Ay is given as c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), and S is a 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is [0, -i], and the second row is [i, 0]. So, I can write down what S looks like.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

And then Ay = c * S. Since c is h/(4π), I'll substitute that in later.

I remember that the eigenvalues of a matrix can be found by solving the characteristic equation, which is det(Ay - a I) = 0, where a is the eigenvalue and I is the identity matrix. 

Let me write Ay explicitly. Since Ay = c * S, each element of S is multiplied by c. So Ay becomes:

[ 0      -i c ]
[ i c     0  ]

So the matrix is:
0    -i c
i c   0

Now, the characteristic equation is determinant of (Ay - a I) = 0. So, let's write that matrix.

Ay - a I becomes:

[ -a      -i c ]
[ i c     -a  ]

The determinant of this matrix is (-a)(-a) - (-i c)(i c). Let me compute that.

(-a)(-a) = a². Then, the other term is (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c². Wait, let's compute (-i c)(i c). Oh wait, wait: the determinant is (top left * bottom right) - (top right * bottom left). So it's ( -a * -a ) - ( (-i c) * (i c) )

So, (a²) - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c^2. Because when you multiply i and i, i^2 is -1. Let's see: (-i) * i = -(i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So (-i c)(i c) = (1) * c². So the determinant is a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0.

So the equation becomes a² = c² → a = ±c.

Wait, but c is h/(4π), so a is either h/(4π) or -h/(4π). But wait, what about the possibility of other factors? Let me double-check the multiplication.

Wait, let me correctly compute the determinant.

(Ay - a I) is:
| (-a)     (-i c) |
| (i c)    (-a)   |

The determinant is (-a)*(-a) - (-i c)*(i c)
= a² - [ (-i c)(i c) ]

Compute (-i c)(i c) = (-i)(i) * c^2. (-i)(i) is -i², which is -(-1) = 1. So, that product is (1) * c². So the determinant is a² - (1 * c²) = a² - c² = 0 → a² = c² → a = ±c.

So the eigenvalues are a = c and a = -c. Since c is h/(4π), the eigenvalues are h/(4π) and -h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are real numbers, no imaginary parts. Wait, but looking at the options, some have imaginary parts. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in calculating the determinant? Let me check again.

Wait, the matrix Ay is
