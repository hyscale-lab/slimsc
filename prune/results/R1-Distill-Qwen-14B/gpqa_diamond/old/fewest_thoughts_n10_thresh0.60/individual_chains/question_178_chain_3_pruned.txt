Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the Lagrangian of an interaction term and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability has to do with the dimensions of the coupling constants. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which I think is part of the definition of the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. Right, because σ matrices often come into play in things like the spinor representation of angular momentum or in certain interaction terms.

So, first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should figure out the dimensions of each term in the Lagrangian. In natural units (where ħ = c = 1), the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4 because the action S = ∫ d^4x L is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4.

Let me break down each part of L_int:

1. ψ̄: That's the Dirac adjoint spinor. The Dirac spinor ψ has a mass dimension of 3/2. So ψ̄ also has 3/2.

2. σ_{μν}: This is a product of two gamma matrices, each of which has mass dimension 1. Since it's a commutator of γ matrices, σ_{μν} should have a dimension of 2. Because (γ_mu)(gamma_nu) is 1*1=2, and the commutator [γ_mu, gamma_nu] is same as their product, I think. So σ_{μν} has dimension 2.

3. ψ: Another Dirac spinor, so dimension 3/2.

4. F^{μν}: That's the field strength tensor of a gauge field, like in electromagnetism. The field strength F is defined as ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu. Each derivative has dimension 1, and A is a vector potential. The vector potential A has dimension 1 because the field tensor F has dimension 2 (each derivative is 1, and A has 1, so [∂A] is 2, right? Or wait, no, F is ∂A, so F has dimension 1 (each derivative) + 1 (A) = 2? Wait, no. Wait, the derivative is mass dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So each term in F is ∂_mu A_nu, which is (1) * (1) = 2. So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Putting it all together, the term is κ multiplied by ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Let's compute the dimensions of each part:

ψ̄ has 3/2, σ_{μν} has 2, ψ has 3/2, F has 2.

So the
