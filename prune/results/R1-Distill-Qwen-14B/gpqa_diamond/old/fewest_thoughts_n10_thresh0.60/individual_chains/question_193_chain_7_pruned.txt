Okay, I need to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again. The question says that the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, N ∝ 1/(parallax)^5. Hmm, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, parallax (plx) is inversely proportional to distance. So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. Wait, no, actually, the formula is plx = 1/(d in parsecs), right. So if the distance is larger, the parallax is smaller.

The question is asking how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range. So I think they're asking about the density of stars as a function of distance. Or maybe the number per unit volume as you go further out.

Wait, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So substituting, N is proportional to (d)^5. Wait, let me do it step by step.

Parallax (plx) = 1/d, where d is in parsecs. So d = 1/plx. So if N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, that's the same as N ∝ d^5, because plx is 1/d, so (1/plx) is d, so (d)^5 is 1/(plx)^5.

Wait, but parallax is in arcseconds. For
