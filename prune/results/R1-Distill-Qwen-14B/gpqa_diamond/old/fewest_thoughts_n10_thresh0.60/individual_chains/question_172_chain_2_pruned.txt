Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their effective temperatures based on the excitation of iron atoms. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that iron atoms in star_1's photosphere are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. Oh right, when they say "excited," I think they're referring to the number of atoms in a higher energy state compared to a lower one. So, the excitation here is about population ratios.

The energy difference between the levels is given as approximately 1.38e-23 J. Wait, that's a specific delta E. Oh, and the stellar photospheres are in LTE, which stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, I can use the Boltzmann equation here, right? Because in LTE, the distribution of particles in energy states follows the Boltzmann distribution.

The Boltzmann equation is something like the ratio of populations in two energy states is equal to the exponential of the negative of the energy difference divided by (k*T), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature.

So, the formula I'm thinking of is n2/n1 = exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). But wait, in this case, star_1 has twice as many excited atoms as star_2. Let's clarify: the energy levels are E1 and E2, with E2 being higher than E1. So, the ratio n2/n1 for each star would relate to their respective temperatures.

Wait, the problem says that in
