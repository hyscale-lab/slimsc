Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for the reactions given. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN plus reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually go through some kind of addition. Oh wait, the cyanide ion (CN-) is a nucleophile, so maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

Wait, ketones typically undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. So when a ketone like butan-2-one reacts with something like NaCN, which provides CN-, it should add to the carbonyl carbon. But what kind of addition? I think when you add a cyanide to a ketone, you get a cyanohydrin formation. The cyanohydrin would have an alcohol group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

But wait, the product here is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that structure. So the carbon chain is four carbons in total. The second carbon (since it's butan-2-one) is the carbonyl carbon. The product has a hydroxyl (OH) and a nitrile (CN) group on the same carbon. So the reaction is adding CN and OH to the carbonyl carbon.

I remember that the formation of cyanohydrins can be done under acidic conditions. Because the cyan
