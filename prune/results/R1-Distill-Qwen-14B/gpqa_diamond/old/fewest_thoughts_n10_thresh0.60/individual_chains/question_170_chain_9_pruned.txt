Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. The state given is (3i, 4), and the options are provided.

Hmm, wait, the state vector is given as (3i, 4). I remember that spin states are usually represented as two-component vectors since the electron has spin-1/2. So the state should be a column vector, right? So maybe it's written as [3i; 4], meaning the first component is 3i and the second is 4.

First, I need to find the expectation value of S_y. The expectation value formula is <ψ| S_y |ψ>. Oh wait, S_y is given as sigma_y multiplied by ħ/2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators are (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrices. So S_y = (ħ/2) * sigma_y.

The sigma_y matrix is given as:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

So, let me write that down. The state is |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T. The expectation value is ψ† S_y ψ, which would be ψ† * (ħ/2) sigma_y * ψ.

Wait, but the dagger (conjugate transpose) of ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] because the first component is 3i, so its conjugate is -3i, and the second component is 4, which is real so it stays the same.

So calculating the expectation value would involve multiplying these matrices. Let me break it down step by step.

First, compute sigma_y matrix multiplied by the state vector |ψ>. Let's compute sigma_y |ψ>.

Sigma_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when we multiply this by [3i, 4], we do:

First component: 0*(3i) + (-i)*4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i
Second component: i*(3i) + 0*(4) = 3i^2 + 0. But i^2 is -1, so 3*(-1) = -3. So the result is [ -4i, -3 ].

Wait, wait, I think I should double-check that
