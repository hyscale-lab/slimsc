Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me see. The question gives me the Lagrangian interaction term between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Wait, the Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λf ψ̄_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Oh right, I think that's the interaction term. So the coupling is between the boson X and the fermion ψ_f, right? So X can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs because the interaction term allows for it.

But wait, what's the general rule for decay kinematics? Oh right, the rest mass of the boson must be greater than or equal to twice the mass of the fermion pair it's decaying into. Because each fermion would need at least half the mass to have enough energy for their rest mass.

So the boson X has a mass of 6 GeV. So any fermion pair where each fermion has a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV would be allowed. Because 2 * 3 GeV = 6 GeV. That's the threshold. If the fermion's mass is more than 3 GeV, the decay isn't allowed kinematically.

Now, let's list the known fermion masses. Let me think:

- Electron (e): about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ): ~1.78 GeV
- Up quark (u): about 0.0035 GeV (but I think in many cases, it's considered as much lighter)
- Down quark (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.27 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.1-4.7 GeV
- Top (t): way
