Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but let's try to think it through. The question is about finding the interplanar distance for a (111) plane in a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I remember that interplanar distance is calculated using some formula involving the lattice parameters and the Miller indices.

Wait, rhombohedral crystals. Oh right, a rhombohedron is a type of crystal structure where all edges are equal and all angles are the same. So in this case, the interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. Oh wait, but wait—rhombohedral systems can be either acute or obtuse, but in this case, all angles are 30 degrees, which is acute.

I think the formula for the interplanar distance d_hkl is given by d = a / sqrt( (h^2 + k^2 + l^2) + 2(hk cos gamma) + 2(hl cos beta) + 2(kl cos alpha) ) ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Or is it another formula? Oh wait, no, another approach is using the general formula for interplanar spacing in a crystal.

Wait, I think more accurately, the formula is d = a / sqrt( h² + k² + l² - 2(hk cos α) - 2(h
