Okay, so I have this question about crystallography, specifically about a rhombohedral crystal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question gives me the interatomic distance as 10 Angstroms, and all the angles alpha, beta, gamma are 30 degrees. I need to find the interplanar distance for the (111) plane. The options are A to D.

Wait, what's a rhombohedral crystal again? Oh right, it's a type of crystal structure where all the edges are of equal length, but the angles aren't necessarily 90 degrees. So it's like a cube that's been squeezed or stretched in some directions, but all sides are the same length. In this case, the angles are all 30 degrees, which is much smaller than 90, so the crystal is probably more compressed.

The interatomic distance is 10 Angstroms. I think in a rhombohedral structure, the unit cell has parameters a, b, c. Since it's rhombohedral, a = b = c. So all edges are the same length. Let's denote this as 'a'. Then, the unit cell is defined by a, and the angles alpha, beta, gamma, which are all 30 degrees here.

Wait, but interatomic distance is the distance between atoms. In a simple cubic structure, the interatomic distance would be 'a', the edge length. But in rhombohedral, perhaps the atoms are arranged differently. Oh, wait, maybe in a simple rhombohedral structure, each atom is at the corners of the unit cell, but given the angles, the actual distance between atoms might not just be 'a' because of the angles.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the unit cell parameters. The interatomic distance would be the nearest neighbor distance. So for a simple cubic structure, it's a√(something). Let me think.

No, wait. In a cubic system, the nearest neighbor distance is a√2 for a face-centered cubic (but that's not rhombohedral). Alternatively, for a simple cubic, the nearest neighbor is a, but that's when angles are 90 degrees. But in a rhombohedral case, the unit vectors have angles between them.

Let me think about the
