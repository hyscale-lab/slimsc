Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. They want to know the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to prepare the solution and the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. Right, so Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and we're adding a strong acid to dissolve it. I remember that hydroxides react with acids to form salts and water. So Fe(OH)3 should react with the strong acid to produce Fe^3+ ions and water.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, but the acid is strong, so the reaction should go to completion. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

First, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is... let's see, iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51=106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. So approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter. Wait, the volume is in cm³, so 100 cm³ is 0.1 liters. But wait, the acid is being added to make the solution, but the total volume after adding the acid would be 100 cm³ plus whatever volume of acid we add. Hmm, but wait, the question is about the minimum volume needed. So I think the approach is to find how much H+ is needed, then calculate the volume from the concentration.

So the H+ needed is 0.002808 moles. The acid is monobasic, so it provides 1 mole of H+ per mole of acid. So moles of acid needed = moles of H+ needed = 0.002808 moles.

The concentration of the acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. So
