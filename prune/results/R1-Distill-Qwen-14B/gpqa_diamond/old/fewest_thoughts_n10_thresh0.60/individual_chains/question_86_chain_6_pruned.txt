Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let me read it again.

The question says that a chemist did two reactions with two unknown compounds, A and B. Each was treated with a different reducing agent. The products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, but one is the R configuration and the other is S. The options give different starting materials for A and B.

Wait, so the products are epoxides? Or wait, no, tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is a cyclic ether with a ketone group. Oh right, pyran is a six-membered oxygen ring. So tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one would be a five-membered ring? No, wait, pyran is six-membered. So 2H-pyran-2-one would have the ketone at position 2. So it's a six-membered ring with an oxygen, and a ketone group at position 2. And there's an ethyl group at position 4.

The products are (R) and (S) configurations. So the starting materials must be ketones or something that can form these upon reduction. Wait, what's the reaction here? The reagents are LiBH4 and BH3 followed by H+.

LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent. It can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols, right? BH3 is also a reducing agent, like in hydroboration. Wait, no, BH3 is used with THF as a Lewis acid catalyst for hydroboration reactions. Or wait, sometimes BH3 is used for the reduction of carbonyls as well. Wait, LiBH4 and BH3 are both used in carbonyl reductions. But wait, wait, LiBH4 is more powerful and can reduce things like esters and amides, but BH3 is typically used for aldehydes and ketones. But in the presence of something else, maybe it can do more.

Wait, the products are both 4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. Wait, but the products are the same compound but enantiomers. So the starting materials must have been ketones that form the same alcohol upon reduction but with opposite configurations.

Wait, no. Because the product is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else. Wait, another thought: the products are
