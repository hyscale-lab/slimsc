Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow and think through each part carefully.

The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then determining the product when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Hmm. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are involved in some kind of elimination reaction, maybe a substitution or something else. Wait, no, red phosphorus is often used in the substitution reactions, like maybe for converting alcohols to other groups. Or wait, maybe it's related to the HI acting as an acid?

Let me start by looking at the spectral data to figure out what compound X is. The IR and NMR should give me clues about the structure.

First, the IR data: 3400â€“2500 cm-1. That broad range usually suggests an O-H stretch, like in an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. The strong peak around 1720 cm-1 is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That could be from a carboxylic acid, ester, ketone, or maybe an aldehyde. But the 1720 is a bit high for an aldehyde, which is around 2800 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. Wait, no, the 1720 is the C=O. For a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm-1, but sometimes a bit higher. An ester is around 1730-1750, but 1720 could be either. Hmm. Also, there's a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1. Those are around the regions for aromatic C=C stretching. So, the compound probably has an aromatic ring.

Looking at the NMR now. The 1H NMR shows several signals:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): That's a broad singlet, which is typical for an O-H proton in a carboxylic acid. So maybe there's a carboxylic acid group. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic -OH, but in that case, the chemical shift would usually be around 5-7 ppm, unless it's something else. But 10.5 is more indicative of a carboxylic acid proton.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Like, two protons in the ortho positions and two in the para? Wait, no, wait. For a para-substituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets. For example, in para-disubstituted benzene, each set of two protons would be as doublets. So if the substituent is in the para position, the protons adjacent to it would be deshielded and split into doublets. So this suggests a benzene ring with two substituents in the para positions. Wait no, wait. If it's a single substituent in the
