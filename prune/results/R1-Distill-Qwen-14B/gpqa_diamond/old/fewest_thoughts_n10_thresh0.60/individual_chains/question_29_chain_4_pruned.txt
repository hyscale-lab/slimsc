Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about barley cultivars and mutations. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question is about a drought-resistant barley plant that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and looked at the gene sequence in all of them. The problem is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. The gene's normal sequence is given. Let me look at the wild type and the mutants.

Wild type starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1 has some changes in the first exon. Let me compare each mutant's sequence to the wild type.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the first part, I see the wild type has TTTCTCGC. Mutant 1 has TCTACGC. So in the middle, instead of CT, maybe a change? Let's see: the fifth and sixth nucleotides in wild type are TT, but in mutant 1 it's CT. Hmm, wait, maybe I should line them up.

Wait, let me write the wild type and mutants more clearly. Let's take the first part.

Wild type: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA
Mutant 1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

Wait, I'm not sure. Let me look at the sequences.

Wild type starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So comparing the first part, the wild type is ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT..., and mutant 1 is ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTT ACT...

Wait, wait, perhaps it's better to split into triplets for codons.

Let me try that. So wild type part:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Mutant 1:

ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA

So looking at the third codon: wild type is CTC (Leucine), mutant is CT ACG? Wait, maybe I
