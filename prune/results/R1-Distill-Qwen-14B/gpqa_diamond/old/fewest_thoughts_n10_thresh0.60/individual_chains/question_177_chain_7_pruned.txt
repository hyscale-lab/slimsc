Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem in front of me. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through what I remember.

The question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Let's read the details again.

Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2. So, Radius_1 = 1.5 * Radius_2. Similarly, the mass of Star_1 is 1.5 times that of Star_2. So Mass_1 = 1.5 Mass_2. 

The astronomers found that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest (the wavelengths of maximum emission) are the same. Hmm, I think this relates to blackbody radiation and Wien's Law. Wien's Law says that the wavelength of maximum emission is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. So, λ_max = b / T, where b is Wien's displacement constant. If both stars have the same λ_max, that means their temperatures are the same. So T_1 = T_2.

Wait, but wait! Are they emitting the same wavelength because their temperatures are the same, or because of some other reason? I'm pretty sure it's because of temperature. So the stars have the same temperature.

Oh wait, but wait again—what about Doppler shifts? Because the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0, meaning it's not moving towards or away from us (no Doppler shift in wavelength), and Star_2 has a radial velocity of 700 km/s. So maybe the observed wavelengths are different because of Doppler effect, but the problem states that the wavelengths at which they appear brightest are the same. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, its observed wavelength would be blueshifted, but the peak would be at a different temperature. So perhaps this affects the calculation. Or maybe when the problem refers to the wavelengths, they are in the rest frame of the stars, not the observed frame. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Let me think again. The question says the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest are the same. So, as observed from Earth, their peak emission is at the same wavelength. But
