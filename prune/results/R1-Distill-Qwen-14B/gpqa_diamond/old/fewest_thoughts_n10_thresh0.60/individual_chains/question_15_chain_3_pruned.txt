Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

So, the question is about two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected using the radial velocity (RV) method, which gives their minimum masses and orbital periods. They have the same mass, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. Both have circular orbits, which probably simplifies things.

The host stars are different. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. But both stars have the same radius. Hmm, why would that be? Oh, maybe because Planet_2's star is a bit evolved, but same size as Planet_1's host. Interesting.

The researchers want to choose the planet with the higher transit probability because they have limited time. Transit method detects exoplanets when they pass in front of their star, blocking some light. The probability depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the orbital distance.

Wait, the transit probability (P) for a planet is given by the formula P ≈ (R_planet / R_star)² * (a / (a * e + R_star)), assuming edge-on orbit. But I think when the orbit is circular, e=0, so the formula simplifies. So P ≈ (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (1/(1 + (R_star/a))). Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think.

Alternatively, I remember that the probability is roughly (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (1 / (1 + (R_s / a)))^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach: the transit probability is proportional to (R_p / R_s)^2 multiplied by (a / (R_s (1 + sqrt( (a^2)/(R_s^2 + a^2) )) )) )... Hmm, maybe I should look for the formula.

Wait, I think the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and the size of the orbit. For a planet with orbital distance a, and star radius R, the probability increases if the planet's orbit is such that it's more likely to cross our line of sight. The key factors are the star's size and the planet's distance.

Wait,
