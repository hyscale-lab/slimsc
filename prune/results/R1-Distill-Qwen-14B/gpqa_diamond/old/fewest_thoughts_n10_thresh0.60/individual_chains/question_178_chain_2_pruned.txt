Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I remember that σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which are the commutators of the gamma matrices. So σ is an antisymmetric tensor made from gamma matrices.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should find the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian, because the Lagrangian must be dimensionless in natural units (since the action is dimensionless).

Wait, actually, in quantum field theory, the Lagrangian density has mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions because the action ∫ L d^4x is dimensionless. So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let's break down each part of the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F.

I remember the fields ψ (fermions) have mass dimension 3/2 each. Because for a Dirac spinor, [ψ]_M = 3/2. So ψ̄ would also have the same dimension since it's ψ† γ^0.

Now σ_{μν} is a product of two gamma matrices, each with dimension 1. So σ_{μν} is dimension 2? Wait, no, because σ is a composite of gamma matrices. The gamma matrices are dimensionless? Or do they have a dimension? I think γ matrices are treated as dimensionless objects because they're part of the spinor representation. So σ_{μν}, being built from γ matrices, is dimensionless.

F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for a gauge field. Wait, in electromagnetism, F is made from the photon field A, which is a vector field. For a vector field A_μ, its dimension is 1. Because for a gauge field in 4D, the dimension is [A_μ] = 1. So the field strength F^{μν} is the derivative of A plus the structure constants for non-abelian fields, but the dimension would still be [∂
