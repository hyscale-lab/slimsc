Okay, so I've got this question about stars and the excitation of iron atoms in their photospheres. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So the question says that in star_1, the iron atoms are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. The energy difference between these levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. And we're assuming Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE), so I can probably use the Boltzmann equation here.

Wait, Boltzmann distribution. Right, the probability of a particle being in a certain energy state is proportional to exp(-E/(k*T)). So the ratio of the populations of two energy levels, say level 2 and level 1, would be n2/n1 = exp(-(E2-E1)/(k*T)). Oh wait, but in this case, the problem says that the excitation is higher in star_1. So the number of excited atoms in star_1 is twice that of star_2 for the same energy level. Or wait, no, wait, the problem says the excitation level is twice as excited, so maybe the population in the excited state is higher.

Wait, no. Wait, the question says that the iron atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So for a specific energy level, the number of atoms in that level in star1 is twice as much as in star2. Hmm, but wait, the energy difference is given. So let's say E is the energy of the excited state, and E may be higher than the ground state
