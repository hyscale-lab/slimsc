Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it carefully. Alright, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. I remember that the uncertainty is calculated using the formula ΔP_z = sqrt(<P_z²> - <P_z>²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The system is in an eigenstate of P_x corresponding to eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). And the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z. Oh right, that means the state is expressed in the eigenbasis of P_z. So the components of the vector are the probabilities or... wait, the state is already in the eigenbasis of P_z, so measuring P_z would give definite values, but wait, no, because the state might be a superposition. Wait, no. Wait, if the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, then the state is written in terms of those. So each component corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. So the state is a linear combination of these eigenstates.

Wait, but if the basis is the eigenbasis of P_z, then the state vector's components are the coefficients of each eigenstate. So when measuring P_z in this state, the possible outcomes are the eigenvalues of P_z, which are the diagonal elements of P_z's matrix. Looking at P_z's matrix: first row is (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, -ħ.

Wait, but the state is given by the vector (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the first component is for the eigenstate of P_z with eigenvalue ħ, the second component is for the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0, and the third component is for the eigenstate with eigenvalue -ħ. So the state is a combination of these three states.

But wait, the state is in the eigenstate of P_x, so when you measure P_x, you get -ħ. So the state is an eigenstate of P_x, which
