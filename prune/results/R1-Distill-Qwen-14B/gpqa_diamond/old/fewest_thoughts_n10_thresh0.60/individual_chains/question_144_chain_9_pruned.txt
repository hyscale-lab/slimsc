Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson decay. Hmm, I remember mesons are subatomic particles, right? They're made up of a quark and an antiquark. But the question is about the mean decay distance of this meson resonance, X.

Alright, the given data: production energy E_X is 8 GeV, mass m_X is 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X is 320 MeV. I need to find the mean decay distance. The options are all in the order of 1e-15 or 1e-16 meters. So, I'm thinking this has to do with how far the meson travels before it decays.

Wait, I think the mean decay length is related to the particle's lifetime and its speed. Oh right, the formula is something like L = gamma * c * tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor, c is the speed of light, and tau is the proper lifetime. But wait, particles that are resonances have a very short lifetime, and I think their lifetime relates to their width Γ.

Right, the uncertainty principle! The width Γ is related to the lifetime τ by Γ = ħ / τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. But wait, no, actually, I think it's Γ ≈ ħ / τ. But wait, actually, the width Γ is the total decay width, which is related to the lifetime by Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ.

Wait, but I've also heard that the mean lifetime is the inverse of the decay
