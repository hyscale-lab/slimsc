Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We need to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required to do this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving a pH and a volume.

Hmm, right. So, Fe(OH)3 is a hydroxide, and I remember that it's a poorly soluble solid. To dissolve it, we usually need an acid because the OH- in Fe(OH)3 will react with H+ from the acid. The reaction between Fe(OH)3 and a strong monobasic acid (like HCl or H2SO4, but since it's monobasic, probably HCl) would produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and the conjugate base of the acid, like Cl-.

Wait, the acid is monobasic, so it donates one H+. So the reaction should be Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

But wait, Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So when it reacts with H+, each OH- will take a H+. So for each Fe(OH)3 molecule, we need 3 H+ ions.

So first, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles.

The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, H is 1.008. So Fe(OH)3: 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1.008) = 55.85 + 3*(17.008) = 55.85 + 51.024 = 106.874 g/mol.

So, 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 / 106.874 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me write that correctly: 0.1 g / 106.874 g/mol ≈ 9.356e-4 mol.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately.

0.1 / 106.874 = (let me get this right) 0.1 divided by about 106.87. So 0.1 / 100 is 0.001, but since it's 106.87, it's a bit less. So approximately 0.0009356 mol. Let's keep it as 9.356e-4 mol.

Now, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires
