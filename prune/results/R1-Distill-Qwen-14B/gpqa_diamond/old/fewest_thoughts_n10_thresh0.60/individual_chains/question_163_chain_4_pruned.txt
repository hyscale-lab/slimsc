Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these types of questions. But I'll try to think it through step by step. 

The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid. Let's break it down. The goal is to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M strong acid needed to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³, and also find the pH of the resulting solution. 

First, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and it's insoluble in water, but it can react with strong acids. The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions to produce Fe³+ and water. 

So, let's write the equation. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. Reacting with a monobasic strong acid (like HCl or HNO3), the reaction would be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O.

Okay, so the acid is monobasic, meaning each molecule provides one H+ ion. So, for every mole of Fe(OH)3, we need three moles of H+.

Next, I need to calculate the moles of Fe(OH)3. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron (Fe) has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, Hydrogen is 1. So, Fe(OH)3 is Fe + 3(OH). 

Fe: 55.85
Each OH is 17 (1+16), so 3*17 =51. 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol for Fe(OH)3.

Given mass is 0.1 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.0009359 moles. Let's say approximately 9.36 x 10^-4 moles.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+, the moles of H+ needed are 3 * 9.36e-4 ≈ 0.002808 moles.

Now, the acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter (1000 cm³). We need to find the volume (in cm³) that contains 0.002808 moles. 

Molarity formula: M = moles / volume(L). So, volume = moles / M.

Volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, but wait, the options given include 28.05 cm³ as option C. Close enough, considering rounding.

But wait, wait. The problem says 100 cm³ total volume. Does that mean the acid solution plus the Fe(OH)3 solution makes up 100 cm³? Or is the total volume including everything? Hmm, in stoichiometry, when you mix solutions, the volumes may not be additive, but in dilute solutions, it's often approximated. So perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume. So, after adding the acid, the total solution is 100 cm³. So, the volume of acid needed is 28.08 cm³, and the total volume is 100 cm³. That makes sense because if you add 28.08 cm³ of acid to some solution (maybe the Fe(OH)3 is already in solution?), but perhaps the question is simplifying. Alternatively, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, so the acid volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution equals 100 cm³. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So when you add the acid to the Fe(OH)3, the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid needed is 28.08 cm³, but when you mix it, the total is 100 cm³. So that would make the volume of acid 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. But let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH about 2.0
