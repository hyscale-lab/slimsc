Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky. Hmm, it says to assume stars are uniformly distributed. Wait, uniform distribution—does that mean they're spread out evenly in all directions? I think that's what it implies. So the density of stars is the same everywhere, right?

The question is about how the number of stars per unit range of parallax (plx) changes with plx. So I need to relate the number of stars to the parallax. Let me recall what parallax means. Parallax is a measure of distance; the closer a star is, the larger its parallax. The formula I remember is that distance d is approximately 1/parallax (in parsecs), so d ≈ 1/plx.

Wait, but how does the number of stars relate to parallax? Since parallax is inversely proportional to distance, a higher parallax means a closer star. So if stars are uniformly distributed, the number of stars within a certain distance should increase as we get closer. But wait, the question is about the number per unit parallax. Hmm.

So let's think about the volume. If stars are uniformly distributed, the number density (stars per unit volume) is constant. Let’s say n is the number density. The volume of a sphere with radius d is (4/3)πd³. So the number of stars within distance d is n*(4/3)πd³.

But how does this relate to parallax? Since d is 1/plx, substituting that in, the number N within parallax plx would be proportional to (1/plx)^
