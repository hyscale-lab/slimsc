Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. There are five such compounds known. The first part talks about substance A1, which is bright red and decomposes at 293 K into A2 and fluorine. Oh, and A1 can oxidize xenon under normal conditions. Hmm, oxidizing xenon usually means it's a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine is a strong oxidizer, but wait, what about some of its compounds?

Wait, I remember that when F2 is a strong oxidizing agent, but some fluorides can be as well. For example, I think about the decomposition of certain fluorides. Let me think: when a fluoride decomposes, it might release F2 gas. So if A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, then A1 is probably something like a diatomic fluoride, but wait, that would just split into two atoms. Maybe it's a polyatomic fluoride, like perhaps something with a higher oxidation state.

Wait, when A1 decomposes, it produces A2 with a certain oF (I think oF here refers to the oxidation number of fluorine, right?). So oF is 31.96%, which I guess is the percentage of the fluorine's oxidation state. Wait, noâ€”wait, wait. Oh, no, wait, oF is the oxidation number. So for example, in some compounds, F can have a negative oxidation state
