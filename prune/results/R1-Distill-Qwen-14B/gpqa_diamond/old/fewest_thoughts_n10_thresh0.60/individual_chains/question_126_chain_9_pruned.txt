Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reaction mechanisms yet. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem says that an organic chemist did two reactions, I and II. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: normal-phase and chiral. I need to figure out how many peaks each will show.

Let me start by breaking down each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is Lithium Aluminum Hydride, a strong reducing agent. It typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So, the starting material is a ketone. The structure of (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

CH3-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Let me count. Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3. So the structure would be:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, wait. Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let me think again. The molecule is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. But the 5th carbon is where the methoxy is attached. So the structure is:

Carbon chain: 1, 2, 3 (CO), 4, 5 (OCH3), 6.

So, the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH3.

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is:

CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Let's draw it as:

Carbon 1: CH3-
Carbon 2: CH2-
Carbon 3: C(O)-
Carbon 4: CH2-
