Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question has two reactions, and I need to determine the major products A and B and then choose the correct option from the four given. 

First reaction: 1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol is treated with THF, KH (which I think is potassium hydride), and then H+. I remember that THF is a common solvent, often used in Grignard or other organometallic reactions. KH is a strong base, so maybe it's deprotonating something here.

Second reaction: (E)-pent-2-en-1-ol is treated with acetyl bromide under basic conditions with LDA (lithium diisopropylamide). LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base, so it's probably deprotonating the alcohol to form an enolate.

Let me tackle each reaction one by one.

Starting with the first reaction:

1-vinylspiro[3.5]non-5-en-1-ol. The structure of this compound is a spiro compound where two rings are connected by a single atom. The spiro is between a 3-membered and a 5-membered ring. The 1-vinyl means there's a vinyl group attached at position 1. So, the structure probably has a bridge, and the alcohol is at the bridgehead.

When KH is used, it's usually a strong base that can deprotonate acidic hydrogens. In the case of alcohols, especially those that are in a conjugated system, the alpha hydrogens can be acidic. Wait, but this is an spiro alcohol. Are the hydrogens adjacent to the oxygen acidic enough for deprotonation by KH?

Wait, more accurately, potassium hydride (KH) is a strong base. It can deprotonate alcohols to form alkoxide ions. So in this case, the hydroxyl group (OH) would be deprotonated to form an O-.

But wait, maybe it's more about the possibility of elimination or
