Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with titration calculations, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, let's read the problem again. We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid. We dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking about the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are provided, and the Ka is given as 1.85x10^-5.

Hmm, first, I think I should figure out what happens when we dilute the acetic acid with water. So, the initial volume is 20 cm³ and 0.05 M. When we add 20 cm³ of water, the volume becomes 40 cm³. Since concentration is moles per liter, the moles of acetic acid remain the same, but the volume doubles, so the concentration halves. Let me calculate that.

Moles of acetic acid initially: Molarity x Volume (L). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ (which is 0.02 L) of water, the new volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the new concentration is 0.001 moles / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, but when we titrate with NaOH, we'll be neutralizing some of the acetic acid. So at 25% titration, we've added 25% of the required NaOH to reach the equivalence point. And at equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized.

Let me think about the equivalence point first. Because understanding that might help me find the concentrations needed for the other parts.

At equivalence, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH. The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001 moles (from earlier). Moles of NaOH needed at equivalence point would be equal to that, 0.001 moles.

The NaOH solution is 0.1 M. So the volume of NaOH needed at equivalence is moles / Molarity = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³.

Wait, but since the initial solution after dilution is 40 cm³, adding 10 cm³ of NaOH brings the total solution volume to 50 cm³. So after equivalence, the solution will have sodium acetate as the main component.

But at equivalence, the solution is a sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate is a salt of a weak acid (acetic acid) and a strong base (NaOH). So the solution will be basic because the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions.

The concentration of sodium acetate at equivalence point is moles / total volume. The moles of sodium acetate is 0.001 moles (same as acetic acid initially). The total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³, which is 0.05 L.

So concentration = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, to find the pH at equivalence point, I can calculate the pH of a 0.02 M sodium acetate solution. Sodium acetate dissociates completely in solution: CH3COO^- Na+ → CH3COO^- + Na+.

The acetate
