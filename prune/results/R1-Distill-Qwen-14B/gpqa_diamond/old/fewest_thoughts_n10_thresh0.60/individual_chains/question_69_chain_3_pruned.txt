Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in a bubble chamber. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and its proper lifetime is τ₀ = 8e-16 seconds. We need to find the minimum resolution required to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the bubble chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, okay, so the bubble chamber is a detector that can track particle paths. The resolution here probably refers to the ability to distinguish the decay point accurately. But I'm not exactly sure how that connects to the problem.

I remember that when particles decay, their lifetime is dilated if they're moving at relativistic speeds. So the observed lifetime (from the lab frame) would be longer than the proper lifetime. The formula for time dilation is τ = γ * τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how does that help here? Oh, because the decay length depends on the velocity and lifetime. The decay length L is the average distance the particle travels before decaying. So L = v * τ, where v is the velocity.

Wait, but to find the minimum resolution, we need to ensure that the detector can distinguish a significant fraction of these decay events. So perhaps we need to calculate the decay length and then determine what fraction is needed.

The question asks for at least 30% of the decays to be observed. So 30% or more of the particles decay within a certain length that the detector can resolve. So maybe the detector's resolution should be such that the length L is at least a certain value, ensuring that 30% of the particles decay within that length.

Wait, actually, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle decays within a certain length L is P = 1 - e^(-L / λ), where λ is the mean decay length. But maybe here, since they're asking for at least 30% to have decayed, we can set P = 0.3, so 0.3 = 1 - e^(-L/λ), which would give L = -λ ln(1-0.3).

Wait, I'm
