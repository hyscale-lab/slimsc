Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question gives me a density matrix ρ, which is (1/2)(|0><0| + |1><1|). And it's asking about the geometrical position in the qubits space. The options are vectors in 3D space, like (1,1,0), (0,0,1), etc.

Wait, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed (not a pure state). Pure states can be written as |ψ><ψ|, but this looks like a mixed state since it's an average of two projectors.

So the given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. That makes sense because it's a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. I think this is the completely mixed state, which is the maximally uncertain state.

Now, how does this relate to the geometry of qubits? Qubits live in a two-dimensional Hilbert space, but when we talk about their position in space, maybe it's in Bloch sphere coordinates. Oh right, the Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states. For pure states, the state is on the surface of the sphere, and mixed states are inside.

The Bloch vector for a density matrix ρ is given by r = [x, y, z], where each component corresponds to the expectation values of the Pauli matrices. So the density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch vector and the identity matrix.

The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. So, I can expand our given ρ and compare it to this form.

Wait, let's compute ρ. The given ρ is (|0><0| + |1><1|) multiplied by 1/2. Let me write |0> and |1> in terms of their basis matrices. |0> is [1, 0]^T, |1> is [0, 1]^T.

So |0><0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1><1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]]. Then multiplied by 1/2, ρ becomes [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].

Now, let's express this using the Bloch vector. The general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Wait, no, that's (I + r · σ ) / 2.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]].

So, compute (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Let's compute each term:

I/2 is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]].
