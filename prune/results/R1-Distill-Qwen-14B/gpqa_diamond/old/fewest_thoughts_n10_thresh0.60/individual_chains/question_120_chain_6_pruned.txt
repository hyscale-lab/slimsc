Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, specifically how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that parallax is related to distance. Oh right, the parallax in astronomy is the apparent shift of a star's position when observed from different points in Earth's orbit. The formula I recall is that the distance (d) in parsecs is the reciprocal of the parallax (plx) in arcseconds. So, d = 1/plx.

But the question is about the number of stars per unit range of parallax. So, I think it's about how the density of stars changes with distance. Like, how many stars are there in a given range of parallax values.

Let me visualize this. If I have a certain parallax range, say from plx to plx + dplx, what's the number of stars in that range? Stars are uniformly distributed, so their number should depend on the volume of space they occupy in that range.

Wait, uniform distribution in space... So, the number of stars in a volume depends on the volume. But how does parallax relate to the volume? Parallax is inversely proportional to distance. So, as parallax increases (which means we're looking at closer stars), the volume per unit parallax changes.

Wait, maybe I should model this. The number of stars in a thin shell between distance d and d + dd is proportional to the surface area of the shell times the thickness dd. Surface area is 4πr², and thickness is dd. So, the number is proportional to 4πd² dd.

But parallax plx = 1/d. So, substituting d = 1/plx. So, d² = 1/plx², and dd would be related to d plx? Let me see. If d = 1/plx, then dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact relation here.

Wait, the number of stars in the parallax range from plx to plx + dplx. Let's express this in terms of distance. Since plx = 1/d, then d = 1/plx. So, if plx increases by dplx, d decreases by (d plx)^2, because d = 1/plx. Hmm, maybe I should think about the differential.

So, the number of stars between plx and plx + dplx would be proportional to the volume between 1/(plx + dplx) and 1/plx. But wait, no, because as plx increases, d decreases. So, the volume between d and d + dd is 4πd² dd, but in terms of plx, what is dd in terms of dplx?

Let me express d in terms of plx: d = 1/plx. So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx. Because the derivative of (1/plx) with respect to plx is -1/plx². So, dd = - (1/plx²) d plx.

Hmm, but the number of stars is proportional to 4π d² dd. Substituting d = 1/plx and dd = -(1/plx²) d plx, we get:

Number of stars ∝ 4π (1/plx)^2 * (-1/plx² d plx)
Wait, but the negative sign suggests decreasing plx as d increases, but since we're considering the number in a range, perhaps I should take the absolute value.

So, the number dN is proportional to (1/plx^2) * (d plx
