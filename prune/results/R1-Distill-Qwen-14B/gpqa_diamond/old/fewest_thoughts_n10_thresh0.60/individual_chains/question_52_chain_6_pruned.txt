Alright, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem. Let me read it again and break it down. 

Okay, the question is about a star with certain parameters and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium atoms in two energy levels. Hmm. I remember that when stars have spots, it can change their overall temperature, which in turn affects the ionization states of elements in their photosphere. 

The star's given parameters are 1.5 solar radii and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K, but when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. Wait, spots are cooler regions, right? So when they cover part of the surface, the star's overall brightness and temperature decrease.

The main thing here is the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, levels 1 and 2. The ratio decreases when the star has spots. So, when there are spots, this ratio is lower. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes—so without spots divided by with spots.

I think this has to do with the Saha equation. The Saha equation relates the ionization states of atoms to the temperature and density. But wait, in this case, it's about the ratio of two energy levels in the same ion. Oh, right, for the same element in the same ionization state, the ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by the Boltzmann equation.

The Boltzmann equation is n_i / n_j = (g_i / g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(kT) )

Where:
- n_i and n_j are the number of particles in energy levels i and j.
- g_i and g_j are the statistical weights (degeneracy factors) of the levels.
- E_i and E_j are the energies of the levels.
- k is the Boltzmann constant.
- T is the temperature.

In this problem, the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the temperature drops, the ratio decreases. Let's think about why.

The transition corresponds to a wavelength of approximately 1448 Å, which is in the near-ultraviolet or maybe far-UV. But for this problem, the wavelength might relate to the energy difference between the levels. But I'm not sure if that's directly needed; perhaps the main point is the temperature dependence.

So, when the star has no spots, T is 6000 K. When it has spots, the overall T is 5500 K. Wait, but wait—does the presence of spots affect the overall photospheric temperature? Because the spots are cooler, but the rest of the surface is hotter? Or does the problem consider the effective temperature as the average? Because when spots cover a part of the surface, the effective temperature is lower than the unspotted surface.

Wait, the problem says when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases to 5500 K. So the effective temperature is a sort of average. But does that mean the temperature in the photosphere of the unspotted regions is higher? Or is the entire photosphere at 5500
