Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem. It's a bit tricky, but I'll take it step by step. Let's read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. So Y is some element that forms five different binary compounds with F. Binary compounds mean each has two elements, Y and F in this case.

The problem describes several substances: A1, A2, A3, A4, A5. I'll need to figure out what each of these is based on the given information.

Let's list out the clues:

1. A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature, around 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. So the decomposition reaction produces F2 as one of the products. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so being oxidized suggests A1 is a strong oxidizing agent.

2. A3 can also interact with xenon. A3 is obtained by fluorinating Y. So fluorinating Y gives A3, which is a binary compound of Y and F.

3. When Y is added in a 1:1 molar ratio to a hot, concentrated, colorless solution of A4, A5 is formed. Then, in water, A5 decomposes into two substances.

The question is asking for the molecular weight range of A4.

Hmm. Let's think about which element Y could be. Since there are five binary compounds with F, Y must be a common element that forms multiple fluorides.

Possible candidates for Y could be elements like oxygen (which forms OF2, O2F2, etc.), but wait, fluorine is more electronegative than oxygen, so maybe another element. Alternatively, maybe Y is something like chlorine, but that might not form five binary fluorides. Wait, another thought: maybe Y is oxygen? Because oxygen forms several fluorides. Let's think: O and F can form OF2, O2F2, maybe others?

Wait, another approach: The decomposition of A1 into A2 and F2. So A1 and A2 are different fluorides of Y. When A1 decomposes, it forms F2 and another compound. So perhaps A1 is a higher fluoride, and decomposes into a lower one plus F2.

Wait, for example, suppose Y is oxygen.
