Okay, so I have this physics problem here about oscillating charge distributions and radiation. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that there's an oscillating charge distribution shaped like a spheroid, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and they're asking what fraction of A is radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and what the form of f is.

I remember that in antenna theory and radiation, the radiation pattern often depends on the angle. For a dipole antenna, the radiation is maximum at the equator (theta=90 degrees), and falls off as cos(theta) squared as you move towards the poles. But wait, in this case, the charge distribution is oscillating spheroidally. I'm not exactly sure about the symmetry here.

Wait, the problem says it's spheroidal, so maybe it's a dipole-like structure, but perhaps it's more like an oscillating dipole in an axisymmetric situation. Wait, or maybe it's a quadrupole? No, no, oscillating charge distributionâ€”probably a dipole. Because dipoles are common in such contexts.

For a dipole radiator, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is the radiation zone here) is given by the dipole formula. The power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) is proportional to (sin theta)^2, I think. Or wait, no, wait. Let me think. The radiation pattern for a dipole is maximum at theta=90 degrees and decreases as you go towards theta=0 or 180. The formula for the radiation intensity (in terms of the far field) is proportional to (sin theta)^2, right? So the maximum occurs when sin theta is 1, so theta=90 degrees.

Wait, but in this case, the maximum power is given as A. So if the maximum occurs at theta=90, then the fraction at theta=30 would be (sin 30)^2, because the intensity is proportional to (sin theta)^2.

Wait, sin 30 is 0.5. So (0.5)^2 is
