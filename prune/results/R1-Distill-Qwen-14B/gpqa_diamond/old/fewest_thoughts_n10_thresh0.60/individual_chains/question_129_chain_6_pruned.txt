Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about identifying compound E based on a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are some hints and options provided, so I'll need to piece everything together.

First, let's outline the reactions:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to form compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D loses an inert gas to form compound E.

And then there are two hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR of A has a strong peak at ~1750 cm^-1, and E's IR is ~1715 cm^-1.

The options are A, B, C, D, each being a ketone (since the suffix is -one). So E is a ketone.

Let me tackle this step by step.

Starting with compound A. The IR peak at 1750 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl group. So A is likely a ketone or maybe an ester or aldehyde. But considering the reaction sequence, let's see.

Reaction 1: A + HCN â†’ B. HCN typically adds to carbonyls. So if A is a ketone, reaction with HCN would form a cyanohydrin. So B would be a cyanohydrin, which has an alcohol and a cyanide group adjacent.

Wait, but wait. Wait, another possibility: if A is an aldehyde or ketone, HCN would add via nucleophilic addition. So for a ketone, the product would have an -OH and -CN group added to adjacent carbons.

Then, reaction 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. That's catalytic hydrogenation. So the -CN group in B would be reduced. The cyanide group (-CN) would become a methylene group (-CH2-), because when hydrogenated, CN (which is sp-hybridized) would reduce to CH2 (sp3). So compound C would have a CH2 group where B had CN.

Then, reaction 3: C reacts with HNO2. HNO2 is nitrous acid, which is typically involved in the formation of diazonium salts. But wait, the conditions matter. If C is a secondary amine, then HNO2 would form a diazonium, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, I'm thinking about the reaction of alcohols with nitrous acid. Wait, no. C is formed by hydrogenation of B, which was a cyanohydrin. So B would be a secondary alcohol with a CN group attached. Upon hydrogenation, the CN becomes CH2, and the OH remains. So C would be a diol? No, wait, let me think again.

Wait, more accurately: let's think about what B is. When a ketone (A) reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohy
