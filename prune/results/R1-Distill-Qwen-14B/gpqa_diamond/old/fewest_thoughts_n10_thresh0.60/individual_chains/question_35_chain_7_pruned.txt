Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about the intrinsic angular momentum of a muon. Hmm, let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, A_y, is represented by a 2x2 matrix. It's given as A_y = c·S, where c is h/(4π) and S is another 2x2 matrix. The matrix S has the first row as (0, -i) and the second row as (i, 0). So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. Then, based on that, I have to determine which of the statements A to D is correct.

Let me break this down. First, I should probably write out the matrix A_y. Since c = h/(4π), A_y is c times the matrix S.

So S is:
[ 0   -i ]
[ i    0 ]

Multiplying by c = h/(4π), A_y becomes:
[ (h/(4π)) * 0       (h/(4π)) * (-i) ]
[ (h/(4π)) * i       (h/(4π)) * 0 ]

Which simplifies to:
[ 0          -i h/(4π) ]
[ i h/(4π)    0       ]

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Because c times S would actually be each element multiplied. So the first element is 0, but the others would be c multiplied by the respective S elements. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of A_y. The eigenvalues a satisfy the equation det(A_y - a I) = 0.

The matrix (A_y - a I) would be:
[ -a          (-i h)/(4π) ]
[ (i h)/(4π)    -a       ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (i h/(4π)) * (-i h/(4π)) ) ].

Let me compute that. The determinant is a² - [ (i * (-i) ) * (h/(4π))^2 ].

Wait, i times negative i is negative i squared. i*(-i) = -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the second term becomes (1) * (h²/(16 π²)).

So determinant equation: a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²). Taking square roots: a = ± h/(4π).

Wait, but wait. Let me think. The eigenvalues of S would be the same as those of A_y, scaled by c. So S is a 2x2 matrix, which is similar to the Pauli Y matrix. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So S should have eigenvalues ±1. Then, A_y = c S would have eigenvalues c*(±1) = ±c, which is ± h/(4π).

But looking at the options, option A says the eigenvalues have imaginary parts
