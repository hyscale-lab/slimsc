Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. 

First, let me read the question again. It says: What is the index of hydrogen deficiency of the product obtained when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess of HI? The options are A to D.

Hmm, so I think I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency, also known as the degree of unsaturation, is a way to determine the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. The formula for calculating it is Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbon atoms, H hydrogen, X halogens, and N nitrogen. But in this case, the reaction product might have changed the structure, so I need to figure out what the product is first.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to visualize that structure. So, it's a cyclohexene ring. The 'cyclohex-3-ene' part means there's a double bond between carbons 3 and 4. Then, substituents are at positions 2 and 5. 

At position 2, there's a formyl group (-CHO), which is a carbonyl group. At position 5, there's a vinyl group (-CH2-CH2?), wait no, wait. Wait, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2? No, no, wait. Vinyl is CH2=CH-, so it's a substituent with a double bond. So position 5 has a vinyl group attached. So the structure is cyclohexene with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (CH2CH2?), no, wait. Let me think again. The substituents are at 2 and 5. So the cyclohexene ring has double bond between 3 and 4. Then, at carbon 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at carbon 5, a vinyl group, which is CH2-CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. So the structure is 2-formyl, so the substituent is attached to the ring at C2 as O=CH-, and at C5 it's a vinyl group, which is CH2CH2 with a double bond. So the vinyl is -CH2-CH2? No, wait, the vinyl group is -CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. Oh wait, no, the vinyl group is a substituent with a double bond. So in this case, the structure would have a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between 3 and 4, a formyl group on C2, and a vinyl group (which is a CH2-CH2 group but with a double bond) on C5. So the vinyl is attached as CH2=CH-.

Wait, but the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the ring is cyclohexen, and on carbons 2 and 5, there are substituents. So I think the structure is: cyclohexene with double bond at 3,4; formyl group on 2 (so a carbonyl group attached to C2), and on C5, a vinyl group (so CH2=CH- attached). And also, the carboxylic acid part is in position 3? Wait, no. Wait, the full name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) is at position 3, because the main ring is cyclohexene, and the position of the substituents are given in order of
