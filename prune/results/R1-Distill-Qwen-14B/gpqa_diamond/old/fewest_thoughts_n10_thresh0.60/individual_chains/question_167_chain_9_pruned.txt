Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. And N is the normalization constant, which is sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). Oh right, because the states |alpha> and |-alpha> are coherent states, and when you add them, you have to normalize.

The problem asks for the non-Gaussianity (nG) when phi is -pi/4 and alpha is 0.5. The measure given is del_b, which is the relative entropy between the state's density matrix rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. The formula is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau).

Wait, but wait. I remember that the relative entropy between two states is also known as the quantum Kullback-Leibler divergence. Oh, right, but for non-Gaussian states, calculating this might get tricky, especially because Gaussian states are easier to handle.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to find the density matrix rho of the given state |psi>. Since it's a pure state, rho is |psi><psi|. Then, I need to compare it with a Gaussian state tau. But what Gaussian state are we considering here? The problem says it's a reference Gaussian state. I think for cat states, the reference is often a coherent state or perhaps a thermal state. Wait, sometimes for cat states, the reference is the state that the cat state is built from. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the reference is the vacuum state or a coherent state.

Wait, the problem says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. So I need to figure out what that reference state is. For a cat state, which is superposition of two coherent states, the reference might be each of the coherent states in the superposition. Or perhaps it's the state that each cat state is compared against. Wait, maybe the reference Gaussian state is the state that would make the relative entropy calculation straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps when the state is a cat state, the reference Gaussian state is the state that the
