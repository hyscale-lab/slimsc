Okay, so I have this question about ChIP-seq experiments, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the details, but let me think it through. The question is about what happens when using PFA fixation versus PFA plus DSG. The peaks disappear when both are used. Hmm.

Wait, I remember that PFA is paraformaldehyde. It's used as a fixative to crosslink proteins to DNA. But wait, doesn't PFA usually fix everything, including proteins and the chromatin structure? So why would the peaks disappear when using PFA+DSG?

Oh right, I think DSG stands for Dithiothreitol. DSG is a reducing agent. So when you fix with PFA, it crosslinks proteins and DNA, making them stick together. But sometimes, you want to modify the crosslinking to allow certain proteins to be released more easily. Like, maybe the crosslinks are too strong in some regions, so you use DSG to break some of them, making the chromatin more accessible for sonication or fragmentation.

Wait, in ChIP-seq, you usually crosslink with PFA, then shear the DNA. But if the crosslinking is too strong, the DNA might not shear properly, leading to larger fragments. So using DSG along with PFA might help in making sure the DNA-protein crosslinks are more manageable, allowing for better fragmentation.

Now, the question says that when they used PFA+DSG, the ChIP peaks (IKAROS binding sites) disappeared. So why would that happen? Oh, wait! IKAROS is a transcription factor that binds to DNA. If the crosslinking is more efficient with PFA alone, maybe the DSG is reducing the crosslinking, making the antibody less effective in pulling down the DNA-protein complexes.

Wait another thought: DSG is often used to reduce disulfide bonds. So maybe, in the presence of DSG, certain regions where the proteins are more tightly crosslinked would be more affected. Or perhaps when there's more DSG, it's causing the release of certain proteins, preventing them from being captured by the antibody.

Wait, but why would that lead to disappearance of peaks at specific genomic regions? So the peaks are no longer found when both PFA and DSG are used. Maybe the method of fixation affects which regions are captured more efficiently.

I recall that PFA is a strong fixative, but can lead to incomplete fragmentation. DSG
