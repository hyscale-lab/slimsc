Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The question is about dissolving Fe(OH)3 in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution. Hmm, right, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it should react with a strong acid like HCl or something similar.

The problem states that we're at 25°C, which is room temperature, so I don't think the temperature will affect the calculations much in this context. The given mass of Fe(OH)3 is 0.1 grams, and the total volume is 100 cm³. We need to find the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required. Also, we have to determine the pH of the solution after this reaction.

First, I'll think about the reaction between Fe(OH)3 and the strong acid. Since Fe(OH)3 is a base, it will react with the acid in a neutralization reaction. The general reaction for such a base and a strong acid would be something like Fe(OH)3 + 3HCl → FeCl3 + 3H2O. Oh wait, but wait, Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so it might not completely dissociate. But since we're adding a strong acid, the acid will donate H+ ions which will react with the OH- from Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but wait. For the stoichiometry part, let's get the molar masses right. Fe has a molar mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, and Hydrogen is 1. So Fe(OH)3 would be 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol. So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Hmm, wait, let me compute that again. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is about 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3.

Fe(OH)3 is a base, so when it reacts with a strong acid, it will consume H+ ions. Each Fe(OH)3 can provide 3 OH- ions, so each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to completely neutralize it. So the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3. So 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 moles H+.

The acid is monobasic and strong, so each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. So the moles of acid needed would be 0.002808 moles. Since the concentration of the acid is 0.1 M, which is 0.1 moles per liter (1000 cm³), the volume required would be moles divided by concentration. So 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C says 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So maybe that's the right volume. But wait, the question asks for the minimum volume. So perhaps this is the correct volume needed to just neutralize Fe(OH)3.

Wait, but wait a second. Fe(OH)3 is a
