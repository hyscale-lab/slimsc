Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, so the question is about identifying compound E through a series of reactions starting from compound A. There are multiple steps, so I'll need to break this down step by step.

The first reaction is compound A reacting with HCN to form compound B. I remember that when ketones react with HCN, they form cyanohydrins. So maybe compound A is a ketone. The IR peak for compound A is around 1750 cm^-1, which supports that because ketones typically have strong absorption around there. 

So, A is a ketone. Then, B is the cyanohydrin. Next, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Hydrogenation of a nitrile group (from HCN) would typically reduce it to an amine, but wait, wait, no. Wait, the cyanohydrin would have an -OH and an -CN group adjacent. Wait, no, wait. Let me think: when a ketone reacts with HCN, the cyanide adds to the carbonyl group, forming a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group attached to the adjacent carbon. So the structure would have an -OH and a -CN on adjacent carbons. But wait, maybe it's more like the cyanide adds to the carbonyl carbon, making a new carbon-nitrogen bond, and the oxygen becomes an -OH. So the product would be a vicinal diol with a nitrile group. Or wait, no, no, wait. Let me think again. The reaction of a ketone with HCN adds the cyanide to the carbonyl, leading to a secondary alcohol and a nitrile group. Wait, no, the product is a cyanohydrin, which is a compound where the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a hydroxyl and a nitrile group on adjacent carbons. So the structure would be a diol but with one of the OHs being replaced by a CN group. Hmm, maybe I'm getting that wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a secondary alcohol with a nitrile group on the adjacent carbon. So when A is a ketone (like cyclohexanone), reacting with HCN gives a cyanohydrin. Then, when we hydrogenate that with H2 and P
