Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

So, the starting material is cyclohexanone. Then there are a series of reactions leading to product 4, and I need to find out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are on product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, let me think about each reaction step by step.

First step: Cyclohexanone treated with bromine, forming product 1. I remember that when ketones react with bromine, it's usually a dibromination. Wait, but wait, ketones can undergo various reactions with bromine. Oh right, in the presence of a base, cyclohexanone might undergo a halogenation. Wait, but wait, cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone. Maybe it's the alpha position that's reacting. Oh, wait! I think that when you add bromine to a ketone, it's an example of the Hell-Volhard-Zelinskii reaction, which adds bromine to the alpha carbon(s). But wait, wait, I might be mixing that up. Alternatively, cyclohexanone might undergo a dihalogenation at the alpha positions. So, cyclohexanone has two alpha carbons, each with two hydrogens (since cyclohexanone is (CH2)5CH with a ketone group, so the
