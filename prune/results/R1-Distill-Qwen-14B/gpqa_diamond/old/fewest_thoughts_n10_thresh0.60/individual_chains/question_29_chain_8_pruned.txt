Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which mutant would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. The question is about gene mutations caused by EMS. Let me break it down.

First, the intact gene sequence is given. All the mutants have changes in the first exon. Since the gene is involved in making the anti-nutritional compound, a mutation that disrupts the gene's function should reduce or eliminate the compound.

Looking at the mutations:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So, comparing, the third position in the third codon changed. Let me see: the original starts with ATG, then TTT, then CTC. In mutant 1, the third codon is TAC instead. Let's get the amino acids.

ATG is methionine. TTT is phenylalanine. CTC is leucine. In mutant 1, the third codon is TAC, which is tyrosine. So, the amino acid changes from Leu to Tyr. That's a missense mutation but not a frameshift or nonsense.

Mutant 2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Looking at the changes. Original has CG, now it's GCT. Wait, let me check each part.

Original: first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

Wait, maybe I should compare each triplet. Let me see:

Original first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT...
Mutant 2: ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGC...

Wait, no, maybe I should compare the sequences line by line.

Wait, the initial part of the intact gene is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...

Mutant 1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, let's see the exact changes.

In the intact gene, the first part is:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAA TAT TTA TGT CGT...

Mutant 1's sequence is:

ATG
