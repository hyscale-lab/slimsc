Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product after a reaction.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. I should probably draw its structure to visualize it better. So, cyclohexene means it's a six-membered ring with one double bond. The numbering is a bit tricky, but I think the substituents are at positions 2, 3, and 5.

Wait, the substituents: 2-formyl, which is a formyl group (-CHO) attached to carbon 2. Then 5-vinyl, which is a vinyl group (-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, vinyl is -CH2CH2? No, vinyl is CH2=CH-. Oh right, so the vinyl group is attached to carbon 5. And the cyclohexene part has a double bond at position 3. So, positions 3 and 4 are double bonded? Or 2 and 3? Let me think. The name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The carboxylic acid is at position 1, I guess. Wait, no, the numbering starts such that the substituents get the lowest numbers. But maybe I should focus on the reaction first.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh wait, red phosphorus with HI is typically used for deoxygenation of carbonyl groups. Like in the Wolff-Kishner reaction, but that uses hydrazine, right? Or maybe it's a different reaction. Wait, another thing: when a carbonyl (like aldehyde or ketone) is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might form a compound with a hydrogen and iodide addition. Or maybe it's a Wittig-like reaction? No, wait, the Wittig uses a different reagent. Alternatively, I remember that when aldehydes or ketones react with HI and red phosphorus, it's called the Cleve elimination or maybe it's a deoxygenation.

Wait, I think I read that aldehydes and ketones when treated with HI and red phosphorus undergo a reaction where the carbonyl is converted into a methylene group. So, RCHO +
