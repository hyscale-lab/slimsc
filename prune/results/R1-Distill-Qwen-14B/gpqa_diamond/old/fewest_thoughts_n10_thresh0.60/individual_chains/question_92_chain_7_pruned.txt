Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the enthalpy of formation of a specific organic compound. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me think this through. 

The compound given is (CH3)2C=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH=C(CH3)2. That's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize the structure. It looks like a diene with multiple substituents. Wait, maybe I should count the number of each type of bond in the molecule because the problem gives me bond energies.

Wait, no. The problem is about calculating the enthalpy of formation, which is the change when 1 mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So the standard enthalpy of formation, right? The formula for that is the sum of the bond energies of the reactants' bonds minus the sum of the bonds formed in the product. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Oh, right, the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the concept that you take the elements in their standard states, form all the bonds of the compound, and calculate the energy change.

Alternatively, another approach is using the formula: ΔHf° = Σ [ΔH of bonds broken] - Σ [ΔH of bonds formed]. Wait, no, wait. The general formula I remember is that the enthalpy of formation is the enthalpy required to break all bonds in the reactants minus the enthalpy required to break all bonds in the products. Or wait, perhaps it's the sum of the bond energies in the reactants minus the sum in the products. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me get this straight.

Wait, another approach: the enthalpy of formation is calculated using the bond energies. The formula is:

ΔHf = (Σ bond energies of reactants) - (Σ bond energies of products)

Wait, no. Oh wait, no. Because when you form the molecule, you're breaking bonds in the reactants and forming bonds in the product. So the enthalpy of formation would be the energy required to break all the bonds in the elements (reactants) minus the energy released when the bonds of the compound are formed.

Alternatively, the standard method is to think about the formation of the molecule from its constituent atoms. For example, for a molecule AB, the enthalpy of formation is the energy required to break A-A and B-B bonds (if they exist as diatomic) and form A-B bonds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of atoms. Let's consider that each molecule is built from its constituent atoms. For example, for a hydrocarbon, you start with H2 and CO2? No, wait, the elements are in their standard states, which for carbon is graphite or diamond? Wait, but the given data is about enthalpy of atomization. Oh, the problem states that the enthalpy of atomization of carbon is 1000 kJ/mol. Hmm, I think that's the energy needed to break all bonds in carbon (as in, breaking C-C bonds in graphite, maybe) to form gaseous atoms. So for each carbon atom, it's 1000 kJ/mol divided by the number of atoms per molecule.
