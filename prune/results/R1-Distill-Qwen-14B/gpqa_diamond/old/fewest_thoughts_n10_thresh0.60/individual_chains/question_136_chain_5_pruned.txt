Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field inside a sphere. The vector field f(r) falls off radially as 1/r², and it's only got a radial component.

Wait, so the vector field is f(r) = (something)/r² in the radial direction. Since it's a vector field, I guess the components in the theta and phi directions are zero, right? So f(r) has only the r-hat component, which is 1/r².

I remember that divergence in spherical coordinates isn't as straightforward as in Cartesian. The formula for divergence in spherical coordinates is: (1/(r²)) * d/dr (r² f_r) ) + ... but since the other components (f_theta and f_phi) are zero, those terms drop out. So divergence of f is (1/r²) * d/dr (r² * f_r).

Wait, f_r is the radial component, which is 1/r². So plugging that in, the divergence becomes (1/r²) * d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ].

Let me compute that. r² * (1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So the divergence ∇ · f is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin? Wait, but at r=0, the function isn't defined because 1/r² would blow up.

Oh wait, right! So this vector field is like the electric
