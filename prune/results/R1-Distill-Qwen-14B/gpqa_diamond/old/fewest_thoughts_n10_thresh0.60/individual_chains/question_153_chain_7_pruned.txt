Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the products of these Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I remember that the Michael reaction involves enolate ions acting as nucleophiles attacking an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. But wait, I should think through each part step by step.

First, let's look at the first reaction: dimethyl malonate, methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, and NaOEt in EtOH. Oh right, NaOEt is a base, so it would deprotonate the malonate to form an enolate. Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it's a strong, stabilized enolate.

The other reactant is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate. The structure of this is something like CH2=CH-CO-OCH3, but the substituent is p-tolyl. Wait, no, the formula is methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate, so the structure is CH2=C(p-tolyl)-CO-OCH3? Or wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-; so 3-(p-tolyl) would mean the substituent is on the middle carbon? So the structure would be CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CHCOOCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-OOCCH3? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2=C(CO2Me)-p-tolyl? No, wait. The correct structure: (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CH–COOCH3 with a p-tolyl group on the beta position. Wait, no, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO–, so 3-(p-tolyl) would be on the third carbon, but that doesn't make sense because CH2=CHCOO– is only three carbons. Oh wait, no, perhaps it's more like CH2=CH-C(p-tolyl)-COOCH3? No, that can't be right. Maybe I should think of it as the acrylate part is the conjugated system. So, methyl (E)-3-(p-tol
