Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay in the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me see what it's asking.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻, and the proper lifetime τ₀ is 8e-16 seconds. The question is about finding the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV.

Wait, right. Proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the rest frame of the particle. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation. So the observed lifetime τ would be longer than τ₀. The formula for time dilation is τ = γ τ₀, where γ is the Lorentz factor.

But how does this relate to the resolution needed? Oh right, because the decay products (Y and Z) will move apart over time, and the resolution of the detector (the Bubble Chamber) must be good enough to distinguish the decay vertex from the original position of the X⁰ particle. So the minimum resolution would correspond to when the decay occurs just far enough that the detector can see it.

Wait, the proper lifetime is the lifetime in the particle's rest frame. So in the lab frame, the lifetime is longer. The distance the decay products travel before we can detect them would be important. Oh wait, but how does the energy relate here?

Wait, the energy given is for the X⁰ particle, I suppose. The energy E
