Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about sigmatropic rearrangements. Hmm, I remember that sigmatropic rearrangements involve the shift of a sigma bond along with a pi bond, right? The key thing is that the pi bond moves into a sigma bond, and these are pericyclic reactions, so they involve concerted movements of electrons.

The question has three parts, each with a different starting material and reaction conditions. I need to figure out the products A, B, and C, and then match them with the options provided.

Let's start with the first reaction:

1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine + but-3-en-2-ol + (H+ + Heat) â†’ A

Wait, what's going on here? 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine has two methoxy groups on a central carbon connected to an amine. But-3-en-2-ol is an allylic alcohol. H+ and heat make me think of acid catalysis. So maybe this is a Claisen-like rearrangement, but with an amine involved.

Claisen rearrangement typically involves allyl vinyl ethers rearranging into gamma,delta-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. But this starting material is different. Wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine might have a structure like (CH2OCH3)2NH. But that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's like N,N-dimethoxyethylamine? Or perhaps it's more like OCH3 groups attached to a central carbon, which is attached to an amine. Let me try to draw it.

The structure would be: 

CH2(OCH2CH3)2NH? No, wait, 1,1-dimethoxyethan-1-amine would be CH2(NH)(OCH3)2? Or maybe it's (CH2OCH3)2N-CH2- something? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as CH2(NH)(OCH3)2. Alternatively, perhaps it's N,N-dimethoxyethylamine, but I'm not entirely sure.

But wait, but-3-en-2-ol is CH2CH2CHOH. No,
