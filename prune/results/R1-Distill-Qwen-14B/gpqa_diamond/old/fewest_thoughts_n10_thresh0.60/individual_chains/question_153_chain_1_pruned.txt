Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Michael addition reactions. Hmm, I need to figure out the reactants and products for each of the reactions given. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Michael reaction.

From what I remember, the Michael reaction is a 1,4-conjugate addition where a nucleophile attacks the beta carbon of an alpha-beta unsaturated carbonyl compound. The nucleophile here is usually an enolate ion, which makes the reaction possible. The product typically has a new carbon-carbon bond formed between the enolate's alpha carbon and the beta carbon of the Michael acceptor.

Looking at the first reaction (A):
The reactants are dimethyl malonate and methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate with sodium ethoxide (NaOEt) in ethanol (EtOH). Dimethyl malonate is a good nucleophile because it can form an enolate. When NaOEt is present, it deprotonates the malonate at the alpha position, generating an enolate.

Methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate has the structure CH2=CHCO-OCH3, but wait, no, wait. Wait, 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be something like CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3. Wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So methyl acrylate is CH2=CHCO-OCH3. So 3-(p-tolyl) would be at the alpha position? Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Wait, the structure of methyl (E)-3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be: the acrylate is propenoate. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, with a substituent (p-tolyl) on C3. So it's CH2-C(p-tolyl)=CH-OCH3? No, wait, acrylate is CH2=CHCOO-. So 3-(p-tolyl)acrylate would be CH2=CHC(p-tolyl)O-OCH3? Or maybe it's CH2=C(p-tolyl)COOCH3? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's (E)-configuration,
