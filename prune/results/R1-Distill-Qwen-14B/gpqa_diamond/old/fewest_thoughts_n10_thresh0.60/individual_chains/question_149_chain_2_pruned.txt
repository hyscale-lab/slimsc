Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this NMR and LC-MS question. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that we've got a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR spectrum looks right except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Oh wait, same alpha-proton but two peaks. Hmm. The shifts are similar, integrals together add up to 1H, so each is about half. And the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause. So what else could cause two peaks for the same proton?

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature. Two peaks with equal intensities, same mass. So same mass implies same molecular weight, so same molecules. But why two peaks then?

Let me think about the options:

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be different. The question says the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule, so the mass is same. So A is probably not it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, so in NMR, for a chiral center, you can get diastereotopic protons. Wait, no. If the compound is a racemic mixture, then in solution, the NMR would show the same as the pure compound because enantiomers have the same NMR. Oh wait, but in a racemic mixture, the peaks would be the same. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. Unless the proton is in a diastereotopic position? Hmm, not sure.

Option C: Double coupling during amide formation. Double coupling would imply something like a splitting due to coupling with two different sets of protons. But the question says they ruled out spin-spin coupling as the reason. Because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it. So maybe this isn't the case.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR peaks would be different. But wait, in the NMR, the same alpha-proton is giving two peaks. If the sample is a diastereomeric mixture, each diastereomer would have its own set of protons. But would the same proton appear as two separate peaks?

Wait, if the molecule has a stereocenter elsewhere, then the alpha
