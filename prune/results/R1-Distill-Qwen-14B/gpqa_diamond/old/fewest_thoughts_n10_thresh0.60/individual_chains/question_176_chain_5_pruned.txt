Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about quantum mechanics and measurements of observables. Hmm, I remember that when you measure an observable, the system collapses into an eigenstate of that operator. So the order of measurements matters here because measuring P first will change the state before measuring Q.

The initial state is given as a column vector (-1, 2, 1). I think I should normalize this because in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. So let me calculate the norm. The vector's components are squared and summed: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6), which means the state is (1/sqrt(6))*(-1, 2, 1).

First, I need to find the possible outcomes when measuring P. The operator P is given by the matrix. I should find its eigenvalues because those are the possible measurement results. Alternatively, maybe I can look for the eigenvectors because measuring P will project the state onto one of P's eigenvectors.

Wait, P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me write it down:

P =
[ 0       1/√2    0     ]
[1/√2    0       1/√2  ]
[ 0       1/√2    0     ]

Hmm, I think this matrix might have a particular structure. Looking at it, it seems symmetric, which makes sense because observables should have Hermitian operators. So yes, P is Hermitian.

To find eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0. Let's compute that.

The matrix P - λI is:

[ -λ     1/√2     0 ]
[1/√2   -λ      1/√2]
[ 0     1/√2    -λ ]

Calculating the determinant:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * something.

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row:

= -λ * det[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)^2 ) ] - (1/√2) *
