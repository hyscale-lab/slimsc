Okay, so I have this question about genetics and mutant barley plants. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The problem is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The goal is to eliminate this compound by mutating the gene responsible for its synthesis. The gene has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and looked at the target gene in the mutants.

The question is asking which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. So, I think the idea is that the mutation disrupts the gene's function, perhaps by causing a premature stop codon or altering the protein enough that it doesn't work.

Looking at the sequences provided, I need to compare the wild-type (intact gene) with each mutant. The changes are in the first exon area. Exons are coding regions, so any mutation here could affect the protein.

First, let me look at each mutant:

Wild-type sequence starts with 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
The ATG is the start codon, so this is the beginning of the protein.

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
Comparing to wild-type, let's line them up.

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … 
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC …

So, looking at the changes in the first part. From TTT in wild-type to TTC in mutant 1. Then CTC becomes TAC. Wait, is that correct? Let me count the letters.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look at exact differences. Let me compare each position.

The first part is:

Wild: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ... 
Mutant 1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, at position after ATG, the wild has TTT, mutant1 has TTC. So that's a T to C change in the second position? Wait, or perhaps it's the third nucleotide. Wait, the exact positions:

Wait, the wild is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Mutant1 is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGAT...

Let me write the wild and mutant sequences in blocks.

Wild starts: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TTC TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, in the first few codons:

Wild: TTT (Ser), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu)...
Mutant1: TTC (Ser), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu)...

So, the first codon after ATG is TTT in wild, TTC in mutant. That's a change in the third T to C. So TTT to TTC is a substitution from Ser to Ser (since TTT is Ser, TTC is also Ser). So no change there? Wait, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong.

Wait, wait, each codon is three nucleotides. So Wild has TTT (Ser), and Mutant1 has TTC (Ser as
