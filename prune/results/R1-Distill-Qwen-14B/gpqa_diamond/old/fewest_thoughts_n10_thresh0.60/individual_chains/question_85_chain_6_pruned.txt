Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star has a mass of 1.5 solar masses, radius 1.2 times the Sun, and Teff of 6300 K. The planets, Planet1 and Planet2, have different masses and radii. Planet1 is 7 Earth masses and radius 1.7 Earth, while Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radius. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about the equilibrium temperatures of the two planets. The options give different ratios, so I need to compute T1/T2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Oh right, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), I think. Since both planets have the same albedo, that part cancels out.

Wait, but to find the equilibrium temperature, we need the distance of each planet from the star. How do I find that? The question mentions the transit and radial velocity methods. Oh, right, because when a planet transits, we can find the size ratio, but for distance, RV gives the mass and the velocity, so maybe that relates to the distance.

Wait, the RV method measures
