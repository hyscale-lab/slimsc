Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. We're supposed to find the minimum volume of a 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to dissolve it and then determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm. I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a metal hydroxide. To dissolve it, we can use an acid in a reaction. Since it's a metal hydroxide and we're adding a strong acid, probably the reaction would be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with H+ ions to produce Fe³+ and water.

Let me write down the reaction. Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe³+ + 3 H2O. Right? Because the hydroxide has three OH- groups, each needs an H+ to neutralize.

So, first, I need to find out how many moles of Fe(OH)3 we have. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed for that. Iron has an atomic mass of about 55.85 g/mol. Oxygen is 16, hydrogen is 1. So for Fe(OH)3, it's 55.85 + (3*(16 + 1)) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

We have 0.1 grams. Moles = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 mol. Let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is approximately 0.0009357 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ ions. So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 * 0.0009357 ≈ 0.002807 mol.

The acid provided is 0.1 M. So, the volume needed is moles divided by concentration. Volume = 0.002807 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³. That's very close. So the volume is about 28.05 cm³. But wait, the question asks for minimum volume. Could there be another factor to consider?

Oh wait, perhaps after dissolving all Fe(OH)3, the solution's volume is 100 cm³. But when adding the acid, the volume increases a bit. Hmm, but the problem might be assuming that the total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid volume is part of that. Or maybe it's a dilution problem. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Wait, no, the total volume after adding the acid is 100 cm³. But the acid added is a certain volume. Hmm, wait, no, the original solution is 100 cm³, but perhaps the acid is added to it, but the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So the volume of acid added plus the volume of the solution would be 100 cm³? I'm a bit confused, but maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Since the problem is about the minimum volume to dissolve, perhaps the 100 cm³ is the final volume, and the acid volume is calculated as 0.02807 liters, which is 28.07 cm³,
