Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decay and the CERN Bubble Chamber. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. They want to know the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. The energy in the Bubble Chamber is 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. The options are A to D, all with different units.

Hmm, I think this has to do with the decay length and how well the detector can resolve it. Right, because in particle physics, the proper lifetime is the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame. But when the particle is moving, we have to consider time dilation. So the actual lifetime in the lab frame would be longer. 

Wait, right, the lifetime observed (τ) is gamma times τ₀, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. Gamma is equal to E / m c², but maybe since we're dealing in natural units (GeV and such), the c² might be accounted for. Hmm, but let me think. The energy E of the particle is given as 27 GeV. And the rest mass is 3.41 GeV. So gamma would be E/(m c²), but in units where c=1, E (in GeV) is equal to gamma m c². So if E is 27 GeV and m is 3.41 GeV, then gamma is 27 / 3.41. Let me calculate that.

27 divided by 3.41 is approximately 7.917. So gamma is about 7.917. So the lifetime in the lab frame would be gamma multiplied by the proper lifetime. So τ = gamma * τ₀. So that's 7.917 * 8e-16 s. Let me compute that.

7.917 * 8e-16: Let's see, 7 *8 is 56, 0.917 *8 is about 7.336. So total is 56 +7.336 =63.336e-16 s. So around 6.3336e-15 seconds.

Wait, but wait. The lifetime of the particle, when observed in the lab frame, is longer. So the decay length would be the speed of the particle multiplied by this lifetime. The speed can be found from the energy and mass, maybe.

The speed beta (v/c) is given by sqrt(1 - (m² c^4)/(E² c^4)), but in natural units, that's sqrt(1 - (m²)/(E²)). So m is 3.41 GeV, E is 27 GeV.

So (m/E) is 3.41/27 ≈ 0.1263. Square that: about 0.01595. So 1 - 0.01595 is 0.98405. The square root is
