Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, both of these are high-resolution spectrographs, right? 

Wait, the question gives some key information about their observing limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V magnitude. HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 V mag. So, for a star to be detected by both, its apparent V magnitude must be less than 17 but also less than 16? Wait, no, because if a star is brighter than 17, both can see it. Wait no, let me think again. Because both can observe stars up to their respective limits. Wait, if a star's apparent magnitude is, say, 16, ESPRESSO can see it (since 16 <17) but HIRES can't, because HIRES only goes up to 16. Or wait, no. Wait, the description says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. So, if V is less than or equal to 17, ESPRESSO can see it. Similarly, HIRES can see V mag brighter than 16, which would be V <=16. Wait, no: the way it's phrased is a bit confusing. Let me parse it.

The question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than
