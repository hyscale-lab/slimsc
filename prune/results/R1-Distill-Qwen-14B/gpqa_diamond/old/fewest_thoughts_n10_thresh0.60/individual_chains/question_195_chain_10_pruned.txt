Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

So, the setup is that there's a planet with Earth's radius in a circular orbit around a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The planet's orbital period is 3 days, and there's a transit impact parameter of 0.2. Then, there's a second planet, bigger—2.5 Earth radii—in the same system. We need to find the maximum orbital period of this second planet so that it both transits and occults.

Hmm, okay. So the first thing I remember is that for a planet to transit its star, the orbital plane must be edge-on enough so that the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view. The impact parameter is the measure of how central the transit is; a lower impact parameter means the planet is closer to the center of the star during transit. But wait, here the impact parameter is 0.2 for the first planet, so that's already happening.

The second planet must also transit, so its orbital plane must be aligned similarly. But more importantly, the second planet must also undergo occultation. Occultation is when the planet passes behind the star from our viewpoint. That requires that the planet's orbit is such that it goes behind the star at some point. For that to happen, the planet's orbital radius must be larger than the star's radius as seen from Earth (or whatever point we're observing from, but I think in these problems we assume Earth-based observation). Wait, no, occultation occurs when the planet is behind the star, so the star must block the planet. So, the planet's orbit must be such that it can be directly behind the star relative to us. That usually happens when the planet's orbital period is longer than the star's rotation period, but in this case, I think it's more about the orbital distance relative to the star's size.

Wait, no. The star's size is fixed. So for a planet to be able to go behind the star (i.e., for occultation to be possible), the planet's orbital radius must be such that, in its orbit, the planet can pass behind the star. Since both planets are in the same orbital plane, the first planet's parameters might influence the second's.

Wait, but wait: The problem says that the second planet must exhibit both transit and occultation
