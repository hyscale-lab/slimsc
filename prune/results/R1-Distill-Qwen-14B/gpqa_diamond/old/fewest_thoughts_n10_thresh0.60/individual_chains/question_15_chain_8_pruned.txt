Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their transit probabilities. Hmm, I remember that transit probability depends on a few factors like the orbital distance and the size of the star. Let me think.

The question says there are two planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have the same mass, but Planet_1 has an orbital period three times shorter than Planet_2. So, Planet_1 is closer to its star because a shorter period means it's orbiting more quickly, right?

Wait, Kepler's third law comes into play here. The formula is P² = (4π²/G(M+m)) * a³. Since the planets' masses are much smaller than the stars, I can approximate M as the star's mass. So, P² is proportional to a³/(M). Since Planet_1's period is three times shorter than Planet_2's, let's say P1 = P2 / 3.

So, (P1²)/(P2²) = ( (a1³/(M1)) ) / ( (a2³/(M2)) )

Given P1 is P2/3, so (P1²) = (P2^2)/9. Therefore, (a1³/a2³) = (M1/M2) * (P1²/P2²) ) = (2/1) * (1/9) ) = 2/9.

Taking cube roots, a1/a2 = (2/9)^(1/3) ≈ (0.222)^(1/3). Let me calculate that. Cube root of 0.222 is about 0.6. So a1 is about 0.6 times a2.

Wait, no, wait. Let me do that again. 9 is 3 squared, but cube root of 2/9 is (since 2/9 ≈ 0.222). The cube of 0.6 is 0.216, which is close to 0.222. So a1 is approximately 0.6 a2. So a2 is about 1.666 times a1. Or wait, no, a1 is 0.6 a2, which means a2 is a1 times (1/0.6) ≈ 1.666.

Wait, that might be necessary later. Now, transit probability. The probability that a planet transits its star is given by R*sin(i)/(a), where i is the inclination, and the maximum probability (assuming random orientation) is R*/a, where R* is the star's radius. So the probability is proportional to (R*/a). But wait, actually, the probability is (R*/a) multiplied by a factor. I think the transit probability is approximately (R*/a) * (something with the star's size and the planet's orbit).

Wait, more accurately, the transit probability is roughly (R*/a) where R* is the star's radius, and a is the semi-major axis (orbital radius). Because the probability depends on the chance that the planet's orbit, from our point of view, passes in front of the star. So the formula is P = (R* / a) * (something like 1), but I think it's
