Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, I need to find the uncertainty in P_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Let me try to remember what I know about uncertainties and operators.

First, the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔP = sqrt(⟨P²⟩ - ⟨P⟩²). So I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared in the given state.

The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩. The operator P_z is given by its matrix, right? Let me write down P_z's matrix to make it clear.

P_z matrix:
[ [ħ, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, -ħ] ]

Wait, no wait, the matrix is given as first row (ħ, 0, 0), second (0,0,0), third (0,0,-ħ). So yes, correct.

Since the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the basis states are |+z⟩, |0z⟩, |-z⟩, where each corresponds to eigenvalues ħ, 0, -ħ respectively.

The state |ψ⟩ is given in this basis. So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I can just compute ψ† P_z ψ.

Wait, ψ is a column vector, so ψ† is the row vector with elements (-1/2)*, (1/sqrt(2))* , (-1/2)*. Since these are real numbers (except maybe for P_y, but P_z is real), the conjugate doesn't matter here.

So let's compute ⟨P_z⟩. Multiply ψ† with P_z and then ψ.

Let me write ψ as a column vector:
ψ = [ -1/2; 1/sqrt(2); -1/2 ]

P_z ψ would be:

First element: (ħ)(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ/2
Second element: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = 0
Third element: 0*(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + (-ħ)*(-1/2) = ħ/2

So P_z ψ is [ -ħ/2, 0, ħ/2 ]^T.

Now, ψ† (P_z ψ) is the dot product of ψ and P_z ψ.

So:

(-1/2)(-ħ/2) + (1/sqrt(2))(0) + (-1/2)(ħ/2)
= (ħ/4) + 0 - (ħ/4)
= 0

So ⟨P_z⟩ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero. Now, what about ⟨P_z²⟩?

Wait, P_z squared is P_z^2. Since P_z is diagonal, squaring it just squares each diagonal element. So P_z^2 matrix is:

[ (ħ)^2, 0, 0;
  0, 0, 0;
  0, 0, (ħ)^2 ]

So P_z^2 is diagonal with entries ħ², 0, ħ².

So P_z^2 ψ is:

First element: (ħ²)(-1/2) + 0*(1/sqrt(2)) + 0*(-1/2) = -ħ²/2
Second element: 0*(...) = 0
Third element: (ħ²)(-1/2) = -ħ²/2? Wait no, no
