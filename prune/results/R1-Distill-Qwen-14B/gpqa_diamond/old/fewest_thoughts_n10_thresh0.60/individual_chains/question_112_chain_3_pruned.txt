Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about an electron's state described by |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate two things: the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator, and the average value of that operator.

Wait, the operator's matrix representation is given by Aij. So A_ij is ħ/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise. Hmm, what kind of matrix is that? Let me think. For a 2x2 matrix, the diagonal elements would be zero, and the off-diagonal elements would be ħ/2. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0    ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2  0 ]

Oh, right! That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli matrices usually have 1s and 0s; this would be σ_x scaled by ħ/2. So the operator is (ħ/2)σ_x.

But wait, the eigenstates of σ_x are the eigenstates of this operator as well, just scaled by (ħ/2). So the eigenstates of A are the same as those of σ_x, which are the states |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

So the first part of the problem is to find the probabilities of measuring the electron in each of these eigenstates. The second part is finding the expectation value of operator A.

First, I need to find the state |alpha> properly. The given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So I should normalize it. Let me compute the normalization factor.

The normalization is given by the inner product of |alpha> with itself. Let me denote the coefficients as a = (1+i) and b = (2 -i). So |alpha> = (a|up> + b|down> ) / N, where N is the normalization factor.

Compute N squared: |a|^2 + |b|^2. Let's calculate |a|^2: (
