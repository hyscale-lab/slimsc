Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that astronomers are observing a planet with a radius of 1 Earth radius. This planet is in a circular orbit, and it has a transit impact parameter of 0.2. It's orbiting a star that's 1.5 times the Sun's radius. The orbital period of this first planet is 3 days. Now, the question is about a second planet with a radius 2.5 times Earth's radius. We need to find the maximum orbital period this second planet can have while still exhibiting both transit and occultation events. Both planets are in circular orbits and share the same orbital plane.

Hmm. So I remember that for a planet to transit its star, the planet's orbital plane needs to align edge-on with our line of sight. Also, the transit and occultation events depend on the orbital periods and the orbital distances. Wait, but how exactly?

Transit event occurs when the planet passes in front of the star from our perspective. Occultation is when the planet is behind the star, so the planet is blocked from view. For both events to happen, the planet's orbit must be such that it can sometimes be in front and sometimes behind, relative to the star.

Wait, but wait. Both transits and occultations require that the planet's orbit is such that it can pass in front of the star (transit) and behind it (occultation). For a single planet, I think these events would happen regularly if the orbit is edge-on. But in this case, there are two planets, and we need both to show these events. Or wait, no, the question says the second planet will exhibit both transit and occultation events. So that second planet's orbit must cause it to sometimes be in front of the star (transit) and sometimes behind (occultation). But how does the first planet affect this? Well, the first planet is already transiting, so maybe the second planet's period is related to the first's in terms of orbital distances.

Wait, no, because each planet's period depends on its distance from the star. Oh right, Kepler's third law. The square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, which for a circular orbit is just the radius of the orbit.

So first, I should probably find the distance of the first planet from the star
