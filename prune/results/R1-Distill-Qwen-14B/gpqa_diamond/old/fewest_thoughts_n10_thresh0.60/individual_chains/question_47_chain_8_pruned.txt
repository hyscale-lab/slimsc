Okay, so I have this problem where I need to identify a compound based on its spectroscopic data. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The peaks around 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably N-H stretches. Those are usually strong or medium bands. Also, since there are two peaks close together, maybe it's an amide or something with an amine group? But wait, the amide has a carbonyl too. Oh, the IR also shows a strong band at 1720 cm-1, which likely corresponds to a carbonyl group, like a ketone, ester, or amide.

Next, looking at the 1H NMR data. I see a triplet at 1.20 ppm, which is probably a CH3 group attached to an electronegative atom. Maybe an ethyl group? The triplet suggests two neighboring protons. So like CH2CH3. The integral is 3H, so that makes sense for a methyl group in an ethyl.

Then there's a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm for 2H. A singlet and around 4 ppmâ€”maybe an OCH2 group. Like an ethoxy group. But wait, the integration is 2H, so perhaps it's adjacent to an electronegative atom. Could be part of an ethyl group attached to oxygen, as in OCH2CH3.

At 4.5 ppm, a quartet with 2H. Quartet suggests splitting into four, so likely a CH2 next to another CH2. So maybe another CH2 in an ester group. Like in an ester, the oxygen is attached to CH2, which is next to another CH2.

The aromatic region is next. There are two doublets: one at 7.0 ppm (2H) and another at 8.0 ppm (2H). Doublets in aromatic regions usually mean coupling with adjacent protons, so maybe para-substituted aromatic rings. So the aromatic system is probably a para-substituted benzene, like p-xylene, but with substituents.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count the atoms. So 9 carbons,
