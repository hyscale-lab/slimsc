Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about solving higher-dimensional heat equations using finite difference methods and parallel splitting. The question is about the key factor that converts a sequential algorithm into a parallel one, particularly involving the matrix exponential function approximated by a fractional approximation.

Hmm, let's break this down. The problem mentions higher-order finite difference approximations and parallel splitting. I remember that when solving PDEs, especially heat equations, the matrix exponential often comes into play when dealing with the time evolution part, like in methods such as the exponential time differencing.

Parallel splitting, or parallel-in-time methods, I think, aim to compute different time steps simultaneously, which is a way to speed things up compared to the usual sequential approach where each time step depends on the previous one. So how does this relate to the matrix exponential?

The matrix exponential is involved in representing the solution at each time step. For example, if you have a system of ODEs, the solution can be written as exp(tA) multiplied by the initial condition. So, approximating this matrix exponential is crucial for the method's efficiency.

Now, the question is about converting a sequential algorithm into a parallel one. I'm thinking that in a sequential algorithm, each time step is computed one after another, so the computational method must be able to handle all time steps at once or in a way that allows parallel processing.

Fractional approximation methods... Oh wait, I think fractional methods like the ones using Pad√© approximants or other rational function approximations are used to approximate the matrix exponential more efficiently. Because the exact exponential might be hard to compute, especially for large matrices, so an approximation is necessary.

But how does this relate to parallel processing? If the method uses a fractional approximation that can be split into parts that don't interfere with each other, maybe each part can be computed in parallel. So the key factor might be how the approximation allows the algorithm to split the computation into independent tasks.

Looking at the options, option D is "Linear partial fraction of fractional approximation." Partial fraction decomposition is a way to break down a rational function into simpler fractions. If the approximation can be split this way, each fraction might correspond to a part that can be computed in parallel. That would make the algorithm parallelizable because each fraction's contribution can be calculated simultaneously.

Option C says "Complex roots of fractional approximation." If the approximation has complex roots, that might affect the stability or the method's convergence, but I'm not sure how that directly relates to parallelism. It's more about the properties of the approximation rather than enabling parallel computation.

Option A, stability analysis, is important for ensuring the numerical method doesn't blow up or become inaccurate, but that's more about the reliability of the method rather than its parallelism.

Option B, existence of nonlocal boundary conditions, sounds more like a boundary issue, which affects the setup of the problem but not necessarily the transition to a parallel algorithm.

So, putting it together, the key factor is probably the linear partial fraction decomposition of the fractional approximation. This decomposition allows the method to split the problem into multiple, independent parts that can be computed in parallel. Each part corresponds to a term in the partial fraction, which can be handled by different processors or threads, thus converting the algorithm into a parallel one.

Wait, another angle: in some methods like
