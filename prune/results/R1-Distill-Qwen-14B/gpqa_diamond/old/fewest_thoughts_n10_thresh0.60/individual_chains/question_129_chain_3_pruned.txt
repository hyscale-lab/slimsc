Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again and make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about identifying compound E in a reaction scheme. The reactions involve several steps, and there are some hints provided. Let me break down the problem.

First, the reaction steps:

1. Compound A reacts with HCN to produce compound B.
2. Compound B is reduced with H2 in the presence of Pd to form compound C.
3. Compound C reacts with HNO2 to form compound D.
4. Compound D eliminates an inert gas to form compound E.

The hints:

a) Compound A, when reacted with an unknown phosphorous ylide, forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane.

b) The IR spectrum of compound A shows a strong peak around 1750 cm^-1, and compound E has a peak around 1715 cm^-1.

The options are four possible structures, all of which are ketones.

So, my plan is to figure out what each step does and work backwards or forwards to find the structure of E. Let's start by thinking about each reaction step.

Step 1: A + HCN → B

HCN typically adds to carbonyl groups. So, if A is a ketone, adding HCN would form a cyanohydrin. Alternatively, if A is an aldehyde, it would form an aldehyde cyanohydrin. But A's IR has a peak at 1750, which is around where ketones and esters absorb. So likely, A is a ketone.

So, reaction of a ketone with HCN would add H and CN groups. So, B would be a cyanohydrin.

Step 2: B is reduced with H2 and Pd. Wait, H2 with Pd usually is hydrogenation. But what's the target here? B is a cyanohydrin: so it's a compound with a hydroxyl and a cyanide group adjacent to each other. Hydrogenation of B would reduce the nitrile group (CN) to an amine (CH2NH2?), but wait, Pd is usually for hydrogenation of triple bonds, maybe.

Wait, more accurately: H2 and Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds. The cyanohydrin from a ketone has a nitrile group. So, when we reduce B with H2 and Pd, the nitrile (CN) would turn into CH2NH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone in B is converted to an alcohol. Wait, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, when a ketone reacts with HCN, it forms a cyanohydrin. The structure would have a ketone group, but wait no—because in the cyanohydrin formation, the carbonyl becomes an alcohol and a cyanide group is added. Wait, no, the carbonyl oxygen of the ketone would be replaced by OH and CN groups. So for example, if A is cyclohexanone, B would
