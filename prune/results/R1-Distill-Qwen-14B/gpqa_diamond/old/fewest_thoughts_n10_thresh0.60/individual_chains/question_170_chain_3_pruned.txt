Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states: An electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). We need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D.

Hmm, wait, what's the spin state here? The state is given as (3i, 4). I remember that in quantum mechanics, spin states for an electron are usually represented as two-component vectors. So, this vector is in the form χ = [a, b], where a and b are complex numbers. In this case, a is 3i and b is 4. So the state vector is χ = [3i, 4]^T.

The expectation value of an observable is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ | S_y | χ⟩. Oh wait, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. I remember that the Pauli matrices are used for spin operators. The Pauli sigma matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. The spin operator S for each direction is (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y.

So first, I need to write down σ_y. The σ_y matrix is given in the note as:
[[0, -i],
 [i, 0]]

Yes, that's correct. So σ_y is that matrix.

So the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) times ⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩. Wait, no, let me think. S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so the expectation value would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the expectation value of σ_y.

So the procedure is: calculate ⟨σ_y⟩ for the given state, then multiply by ħ/2 to get ⟨S_y⟩.

But wait, the state is a column vector χ = [3i, 4]^T. So let's compute ⟨χ | σ_y | χ⟩.

The steps are:

1. Compute σ_y * χ, which gives a new vector.
2. Then take the conjugate transpose of χ (which is χ†) and multiply it by the result from step 1.

So let's compute σ_y * χ.

The matrix σ_y is:
