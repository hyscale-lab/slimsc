Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me think this through.

The question is about a synthesized peptidic compound. The 1H NMR shows peaks that shouldn't be there. Specifically, there are two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton. Both have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals adding up to 1H. Hmm, so maybe it's not a simple splitting because the integrals add up to the expected 1H. Also, coupling isn't the issue because the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, the peaks are not due to coupling with neighboring protons.

Then there's the LC-MS part. The crude compound, when analyzed, shows two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass. So the mass is the same, but there are two peaks. That suggests something is causing the compound to separate into two, but with the same mass.

Wait, what could cause two peaks in LC-MS with the same mass? Maybe it's not a single compound but a mixture of isomers. But why would they have the same mass? If they're enantiomers, they would have the same molecular weight but would be non-superimposable mirror images. But in LC-MS, would they elute at the same time or different times?

Wait, I remember that enantiomers can sometimes behave the same in some chromatography methods if the column isn't chiral. So, if the LC column is achiral, enantiomers might come out at the same retention time, but the question says two clearly defined peaks. So that's probably not the case. Because if the column were chiral, they'd separate, but if the sample is racemic, an achiral column would show one peak. But here, LC shows two peaks, so maybe it's something else.

Another possibility is diastereomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times in LC. But if the LC conditions aren't separating them, perhaps they're too similar. Wait, but the question says two clearly defined peaks. So maybe they are diastereomers and the LC can separate them, hence two peaks.

But wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. If it's a diastereomer, the alpha protons would be in different environments, so their shifts would be different, right? But in the NMR, the shifts are similar. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the diastereomers have the same environment for that particular proton, maybe because the substitution is symmetric or something. Not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows two peaks, same integral and similar shifts. So maybe it's not about diastereomers or enantiomers. What else? Oh, maybe it's a result of some kind of coupling during the synthesis. The question mentions that the peaks can't be explained by spin-spin coupling. So possible other issues.

Another thought: Could it be due to the presence of a double bond where the proton is in a different environment in different conformations, leading to two peaks? Like, if the molecule is flexible and can have two different conformers that interconvert on the NMR timescale. But wait, if the conformers are interconverting rapidly, you might not see splitting. Unless the interconversion is slow, leading to two separate signals. But the question says the coupling isn't the issue, so maybe it's not that.

Wait, the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So that suggests that the molecular weight is the same, but the structures are different. But how?

Let me think about the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. If it's a precursor, the mass would be higher, right? Because a precursor would have more groups, perhaps the protecting group or something. But the question says the mass is consistent with the expected molecule, so this might not fit. Unless the precursor has the same mass, but that seems unlikely.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. But if that's the case, in the NMR, each enantiomer would have the same set of protons, so their NMR would be the same. But when in a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same as pure sample, not two separate peaks. Unless... maybe if there's some sort of diastereotopicity or if the coupling is causing something else. But the question says that the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin as the cause. So enantiomers might not be the answer since the NMR doesn't change for racemic mixtures.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm. I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' refers to. Wait, maybe it's about the formation of the amide bond where two different bonds could form, leading to more than one product. Or perhaps during the coupling reaction, like in peptide synthesis, some side reactions occur. For example, if the coupling leads to more than one possible product, maybe with different stereochemistry or different substituents. But then, if that's the case, would the NMR show two peaks for the same proton? Maybe if the two products have that alpha proton in two different environments but with similar shifts.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. So diastereomers would have different physical properties, leading to separate peaks in LC-MS. But in NMR, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons. If the two diastereomers are present in equal amounts, and for a particular proton, both have the same shift, then the peak would integrate to 2H? But the question says the integrals together are 1H. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because if each diastereomer has 1H, and each contributes, the integral would be 2H. But the question says together they integrate to 1H. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, no, wait. If it's a diastereomer with two identical structures for that proton, no. Wait, maybe the diastereomers have the same environment for that alpha proton, making their shifts the same, but each has only one proton. So in the NMR, you see two peaks because you have two different diastereomers, each contributing a single proton. But since they are identical in that environment, the peaks would be the same, so you'd see a singlet? Or perhaps each diastereomer's proton is split, but that doesn't match the question.

Hmm, maybe the issue is with the synthesis step leading to a mixture. Let's think about the amide bond formation.

In peptide synthesis, sometimes the reaction can form either the correct amide bond or an incorrect one, perhaps leading to different stereochemistry. Or maybe some kind of double coupling, such as if two different groups could form bonds, leading to two different products.

Wait, the question says the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So maybe the same proton is being split because of some coupling during the synthesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a double bond or some other feature that allows for different coupling, but the question says spin-spin coupling has been ruled out. So that's not it.

Another angle: The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Since the integrals add up to 1H, maybe it's a result of a double bond in the molecule where the proton is in a different environment. For example, in a double bond, the protons could be in a trans and cis arrangement, but that might cause splitting, not two separate peaks. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, the question says that the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks. Wait, why elevated temperature? LC is usually run with a certain temperature. Elevated temperature might cause some compounds to behave differently. What if the crude compound has a mixture of diastereomers that are not separated under normal conditions, but at higher temperature, they start to separate. But how does that affect the NMR? Hmm.

Wait, the NMR is of the crude compound. So perhaps the crude contains a mixture of diastereomers, which would show as two peaks in LC-MS (since they have same mass? No, wait, diastereomers have different masses only if their structures differ in a way that changes molecular weight. Wait, no, diastereomers have the same molecular formula, same molecular weight. So yes, same mass. So if you have two diastereomers, same mass, but different properties. So in LC, if the separation is good, you get two peaks of same mass, but different retention times. So that would fit option D.

But then, why does the NMR show two peaks for the same alpha proton? If it's a mixture of diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton environment, then perhaps each contributes one peak. So for each molecule, the alpha proton is in the same environment, so each contributes the same peak. But if the diastereomers have identical environments for that proton, their NMR signals would overlap, resulting in a single peak. But in the question, there are two peaks. So maybe they don't have the same environment. So perhaps one diastereomer has the alpha proton in a certain environment, and the other has it in a different environment, leading to two separate peaks.

But in that case, the NMR would show two peaks, each integrating to 1H, but the question says together they integrate to 1H. Wait, that's confusing. Because if each contributes 1H, the integral would be 2H. But the question says together they add up to 1H, which suggests each is 0.5H. That doesn't make sense unless each peak is integrating to 0.5H. But that's impossible for a proton.

Alternatively, the two peaks each have integral â‰ˆ0.5H, adding to 1H. But why would that be the case? Maybe because each is present in equal amounts. Like, if each diastereomer has that alpha proton, then each would be 0.5H. So the total integral would be 1H. But why would each have 0.5H? Because each diastereomer is present in 50% concentration, each diastereomer having one alpha proton.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the crude compound is a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton, but in different environments, then each would show up as a separate peak. Since each contributes 0.5H, the integrals add to 1H.

But then, why would the diastereomers have the same alpha proton environment? Unless the environment isn't affected by the diastereomerism. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the two diastereomers have the same alpha proton in the same environment, but the molecule is such that the coupling isn't spin-spin. Wait, but that would lead to a single peak, not two.

Wait, maybe the presence of diastereomers leads to a different splitting. For example, suppose the alpha proton is coupled to another proton in a way that in each diastereomer, the coupling is different. So if the same proton is coupled to two different sets of protons in each diastereomer, then each would have a different splitting, leading to two separate peaks. But the question says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin as the cause, so maybe it's something else.

Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers have different ring structures or other features that cause the same proton to split in a way that's not spin-spin. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the options again. Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure what 'double coupling' means. Maybe during the formation of the amide bond, two different groups are being coupled, leading to two different products. For example, in amide bond formation, if the coupling reagent (like HATU or EDCl) leads to both the desired product and another product, perhaps with a different stereochemistry or substituent, leading to two different compounds.

If that's the case, then in the NMR, each product would have the same alpha proton in different environments, leading to two separate peaks. But then, the LC-MS would show two peaks of same mass (since the molecular weight is the same) but different structures. So that would fit.

But wait, why would the molecular weight be the same? Oh, because the double coupling would form the same molecular formula. Wait, no, if it's a side product, perhaps the molecular weight is the same.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case of isomerization during the synthesis. For example, if the amide bond could form in two different configurations, leading to two diastereomers. But then, that would be diastereomers, which is option D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: diastereomers, but then I'm confused about the NMR integration.

Let me think about the NMR again. The two peaks correspond to the same proton in the same molecule, but with different shifts. Wait, no, same molecule? Or different molecules. Hmm.

Wait, if the compound consists of a single molecule, but with different diastereomers, each present in the mixture. So each diastereomer would have the same alpha proton. But if the environment of that proton is the same, the NMR would show a single peak, not two. But in the question, the alpha proton has two peaks with similar shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps in each diastereomer, the alpha proton is in a slightly different environment, leading to two peaks. But that would require that the diastereomers are not completely identical in that particular environment.

Wait, think about a simple example: say a compound with an alpha proton where the configuration of another group affects the environment, like adjacent stereocenters. So in one diastereomer, the alpha proton is next to a certain configuration, and the other diastereomer has a different configuration, leading to a slightly different shift. So each diastereomer contributes a peak, but the shifts are close, hence two peaks.

So if the mixture is 50:50, each proton contributes 0.5H, so the integral adds to 1H.

So then, the LC-MS would see two peaks because the diastereomers separate, but same mass, so same m/z.

So this would fit option D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

Alternatively, what's the other option? Option C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps that leads to more than one product, which would be diastereomers, making option D the correct answer.

So putting it all together, the NMR shows two peaks because it's a mixture of diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton but slightly different environments. The LC-MS shows two peaks because the diastereomers separate. So the answer would be D.


The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (adding to 1H), and no evidence of spin-spin coupling. LC-MS analysis of the crude compound shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Contaminated with a precursor**  
   A precursor would typically have a different molecular weight (higher mass due to additional groups like protecting groups). However, the question specifies that the mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule, ruling out the presence of a precursor. Thus, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B: Mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers are non-superimposable mirror images and have identical physical properties, including NMR spectra. In an NMR spectrum, a racemic mixture of enantiomers would appear as a single peak, not two distinct peaks. Additionally, LC-MS would not separate enantiomers on an achiral column, but the question specifies two clearly defined peaks, which contradicts this scenario. Therefore, this option is also unlikely.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide-bond forming reaction**  
   This term is ambiguous, but it could refer to the formation of multiple products during amide bond formation, such as diastereomers. However, the question explicitly asks for the most likely explanation, and the observations (two peaks in NMR and LC-MS) are better explained by the presence of diastereomers rather than a specific reaction artifact. Thus, while this option is plausible, it is less precise than the explanation provided by Option D.

4. **Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereomers have the same molecular weight but different physical properties, leading to separate peaks in LC-MS. In the NMR spectrum, each diastereomer can contribute a distinct peak for the same alpha-proton if the environments of the proton differ slightly between the diastereomers. The integrals of the two peaks add up to 1H, consistent with a 50:50 mixture of two diastereomers, each contributing 0.5H. This explanation aligns well with the observations in both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the two peaks in both the NMR and LC-MS analyses.
