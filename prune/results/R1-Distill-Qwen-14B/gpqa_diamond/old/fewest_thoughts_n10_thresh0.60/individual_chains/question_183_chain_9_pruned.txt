Okay, so I have a chemistry problem here about the index of hydrogen deficiency in a product. Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency is related to the number of rings and double bonds in the molecule. Right, each ring or double bond contributes one to the index.

The question is about reacting 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid with red phosphorus and excess HI. Wait, I think red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Oh right, that's the reaction where the phosphorus acts as a catalyst for the addition of HI across double bonds.

Let me think about the structure of the starting material. The compound is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, there's a cyclohexene ring—so that's a six-membered ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. At position 2, there's a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5, a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? Wait, no, vinyl is CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached. So wait, the substituents are a formyl and a vinyl group on the cyclohexene ring.

So the cyclohexene ring has a double bond between carbons 3 and 4 maybe? Because it's cyclohex-3-ene. So the numbering would have the double bond starting at carbon 3, and the substituents at 2 and 5.

So the molecule has a cyclohexene ring with substituents. Let's count the double bonds and rings. The cyclohexene has one ring and one double bond (the ring itself). Wait, no, a cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So each ring contributes one, and each double bond adds another. So the cyclohexene has one ring and one double bond. So index of hydrogen deficiency for the entire molecule?

Wait, but the starting molecule has additional substituents. The formyl group is CHO—so no double bonds there. The vinyl group is CH₂CH₂? No, vinyl is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. Oh wait, the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group, which itself has a double bond
