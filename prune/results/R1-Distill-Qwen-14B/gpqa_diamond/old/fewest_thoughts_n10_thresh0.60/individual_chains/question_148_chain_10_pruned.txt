Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about five binary compounds of fluorine with an element Y. That immediately makes me think that Y is probably a halogen because fluorine is another halogen, and they often form compounds with each other. Wait, but the options given are for molecular weights, so maybe I should think about the compounds each Y could form with fluorine.

So, the compounds are labeled A1 to A5. Let's read the descriptions one by one.

First, A1 is a bright-red substance that decomposes at 293 K (which is about room temperature, 25Â°C) into A2 and fluorine. The oF (I think this stands for oxidation state of fluorine or maybe some other notation) is given as 31.96% for A2. Wait, wait, that might not make sense because fluorine usually has a high oxidation state, like -1 or +1, but 31.96%... Hmm, maybe it's the molar percentage? Or maybe it's the percentage of fluorine in the compound, so 31.96% fluorine by mass. Okay, that could make sense.

A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if A1 is an oxidizing agent, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. Fluorine compounds can be strong oxidizers. For example, ClF
