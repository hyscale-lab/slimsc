Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the energy required for a nucleus to reach a certain speed. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

The question says that the speed of nucleus X is 0.96c. I remember that in relativity, when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light, we can't use classical mechanics; we have to use special relativity formulas. So the first thing I need to figure out is the relativistic energy of this nucleus.

Wait, what's the nucleus X? Oh right, X is defined as Li with 3 neutrons. So Li-6 maybe? Because Li usually has 3 protons, right? So if it's Li with 3 neutrons, that's 3 protons + 3 neutrons = 6 nucleons total. So the mass number A is 6. Is that correct? Let me double-check: Lithium typically has an atomic number (protons) of 3. If it has 3 neutrons, then the isotope is Li-6 because 3 protons + 3 neutrons equals 6 nucleons. Yeah, that makes sense.

So the nucleus is Li-6. I need to find the energy of the RHIC setup where the speed is 0.96c. I think the energy in particle physics usually refers to the kinetic energy, but wait, sometimes it's the total energy. Hmm. I should clarify that. Wait, in accelerators, the energy given is typically the kinetic energy, but sometimes it's the total energy. Wait no, in high-energy physics, when they say "energy" for particles, they usually mean the total energy, which includes rest mass energy plus kinetic. So I'll need to calculate the total energy, I think. Or maybe the kinetic energy? Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the speed is 0.96c. So let's think about the formulas. The total energy E is gamma * m c squared. The kinetic energy K is (gamma - 1) * m c squared. So if the problem is asking for the energy of the collider, which is the total energy each nucleus has, then E is what I need to compute. But I'm not entirely sure; sometimes problems might refer to just the kinetic energy.

But let's proceed. Let's think about how to compute the total energy
