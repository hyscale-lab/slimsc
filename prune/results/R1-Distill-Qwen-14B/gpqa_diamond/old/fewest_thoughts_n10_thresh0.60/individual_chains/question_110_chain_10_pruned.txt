Okay, I've got this astronomy question here about which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So, first, I remember that both instruments are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations, including studying exoplanets and stellar properties. But the key here is their detection limits. The question says that ESPRESSO can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag, and HIRES can go down to brighter than 16 mag. Wait, no—I need to clarify: brighter stars have lower magnitudes. So, if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that's a lower magnitude number. So, ESPRESSO can detect stars up to, but not beyond, 17 mag. Similarly, HIRES can detect up to 16 mag. So HIRES is more sensitive; it can see fainter stars since 16 is less than 17. Or wait, wait—no, because higher magnitudes mean fainter objects. So, a V magnitude of 16 is fainter than 17? No, wait, no. Because the magnitude scale is inverse. Like, lower numbers mean brighter. So a 16 mag star is brighter than a 17 mag one. So, HIRES can observe stars brighter than (i.e., magnitude less than) 16. So, a star with V=15 is bright enough for both.
