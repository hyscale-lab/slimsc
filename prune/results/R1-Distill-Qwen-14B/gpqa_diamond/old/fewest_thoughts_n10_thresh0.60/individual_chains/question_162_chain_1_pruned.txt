Okay, so I've got this problem in front of me, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the area of a pseudosphere with a given metric and radius r=2. Hmm, right, a pseudosphere is a type of surface in hyperbolic geometry, but I'm a bit rusty on the details.

The metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit familiar. I remember that the metric for a sphere is usually something like (dr² + r² dθ²) or in terms of x and y, but this seems different. Oh wait, no, this is in 2D, so maybe it's a 2-dimensional surface embedded in some higher-dimensional space.

Wait, no, the metric is given in terms of x and y, so perhaps it's a 2D space with coordinates x and y. Hmm, but the term pseudosphere makes me think of a 2D surface. Or wait, a pseudosphere is a 2D surface with constant negative curvature. Right, so a pseudosphere is an example of a surface with hyperbolic geometry.

So the area of a pseudosphere... Oh wait, the standard pseudosphere has infinite area, right? Because as you go off to infinity in the hyperbolic plane, the area keeps increasing. But wait, maybe I'm mixing up things. Let me think again.

Wait, the metric given here is a bit tricky. Let me parse it. The coefficient is 32 divided by (4 - x² - y²). So the denominator is 4 - (x² + y²). That means this expression is undefined when x² + y² =4, so the region of validity is where x² + y² <4. So the coordinates x and y are confined within a circle of radius 2. Because when x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator approaches zero, making the metric terms blow up. So this suggests that the space is a 2D surface with a singularity at x² + y² =4.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. I thought a pseudosphere's radius is a parameter related to its curvature, but maybe in this case, the radius here is tied to the coordinate system. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is that of a pseudosphere with radius 2.

Wait, the standard metric for a pseudosphere (which is a
