Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this quantum mechanics problem about non-Gaussianity in a Schrödinger cat state. Hmm, I remember that non-Gaussian states are important in quantum information because they can't be described by Gaussian statistics, which are easier to handle. The question is asking me to calculate the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure.

The state given is |psi> = (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>)/N. Oh wait, and N is the normalization constant given as sqrt(1 + sin(2phi) exp(-2alpha²)). The parameters are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5.

I think the relative entropy measure del_b is defined as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of the state rho and a reference Gaussian state tau. So del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). But wait, the von Neumann entropy is S = -trace(rho ln rho), so if I'm subtracting trace(tau ln tau), maybe I'm considering the difference in entropies? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, non-Gaussian states have higher entropy when compared to Gaussian states, right? Because Gaussian states are minimum uncertainty states, so their entropy is lower. So if rho is non-Gaussian, trace(rho ln rho) would be larger than trace(tau ln tau), making del_b positive.

But how do I compute this? First, I need the density matrices for rho and tau. The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states, which are Gaussian. So rho is the density matrix of this state, and tau should be some Gaussian state, perhaps a thermal state or a coherent state?

Wait, the question says tau is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state. I think the reference is usually the most Gaussian state possible, like a coherent state. Because coherent states are Gaussian and have the lowest possible entropy among all states with the same photon number, I think. So maybe tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity (NG) is defined as S(rho || tau), where tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho. Alternatively, it's the difference in their entropies. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about the exact definition here. Let me think.

The formula given is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau). Oh, wait, because S(rho) = - trace(rho ln rho), so if del_b is [S(rho) - S(tau)], that would be ( - trace(rho ln rho) ) - ( - trace(tau ln tau) ) ) = [trace(tau ln tau) - trace(rho ln rho)] multiplied by -1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting the sign wrong. Wait no, the question says del_b is the trace difference as given. So if tau is a Gaussian state, then the non-Gaussianity is the difference in their entropy terms.

But wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the steps.

First, I need to find rho, which is |psi><psi|. Then I need to find tau, the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Because the relative entropy of non-Gaussianity is computed with respect to the closest Gaussian state, which is the one that matches the first and second moments.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the reference Gaussian state could be the thermal state or a coherent state. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the one with the same first moments (mean photon number) as the state |psi>. Because coherent states have specific properties.

Wait, let me compute the state rho first. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Let me compute N first.

Given phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5.

Compute sin(2phi): 2phi = -pi/2. So sin(-pi/2) is -1. Exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065. So N squared is 1 + (-1)*0.6065 ≈ 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is |psi> = [cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. So substituting:

|psi> ≈ [0.7071 |0.5> - 0.7071 |-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Hmm, but what does this state look like? It's a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. So this state is a cat state, which is a well-known non-Gaussian state.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. To compute the non-Gaussianity, I need to compare this with the Gaussian state tau that has the same first and second moments.

So what's the first moment? The expectation value of the annihilation operator a. For rho, <a> = <psi | a | psi>.

If |psi> is (c|alpha> + s| - alpha> )/N, then <a> would be (c^2 alpha + s^2
