Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about expectation values. Hmm, I remember that the expectation value is like the average outcome if you measured an observable many times on a system in a particular state. Right, and the formula involves the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator and then the state vector again.

The problem says the particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Oh wait, and these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σ_z. So, σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for those states, respectively. The operator we're looking at is 10σ_z +5σ_x. I need to find the expectation value of this operator.

Wait, so to find the expectation value ⟨O⟩, where O is the operator, I need to compute ⟨ψ| O |ψ⟩. Let's break down O into 10σ_z +5σ_x. So the expectation value would be 10⟨σ_z⟩ +5⟨σ_x⟩.

Right, because expectation values are linear. That should make things easier. I can compute each expectation separately.

First, let's find ⟨σ_z⟩. Since σ_z has eigenvalues +1 and -1 for |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation is just the probability of each state multiplied by their corresponding eigenvalues. Oh wait, the state is a superposition, so the coefficients are 0.5 and sqrt(3)/2. But wait, do I need to normalize the state first?

Wait, no, the state given is 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1. (0.5)^2 is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4, which adds up to 1. So it's already normalized. Cool.

So for σ_z, the expectation is |0.5|^2 * (+1) + |sqrt(3)/2|^2 * (-1). Wait, because |↑⟩ is eigenstate with +1, and |↓⟩ has -1. So:

⟨σ_z⟩ = (0.5)^2 * 1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1)
= 0.25 * 1 + (3/4) * (-1)
= 0.25 - 0.75
= -0.5.

Wait, that makes sense. So the expectation of σ_z is -0.5.

Now, onto ⟨σ_x⟩. Oh, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are different; they are the superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But I might not need to go into that. Alternatively, I can express σ_x in terms of its matrix form and compute ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩.

The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So to compute ⟨σ_x⟩, which is ψ† σ_x ψ.

Wait, ψ is given as a column vector. Let me write ψ as a vector. So |↑⟩ is [1; 0], and |↓⟩ is [0; 1]. So ψ is 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0; 1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† σ_x ψ is [0.5* sqrt(3)/2 , 0.5* ... Wait, no, perhaps I should compute it as ψ† * σ_x * ψ.

Let me compute it step by step.

ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ].

Multiply σ_x (which is [[0,1],[1,0]]) by ψ: so σ_x ψ = [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2), 1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then, ψ† times that is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] times [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

So the dot product: 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5) = 2*(0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 ) )= 2*( sqrt(3)/4 )= sqrt(3)/2.

Wait, so sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, so sqrt(3)/2 is about 0.866.

Wait, so ⟨σ_x⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.866.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute ⟨σ_x⟩ using the expectation formula. Because σ_x is the spin-x operator, and it's Hermitian, so its expectation can also be calculated using the probabilities and cross terms.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just compute it as the inner product.

Wait, ψ is [a; b] where a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2.

σ_x |ψ⟩ is [b; a]. So σ_x |ψ⟩ is [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Then, the inner product ψ† (σ_x |ψ⟩) is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 + sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 = two times (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2. Yeah, that's correct.

So ⟨σ_x⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

But wait, wait. The Pauli matrices are a bit tricky for expectation values. Another approach is to note that for a state |ψ⟩ = α |↑⟩ + β |↓⟩, the expectation value of σ_x is 2( |α|^2 - |β|^2 )? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, no. Because σ_x is (|↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑|). So the expectation value is ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩ = |α|^2 ⟨↓| + |β|^2 ⟨↑| applied to σ_x |ψ⟩. Hmm, maybe another approach. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for expectation of σ_x.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Another approach: we can write σ_x in terms of the basis states. So σ_x |↑⟩ = |↓⟩, and σ_x |↓⟩ = |↑⟩.

So when we compute ⟨ψ| σ_x |ψ⟩, it's (0.5⟨↑| + (sqrt(3)/2)⟨↓| ) * σ_x * (0.5|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩ )).

Expanding this, we get 0.5 * 0.5 ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) ⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩.

But σ_x|↑⟩ is |↓⟩, so ⟨↑|σ_x|↑⟩ = ⟨↑|↓⟩ = 0. Similarly, σ_x|↓⟩ = |↑⟩, so ⟨↓|σ_x|↓⟩=⟨↓|↑⟩=0.

The cross terms: ⟨↑|σ_x|↓⟩ is ⟨↑|↑⟩=1, and ⟨↓|σ_x|↑⟩=⟨↓|↓⟩=1.

So putting it together:

0.5*0.5 *0 + 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5 *1 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * 0.

Which simplifies to [ (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) ) ] + [ (sqrt(3)/2 * 0.5 ) ] 

Each term is (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2. So yeah, same as before.

So ⟨σ_x⟩= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So now, putting it all together, the expectation value of the operator O=10σ_z +5σ_x is:

⟨O⟩ = 10 * ⟨σ_z⟩ +5 * ⟨σ_x⟩.

⟨σ_z⟩ is -0.5, so 10*(-0.5)= -5.

⟨σ_x⟩ is about 0.866, so 5*0.866 is about 4.33.

Adding them: -5 +4.33= -0.67.

Wait, but wait. Let me do it more accurately. Because 0.5 squared is 0.25, and (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is 3/4 (which is 0.75). So ⟨σ_z⟩= 0.25*(1) + 0.75*(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.

So 10*(-0.5) = -5. ⟨σ_x⟩ is (sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 0.8660254.

So 5 * 0.8660254 ≈ 4.330127.

So total expectation is -5 +4.330127 ≈ -0.669873.

Rounded to one decimal place, that's approximately -0.7.

Wait, but let's see: -0.669873 is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but let me check, because 0.669873 is closer to 0.67 than 0.66, so to one decimal place, it's -0.7.

Looking back at the options, option C is -0.7. So the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = |0.5|^2 \cdot (+1) + \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Calculating the probabilities:
\[
|0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75.
\]

Thus:
\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) operator is represented as:
\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]
The state \( \psi \) is written as a column vector:
\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):
\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Perform the dot product:
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \):
\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle O \rangle \)
Using the linearity of expectation values:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866).
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
10(-0.5) = -5, \quad 5(0.866) \approx 4.33.
\]

Add the results:
\[
\langle O \rangle \approx -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of \( O = 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to option **C**.
