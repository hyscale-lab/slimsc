Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem describes a series of reactions starting with cyclohexanone, and I need to figure out how many chemically distinct hydrogen atoms are present in the final product, product 4. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)7.

Hmm, I remember that cyclohexanone is a cyclic ketone, so the first reaction is treating it with bromine. Wait, bromine in what conditions? Oh, right, when a ketone like cyclohexanone is treated with bromine (Br2) in an aqueous solution, it usually undergoes a dibromination. But wait, wait, no. Dibromination happens under certain conditions. Alternatively, I think in the presence of a base, like maybe the next step is using NaOH. Oh wait, noâ€”that's the second step. So the first step is with Br2.

Wait, another possibility: maybe it's an addition reaction. Oh wait, no. Cyclohexanone is a ketone, and when you treat ketones with bromine, it can undergo a halohydrin formation. Or wait, no, that's when you have a double bond. Oh wait, cyclohexanone doesn't have a double bond. Oh wait, the molecule is cyclohexanone, a cyclic ketone. So treating it with bromine would not add across a double bond because there isn't
