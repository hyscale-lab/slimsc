Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes in the solution. Hmm, let's see what I remember about stability constants and complex ion formation.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate. The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are beta1=9, beta2=40, beta3=63, beta4=16. I'm supposed to find the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes, which I think is the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, right? Because dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, dithiocyanato is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+? Or maybe it's [Co(SCN)_4]^2-? Wait, no, the stability constants are given for β1 to β4, so each β corresponds to the complex with n SCN- ions where n is the subscript. So β1 is [CoSCN]^+, β2 is [Co(SCN)_2]^2+, β3 is [Co(SCN)_3]^3-, and β4 is [Co(SCN)_4]^4-? Or wait, the charge would be +2 for the [Co(SCN)_2]^2+ complex. Hmm, maybe I should think about the general form.

Stability constant (β) is defined as the equilibrium constant for the formation of a complex. For each n, βn is the formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). Wait, no, because Co^2+ has a +2 charge. So each SCN^- is -1. So for [Co(SCN)_n]^{2−n}. Wait, that can't be right. Let me think. Co^2+ has a charge of +2. Each SCN^- contributes -1. So the complex [Co(SCN)_n] would have a charge of +2 − n*(+1), wait no, because SCN^- is -1 each. So Co^2+ plus n SCN^- would be Co^2+ + n SCN^- → [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) ?

Wait, wait, no: the
