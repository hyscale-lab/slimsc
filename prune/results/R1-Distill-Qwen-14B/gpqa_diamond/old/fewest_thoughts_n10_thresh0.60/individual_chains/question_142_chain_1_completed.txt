Okay, so I've got this question about quantum states and density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think through it.

The question is about the density matrix ρ, which is given as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I need to find its geometrical position in the qubit space. The options are four points in 3D space, like r=(1,1,0) and so on. Wait, what does that mean? Oh right, the Bloch sphere representation, I think. Because qubits can be represented on a Bloch sphere in 3D space.

So, the density matrix ρ is a mixed state. Let me recall, for a qubit, the density matrix is a 2x2 matrix. The general form for a qubit state can be written as ρ = (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (probably in 3D space) of expectation values for the Pauli matrices. So r = (x, y, z), and the state is determined by the angles θ and φ on the Bloch sphere.

Wait, for a pure state |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, the density matrix would have r as a vector of length 1. But here, ρ is a mixed state because it's (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Oh right, because |0⟩⟨0| is a pure state, and |1⟩⟨1| another, but averaged equally, so it's a completely mixed state. So that should correspond to the maximally mixed state, which on the Bloch sphere would be the center, right?

Wait, no. The maximally mixed state for a qubit is (I/2), because I is the 2x2 identity matrix. So in that case, the density matrix is (I)/2. Comparing that to the given ρ, which is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let me compute that.

The identity matrix I for 2x2 is |0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|. So ρ is (I/2), which is indeed the maximally mixed state. So that should correspond to the center of the Bloch sphere, because it's completely mixed, no coherence, and all directions are equally probable. So the state is at the origin (0,0,0).

Wait, but how does that translate into the vector r in the general form of the density matrix? The general form is ρ = (I + r·σ)/2. So if r is zero, then we have ρ = I/2, which matches our case. So the vector r would be (0,0,0), which is option C.

Alternatively, let's think about what each option represents. Option B is (0,0,1), which would be the state |0⟩ if I'm not mistaken because z-axis. But wait, |0⟩ is a pure state, so for a density matrix, that would have r=(0,0,1), and ρ would be |0⟩⟨0|. But our ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2, which is the average, so it's a mixed state, not a pure state. So the vector would be zero vector, meaning the origin.

So looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit, as it is an equal mixture of the pure states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\). In the Bloch sphere representation, the density matrix of a qubit can generally be written as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma} \right),
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r}\) is a vector in 3D space. For the maximally mixed state, there is no preference for any direction in the Bloch sphere, meaning \(\mathbf{r} = (0, 0, 0)\). This corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

Analyzing the options:
- **A) \(r = (1, 1, 0)\):** This would correspond to a pure state, not a mixed state.
- **B) \(r = (0, 0, 1)\):** This corresponds to the pure state \(|0\rangle\), not a mixed state.
- **C) \(r = (0, 0, 0)\):** This corresponds to the maximally mixed state, which matches the given density matrix.
- **D) \(r = (1, 1, 1):** This would correspond to another pure state, not a mixed state.

Thus, the correct geometrical position of the density matrix in the qubit space is \((0, 0, 0)\).

Answer: C
