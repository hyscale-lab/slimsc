Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction for an electron. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says the electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). Wait, I think that notation refers to a two-component spinor, right? So it's like a column vector with two elements: the first is 3i and the second is 4. So the state vector χ would be [3i; 4].

The expectation value of an operator is given by the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨χ| S_y |χ⟩. Oh right, S_y is the spin operator in the y-direction. I remember that the Pauli matrices are involved here. The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. And since the spin operator S is (ħ/2) times σ, because for electrons the spin is ħ/2, right?

So S_y would be (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix. Let me write that down:

σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]
So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y = [[0, -iħ/2],
                        [iħ/2, 0]]

Now, to compute the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩, I need to perform the operation χ† S_y χ, where χ† is the conjugate transpose of χ.

Wait, what's χ†? The original χ is a column vector [3i; 4], so the conjugate transpose would be a row vector [ -3, 4 ] because the conjugate of 3i is -3 (wait, no, wait: 3i's conjugate is -3i? Wait no, wait. Wait, 3i is a complex number. The conjugate of 3i is -3i, but when you take the transpose, it becomes the row vector [ -3i, 4 ]? Wait, no, wait. Let me be precise. The original χ is [3i; 4]. So χ† is the conjugate transpose, which is [ (3i)^*, 4^* ] as a row vector. Since 4 is real, 4^* is 4. (3i)^* is -3i. So χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, wait, no! Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i. So yes, χ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the expectation value calculation is:

⟨S_y⟩ = χ† * S_y * χ

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, let me compute χ† S_y. Let me write that out.

S_y is a 2x2 matrix, χ is a 2x1 vector, and χ† is a 1x2 vector.

Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. χ is a column vector, 2x1. So χ† is 1x2. S_y is 2x2. So χ† * S_y is a 1x2 matrix. Then (χ† S_y) multiplied by
