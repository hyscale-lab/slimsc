Okay, I'm trying to tackle this physics problem about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, let's see what I remember from my electromagnetism classes.

So, the question is about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it oscillates, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we need to find what fraction of A is radiated at θ = 30 degrees, and what form f takes.

Wait, I think this has to do with the radiation pattern of a dipole antenna or something like that. Oh right, when a dipole oscillates, the radiation isn't isotropic—it's stronger in certain directions. The maximum is along the equator (θ=90 degrees for a dipole), but wait no, wait. Wait, no: for a dipole, the radiation pattern is strongest perpendicular to the axis, right? So maximum at θ=90 degrees.

But wait, this charge distribution is spheroidal. Maybe it's an electric dipole? Or perhaps it's a different type of oscillator. But the general idea is about the angular dependence of the radiation.

In the far field (radiation zone), the electric and magnetic fields vary as 1/r, and the intensity (which relates to the radiated power) depends on the square of the fields. The power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to the square of the (electric or magnetic) dipole moment, I think.

Wait, for an oscillating dipole, the power radiated in a particular direction depends on the angle θ. The formula I remember for the radiation pattern is something like (sin²θ) over (something). Or maybe it's proportional to sin²θ? Or wait, no. For a dipole, the intensity is proportional to sin²θ. But wait, the maximum intensity is when sinθ is 1, so θ=90 degrees. So the intensity is maximum at θ=90, and zero along the axis (θ=0 and 180).

But wait, the question says the charge distribution is spheroidal with the symmetry along z. So when it oscillates, perhaps the dipole moment is along the z-axis. Then, the radiation pattern would be like that of a dipole, with maximum at θ=90 degrees.

But the question is about the fraction of the maximum power A radiated at θ=30 degrees. So what's the value of f(θ=30) in terms of A?

Wait, the function f is the power per unit solid angle, right? So the total power is the integral of f over all solid angles. The max power A would be the maximum value of f. So f_max = A.

The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the formula for the intensity: I = (p^2 ω^4 sin²θ)/(12π c^3), where p is the dipole moment. The total power is the integral of I over the sphere, which gives A. So the maximum intensity occurs at θ=90°, and I_max = A.

So the fraction at θ=30° would be I(30)/A. Let's compute I(30)/I_max.

I(θ) = A * (sin²θ)/(sin² 90°) = A * sin²θ, because sin90 is 1.

So I(30) = A * sin²30. What's sin30? 0.5, so sin²30 is 0.25. Therefore, the fraction is 0.25 A, so 1/4 of A.

Hmm, so the fraction is 1/4. Now, looking at the options, options B and C have 1/4 as the first part.

Next, what's the form of f, the function of λ and θ? The problem says f is a function of λ and θ. So f(λ,θ) is the power per unit solid angle.

From the intensity formula, I is proportional to sin²θ. So that's the angular part. What about the dependence on λ?

The dipole moment p is related to the charge distribution and the frequency. For a dipole oscillating at frequency f, the power radiated is given by P = ( (μ_0 p_0^2 ω^4 )/(12π c) ) * something. Wait, the formula for power radiated by an oscillating dipole is P = ( (μ₀ p₀² ω⁴ )/(12π c³ )) * (something), maybe the time average.

Wait, but the intensity I is P/(4π) for isotropic radiation, but here it's not isotropic. Wait, the total power is the integral of I over 4π steradians. So I(θ) is (some function of θ) times (some function of λ). So let's think about how I depends on λ.

In the dipole formula, the intensity I is proportional to (ω^4) because I = (p^2 ω^4 sin²θ)/(12 π c^3). And since ω is 2πf, and f is related to λ through the speed of light c. Wait, but λ is the wavelength in the medium, probably vacuum, so λ = c / f, so f = c / λ. So ω = 2πf = 2π c / λ. Therefore, ω^4 = (2π c / λ )^4.

So substituting back into I, I is proportional to (1/λ^4) multiplied by sin²θ. So the function f would have a λ^(-4) dependence. So the form is f ~ λ^(-4) * sin²θ.

So the function f is proportional to sin²θ and inversely proportional to λ^4.

Looking back at the options, the function form is either λ^-4 (option A and C) or another power.

So the second part of the answer is λ^(-4). So looking at the options, option C is 1/4 and λ^(-4), which fits.

Wait, the question says "the fraction of A that will be radiated at an angle θ=30°" is 1/4. So the first part is 1/4, and the function f is λ^(-4). So option C.


To analyze the problem, we consider an oscillating charge distribution with spheroidal symmetry along the z-axis. The radiation pattern depends on the angle θ (measured from the z-axis) and the wavelength λ. The power radiated per unit solid angle is given as a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), and the maximum power is \( A \). The goal is to determine the fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For an oscillating dipole, the intensity \( I(\theta) \) radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2\theta \). The maximum intensity occurs at \( \theta = 90^\circ \), where \( \sin^2\theta = 1 \). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin^2\theta = \sin^2(30^\circ) = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \). Thus, the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 0.25 \), or \( \frac{1}{4} \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength**:  
   The intensity \( I(\theta) \) also depends on the wavelength \( \lambda \). From the dipole radiation formula, \( I(\theta) \propto \frac{\omega^4 \sin^2\theta}{c^3} \), where \( \omega = \frac{2\pi c}{\lambda} \). Substituting \( \omega^4 = \left(\frac{2\pi c}{\lambda}\right)^4 \), the intensity becomes proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) has the form \( f(\lambda, \theta) \propto \lambda^{-4} \sin^2\theta \).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   The fraction of \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the form of \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) is \( \lambda^{-4} \). Among the given options, only **Option C** satisfies both conditions.

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( \frac{1}{4} \), and the function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) has the form \( \lambda^{-4} \).
