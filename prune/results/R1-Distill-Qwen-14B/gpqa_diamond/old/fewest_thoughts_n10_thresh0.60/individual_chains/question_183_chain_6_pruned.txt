Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a specific reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It's reacting with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options for the index are given as A) 1, B) 3, C)5, D)0.

Hmm, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is a way to determine the number of rings and double bonds in a molecule. Each ring or double bond contributes one to the index. Rings and triple bonds count as one each, but each triple bond actually contributes two, I think. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that: the index is calculated as (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2, where C is the number of carbons, H is hydrogens, X is halogens, and N is nitrogens. But in this case, there's no N, so I'll ignore that.

So, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me draw that structure mentally. The cyclohexene ring has a substituent at position 2 (formyl group) and at position 5 (vinyl group). Also, the cyclohexene has a double bond at position 3, so the ring has one double bond.

Wait, the structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the cyclohexane ring has double bonds at position 3 (so cyclohexene) and also a substituent at position 2 which is a formyl group (CHO), and another substituent at position 5 which is a vinyl group (CH₂CH₂? No, wait. Vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So, the substituent at position 5 is a vinyl group, meaning it's attached as CH₂-CH₂? No, wait, vinyl is CH₂=CH–. So, attached as CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond? Or is the vinyl group attached to the cyclohexene ring with its own double bond?

Wait, the substituent is a vinyl group, which is CH₂=CH–. So, the cyclohexene ring has a substituent at position 5 which is a vinyl group. So, the molecule has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a formyl group (which is a CHO group, no double bonds), and a vinyl group (another CH₂=CH–, which has a double bond). So, the starting molecule has two double bonds: one in the cyclohexene ring and another in the vinyl substituent.

Wait, but the cyclohexene ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, the starting molecule has two double bonds. But wait, the cyclohexene is a ring with one double bond, and the vinyl group adds another. So the index of hydrogen deficiency for the starting material would be 2 (one from the ring, one from the vinyl group, and maybe another from the formyl group? Wait, no. The formyl group is CHO. That's a carbonyl group, which is a double bond. So, each of those adds to the index.

So starting material: cyclohexene (1 double bond), formyl group (1 double bond), vinyl group (1 double bond). So that's three double bonds, right? Also, the cyclohexene ring has a ring structure, which counts as one degree of unsaturation. Wait, no. Wait, the ring is part of the structure. So for each ring, you have one degree, regardless of double bonds.

Wait, the degree of unsaturation is calculated as each ring or double bond contributing one. Triple bonds count as two. So for the starting material, let's count rings and double bonds.

The molecule is a cyclohexene ring. So that's a six-membered ring
