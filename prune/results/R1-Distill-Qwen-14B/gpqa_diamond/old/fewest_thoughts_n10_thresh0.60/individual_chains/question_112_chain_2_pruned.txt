Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to work through it step by step. I'll take it slow and think it out.

The question is about an electron's state, |alpha>, which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the spin-z operator. I need to find the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, whose matrix is given as Aij. The matrix Aij is zero when i equals j, and hbar/2 otherwise. Then, I also have to compute the average value of that operator.

Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I think I should normalize the given state |alpha>. Because it's proportional, I need to find the normalization constant. The state is given as (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>. So, to find the norm, I'll calculate the inner product of this state with itself.

The inner product of |alpha> with itself is (1+i)*(1-i) + (2 -i)*(2 +i). Because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, their inner product is 1 when same, zero otherwise.

Calculating the first term: (1+i)(1-i) = 1^2 + (i)(-i) + 1*(-i) + i*1? Wait, no, wait. Wait, (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². Oh right, so (1+i)(1-i) = (1)^2 - (i)^2. Because (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So 1 - (i^2). Since i² is -1, this becomes 1 - (-1) = 2.

The second term is (2 - i)(2 + i). Again, same approach. (2)^2 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So the total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the square root of 7 is the normalization factor. So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Wait, no, wait. Because the original statement says it's proportional. So
