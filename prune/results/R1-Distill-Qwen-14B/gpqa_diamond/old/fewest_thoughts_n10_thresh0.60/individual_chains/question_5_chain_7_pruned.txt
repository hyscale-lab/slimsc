Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n lying in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. I need to find the elements of the normalized eigenvector from the given options.

First, I remember that in quantum mechanics, operators correspond to observables, and their eigenvectors represent the states with definite values. The eigenvalue here is ħ/2, so the operator P must have ħ/2 as one of its eigenvalues.

Wait, the operator P is along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh, right! So the direction is arbitrary, but in the x-z plane, which means the angle θ is measured from the z-axis, and phi would be 0 or 180, since it's in the x-z plane. Wait, no, the direction is arbitrary, so phi could be anything? Wait, n is in the x-z plane, so phi is either 0 or π, but wait, the x-z plane includes all angles where phi is 0 or 180? Or maybe it's any direction in the x-z plane, so phi can be any angle as long as it's in that plane. Hmm, maybe I'll think about this more later.

The operator components are given: Px, Py, Pz. Each is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write them down:

Px = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Py = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Pz = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, the operator P along direction n is given by P = nx Px + ny Py + nz Pz. Since n is in the x-z plane, ny must be zero. So, n is (nx, 0, nz), and since it's a unit vector, nx² + nz² = 1.

Wait, but the direction vector n can be parameterized by an angle
