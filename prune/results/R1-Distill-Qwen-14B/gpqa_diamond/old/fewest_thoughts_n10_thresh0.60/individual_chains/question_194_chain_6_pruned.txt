Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. Let's see how to approach this.

Hmm, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). So I need to find all possible states and calculate E for each, then sum the exponentials.

Wait, each spin can be +1 or -1. So for three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. That's manageable. I can list all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3 and calculate the energy for each.

Let me list the states:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1

Now, for each state, calculate the energy E. The energy is -J times (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3).

Let's compute each term:

1. State 1: All +1s.
S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. State 2: S3 is -1.
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. State 3: S2 is -1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 = -1. E = J.

4. State 4: S2 and S3 are -1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E = J.

5. State 5: S1 is -1, others +1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 = -1. E=J.

6. State 6: S3 is -1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1 +1 -1 =-1. E=J.

7. State 7: S2 is -1.
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1 -1 +1 =-1. E=J.

8. State 8: All -1s.
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. E = -3J.

Wait, let me double-check each calculation because getting the energies right is crucial.

Wait, for State 2:
S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1.

S1S2 = 1*1 =1.
S1S3 =1*(-1)=-1.
S2S3=1*(-1)=-1.
Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1.
E = -J*(-1) = J.

Same for State 3:
S1=1, S2
