Okay, so I have this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where E is the energy of each state and β is 1/(kT). 

The system has three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each spin can be either +1 or -1. So each spin has two possible states. For three spins, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. I need to consider all these 8 states and calculate their energies, then sum the exponentials.

The energy is given by E = -J [S1 S2 + S1 S3 + S2 S3]. J is some coupling constant. Since J could be positive or negative, but in this problem, I think J is given as a parameter, so I'll treat it as a positive value unless told otherwise.

So first, I need to find all possible combinations of S1, S2, S3, compute E for each, and then sum exp(-βE) for each state.

Wait, but maybe instead of enumerating all 8 states, I can find the possible values of the energy and how many states have each energy. That would make it easier.

Let me think: Each term S_i S_j is 1 if the spins are aligned and -1 if anti-aligned. Because S_i can be +1 or -1. So S1 S2 is +1 if S1 and S2 are same, else -1.

The energy expression is E = -J [ (S1S2) + (S1S3) + (S2S3) ]

Let me denote the sum inside as H = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. So E = -J H.

So H can take different values based on the spins. Let me find the possible values of H.

Let me consider all possible states:

Each spin can be +1 or -1. So let's list all 8 possibilities.

But perhaps a smarter way is to calculate the sum H for each configuration.

Wait, another approach: The sum H is the sum of all three pairs. Each term is ±1, so H can range from -3 to +3, but in steps of 2? Because each term in H is ±1, so the sum can be 3 (all +1), 1 (two +1, one -1), -1 (two -1, one +1), or -3 (all -1). Wait, actually, each term is either +1 or -1, so the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, no. Let me see: if all three pairs are +1, then H = 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, H = 2*1 + (-1) =1. If one is +1 and two are -1, H=1 -2 =-1. If all are -1, H=-3.

So H can be 3, 1, -1, -3. Now, how many states correspond to each H?

So for each state configuration (s1, s2, s3), compute H = s1 s2 + s1 s3 + s2 s3.

Let me compute H for each possible state.

Wait, maybe count how many states have H=3, H=1, H=-1, H=-3.

Let me think about the possible values of H:

H = s1 s2 + s1 s3 + s2 s3.

Let me compute this for different cases.

Case 1: All spins are same. So s1 = s2 = s3 = +1 or all =-1.

In this case:

s1 s2 = +1, s1 s3=+1, s2 s3=+1. So H=3.

Similarly, if all are -1: s1 s2 = (-1)*(-1)=1, same for others. So H=3.

So how many states have H
