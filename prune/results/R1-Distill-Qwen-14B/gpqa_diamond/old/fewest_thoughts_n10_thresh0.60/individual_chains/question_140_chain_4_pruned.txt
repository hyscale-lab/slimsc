Okay, so I'm trying to solve this multiple-choice science question. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's a chemistry problem involving reactions and some properties of substances. The question gives a scenario with several substances and reactions, and then asks about the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in Substance X.

First, I need to parse the information step by step.

Substance X reacts violently with liquid Y, releasing gas W. Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, W's molecule has equal protons and neutrons. That makes me think of a molecule where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but W is a gas, so maybe it's a simple diatomic molecule.

Wait, each molecule? Or each atom? Because the molecule could be made of atoms where each atom has equal protons and neutrons. Or maybe the molecule as a whole has equal protons and neutrons. Hmm. Let me think. For example, if W is H2, then each H has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (since it's H-1), but that's for each atom. So the molecule would have 2 protons and 0 neutrons. That wouldn't work because the number of protons and neutrons in the molecule would differ. Alternatively, if W is something like O2, but wait, O has 8 protons. Neutrons
