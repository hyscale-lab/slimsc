Okay, so I've got this question here about two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature depends on a few factors: the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo, so that's one variable I don't need to worry about.

The formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_planet = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.25, but wait, maybe the exact factors are a bit different. Let me get that right. Oh right, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - A) )^0.25. But since albedo A is the same for both, that part will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So the main variables are the distance 'a' of each planet from the star. But wait, how do I find 'a'? The question mentions the RV method, which gives the mass of the planet and the velocity of the star. But I'm not sure how that relates directly to the distance. Oh, wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity, and from that, you can get the mass function, which involves the planet's mass and the distance.

Wait, but the
