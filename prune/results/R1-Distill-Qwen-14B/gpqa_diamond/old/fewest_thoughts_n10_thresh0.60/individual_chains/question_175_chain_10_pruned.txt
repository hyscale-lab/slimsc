Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and the radiation they produce. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says we have an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, with the symmetry along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength lambda. In the radiation zone, the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and the angle theta. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at theta = 30 degrees, and also the possible form of f.

The options are A to D, each giving a fraction and a lambda dependence. So I need to figure out both the fraction and the dependence.

I remember from my electromagnetism classes that when a dipole oscillates, it radiates electromagnetic waves. The radiation pattern for a dipole has a certain angular dependence. In particular, the power radiated per unit solid angle (the radiation intensity) depends on the cosine of theta squared, so like cos^2(theta). Wait, is that right? Or is it sin^2(theta) for something else?

Wait, correction: The radiation pattern for a dipole is actually proportional to (sin^2(theta)) when looking at the intensity. No, wait, wait. Let me think. The intensity distribution for a dipole is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis (theta = 90 degrees) and falls off to zero along the axis (theta=0 and 180). So the formula is proportional to (sin^2(theta)) multiplied by another term. No, wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me think about the formula.

The radiation intensity for an oscillating dipole is given by:

I = ( (μ₀ μ₀) / (4π c r²) ) * ( ( (k²) ) / (c²) ) * ( (d²φ/dt²)² ) * ( (1/(2)) (1 - cos²θ) ) )

Wait, maybe more accurately, the expression for the intensity (power per unit solid angle) of an oscillating dipole is proportional to (sin²θ), because for a dipole, the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the axis. So the maximum is at 90 degrees, not along the axis.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let
