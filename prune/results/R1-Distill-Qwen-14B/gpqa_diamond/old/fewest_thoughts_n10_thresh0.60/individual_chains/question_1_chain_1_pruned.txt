Alright, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question talks about two quantum states with energies E1 and E2. Their lifetimes are given as 10^-9 seconds and 10^-8 seconds, respectively. The goal is to find the energy difference that would allow us to clearly distinguish these two energy levels. The options are A through D.

Hmm, okay, I remember something about the uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. Oh right, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. It says that there's a fundamental limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be known. One of the key applications is the energy-time uncertainty relation. The formula I recall is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2, where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, but I think in many contexts, people use ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt, ignoring the 1/2 factor because the exact value isn't critical for order-of-magnitude estimates. So the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime (which is the time uncertainty). That makes sense because a shorter lifetime means a less precise measurement of energy.

So the idea here is that for each energy level, the uncertainty in energy is inversely proportional to the lifetime. If the energy difference between the two states is much larger than the uncertainties, then they can be distinguished. But if the difference is smaller than the uncertainties, the states might not be resolvable.

Let me think about each state. The first has a lifetime of 10^-9 seconds. Let's compute the uncertainty in energy for that. Similarly, the second has 10^-8 seconds.

Wait, but the question is about the energy difference between the two states. So, we need to ensure that the energy difference is larger than the combined uncertainties of both states? Or do we compare it to each individually?

No, wait, actually, each state's energy has its own uncertainty. The energy difference needs to be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, or perhaps each state's uncertainty contributes. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Let me think again.

Suppose E1 has a lifetime τ1, so ΔE1 ≈ ħ / τ1. Similarly, E2 has τ2, so ΔE2 ≈ ħ / τ2. The energy difference ΔE = |E2 - E1|. For them to be distinguishable, ΔE must be larger than the sum of the uncertainties, I think. Because if the uncertainty is too large, the states might overlap.

Wait, but perhaps the key is that the energy difference must be larger than the uncertainty in energy for each state. Because if the difference is much larger than each state's uncertainty, then you can tell them apart. So each state is a peak in the energy spectrum, and the separation between the peaks must be more than the width (which is the uncertainty). So the energy difference must be larger than each individual uncertainty.

Wait, but the actual condition is that the energy difference should be larger than the uncertainty in energy. So the combined uncertainty of both might not be necessary because the uncertainty in energy for each state is the width of its peak. So the separation needs to be greater than the sum of the two widths? Or just each width?

Hmm. Maybe
