Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, I remember the RV method detects planets by looking at the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum caused by the planet's gravity making the star wobble. The shift in the spectral lines tells us about the planet's presence.

The question says there are two stars with the same mass as our Sun. Each has a planet similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. The RV method detected each planet, and the shifts in their spectral lines are given as 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 for planet #2.

Wait, the question is about the orbital periods of the two planets. How do these shifts relate to the orbital period?

I think the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is what's measured. K depends on the mass of the planet, the orbital period, the inclination of the orbit (but since it's circular, maybe we can assume it's edge-on, so sin(i) is 1?), and the star's mass.

The formula I remember for K is K = (v) where v is the star's velocity. And the formula for K in terms of other variables is K = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) ) / ( (P * (2π))^(1/3) ) ) * something. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the relation between K and the orbital period.

Alternatively, I recall that K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. Because from Kepler's third law, the period is related to the semi-major axis, which for a star-planet system relates to the velocity.

Wait, let's think about Kepler's third law. The period P squared is proportional to a cubed divided by (M_star + M_p). But since M_p is much smaller than M_star (like Neptune is much less than the Sun), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So P² is proportional to a³ / M_star.

But how does this tie into the radial velocity semi-amplitude K? The formula for K is:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * sin(i) ] / ( (P * (2 * π))^(1/3) ) )

Since sin(i)
