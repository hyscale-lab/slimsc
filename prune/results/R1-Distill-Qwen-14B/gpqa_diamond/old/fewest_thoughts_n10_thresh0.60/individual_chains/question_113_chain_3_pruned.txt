Okay, so I've got this problem about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic data. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question gives me the results from FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. My goal is to figure out the chemical formula from the options provided.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. It shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm⁻¹. I remember that broad peaks in that region often indicate O-H groups, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. But wait, the peak is at 3000, which is a bit higher than typical O-H stretches. Or maybe it's a broad peak because of hydrogen bonding, as in a carboxylic acid? Or maybe it's an alcohol, but the broadness suggests perhaps a strong hydrogen bonding, so maybe a more acidic proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, maybe it's an ether, but ether O-H is not common because ethers don't have O-H bonds. Wait, no, ethers don't have O-H. So the O-H is probably from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid, or maybe something else like a phenol, but I don't see any mention of a strong peak around 1500 for phenol rings, so perhaps it's not a phenol.

Then there are two strong peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹. Hmm, 1700 is a typical carbonyl (C=O) stretch. But wait, 1650 could be another carbonyl, maybe a conjugated one, or maybe an aromatic ring with C=C stretching. Alternatively, it could be an amide, but the options don't have nitrogen. So maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl group. Wait, another possibility: maybe the 1700 is a carbonyl and the 1650 is a C=C (alkene) stretch. Because if the compound has both a carbonyl group and an alkene, that would make sense. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic ring, but I don't think so because the NMR mentions vinyl hydrogens, which are alkenes.

So putting that together: the compound probably has a carbonyl group (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and an alkene (vinyl group). Also, the O-H from the FTIR suggests an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but wait. The presence of a broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ might suggest an -OH group. So maybe the compound is something like an ester, which has both a carbonyl and an O-H? No, wait, esters don't have O-H groups because they're formed from alcohols and carboxylic acids. Wait, unless it's an acid derivative. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a ketone with an alcohol group, but that's less likely because ketones don't usually have
