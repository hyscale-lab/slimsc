Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh wait, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, those are the antisymmetric products of gamma matrices. And F^{μν} is the field strength tensor, I think it's for a gauge field like electromagnetism, so F^{μν} = ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ or something like that.

So, the question is about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. I remember that renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants and the possible divergences in loops.

Let me recall how to find the mass dimension of the coupling. The idea is to make the Lagrangian have mass dimension 4 since when you integrate L over spacetime, the action should be dimensionless in natural units (where ħ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Looking at L_int: it's made of ψ̄, σ_{μν} (which are matrices, but their dimension comes from the gamma matrices), ψ, and F^{μν}.

First, I need to determine the mass
