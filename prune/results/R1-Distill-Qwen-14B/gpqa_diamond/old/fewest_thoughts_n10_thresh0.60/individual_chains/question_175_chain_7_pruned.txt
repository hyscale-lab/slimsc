Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an oscillating charge distribution that radiates power. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that oscillating charges can emit radiation, especially if they're accelerating. The question is a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

The setup is that the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped, with the symmetry along the z-axis. So the oscillation is probably along the z-axis, making it an oscillating dipole or something similar. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a certain wavelength λ. The question is about the radiated power per unit solid angle as a function f of λ and the angle θ. The maximum power is A, and we need to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, as well as the possible form of f.

Wait, so the maximum power A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle multiplied by the solid angle, right? Or is A the total power radiated? I think in radiation problems, the total power is the integral of the power per unit solid angle over all solid angles. So A might be the total power, or the maximum per unit solid angle.

Wait, the question says the maximum power thus radiated is A. So maybe A is the maximum value of the power per unit solid angle? Or is it the total power? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think. The radiation from a dipole antenna varies with the angle θ. The power pattern for a dipole is maximum at θ = 90 degrees (perpendicular to the dipole axis) and decreases towards θ=0 and 180 degrees. The formula for the power per unit solid angle (the radiation pattern) is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) in the far field. So at θ=90 degrees, cosθ is 0, so it's 1, which gives maximum. At θ=0, cosθ is 1, so 1+1=2, but wait, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. The dipole radiation pattern in the far field is (sinθ)^2, isn't it? Or is it (1 + cos^2θ)? I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, let me recall. The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by P(θ) proportional to (sinθ)^2. Oh
