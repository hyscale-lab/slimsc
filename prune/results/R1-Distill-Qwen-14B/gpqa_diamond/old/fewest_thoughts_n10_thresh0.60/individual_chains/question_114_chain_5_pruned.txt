Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out the right reagents for these reactions. Let me take it step by step.

The first reaction is between butan-2-one and NaCN with a reagent A. The product is 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Hmm, I remember that ketones reacting with nitriles usually involve some kind of addition. Oh wait, the CN- group is a good nucleophile. So, maybe it's a nucleophilic addition to the ketone.

In the first reaction, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. When a ketone reacts with a cyanide, I think it's called a cyanohydrin formation. Yeah, right. So the reaction is the ketone reacting with cyanide ion to form a cyanohydrin. The conditions for that... I think it's usually done with a strong acid as a catalyst. Like H3O+ or maybe something else.

Wait, how does that work? The ketone would have the carbonyl group, and the CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. The acid (like H3O+) would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic. Then the CN- attacks, and water leaves, forming the alcohol. So the product would have a hydroxyl group and a nitrile group attached to the same carbon.

So for the first part, reagent A is probably H3O+ or another strong acid. Because the product has both an alcohol and a nitrile group on the same carbon, that fits the cyanohydrin formation.

Now the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B (H2O) to give 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group is converting into a carboxylic acid.

How does that happen? Nitriles hydrolyze under certain conditions. I think there are two main ways: acidic and basic conditions. Let me recall. The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids typically requires strong acidic conditions. Like using HCl (HCl) as a catalyst, and then under reflux with water. Or sometimes it's done with a strong acid like H2SO4.

Wait, but in the options, the reagent B is either HCl or CH3CO
