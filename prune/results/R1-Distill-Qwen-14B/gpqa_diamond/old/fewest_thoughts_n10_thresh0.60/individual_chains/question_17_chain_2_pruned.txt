Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution containing a Ca-EDTA complex. The given data is 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, the pH is ideal, temperature is 25°C, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The options are A through D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca. The complex here is Ca-EDTA, which I think would be something like CaY^2- where Y is the EDTA^4- ion.

Wait, the formation constant, K, is given. Formation constants are for the reaction where the metal ion binds with the ligand. So the general reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K is given by [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

In this problem, the solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So initially, I think that the concentration of CaEDTA^2- is 0.02 M. But wait, what about the dissociation of this complex? Because the complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-.

The problem says to assume the pH is ideal. Oh right, pH affects the concentration of EDTA in solution because EDTA exists in different protonated forms. But since pH is ideal, I probably don't need to worry about the conditional formation constant or the alpha fraction. So I can use the formation constant as given.

So the dissociation would be:

CaEDTA^2- ⇌ Ca²+ + EDTA^4-

The formation constant K is 5e10, which is very large, so the complex is very stable. But wait, wait, no. Wait, the formation constant is for the formation of the complex. So the K is [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

But in solution, the concentration of CaEDTA is 0.02 M. So initially, I can assume that the concentration of the complex is
