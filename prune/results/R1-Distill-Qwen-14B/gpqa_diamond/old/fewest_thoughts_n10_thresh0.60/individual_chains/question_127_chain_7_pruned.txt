Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about what happens when 5-butylnona-2,6-diene is heated. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll think it through.

First, I remember that when alkenes are heated, especially in certain conditions, they can undergo rearrangement reactions. Oh wait, that's probably a Diels-Alder reaction, but wait, no, Diels-Alder is a [4+2] cycloaddition between a diene and a dienophile. But if it's just one diene being heated, maybe it's more about isomerization or some kind of rearrangement like a hydride shift or something else.

Wait, wait. Another possibility is that the molecule undergoes a dehydrogenation or hydrogen shift, leading to a more stable structure. Oh, right! When alkenes are heated, especially if they're conjugated dienes, they can form more substituted, more stable alkenes through a process like the Cope rearrangement or something similar. Wait, the Cope rearrangement is for 1,5-dienes, right? So if the given molecule is a 1,5-diene or can form one, that might be the case.

Wait, let me look at the structure of 5-butylnona-2,6-diene. So nona means nine carbons. The diene has double bonds at positions 2 and 6. So numbering from the left, the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH
