Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about titrating acetic acid with NaOH. Oh right, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So, when you titrate them, they react to form the acetate ion and water.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given, so I need to calculate both values.

First, let me outline the steps I need to take. 

1. Calculate the initial concentration of the diluted acetic acid.
2. Determine the volume of NaOH added at 25% titration.
3. Calculate the moles of acetic acid and acetate at that point to find the pH using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.
4. Find the pH at the equivalence point, which involves finding the concentration of the acetate ion in solution and then the pH from that.

Wait, let me think about the initial step. The initial solution is made by mixing 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 liters. 

The moles of acetic acid before dilution are Molarity × Volume. So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. After diluting to 40 cm³, the concentration is moles / total volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, when titrating with NaOH, the reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^-Na+ + H2O.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have been neutralized to acetate. So the moles of NaOH at equivalence will be equal to the moles of acetic acid. 

Wait, moles of acetic acid in the diluted solution: 0.025 M × 0.04 L = 0.001 mol. So moles of NaOH needed for equivalence is also 0.001 mol. Since the NaOH concentration is 0.1 M, the volume needed is moles / concentration: 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³. So total volume at equivalence is 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³.

But wait, no, the original solution is 40 cm³, and then we add 10 cm³ of NaOH, so yes, 50 cm³ total.

Now, back to the 25% titration. 25% of the equivalence volume is added. Wait, what's the equivalence volume? It's 10 cm³, as I found earlier. 25% of that is 2.5 cm³. So at 25% titration, 2.5 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH has been added.

Let me calculate moles of NaOH added: 0.1 M * 0.0025 L = 0.00025 mol. So that's how much acetic acid has been neutralized. So, the moles of CH3COOH remaining: initial moles of acetic acid 0.001 mol minus 0.00025 mol = 0.00075 mol. And the moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 mol.

Wait, but the solution's volume is the original 40 cm³ plus the added NaOH, which is 2.5 cm³. So total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). 

So the concentrations are [A] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M and [HA] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M. 

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. No. Because the initial solution is 40 cm³, and we add 2.5 cm³ of NaOH. So the total volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L). So both the remaining acetic acid and the acetate are in this volume.

So the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M.

Wait no, wait, no. Wait, wait. The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation uses the ratio of the concentrations, so maybe I don't need to calculate the individual concentrations, because it's [A-]/[HA] = (n_A-)/(n_HA)
