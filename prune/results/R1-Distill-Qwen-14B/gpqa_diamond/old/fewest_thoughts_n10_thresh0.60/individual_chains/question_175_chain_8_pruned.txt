Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about oscillating charges and radiation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says we've got an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroid-shaped with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. Because it's oscillating, it radiates at a wavelength λ. In the radiation zone, the power per unit solid angle is a function f of λ and θ, the angle from the z-axis. The maximum power is A, and we're supposed to find the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees, as well as the form of f.

The options are A, B, C, D with fractions and λ exponents. I remember that when charges oscillate, they emit electromagnetic radiation, and the radiation pattern depends on the angle θ.

Wait, I think dipole radiation is the key here. Because the charge distribution is spheroid, maybe it's approximating a dipole. The radiation from a dipole has a specific angular dependence.

Dipole radiation has a power pattern that depends on cos²θ, but wait, no, wait. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field (which is what the radiation zone refers to) is proportional to (1 + cos²θ) or something like that. Or was it (sin²θ) for some component?

No, wait. The dipole's radiation is maximum in the plane perpendicular to the axis, so θ=90 degrees is maximum. For a dipole, the radiation pattern is usually (sin²θ) multiplied by some factors, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, the intensity in the far field for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²θ), but that can't be right because that would imply maximum at θ=0 and θ=180, which is the direction along the dipole. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, in dipole radiation, the electric field in the far zone is proportional to (1/r) * (e^(ikr)/k) * (dipole moment direction) and the radiation is strongest perpendicular to the dipole, so that's at θ=90 degrees. So the radiation pattern, I think, for the intensity (which is power per unit area) would be proportional to sin²θ, because as
