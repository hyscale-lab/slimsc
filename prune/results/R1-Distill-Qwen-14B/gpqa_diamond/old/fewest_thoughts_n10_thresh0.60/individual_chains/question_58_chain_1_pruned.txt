Alright, so I have this multiple-choice question about physics theories and regularization at high energies. Hmm, let me try to think through this. Okay, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, like infinite results that don't make physical sense. The idea is to make the calculations finite by introducing a cutoff or some other method, and then later take the cutoff to infinity or absorb it into renormalization.

The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), C) Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), and D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Let me think about each option one by one.

Option A: Superstring Theory. I recall that string theory is a candidate for a theory of quantum gravity. Unlike quantum field theories, which have particles as point-like objects, strings are extended. I think string theories are supposed to be finite, meaning they don't have the same types of divergences that QED or QCD do. So maybe they don't require regularization? Or do they? Wait, I think that in perturbative string theory, calculations can still have divergences, especially in certain limits. Or maybe not, because the theory is background-dependent? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Alternatively, maybe string theory doesn't require regularization because the underlying structure is different, and the perturbative expansions are better behaved. Hmm.

Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics. QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-abelian gauge theory with asymptotic freedom, meaning that at high energies (or short distances), the coupling constant becomes weak, and perturbation theory works. But at low energies, it becomes strongly coupled. I remember that QCD requires renormalization, so it must have divergences that need to be handled. So regularization is needed here, like using lattice methods or other techniques.

Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics. QED is the theory of electromagnetism. It's an abelian gauge theory. I know that historically, QED had problems with divergent loop diagrams, which led to the development of renormalization techniques. So yes, regularization is required in QED calculations to handle these divergences before renormalization.

Option D: Classical Electrodynamics. Classical theories don't involve the same divergences that quantum theories do. In classical E&M, you don't have issues like infinite self-energy of point charges because you
