Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I need to figure out which of Maxwell's equations would be different in such a scenario.

Wait, Maxwell's equations as we know them include certain symmetries. Let me recall each equation. There are four of them, right? The four equations are about the divergence of E and B fields, the curl of E and B, and the relationships between them with charges and currents.

In our universe, magnetic monopoles don't exist, so the divergence of the magnetic field B is zero. That's the second equation: ∇·B = 0. If there were isolated magnetic poles, like an isolated North or South pole, then B wouldn't necessarily have zero divergence anymore. So that equation would change.

But wait, Maxwell's equations also have Faraday's Law, which is about the curl of E. Faraday's Law in our universe is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. I'm not sure if that would change. Maybe not, because that's more about the time variation of the magnetic field inducing an electric field.

What about the other equations? Gauss's Law for electricity is ∇·E = ρ/ε₀. That's about electric charges, so unless there are magnetic charges, I don't think that equation changes. Similarly, Ampère's Law (with Maxwell's addition) is about the curl of B, ∇×B = μ₀ J + μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t. If there are magnetic currents, would that equation change? Or does that equation relate to currents of electric charges?

Wait, in the question, it's a universe where magnets can have isolated poles. So magnetic monopoles exist, meaning that something like magnetic charge density exists. So the divergence of B would not be zero. So that equation would change.

But also, another equation might change. Ampère's Law includes the displacement current, but that's about electric fields changing. If magnetic monopoles exist, maybe there's a magnetic version of Ampère's Law. Or perhaps not. Let me think.

Oh, I remember that in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the symmetries of Maxwell's equations break. Two of the four equations would change. Without magnetic monopoles,
