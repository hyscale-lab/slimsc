Okay, so I'm trying to solve this neutrino flux ratio problem. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question is about the Sun's neutrino production when the pp-III branch stops suddenly. I remember that the pp chain is a major source of energy in the Sun, and it produces neutrinos, especially electron neutrinos. 

Wait, the pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton cycle, right? The pp chain has different branches, and I think the pp-III branch is responsible for producing helium-4 from two helium-3 ions. If that stops, what happens to neutrino production?

Oh right, the pp-III branch produces a lot of neutrinos. Specifically, the main neutrinos from the Sun come from the proton-proton chain, and the main ones are from the pp-III branch, which is the dominant process. So if pp-III stops, the neutrino production from that part would drop. But the question says all other reactions remain as they were. Hmm, but wait, the pp chain has other branches too, like pp-I and pp-II. So maybe those other branches would compensate a bit, but not entirely.

So, the neutrino flux we detect on Earth is a mix of neutrinos from different sources in the Sun. The main ones are from the pp chain and the CNO cycle. The CNO cycle is less dominant than the pp chain in the Sun, I think. But wait, in the core, the pp chain is more active, especially when the temperature is lower. The CNO cycle dominates at higher temperatures.

If the pp-III branch stops, the pp chain's neutrino production would decrease. But neutrinos from the CNO cycle are still being produced as usual elsewhere. Wait, but the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos compared to the pp chain, I believe. Or is it the other way around?

No, wait, the neutrinos from the CNO cycle are actually higher energy. The pp chain produces lower-energy neutrinos, while the CNO produces higher-energy ones. So the majority of the solar neutrinos are from the pp chain, but when pp-III stops, the pp chain's contribution drops. So the remaining neutrinos would come more from the CNO cycle and any other pp branches that are unaffected.

Wait, but the question is about the flux in two specific energy bands. Band 1 is 700-800 keV, and Band 2 is 800-
