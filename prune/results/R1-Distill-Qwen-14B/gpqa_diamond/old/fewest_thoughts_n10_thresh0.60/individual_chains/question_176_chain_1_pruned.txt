Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, but in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as column vectors, and they need to be normalized. Hmm, I remember that the state vector must have a magnitude (or norm) of 1. So I should probably normalize this vector first before doing anything else.

The vector is [-1, 2, 1]^T. Let me calculate its norm. The norm squared is (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the normalized state vector is [ -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) ]^T.

Next, the problem involves two observables, P and Q. The operators for these observables are given as matrices. For observable P, the matrix is:

First row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Second row: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Third row: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And for Q, the matrix is diagonal: first row [1,0,0], second row [0,0,0], third row [0,0,-1]. So Q is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. Wait, but wait, the second diagonal element is zero. So the possible outcomes for Q are 1, 0, -1.

The question is about measuring P first, then Q, and finding the probability that P yields 0 and Q yields -1. Hmm. Wait, no, the order is someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. Oh wait, no, the question says: if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements?

Wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again. It says, "if someone measures Q just after the measurement of P, what is the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective
