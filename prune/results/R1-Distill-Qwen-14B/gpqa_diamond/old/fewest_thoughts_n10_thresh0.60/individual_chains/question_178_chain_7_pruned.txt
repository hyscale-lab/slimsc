Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the Lagrangian and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I remember that renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. Let me think through this step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I think I need to find the mass dimension of κ and then determine if the theory is renormalizable based on that.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4 because the Lagrangian density has units of mass^4 in natural units (since the integral over d^4x has units mass^-4, so the integrand must be mass^4 to get an overall dimensionless action).

So each term in the Lagrangian must have a mass dimension of 4. Let's break down the terms in L_int.

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. Let me find the mass dimensions of each part.

I know that for a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. So ψ̄ (which is ψ^dagger γ^0) also has dimension 3/2.

What about σ_{μν}? Since σ is made from the commutator of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (as far as I remember, gamma matrices are treated as dimensionless objects). So σ_{μν} has the same dimension as [γ_mu, γ_nu], which is dimensionless. So σ_{μν} is dimensionless.

So the ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ part would have dimensions: (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) = 3.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor. For electromagnetism, F_{μν} is the field tensor, which has a dimension of 2. Because the electromagnetic field A_mu has dimension 1 (since the kinetic term is ∂μ Aν ∂^μ A^ν, each A has dim 1), and F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, so same as A's dimension, but wait, wait. Wait, F_{μν} has dimensions of (mass)^2. Because F_{μν} is built from derivatives of A, and A has dimension 1. Each derivative brings a mass dimension of 1. So F has dimension 2.

So putting all together, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ) (F). The dimension of (ψ̄ σ ψ) is 3, F is 2, so total without κ is 5. So the entire term must have dimension 4, since it's part of the Lagrangian.

So the equation is: [κ] + 3 + 2 = 4. So [κ] = -1.

Wait wait, let me double-check that. Each ψ has 3/2, so ψ̄ σ ψ is (3/2) + (3/2) =3. F has dimension 2. So 3+2=5. So κ must be 4-5 = -1. So the mass dimension of κ is -1. That suggests that the first part of the answer is option A or C.

Now the second part: is the theory renormalizable? I remember that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have mass dimension ≤ (4 - the dimension of the term in the Lagrangian, but wait, no, more precisely, the dimension of the coupling constants must be ≥ 0. Because in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants are dimensionless (in 4D) or have dimensions that allow only a finite number of terms in the renormalization group equations.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For a theory to be renormalizable,
