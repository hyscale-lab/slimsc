Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's go through it slowly because I'm a bit rusty on some concepts. The question is about the CERN Bubble Chamber and particle decay. Hmm, I think I remember that particle decay involves lifetimes and velocities, but I'm not exactly sure how it all connects. Let me break it down.

The problem says that a particle X⁰ decays into Y⁺ and Z⁻ with a proper lifetime τ₀ of 8×10⁻¹⁶ seconds. The question is about the minimum resolution needed to observe at least 30% of these decays. Oh, right, the resolution probably refers to the detection capability, maybe the distance a particle travels before decaying, so that the chamber can capture it.

The setup gives the energy in the Bubble Chamber as 27 GeV, and the mass of X⁰ is 3.41 GeV. Wait, energy and mass... I think I'll need to find the velocity of the X⁰ particle to calculate its lifetime as observed in the lab frame. Because in the lab frame, the lifetime would be longer due to time dilation.

So first, I need to find the velocity of X⁰. The energy E is given by the relativistic formula E² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Here, E is 27 GeV, m is 3.41 GeV, and c is the speed of light. But wait, the units—since everything is in GeV, and c is in m/s, but perhaps I can work in natural units where c=1 for calculation purposes and then adjust later. Hmm, but maybe I should proceed carefully.

Alternatively, since E is much larger than mc², I can approximate the velocity as being very close to the speed of light. Let's compute gamma, the Lorentz factor. Gamma is E/(mc²). Because when E is much larger than mc², gamma is approximately E/(m c²), but wait, in units where c=1, E is in GeV and m is also in GeV/c², so E = gamma m c²? So gamma is E/(m c²) but with c² in m²/s². Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me try to compute gamma correctly.

Wait, m is 3.41 GeV/c². So, m c² is 3.41 GeV. E is 27 GeV, so gamma is E/(m c²) = 27 / 3.41 ≈ 7.91. Wait, that makes sense. So gamma is around 7.91.

Now, the proper lifetime τ₀ is given as 8e-16 seconds. The observed lifetime τ in the lab frame is gamma multiplied by τ₀. So τ = gamma τ₀ = 7.91 * 8e-16 s ≈ 63.28e-16 s, which is 6.328e-15 seconds. Wait, that's the mean lifetime as observed, right?

But wait, particles don't live forever. They decay randomly according to their lifetime. The probability that a particle decays
