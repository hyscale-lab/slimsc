Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll take it slow.

The question gives me a compound with molecular formula C8H9NO. Hmm, that formula. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation. Each degree is either a ring or a double bond. The formula is C8H9NO. Nitrogen is one atom, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation. Oh wait, for the degree of unsaturation, each double bond, ring, or triple bond counts as one. Each triple bond is two, etc.

The formula is C8H9NO. To find degree of unsaturation, I can use the formula: Degrees of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C + 2 - H - X + N)/2. Wait, what's X here? X is halogens, but in this case, there are none. So substituting the values: C=8, H=9, N=1, X=0.

So DoU = (2*8 +2 -9 -0 +1)/2 = (18-9+1)/2= 10/2=5. So five degrees. That could be a combination of rings and double bonds. Maybe a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) and some other double bonds or rings.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H-NMR (ppm): 
9.72 (t, 1H)
6.98 (d, 2H)
6.51 (d, 2H)
6.27 (bs, 2H)
3.66 (d, 2H)

Let me try to interpret this. The peak at 9.72 is a triplet integrating for 1H. A triplet at around 9.7 could be an aldehyde proton. Aldehydes usually appear around 9-10 ppm. But wait, if it's an aldehyde, the splitting (triplet) suggests coupling with two adjacent protons. Hmm, but aldehydes are usually at the end, so maybe they have coupling with a neighboring CH2 group? Or perhaps it's an aromatic proton.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the peak at 9.72 is an aromatic proton. For example, in some
