Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. Hmm, I think it involves the dissociation of a complex ion. Let me see.

The problem states that the solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. Wait, what's a stoichiometric complex? Oh right, I remember that in such complexes, the metal ion and the ligand are in a 1:1 ratio. So EDTA has four binding sites, but in this case, it's a 1:1, meaning the formula is probably CaY²−, where Y is the EDTA^4- or something like that.

The given K for the complex, KCa-EDTA, is 5x10^10. That's a very large K, which suggests that the complex is very stable, meaning it doesn't dissociate much. So, the concentration of free calcium ions should be really low.

I think the reaction is something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ⇌ CaEDTA²−, and the formation constant Kf is given. Wait, but the K given here is KCa-EDTA. Oh, maybe it's the formation constant. So K = [CaEDTA²−]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4−]). That's right.

But wait, the initial solution has 0.02 M of the Ca-EDTA complex. So the initial concentration of CaED
