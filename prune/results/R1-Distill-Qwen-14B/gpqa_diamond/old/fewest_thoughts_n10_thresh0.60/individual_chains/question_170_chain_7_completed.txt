Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Wait, the spin state given is (3i, 4). Oh right, in quantum mechanics, spin states are often represented as two-component vectors. So this must be a column vector, like [3i; 4]. Or maybe written as a row vector? Wait, the notation can sometimes be a bit confusing. I think in this context, it's a column vector. So the state is |ψ> = [3i, 4]^T.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the bra-ket product: <ψ| S_y |ψ> divided by the normalization, I suppose. Oh wait, wait, but first, I need to make sure the state is normalized. Let me check that.

The normalization factor is the inner product of the state with itself. So the state is [3i, 4]^T. The inner product would be (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4), because when you take the conjugate transpose (bra) and multiply by the ket, the first term is (3i)* times (3i), which is (3i)(-3i) because complex conjugate flips the sign of i. Wait, let me compute that more carefully.

Wait, the conjugate of 3i is -3i. So when I compute <ψ|ψ>, it's (3i)* * 3i + (4)* *4. So that's (-3i)(3i) plus 16. Let's compute that. (-3i)(3i) is (-9)(i^2), but i^2 is -1, so that's (-9)(-1) = 9. Plus 16 is 25. So the normalization is 25. So the state is already normalized because the inner product is 25, which we can divide by to get 1. So the expectation value would be <ψ| S_y |ψ> divided by 25, perhaps? Wait, no, S_y is already an operator in units of ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Wait, let me think.

Wait, the spin operator S_y for an electron is given by (ħ/2) times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Because the Pauli matrices are for spin-1/2 systems and the spin operators are (ħ/2) times σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So S_y = (ħ/2) σ_y. And the σ_y matrix given is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. Right.

So the expectation value is <ψ| S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) <ψ| σ_y |ψ>.

So now I need to compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ> first, then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me write out the vectors. The state |ψ> is [3i, 4]^T. So the bra vector <ψ| is [ -3i, 4 ]. Because the conjugate transpose. Since 3i becomes -3i and 4 remains 4.

So let's compute σ_y |ψ> first. σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when I multiply σ_y by |ψ>, which is [3i; 4], I get:

First component: (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = -4i.

Second component: (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = i*(3i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y |ψ> = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me redo that multiplication. Matrix multiplication is row times column.

So σ_y is a 2x2 matrix:

Row 1: [0, -i]

Row 2: [i, 0]

Multiplying by |ψ> which is [3i; 4], each component is:

First component (row 1 of σ_y times column of |ψ>):

0 * 3i + (-i) *4 = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component (row 2 of σ_y times |ψ>):

i *3i + 0 *4 = i*(3i) = 3i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

So yes, σ_y |ψ> is [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, <ψ| σ_y |ψ> is the inner product of <ψ| and σ_y |ψ>.

So <ψ| is [ -3i, 4 ].

So the inner product is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let me compute each term.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i². i squared is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So adding them together: -12 + (-12) = -24.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, no. Because wait, the first term is:

(-3i)(-4i) = (12) (i^2) = 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4*(-3) = -12.

So sum is -12 + (-12) = -24. So the expectation value of σ_y is -24.

Wait, but wait, S_y is (ħ/2) times σ_y. So the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24).

Wait, but also, wait a second. Our state |ψ> was [3i, 4]^T. But when I computed σ_y |ψ>, I got [ -4i, -3 ]^T. Then <ψ| σ_y |ψ> is (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3) = 12i² + (-12) = 12*(-1) = -12, plus -12 gives -24.

So <σ_y> = -24.

But wait, normalization. Oh wait, I think I missed the normalization factor earlier. Because the state |ψ> is not normalized yet. Wait, no. Because when I did <ψ|ψ>, I got 25, so the state isn't normalized unless we divide by sqrt(25)=5. So the actual state should be |ψ> = [3i,4]^T / 5, because the norm is 5² =25.

Wait, wait! Oh no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because when calculating the expectation value, if the state isn't normalized, you have to divide by the norm squared. So the expectation value is [ <ψ| S_y |ψ> ] divided by [ <ψ|ψ> ].

So let me correct that. Because in the initial step, I thought the state was normalized, but actually, the inner product <ψ|ψ> is 25. So the normalized state is |ψ> = (1/5) [3i;4]. So when calculating <S_y>, it's <ψ| S_y |ψ> divided by <ψ|ψ>, which is 25.

So let me redo the calculation.

Compute <ψ| S_y |ψ> = (ħ/2) * <ψ| σ_y |ψ>.

But since |ψ> is (1/5) [3i;4], let's compute everything properly.

Wait, wait. Let me rephrase. The initial state is [3i,4]^T. So the norm squared is 25, so the normalized state is (1/5) [3i, 4]^T. So the actual state is |ψ> = [3i/5, 4/5]^T.

So when I compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ>, I have to use this normalized state.

So, let's recompute <ψ| σ_y |ψ> with the normalized state.

First, |ψ> is [3i/5, 4/5]^T. So <ψ| is [ -3i/5, 4/5 ].

Compute σ_y |ψ>:

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].

So σ_y |ψ> = [ (0)(3i/5) + (-i)(4/5), (i)(3i/5) + (0)(4/5) ]^T.

Compute each component:

First component: 0 + (-i)(4/5) = -4i/5.

Second component: (i)(3i/5) = (3 i²)/5 = 3*(-1)/5 = -3/5.

So σ_y |ψ> = [ -4i/5, -3/5 ]^T.

Now, compute <ψ| σ_y |ψ>:

<ψ| = [ -3i/5, 4/5 ]

Inner product: (-3i/5)(-4i/5) + (4/5)(-3/5).

Compute each term:

First term: (-3i/5)(-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = (12*(-1))/25 = -12/25.

Second term: (4/5)(-3/5) = -12/25.

So sum is (-12/25) + (-12/25) = (-24)/25.

So <σ_y> is -24/25.

But S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, so <S_y> is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24 ħ)/(50) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again because I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the first term in the inner product is (-3i/5) multiplied by (-4i/5). Let me compute that:

(-3i/5) * (-4i/5) = (12 i²)/(25) = 12*(-1)/25 = -12/25.

The second term is (4/5) multiplied by (-3/5) = (4*(-3))/(5*5) )= -12/25.

Adding them gives (-12/25) + (-12/25) = -24/25.

So σ_y expectation is -24/25.

Since S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y, the expectation is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) = (-24/25) * (ħ/2) = (-12 ħ)/25.

Looking at the options, option A is -12 ħ/25. So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check: I normalized the state correctly. The initial state's norm squared is (3i)(3i)^* + (4)(4)^*.

(3i)(-3i) = 9i² = -9*1? Wait wait, no. (3i) is the first component, and its conjugate is (-3i). So (3i)*(-3i) = 9 (i)(-i) = 9*( -i² )= 9*(1) =9. Because i*(-i)= -i²= 1.

Ah wait, no: wait, (3i)(-3i) = (3)(-3) (i)(i) )= (-9)(i^2 )= (-9)(-1) =9. So yes, the first term is 9, the second term is 16. So 9+16=25, so the norm is 25, so the state is [3i,4]^T /5.

Then, in the inner product, I correctly used the normalized vectors. So yes, the calculation seems correct.

So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25, which is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Normalization of the state**:  
   The norm squared of the state is \( \langle \psi | \psi \rangle = (3i)(-3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25 \).  
   Thus, the normalized state is \( | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{5} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \).

2. **Spin operator \( S_y \)**:  
   The spin operator \( S_y \) is related to the Pauli matrix \( \sigma_y \) as \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where  
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

3. **Compute \( \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)**:  
   Using \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \), we calculate  
   \[
   \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \frac{3i}{5} \\ \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{4i}{5} \\ -\frac{3}{5} \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle \)**:  
   The bra vector is \( \langle \psi | = \begin{pmatrix} -\frac{3i}{5} & \frac{4}{5} \end{pmatrix} \).  
   The inner product is  
   \[
   \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{5}\right).
   \]  
   - First term: \( \left(-\frac{3i}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{4i}{5}\right) = \frac{12i^2}{25} = \frac{-12}{25} \) (since \( i^2 = -1 \)).  
   - Second term: \( \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)\left(-\frac{3}{5}\right) = \frac{-12}{25} \).  
   Adding these gives \( \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{-12}{25} + \frac{-12}{25} = \frac{-24}{25} \).

5. **Expectation value of \( S_y \)**:  
   Since \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), the expectation value is  
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \langle \psi | \sigma_y | \psi \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = \frac{-12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final answer**:  
   Comparing with the options, the correct choice is **A**.

Answer: A
