Okay, so I have this problem about quantum mechanics, specifically involving operators and uncertainties. Hmm, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the standard deviation formula. The uncertainty ΔP_z is the square root of the expectation value of P_z squared minus the square of the expectation value of P_z. So, mathematically, ΔP_z = sqrt(⟨P_z²⟩ - ⟨P_z⟩²).

Wait, but to compute that, I need to find the expectation values of P_z and P_z squared. Since the state is given as a column vector, I can use that to compute these expectations.

The state vector provided is (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let me denote this as |ψ⟩. Also, the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which means the matrix for P_z is diagonal here, right? Because when the basis is the eigenbasis, the matrix representation is diagonal.

Looking at P_z's matrix: it's diagonal with entries ħ, 0, -ħ. So, the eigenstates are the basis vectors, and the diagonal elements are their corresponding eigenvalues.

But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, not P_z. So the state |ψ⟩ isn't an eigenstate of P_z, which means when we measure P_z, we can get any of the eigenvalues ħ, 0, or -ħ, depending on the projection.

So to find ⟨P_z⟩, I need to calculate the expectation value. The expectation value is ψ† P_z ψ. Let me write down the components.

The state vector is a column vector: ψ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T.

So ψ† is the row vector [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ].

Multiplying ψ† by P_z matrix: since P_z is diagonal, the product P_z ψ is just scaling each component.

Wait, wait. No, the multiplication is ψ† P_z. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps it
