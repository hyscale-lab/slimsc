Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Let me try to wrap my head around it.

Each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy E is given by -J times the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So the energy depends on the interactions between the spins. Hmm, I remember that the partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right?

Wait, each spin has two possible states, so for three spins, the total number of states is 2^3 = 8. But maybe some states have the same energy, so I can group them by their energies.

Let me list all possible states and calculate their energies. Each state is a combination of S1, S2, S3 being +1 or -1. Let's see:

1. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=+1
The product terms: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum is 3. So E = -J*(3) = -3J.

2. S1=+1, S2=+1, S3=-1
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E = J.

4. S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=-1
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1 = -1. E = J.

5. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=+1
S1S2=-1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1. Sum is -1-1+1 = -1. E = J.

6. S1=-1, S2=+1, S3=-1
S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1. E = J.

7. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=+1
S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=-1. Sum is 1-1-1 = -1. E = J.

8. S1=-1, S2=-1, S3=-1
All products are +1. Sum is 3. E = -3J.

Wait, let me double-check that. For state 3: S1=+1, S2=-1, S3=+1. So S1S2 is -1, S1S3 is +1, S2S3 is -1. Sum is (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1. Right.

So looking at all the states, how many have each energy?

The first state (all +1) has E=-3J. Similarly, the last state (all -1) also has E=-3J. So two states with E=-3J.

All the other six states have E= J. So six states with E=J each.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all microstates of exp(-βE). Wait, wait, I think I should check the formula. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-βE), with β = 1/(kT). So each state contributes exp(-βE_i) to the partition function.

So for E=-3J, the contribution is exp(-β*(-3J)) = exp(3βJ). And
