Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Hmm, the question is about a diatomic molecule made up of atoms X and Y. They give me the masses of X and Y as 20 amu and 2 amu, respectively. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency w is 4e14 rad/s. 

The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that should be absorbed so the molecule switches to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The options are A to D with different momentum values.

Wait, so what's the fundamental state in this context? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state. But I think in the rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized both for rotation and vibration. So the fundamental state is the state with the lowest rotational and vibrational quantum numbers. But I'm a bit fuzzy on how exactly the energy levels work here.

In the rigid rotor model, the rotational energy levels are given by something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. But since this is a non-rigid rotor, the bond length might change, but I'm not sure how that affects the calculation here. Maybe for this problem, we can treat it as a rigid rotor, since the question doesn't specify other factors.

Wait, but the problem also involves vibrational energy. Oh right, because it's the rotation-vibration model. So the molecule's energy includes both rotational and vibrational contributions. The fundamental state would be the v=0, J=0 state, perhaps. Or maybe the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0) or J=1? Hmm, wait, in the rigid rotor model, J can't be zero because that's the ground state. Wait, no, J=0 is allowed for rotation, but for a diatomic, the ground state is J=0, but I think the rotational partition function starts from J=0.

So the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. That would be v=0 (vibrational ground state) and J=0 (rotational ground state). But wait, when a photon is
