Okay, so I've got this question here about large clouds of neutral hydrogen and their detection using optical ground-based telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my cosmology, but let me try to think this through.

The question says that the clouds absorb light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. Lyman alpha is the series of transitions in hydrogen where the electron drops to the first energy level (n=1), right? So Lyman alpha emission is at around 121.6 nm, which is in the ultraviolet range.

But wait, the question is about absorption. So when a quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs at this wavelength. Since quasars are very bright and distant, their light is redshifted due to the expansion of the universe. The absorption line from the hydrogen cloud would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms because of the redshift.

Now, the problem is to find the lower limit on the redshift such that these clouds can be detected with optical telescopes. Optical telescopes, as I remember, typically observe in the visible spectrum, which is about 400-700 nm. So if the absorption line is shifted into the optical range, we can detect it with ground-based telescopes.

Let me get the formula right. The redshift z is given by (observed wavelength / rest wavelength) - 1. So, observed wavelength λ_obs = λ_rest
