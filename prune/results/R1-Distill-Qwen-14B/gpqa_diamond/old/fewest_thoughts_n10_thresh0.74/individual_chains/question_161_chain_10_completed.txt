Okay, so I've got this question about transmission electron microscopy and the mean free path of gas molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my vacuum physics, but let me try to think this through.

The setup is that Mike is using a high-resolution TEM with an accelerating voltage of 1000 kV. He's connected vacuum pumps to get an ultra-high vacuum, like less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to minimize gas molecules because in electron microscopy, these can scatter the electron beam, reducing image quality. So the lower the pressure, the fewer gas particles there are.

But even in that super vacuum, some gas particles remained, as detected by a mass spectrometer. Mike determined the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. In a vacuum, higher mean free path means fewer collisions because the pressure is lower.

Wait, so when the vacuum is really good (high mean free path), gas molecules don't collide much. But when Mike starts the electron beam, he notices the mean free path changes. It's now λ2, which is different from λ1, even though the temperature is the same.

I'm trying to remember what factors affect the mean free path. Oh right, the mean free path (λ) is given by λ = 1/(√2 n π d²), where n is the number density of the gas and d is the mean collision diameter. Alternatively, another formula I remember is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is temperature. So temperature affects λ as well.

But wait, in the problem, the temperature remained the same. So any change in λ must be due to a change in n, the number of gas molecules. Oh wait, but Mike achieved the ultra-high vacuum, so n should be very low. But when he turns on the electron beam, does that affect n?

Wait, the electron beam is high-energy. Maybe it's causing some outgassing of the sample or the chamber. Or perhaps the beam is ionizing the gas molecules, which could lead to changes in their behavior. Alternatively, the beam might be heating the sample or the chamber, but the question says the temperature is the same, so maybe that's not it.

Wait another angle: The mean free path is calculated based on the gas particles' behavior. When the electron beam is on, perhaps these electrons are interacting with the gas molecules. The electrons might be causing the gas molecules to move or change their distribution.

Wait, but how would that affect the mean free path? Let's think. The mean free path depends on the density of the gas. If the number density n increases, λ decreases because molecules collide more frequently. So if n increases when the beam is on, λ would decrease.

But why would n increase? Maybe the electron beam is causing more gas molecules to be in the vicinity. Or perhaps the beam is causing some molecules to desorb from surfaces, increasing n.

Wait, when the electron beam is off, the gas is just sitting there, at a very low pressure. But when the beam is on, maybe the high-energy electrons are causing more collisions, or perhaps exciting the gas molecules, making them move more, thus increasing the effective n. Or maybe the beam is causing the gas to be ionized, but ionized gas would behave differently, perhaps with different mean free paths.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam induces a current or some other effect that affects the pressure. Wait, but the pressure is already ultra-high vacuum. Maybe the beam is heating the gas molecules, increasing their velocity, which would normally increase the mean free path (since higher velocity would lead to more collisions if n is same, but wait, no—if velocity increases, the time between collisions decreases, so the mean free path is inversely proportional to the velocity. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, the mean free path equation: λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n). If T is the same, but n increases, λ decreases. So in the scenario, when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2. So if λ2 is less than λ1, that would mean n increased.

Why would n increase when the beam is on? Maybe the electron beam is causing more gas molecules to be in the path. Or perhaps the beam is causing some gas to be released from the sample or the chamber walls.

Wait, the initial setup was to create an ultra-high vacuum with pumps. But even in that state, some gas remains. When the electron beam is applied, perhaps the high-energy electrons cause gas molecules to be knocked off the surfaces or the sample. Wait, but that would increase the number of gas molecules in the compartment, thus increasing n and decreasing λ.

But wait, if that's the case, then λ2 would be less than λ1. Because when n increases, λ decreases.

But wait, earlier it was stated that λ1 was the mean free path under the vacuum conditions. So when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2. So if the beam causes n to increase, λ2 would be smaller.

So the question is, which option says λ2 is less than λ1? Let's look at the options.

Option C says λ2 < λ1. Option A says λ2 >=1.22 λ1. Option D is λ1 < λ2 <1.22 λ1.

So according to this reasoning, the correct conclusion would be that λ2 is less than λ1, which is option C.

But wait, what's another possibility. When the electron beam is on, does it ionize the gas molecules? If the gas becomes ionized, the mean free path could change because ionized particles might have different collision properties. For example, charged particles might interact more or less frequently. But in an ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already very long. If the gas is ionized, perhaps the mean free path would be shorter because ions can interact with the electric fields or other ions, causing more frequent collisions. Alternatively, in a high vacuum, the ions might have a longer mean free path because there's less to collide with.

Wait, but the presence of an electron beam would ionize some gas molecules. If the gas was originally neutral, and now becomes partially ionized, the mean free path could change. But I'm not sure about the exact effect. Let me think: ionized particles (ions) might have a different effective diameter, but in the mean free path equation, d is the collision diameter. If the gas is mostly neutral, but some ions are present, but since the number of ions would be low, perhaps the change in n is small, so λ wouldn't change much.

Alternatively, perhaps the ionized gas would have a different behavior. But in the initial setup, the mean free path λ1 is determined before the beam is on. When the beam is on, if the gas is ionized, the effective n (number density) might increase because the ions are charged and can influence each other more, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas is more likely to stick to the walls or the sample, thus removing them from the gas phase, which would lower the pressure and increase the mean free path. Wait, but that's confusing. If ions are sticking, the number of gas particles in the compartment would decrease, so n decreases, λ increases.

But that would mean λ2 is larger than λ1, which would not fit with option C. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, but the question says that in the initial state (ultra-high vacuum, before the beam is on), the mean free path is λ1. Then, when the beam is on, the mean free path is λ2. It's observed that λ2 is not equal to λ1.

So why would the mean free path change? The temperature is the same. So it's either because n changed, or perhaps because the gas became ionized, altering the collision diameter.

Wait, but what if the electron beam causes gas molecules to become charged, thus altering their effective diameter. For example, if a molecule becomes ionized, its collision diameter could change—maybe it becomes larger if the ion charge affects the size. If d increases, then λ would decrease, because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d increases, λ goes down. So in that case, λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

Alternatively, perhaps the collision diameter d remains about the same, but the number density n increases. So either way, λ2 would be less than λ1.

Another angle: The electron beam may cause the gas to heat up, but the question states the temperature remains the same, so that's not affecting it.

Wait, another possibility: the electron beam could cause the gas to expand, perhaps increasing the volume. But wait, the sample compartment has a fixed volume, so if the gas expands, the pressure would decrease. That would lead to lower n, increasing λ. But in the question, the observation is that the mean free path changes. Wait, but if the volume increases, but the number of gas molecules remains the same, then pressure would decrease, so n would decrease, leading to higher λ. But the sample compartment's volume doesn't change, so that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more mobile, so their effective speed increases. Since λ depends on velocity, maybe the mean free path increases. Because the formula for λ involves temperature, which is the same, but if the speed increases due to some other factor, perhaps λ increases. But wait, the formula is λ = (k*T)/(√2 π d² n). So if T is same, and n is same, then λ is same. But velocity affects the collision rate, but in the formula, λ is based on the average distance between collisions, which depends on velocity and n.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the electron beam introduces another factor into the calculation of the mean free path. For example, the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to lose or gain electrons, affecting their cross-section for collisions. So if the effective cross-section (d) increases, then λ decreases.

Alternatively, the gas could become polarized in the presence of the beam, leading to more frequent collisions. But I'm not certain about this.

Wait, the initial setup—ultra-high vacuum—has a very low n. So λ1 is very large. When the beam is on, perhaps some of the gas molecules are being ionized, making them more likely to interact with each other or the beam, thus increasing the collision rate. So this would reduce λ, making λ2 smaller than λ1.

So according to this reasoning, λ2 is less than λ1, which is option C.


The question revolves around the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in an ultra-high vacuum (<10^-9 Torr) in a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM). Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ1 under vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2, despite the temperature remaining constant. The task is to determine the relationship between λ2 and λ1.

The mean free path, λ, is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{kT}{\sqrt{2} \pi n d^2}
\]

where \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, \(T\) is the temperature, \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, and \(d\) is the mean collision diameter. Since the temperature \(T\) is constant, any change in λ must arise from changes in \(n\) or \(d\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State (λ1):** In the ultra-high vacuum, the number density \(n\) is very low, resulting in a large mean free path λ1. This is consistent with the low pressure and sparse gas molecules.

2. **State with Electron Beam (λ2):** When the electron beam is turned on, several effects could occur:
   - **Increase in \(n\):** The electron beam may cause gas molecules to desorb from surfaces or walls, increasing the number density \(n\). This would reduce the mean free path, making λ2 smaller than λ1.
   - **Ionization of Gas Molecules:** The beam could ionize gas molecules, altering their collision properties. For example, ionized molecules might have a larger effective collision diameter \(d\), which would also reduce λ2.
   - **No Significant Change in \(T\):** The temperature remains constant, so it does not contribute to the observed change in λ.

3. **Conclusion:** The observed change in the mean free path (λ2 ≠ λ1) is most likely due to an increase in \(n\) or an increase in \(d\), both of which would result in λ2 being smaller than λ1.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\(λ2 \geq 1.22λ1\)):** This implies λ2 is significantly larger than λ1, which is inconsistent with the reasoning that λ2 decreases due to increased \(n\) or \(d\).
- **Option B (\(λ2 = λ1\)):** This suggests no change in the mean free path, which contradicts the problem statement.
- **Option C (\(λ2 < λ1\)):** This aligns with the reasoning that λ2 decreases due to increased \(n\) or \(d\) when the electron beam is applied.
- **Option D (\(λ1 < λ2 < 1.22λ1\)):** This implies λ2 is larger than λ1 but less than 1.22λ1, which is inconsistent with the expected decrease in λ2.

### Final Answer:
The correct conclusion is that λ2 is less than λ1, making **Option C** the correct choice.
