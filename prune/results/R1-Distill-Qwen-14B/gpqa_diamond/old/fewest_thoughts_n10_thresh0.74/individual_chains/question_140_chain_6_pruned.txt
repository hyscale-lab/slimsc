Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's read the question again and see what clues I can gather.

The question is about a substance X reacting with liquid Y. The reaction is violent and releases a gas W. The molecule of W has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then a precipitate G forms, which when heated releases B. The melting point of B is near 277 K, which I think is around 4 degrees Celsius because 273 K is 0°C, so 277 K is about 4°C. So B must be a solid at that temperature or just starting to melt.

Substance X is known for incorporating a heavier isotope of one of its elements. Hmm, isotopes are variants of elements with the same number of protons but different neutrons. So X has a heavier isotope, maybe like Cl-35 or something. Wait, the problem mentions that when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Oh, and X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, which makes me think of something like NaOH or maybe another strong base. Wait, but NaOH is sodium hydroxide. But wait, another thought: X is a heavier isotope in one element, and in the reaction with a keto acid (like a carboxylic acid), maybe it's a deprotonation reaction. So if X is a base, like NaOH, but with a heavier isotope. Wait, but Na is usually the light isotope, but perhaps it's something else.

Wait, let's think about the reaction with Y. It says that X reacts violently with Y, releasing gas W. What's a violent reaction? Maybe something like a metal reacting with an acid? Or a strong base reacting with something else. Let's think, if X is a metal, maybe reacting with an acid Y to produce hydrogen gas (H2), but W's molecule has same neutrons and protons. Wait, hydrogen has 1 proton and 0 neutrons (as H1), but maybe another isotope? No, because another isotope would have same protons, different neutrons. Wait, but if the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons, what's that? Let me think: for example, if W is H2O, but wait, H2O has 2 H (each with 1 p, 0 n) and O has 8 p and 8 n. So total protons in the molecule: 2 +8=10. Neutrons: 0 (from H) +8=8. Not equal. So that's not it.

Wait, maybe the gas is something else. Let's think of gases that have the same number of protons and neutrons in their molecule. Oh! Maybe CO2? No, wait. Wait, wait, another approach: the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's think about elements where the number of neutrons equals the number of protons. For example, Carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. So if the gas is CO2, each molecule would have... Well, each CO2 molecule has 2 C and
