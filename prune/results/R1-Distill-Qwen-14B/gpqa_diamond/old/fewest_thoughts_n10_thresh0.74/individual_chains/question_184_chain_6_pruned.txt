Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound starting from benzene. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, wait, let me visualize that structure.

So benzene ring with substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. Position 1 has an ethoxy group (OEt), position 2 has a tert-butyl group, and position 3 has a nitro group (NO2). The numbering is probably such that the substituents are in the 1,2,3 positions.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to find the correct order.

First, benzene is the starting material. The substituents I need to add are: tert-butyl, ethoxy, and nitro groups. The key here is the order in which these are introduced because each substitution can influence the others, especially in electrophilic substitution.

Let me think about each substituent. The tert-butyl group is an activating, bulky substituent. It's a strong activating group because it's a strong electron-donating alkyl group. The nitro group is deactivating and meta-directing. The ethoxy group is activating (since it's an ether), ortho/para-directing.

But wait, the positions matter. The target has substituents in 1,2,3 positions. So benzene is a six-membered ring. Let's imagine the numbering: position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So the substituents are adjacent to each other. That's a meta arrangement for the nitro, but wait.

Wait, if the substituents are at positions 1,2,3, that makes them in a row. So, for example, substituent A is at position 1, B at 2, and C at 3. So each is adjacent in the ring.

But in electrophilic substitution, each new group's position depends on the directing effects of the existing substituents. So the order of adding groups is crucial.

I think the order should be such that each new substituent is added in a way that allows for the correct positioning relative to the others.

Let me outline the substituents in the target:

- Ethoxy (OEt) at position 1
- tert-Butyl at position 2
- Nitro (NO2) at position 3

Wait, but if I start with benzene, and first add one substituent, then the next, and so on.

But wait, the problem is that adding substituents affects the positions where other substituents will go. So the order of adding the substituents will determine where each goes.

Maybe it's better to plan the steps:

1. First substitution: add tert-butyl group. Since it's a strong activating group, it will direct incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions.

So, the first step would be Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride using AlCl3 as
