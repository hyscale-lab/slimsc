Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle annihilation. Let me try to figure it out. Hmm. The question is about the annihilation process where a proton and an antiproton collide to produce two particles, A+ and A-. The given equation is p + pbar → 2A+ + 2A-. Wait, no, wait. Oh, right, the equation says 2A+ and 2A-, so four particles in total. 

The problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so I guess that means its velocity is low compared to the speed of light. Wait, 'slowly'—so perhaps I can consider that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. Or maybe in the lab frame, the proton is stationary and the antiproton is moving? Wait, no, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. So, the setup is that in the lab frame, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low velocity. Or maybe the other way around? Hmm, I should be careful. 

But the main question is about the velocity of particle A. The mass of A is given as mA c squared equals 300 MeV. So, each A is 300 MeV/c². The options are all velocities in terms of the speed of light, so I need to find v_A in terms of c.

Wait, the process is annihilation, so the initial particles (proton and antiproton) are converting into these A particles. But wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So the proton's rest mass is about 938 MeV/c², from what I remember. The antiproton has the same mass as the proton. So each of them has rest energy 938 MeV, so combined, 1876 MeV.

But the products are four particles, each of 300 MeV. So, 4 * 300 is 1200 MeV. Wait, that's less than the initial energy. Wait, but that can't be right because in annihilation, energy and momentum must be conserved. Oh, but wait, maybe the initial particles are moving, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly. So probably, the total energy in the initial state is the sum of their rest energies plus kinetic energies.

Wait, but the question says the antiproton is slowly moving, so perhaps we can approximate its kinetic energy as much smaller than its rest mass. So, maybe the initial energy is approximately 2 * 938 MeV (since the proton is at rest and the antiproton has a low velocity, so its kinetic energy is negligible). But wait, the rest energy of the proton is 938 MeV, so initial rest energy is 938 (proton) + 938 (antiproton) = 1876 MeV. But the products are 4 * 300 = 1200, which is less than 1876. That doesn't add up. Wait, that's a problem because energy must be conserved. So maybe the initial particles are not both at rest, but the antiproton is moving, so the total energy is higher.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me think step by step.

First, in the annihilation process, the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton. Let's denote their rest mass as m_p = m_{pbar} = m. So, m = 938 MeV/c². The mass of A is mA = 300 MeV/c².

The reaction is p + pbar → 2 A+ + 2 A-.

Wait, four particles in total. So 2 A+ and 2 A-.

Now, the initial rest energy is 2 * m_p c² = 1876 MeV. But the final rest energy is 4 * m_A c² = 1200 MeV. So that's less than 1876. But energy must be conserved, so where's the discrepancy?

Ah! Because in the initial state, the antiproton is moving, so the initial total energy is higher than 1876 MeV. So the kinetic energy of the incoming antiproton contributes to the total energy. So, the initial total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy (since it's at rest) plus the total energy of the moving antiproton.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so velocity v is small compared to c. So, in that case, perhaps we can approximate the total energy as just the sum of their rest energies plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass energy.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's better to work in the center of mass frame. Because in annihilation, the products are usually produced in the center of mass frame, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. So, perhaps we can model this using energy and momentum conservation.

Let me set up the variables:

In the lab frame, let's assume the proton is at rest, so its momentum is zero. The antiproton is moving with velocity v (but it's stated to be slow, so v << c). Let's denote the velocity of the antiproton as v_p (but since it's an antiproton, maybe better to use u for its velocity).

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's said that the antiproton is slowly moving. So, perhaps the initial setup is that the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with a low speed. So, the initial momentum is all from the antiproton.

So the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma * m_p c², where gamma is the Lorentz factor for the antiproton's velocity. Similarly, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma * m_p * v_p, since the proton is at rest and contributes nothing to momentum.

In the final state, we have four particles: 2 A+ and 2 A-. Let's assume they are all moving in the same direction for simplicity, but in reality, they might be moving in different directions. Alternatively, perhaps they are moving symmetrically, such that the total momentum is zero. Wait, but that's only possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it's not in this case.

Wait, perhaps in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, so the products would have symmetric momenta. But since in the lab frame, the initial proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving, the lab frame is not the center of mass frame.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote:

- The initial proton is at rest, so E_p = m_p c², p_p = 0.
- The antiproton is moving with velocity v, so E_pbar = gamma * m_p c², p_pbar = gamma m_p v.

So, total initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².
Total initial momentum p_initial = gamma m_p v.

In the final state, we have four particles: 2 A+ and 2 A-.

Assuming the products move in such a way that their momenta add up to the same as the initial momentum. But without knowing the directions, it's hard. Perhaps we can make an assumption that the A particles are all moving in the same direction as the initial antiproton, but that's probably not the case. Alternatively, maybe the products are moving symmetrically, making the total momentum equal to the initial momentum.

Wait, but the products are four particles. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as each A particle having the same velocity, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps in the center of mass frame, the products move symmetrically. But since this is the lab frame, maybe the particles have some symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric in the sense that the 2 A+ and 2 A- are produced and symmetrically arranged with the same speed but opposite directions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed, but that may not hold.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the velocity of particle A. So, perhaps all four A particles have the same speed. But that's a big assumption. Let me think: in the reaction, maybe the four particles are produced with some symmetry. Perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) have opposite momenta, but since there are two pairs, the total momentum would be zero. But that would require that the initial momentum is zero, which it's not. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A particles are all moving in the same direction, each with the same speed. But that would require that their momentum adds up to the initial momentum. Let's try to model that.

Let me denote each A has mass m_A c² = 300 MeV. So, m_A = 300 MeV/c².

Each A has energy E_A and momentum p_A. Since all four are moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 p_A. But wait, that seems unlikely because the initial momentum is just the antiproton's momentum, which is gamma m_p v. So maybe each A has the same momentum, but perhaps not the same speed. Alternatively, maybe each A has the same speed, so their momenta would be gamma_A m_A v_A, but that would accumulate.

Alternatively, perhaps the four particles are produced in pairs. For example, each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, but it's unclear.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the details. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Another approach: Since the process is p + pbar → 2A+ + 2A-, perhaps it's better to consider the center of mass frame. Because in the center of mass frame, the total initial momentum is zero, so the final particles would also have zero total momentum. Which would imply that the products are emitted symmetrically.

Wait, but that's only true if the reaction occurs in the center of mass frame. So, if the initial particles (proton and antiproton) are moving towards each other, their center of mass frame would have zero total momentum. But in the lab frame, perhaps only the antiproton is moving, and the proton is at rest. So, the lab frame is not the center of mass frame.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the center of mass frame. Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial particles are at rest relative to each other, but that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the majority of the energy comes from the rest mass of the proton and antiproton, and the kinetic energy is negligible. But given that the rest mass energy is 1876 MeV, but the products have rest mass 1200 MeV, there's a deficit. So, perhaps the kinetic energies of the products make up that difference.

But this seems too vague. Maybe I should think about conservation of four-momentum. The four-momentum before the collision must equal the four-momentum after.

The four-momentum is (E_total/c, p_total).

Before the collision:

E_initial = E_p + E_pbar = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

p_initial = p_pbar = γ m_p v_p.

After the collision:

E_final = 4 E_A (assuming each A has energy E_A because they all have the same speed, maybe? Probably not, but let's proceed.)

p_final = 4 p_A cosθ, but since we don't know the angles, this becomes complicated.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the process is symmetric, so each A particle has the same speed. So, each A has the same energy and momentum.

Wait, but with four particles, it's a bit complicated. Maybe the products are moving in pairs, each pair moving in opposite directions. But that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that all four particles are moving in the same direction with the same speed. But that would make the total momentum four times the momentum of one particle.

But maybe a better approach is to consider that the kinetic energy is negligible, but wait, the initial problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so its velocity is small, which implies that its kinetic energy is small compared to its rest mass.

So, initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + m_p c² + K_pbar, where K_pbar is the kinetic energy of the antiproton. Since it's moving slowly, K_pbar << m_p c², so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

The rest mass energy of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV, so the total rest mass is less than the initial rest mass. That suggests that the products have a significant amount of kinetic energy, which must be provided by the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton and the proton's rest energy.

Wait, but the proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton has energy m_p c² plus a small kinetic energy. So, the total initial energy is about 2 m_p c² plus a small K. Since the products have rest mass 1200 MeV, which is about 1.2 * 1000, and 2 m_p is about 1.876 * 1000 MeV, so the initial energy is around 1.876 GeV, and the rest energy of the products is 1.2 GeV. So, the products must have 0.676 GeV of kinetic energy in total.

But how does this help me find the velocity of each A?

Alternatively, maybe I can model this using the conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote:

In the lab frame, proton is at rest, so E_p = m_p c², p_p = 0.

Antiproton is moving with velocity v, so E_pbar = γ m_p c², p_pbar = γ m_p v.

So, initial total energy E_initial = m_p c² + γ m_p c².

Initial momentum p_initial = γ m_p v.

After the collision, four A particles are produced. Let me assume that each A has the same velocity v_A, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the A particles are moving in opposite directions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the system is symmetric, and the total momentum after the collision is same as before, so p_initial = sum of momenta of A particles.

But with four particles, it's complicated. Maybe it's easier to consider that the A particles are moving in pairs. For example, two A+ and two A- might each be moving in opposite directions, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the problem is symmetric, so the total momentum of the A particles is zero? That can't be because the initial momentum is not zero. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps all four A particles are moving in the same direction, so their momenta add up. Then, the total momentum after collision is 4 * gamma_A m_A v_A.

But then, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

And the total energy after is 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, the energy conservation equation is:

m_p c² + gamma m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

So, let's write that as:

(1 + gamma) m_p c² = 4 gamma_A m_A c².

Divide both sides by c²:

(1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Now, the momentum equation is:

gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So, two equations:

1) (1 + gamma) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

2) gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Hmm, but I have two equations and three variables: gamma, gamma_A, v_A, and v.

Wait, but perhaps I can express gamma_A and v_A in terms of the other variables.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate gamma and v.

Because gamma is the Lorentz factor:

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v << c, so gamma ≈ 1 + (1/2) v²/c².

Wait, but that's an approximation. Let me see.

If v is small compared to c, then v^2/c^2 is small, so gamma ≈ 1 + (v^2)/(2 c^2).

Hmm, but maybe for the sake of simplification, I can approximate gamma ≈ 1, since v is small.

Wait, but if I make that approximation, then equation 1 becomes (1 + 1) m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

So, 2 m_p = 4 gamma_A m_A.

Thus, gamma_A = (2 m_p) / (4 m_A) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A).

But m_p is 938 MeV/c², m_A is 300 MeV/c².

So, gamma_A = (938)/(2*300) = 938 / 600 ≈ 1.5633.

Wait, but if gamma_A is about 1.5633, that's not that high. So, the velocity v_A can be found using gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A/c)^2).

So, solving for v_A:

gamma_A^2 = 1 / (1 - (v_A/c)^2 )

gamma_A^2 (1 - (v_A/c)^2 ) = 1.

gamma_A^2 - gamma_A^2 (v_A/c)^2 = 1.

Rearranging:

gamma_A^2 (v_A/c)^2 = gamma_A^2 - 1.

(v_A/c)^2 = (gamma_A^2 - 1)/gamma_A^2.

= 1 - 1/(gamma_A^2).

So,

v_A/c = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_A^2)).

Substituting gamma_A = 1.5633:

1/(gamma_A^2) = 1/( (1.5633)^2 ) ≈ 1/(2.444) ≈ 0.409.

So,

v_A/c ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.409 ) = sqrt(0.591) ≈ 0.769c.

Wait, that's approximately 0.77c. Looking at the options, option A is 0.77c.

Wait, but I made the assumption that gamma ≈ 1 for the antiproton. But the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v is small, so my approximation might be valid.

Wait, but let me check if this makes sense. Because if v is small, the initial energy E_initial is approximately 2 m_p c², and the final rest mass is 4 m_A c². So, 2 m_p is about 1.876 GeV, and 4 m_A is 1.2 GeV. So, the products must have a kinetic energy of about 0.676 GeV. That would imply that each A has a gamma factor about (1.876 / 1.2) = 1.563, which is what I found.

But wait, let me re-express the equations without the approximation.

Wait, equation 1 is (1 + gamma) m_p c^2 = 4 gamma_A m_A c^2.

Equation 2 is gamma m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

From equation 1, gamma = (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1.

Substituting into equation 2:

( (4 gamma_A m_A / m_p ) - 1 ) * m_p v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Simplify:

(4 gamma_A m_A - m_p ) * v = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

Hmm. But I'm not sure if this approach will lead me anywhere without knowing gamma_A or v.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express v_A in terms of gamma_A, and then find the relationship.

Wait, perhaps I can write v_A = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A^2)).

But without knowing gamma_A, I can't proceed numerically.

Alternative approach: Maybe consider that all the kinetic energy comes from the initial antiproton, and the proton is at rest. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The initial rest mass energy is 2 m_p c^2 = 1876 MeV, and the final rest mass energy is 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 MeV. So, the total energy after the collision (including kinetic) must be 1876 MeV plus the kinetic energy of the antiproton. But since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps its kinetic energy is small compared to m_p c^2.

Wait, but if the antiproton is moving with velocity v, its kinetic energy is (gamma -1) m_p c^2. So, if v is small, then gamma is close to 1, so K ≈ (v^2/(2c^2)) m_p c².

But I'm not sure how much that contributes. Maybe let's assume that the initial kinetic energy is small, so the total initial energy is approximately 2 m_p c^2 + K, where K is small compared to m_p c^2.

Wait, but the final rest energy is 1200 MeV, which is less than 1876 MeV, so the products must have kinetic energy. The difference between initial and final rest mass is about 676 MeV, so perhaps the kinetic energy is about 676 MeV, which must be provided by the initial kinetic energy of the antiproton plus any other contributions.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with the earlier approach where I approximated gamma as 1 for the antiproton.

So, our earlier calculation gave v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is option A. But let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 0.77c
B) 0.96c
C) 0.91c
D) 0.86c

So, 0.77c is option A.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Maybe I should think about another approach.

Another approach: Since the initial particles are a proton and an antiproton, their combined rest mass is 2 m_p c^2. The final particles have a combined rest mass of 4 m_A c^2.

So, the available energy is the sum of the rest energies plus any kinetic energy. But in this problem, the antiproton's velocity is low, so perhaps the initial kinetic energy is negligible. So, the available energy is about 2 m_p c^2, which is 1876 MeV. The products have a rest mass of 1200 MeV, so the kinetic energy is 676 MeV.

But how does this split among the four particles? Each would have about 169 MeV of kinetic energy, perhaps. But I'm not sure how that translates to velocity.

Wait, maybe I can model each A as having energy E_A = m_A c^2 + K_A, where K_A is the kinetic energy per A.

But the total kinetic energy is 676 MeV, so four particles would have 676 MeV, so each has 169 MeV of kinetic energy.

So, E_A = m_A c^2 + K_A = 300 MeV + 169 MeV = 469 MeV.

Then, gamma_A = E_A/(m_A c^2) = 469/300 ≈ 1.563.

Which brings us back to the same calculation as before.

So, gamma_A ≈ 1.563, which gives v_A ≈ 0.77c.

So, the answer would be option A.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation.

gamma_A = 1.563, so v_A/c = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_A^2)).

gamma_A^2 is about 2.443, so 1/gamma_A^2 is about 0.409.

1 - 0.409 = 0.591.

sqrt(0.591) is approximately 0.77c.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, the velocity of particle A is approximately 0.77c, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

**Reaction**:  
\[
p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-
\]

### Key Information:
1. The antiproton is moving slowly, implying its velocity \(v_{\bar{p}}\) is small compared to \(c\), and its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy.
2. The rest energy of the proton and antiproton is \(m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV}\), so their combined rest energy is:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial, rest}} = 2 m_p c^2 = 1876 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]
3. The rest energy of each particle \(A\) is \(m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV}\), so the total rest energy of the four \(A\) particles is:
   \[
   E_{\text{final, rest}} = 4 m_A c^2 = 1200 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Energy Conservation:
The total energy before and after the collision must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small, and the total initial energy is approximately:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} \approx E_{\text{initial, rest}} = 1876 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The total energy after the collision includes the rest energy of the \(A\) particles and their kinetic energy. Thus:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final, rest}} + E_{\text{final, kinetic}}.
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
1876 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV} + E_{\text{final, kinetic}}.
\]
This gives:
\[
E_{\text{final, kinetic}} = 676 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The kinetic energy is distributed among the four \(A\) particles, so each \(A\) particle has an average kinetic energy of:
\[
K_A = \frac{E_{\text{final, kinetic}}}{4} = \frac{676}{4} = 169 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Relating Energy to Velocity:
The total energy of each \(A\) particle is the sum of its rest energy and kinetic energy:
\[
E_A = m_A c^2 + K_A = 300 \, \text{MeV} + 169 \, \text{MeV} = 469 \, \text{MeV}.
\]
The Lorentz factor \(\gamma_A\) for each \(A\) particle is:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{E_A}{m_A c^2} = \frac{469}{300} \approx 1.563.
\]
The velocity \(v_A\) of each \(A\) particle is related to \(\gamma_A\) by:
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_A^2}{c^2}}}.
\]
Rearranging for \(v_A/c\):
\[
v_A/c = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2}}.
\]
Substituting \(\gamma_A \approx 1.563\):
\[
\gamma_A^2 \approx 2.444, \quad \frac{1}{\gamma_A^2} \approx 0.409, \quad v_A/c = \sqrt{1 - 0.409} = \sqrt{0.591} \approx 0.77.
\]

### Conclusion:
The velocity of each \(A\) particle is approximately \(0.77c\), which corresponds to **option A**.

**Answer: A**
