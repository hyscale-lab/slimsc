Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the planets are discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But I'm not sure if that has any bearing on the problem here, so maybe I can set that aside for now.

The problem gives me the ratios of equilibrium temperatures between the planets and the masses. Oh, and the albedo is the same for all three, which is 0.3. I need to find how much larger Planet3's orbital period is compared to Planet1.

Wait, equilibrium temperature... right. The equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star, its orbital period, and other factors like albedo. The formula I remember for equilibrium temperature is something like T = T_star * (L / (16πσ))^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / ( (1 + e)^(1/2) ) )^(1/4) * (1 / sqrt(a)) ), but wait, maybe that's more detailed than I need right now. Maybe I should think of it more simply.

Oh wait, another approach. The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period, but wait, no. Wait, the equilibrium temperature is related to the semi-major axis. Because the further out a planet is, the cooler it is. Since the planets have circular orbits, the semi-major axis is the same as the radius. 

The formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_sun * sqrt(R_sun/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Or perhaps another way: The equilibrium temperature scales with (Luminosity / (16πσ a² (1 - a))) )^(1/4). Since L and σ are constants for a given star, the temperature T is proportional to (1/(a (1 - a)) )^(1/4). But wait, the albedo is the same for all planets here, so (1 - a) is the same for all. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), because a is in the denominator under a square root. So T ∝ 1/√a.

Wait, that makes sense because if a planet is farther away, its temperature should be lower. So if Planet1's equilibrium temperature is T1 and Planet2's is T2, then T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Because T1 = (something) * 1/√a1 and T2 = same * 1/√a2. So T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So the ratio of temperatures is inverse square root of the semi-major axis ratio.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think in terms of ratios. Let me define T1 as Planet1's temperature, T2 as Planet2's. The given ratio is T1/T2 ≈ 1.4. So according to the formula, T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). So 1.4 = sqrt(a2/a1). Squaring both sides, (a2/a1) = (1.4)^2 ≈ 1.96. So a2 = 1.96 * a1.

Wait, but that's the ratio of a2 to a1. So Planet2's semi-major axis is about 1.96 times Planet1's. So a2 ≈ 1.96 a1.

Now, between Planet2 and Planet3, the temperature ratio is T2/T3 ≈ 2.3. So using the same logic: T2/T3 = sqrt(a3/a2). So 2.3 = sqrt(a3/a2). Squaring, a3/a2 = (2.3)^2 ≈ 5.29. So a3 = 5.29 * a2.

But a2 is 1.96 a1, so substituting: a3 = 5.29 * 1.96 a1. Let me compute 5.29 * 1.96. 5 * 2 is 10, but more accurately: 5.29 * 1.96.

Let me compute 5.29 * 2 = 10.58, minus 5.29 * 0.04 = 0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116 ≈ 10.3684. So a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

So the semi-major axis of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, the problem is to find the ratio of the orbital periods, Period3 / Period1. But Kepler's third law comes into play here. The law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis, assuming the same star. So P² ∝ a³. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

Wait, but wait, the mass of the planets also comes into play in Kepler's law. Oh wait, no, Kepler's third law in the context of a star and a planet (where the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star) is P² = (4π²/G M_star) a³. So the period depends on the mass of the star, not the mass of the planet. So the planetary masses won't affect the orbital period when using Kepler's law in this simplified form. So the given mass ratios are perhaps a red herring, or maybe they are used for something else, but in this specific question, maybe not.

So if the ratio a3/a1 is approximately 10.37, then the period ratio P3/P1 is (10.37)^(3/2).

Let me compute that. Let me think, 10^(3/2) is sqrt(10^3) = sqrt(1000) ≈ 31.62. But 10.37 is a bit more than 10, so the cube is about 10.37^3. Let me compute 10.37^3. 10^3 is 1000. 0.37^3 is about 0.05065. But wait, that's not the right approach. Alternatively, 10.37 * 10.37 = (10 + 0.37)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.37 + 0.37^2. 2*10*0.37 = 7.4, 0.37^2=0.1369, so 100 + 7.4 + 0.1369=107.5369. Then, multiply by another 10.37: 107.5369 * 10.37.

Let me approximate that. 107 * 10 = 1070. 107 * 0.37 ≈ 39.59. 0.5369 *10 =5.369, 0.5369 *0.37≈0.19865. So adding all, 1070 +39.59=1109.59; 5.369 +0.19865=5.56765. So total is approximately 1109.59 +5.56765≈ 1115.15765. So 10.37^3 ≈ 1115.16. The cube root of this is a3/a1 =10.37. Wait, no, P3/P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(1.5). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, Kepler's law is P² ∝ a³. So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.37)^(1.5).

Alternatively, 10.37^(3/2) = sqrt(10.37^3). So 10.37^3 is approximately 1115 (from earlier), so sqrt(1115) ≈ 33.4. Because 33^2 is 1089, 34^2=1156. 1115 is between them. Let me compute 33.4^2: 33^2 is 1089, 0.4^2 is 0.16, and 2 *33 *0.4=26.4. So 33.4^2 = 1089 +26.4 +0.16= 1115.56. Oh, that's almost exactly 1115.56, so sqrt(1115.16) is approximately 33.4.

So P3/P1 ≈33.4. So the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1.

But wait, the options are A) ~10.4, B) ~3.2, C) ~4.4, D) ~33.4. So option D is 33.4, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because it's easy to make a mistake in exponents.

So T1/T2 =1.4, so a2/a1 = (T1/T2)^(-2) = (1.4)^(-2) ? Wait no, let's go back.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in that part. Let me recheck the temperature relation.

Earlier, I thought T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1). Let me verify that formula. The equilibrium temperature is given by T = [(L (1 - a))/(16πσ a²)]^(1/4). So T is proportional to [ (1 - a) / a² ]^(1/4 ). Since albedo a is the same for all, (1 - a) is a constant, so T ∝ 1/a^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/√a.

So T1 / T2 = (√a2) / (√a1) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Given that T1/T2 =1.4, so sqrt(a2/a1) =1.4. Squaring both sides, a2/a1= (1.4)^2=1.96.

So a2=1.96 a1. Correct.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3. So sqrt(a3/a2)=2.3. Squaring, a3/a2=5.29 → a3=5.29 a2.

So a3=5.29 *1.96 a1=10.3684 a1.

So a3/a1=10.3684. Now, Kepler's third law says P² ∝ a³, so P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2).

So (10.3684)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(1.5). Let me compute this.

Compute 10.3684^(1.5) = sqrt(10.3684^3). So let's compute 10.3684^3.

10.3684 *10.3684 = approximately 107.537 (as before). Then 107.537 *10.3684 ≈ let me compute 107 *10=1070, 107*0.3684≈107*0.3=32.1 +107*0.0684≈7.32 → 32.1+7.32=39.42. So 107*10.3684≈1070 +39.42=1109.42.

Plus, 0.537 *10.3684 ≈ 5.56. So total≈1109.42 +5.56=1114.98.

So 10.3684^3≈1114.98. So sqrt(1114.98)= approx 33.4, because 33.4^2=1115.56, which is close. So P3/P1 ≈33.4.

So the answer would be option D, ~33.4.

Wait, but the mass ratios given are 1.15 (Planet1/Planet2) and 1.35 (Planet2/Planet3). But I didn't use them in my calculations. Does that matter? The question is about the orbital period, which depends on the star's mass and the planet's semi-major axis. But if the star's mass is the same for all planets, then the periods depend only on a. So the masses of the planets don't affect the period in this model. So I think the mass ratios are extra info but not needed for this question.

So the conclusion is that the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1, so the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships provided and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its semi-major axis, given by:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating semi-major axes using temperature ratios
The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is given as \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \). Using the relationship \( T_1 / T_2 = \sqrt{a_2 / a_1} \), we find:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
\]

Thus, \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \).

Similarly, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \). Using \( T_2 / T_3 = \sqrt{a_3 / a_2} \), we find:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
\]

Thus, \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \).

### Step 2: Combining the semi-major axis ratios
Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 a_2 \), we get:

\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 a_1 = 10.3684 a_1
\]

Thus, \( a_3 / a_1 \approx 10.37 \).

### Step 3: Applying Kepler's third law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis:

\[
P^2 \propto a^3 \implies \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( a_3 / a_1 \approx 10.37 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]

First, compute \( 10.37^3 \):

\[
10.37^3 \approx 1115.16
\]

Then, take the square root:

\[
\sqrt{1115.16} \approx 33.4
\]

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times that of Planet1.

### Final Answer
The mass ratios provided are not relevant to the calculation of orbital periods, as the periods depend only on the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
