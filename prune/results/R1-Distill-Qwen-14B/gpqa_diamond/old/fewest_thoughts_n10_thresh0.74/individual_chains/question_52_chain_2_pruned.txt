Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, alright, let's see what the question is asking.

So, the problem is about a star with certain characteristics. The star has a radius of 1.5 solar radii and a mass of 1.1 solar masses. When its surface isn't covered by dark spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall photospheric effective temperature drops to 5500 K. 

The main part of the question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels—level 1 and level 2. They observed that this ratio decreases when the star has spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star doesn't have spots compared to when it does. 

Wait, so when the star has spots, the ratio is lower. So the factor would be the ratio when it's spotless divided by the ratio when it has spots. Let me think about the factors involved here.

The problem mentions that the transition between these levels corresponds to a wavelength of about 1448 Å. Also, the photosphere is in Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). So, in LTE, the distribution of atoms between energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation. 

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of populations of two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k*T) ). Here, E2 is higher than E1 because the transition is from a lower to higher level (since wavelength is involved, but I think the energy is E2 higher than E1). Wait, wait. The wavelength is about 1448 Å. So that's in the ultraviolet maybe? Or near UV? Let me think, 1448 Å is 0.1448 nm, which is in the UV range. 

Wait, but we're dealing with the transition between two energy levels. The energy difference ΔE between the two levels can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. H is Planck's constant, c is speed of light, λ is wavelength. 

But since the problem is about the ratio of populations, maybe I can work with the ratio of the Boltzmann factors when the temperature changes. Because the question is about the change in the ratio of Ti atoms in two levels when the star's Teff changes from 6000 K to 5500 K. 

Wait, but when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower, 5500 K. The problem says that when the star is spotless, the Teff is 6000 K. So in that case, the star emits more flux when spotless, but when spotted, 40% of the surface is cooler. But I think the effective temperature here is the overall photospheric temperature. So, the observed Teff would be the average of the spotted and unspotted areas. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Because the question is about the
