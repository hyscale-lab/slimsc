Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and the motion of its ejecta. Hmm, let's try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. So, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. And the question is, what distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait, I remember that when dealing with different reference frames, especially when there's relative motion, we might need to consider things like time dilation or length contraction from special relativity. But wait, I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Let me think.

In the problem statement, it says both are inertial frames. So, maybe the problem can be approached using the Galilean transformations or perhaps the Lorentz transformations. But wait, when velocities are a significant fraction of the speed of light, Galilean doesn't work. So since 60,000 km/s is way higher than typical speeds we deal with, I should check if it's a significant fraction of the speed of light.

Wait, the speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is about 20% of the speed of light. Oh, that's a considerable fraction. So relativistic effects might come into play here.

But let me check the problem again. It says "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame." So the time given is in the ejecta's frame. So I need to find the distance in the Galaxy's frame, given the time in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, I'm trying to recall the relationships. In special relativity, time intervals can dilate, and lengths can contract depending on the frame. But the question is about distance traveled, which is velocity multiplied by time. But the velocity here is the ejecta's velocity relative to the Galaxy. Or wait, no. Wait, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy
