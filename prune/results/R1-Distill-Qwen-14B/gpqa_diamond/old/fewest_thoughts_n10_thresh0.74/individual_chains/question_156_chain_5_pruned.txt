Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question involves reactions with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Oh right, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation of alkenes, right? So when you treat an alkene with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide.

The problem says that there are two reactions. Reaction 1 uses (E)-oct-4-ene, and reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Each is treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on HPLC columnsâ€”both standard (achiral) and chiral.

So I need to figure out what the HPLC chromatograms will show. The options are about the number of peaks in each type of column.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it adds an epoxide group across the double bond. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the two substituents on each end of the double bond (in this case, the two methyl groups, I think? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end? Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH2 CH3? No, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end, so structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 groups on either end of the double bond? Or perhaps more accurately, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between carbons 4 and 5. Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, octene is 8 carbons. So oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 but with the double bond between C4 and C5. So on either side of the double bond, each carbon is connected to two CH2 groups?

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the double bond is between C4 and C5, so each of those carbons has two CH2 groups attached.

Now, when mCPBA epoxidizes the double bond, it forms an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the epoxide depends on the starting alkene's geometry. For (E)-oct-4-
