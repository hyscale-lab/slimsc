Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question says that an electron is in the spin state (3i, 4). I need to find the expectation value of its spin along the y-direction, S_y. The options are given as A to D, with some fractions involving hbar.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, multiplied by the state vector again. So, mathematically, it's <S_y> = ψ† σ_y ψ.

Wait, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). So ψ is a two-component vector. Let me write that down. The state vector ψ is [3i, 4]^T.

The Pauli matrix σ_y is given as:
[ [0, -i],
  [i, 0] ]

Right, so to compute the expectation value, I should first compute ψ† σ_y, then multiply by ψ.

Wait, ψ† is the conjugate transpose. So ψ† would be [ -3 (because (3i)* is -3i?), wait no. Wait, (3i)* is -3i? Wait, no. Wait, the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait no, wait. Oh wait, 3i is a purely imaginary number. The complex conjugate of i is -i. So the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i, correct. So ψ† would be [-3i, 4], but wait, wait. Let me think again. The original ψ is [3i; 4]. So ψ is a column vector. So ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*]. Since 4 is real, 4* is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Wait, no. Wait, 3i is 3 multiplied by i. So the complex conjugate of 3i is -3i. Because (i)* = -i. So yes, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, I need to compute ψ† σ_y. So multiply the row vector [ -3i, 4 ] with the matrix σ_y which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]].
