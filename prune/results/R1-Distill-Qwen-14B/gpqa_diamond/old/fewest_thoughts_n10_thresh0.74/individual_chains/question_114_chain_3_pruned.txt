Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The first part of the reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second part involves 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacting with reagent B (which is H2O) to become 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. I need to choose the correct reagents A and B from the options given.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile, often used in nucleophilic substitution reactions. But wait, butan-2-one is a ketone. Oh right, ketones can undergo various reactions. Wait, when a ketone reacts with a cyanide ion, what happens? I think it's the formation of a cyanohydrin. Yeah, that's right. Cyanohydrins are formed when a ketone or aldehyde reacts with a cyanide ion in the presence of an acid catalyst. The mechanism probably involves the protonation of the carbonyl oxygen, making it more electrophilic, then the CN- attacks, leading to the formation of a new carbon-carbon bond.

So for the first reaction, the reagent A must be an acid catalyst. Looking at the options, reagent A is either H3O+ or NaHSO3. H3O+ is a strong acid, which could help protonate the carbonyl group. NaHSO3, though, is sodium bisulfite. Wait, but isn't that used in the formation of sulfites or maybe in the hydrolysis of certain compounds? Or maybe in the workup after a reaction? Hmm. Oh, wait, sometimes in the cyanohydrin formation, you need a weak acid or a strong acid. Alternatively, sometimes the reaction is done under basic conditions, but I think for cyanohydrin, the acid is necessary.

So the first step uses NaCN and an acid. Looking at the product, 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile, that's the cyanohydrin of butan-2-one. So the correct reagent A is an acid. So options A and B have H3O+ as A, while C and D have NaHSO3. So I think A must be either H3O+ or something else. Wait, what's the role of NaHSO3 here? Sodium bisulfite is a source of HSO3-, which can act as an acid. But I'm not sure if it's used as the catalyst for the cyanohydrin formation.

Wait, another thought: in the cyanohydrin formation, HCN is typically used, but in this case, NaCN is used. Maybe the reaction is under acidic conditions. So the first reagent should be an acid. So A would be H3O+ (option A or B) or maybe the acid comes from NaHSO3. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think. When you have NaCN and a ketone, you usually need an acid to protonate the carbonyl. So H3O+ (option A or B) would be the right choice for A.

So moving on to the second reaction. The reagent B is H2O, but the options say B is either HCl, CH3COOH, etc. So in the second reaction, the starting material is a nitrile (butanenitrile) with a hydroxyl group, and it's being converted into a carboxylic acid. Wait, how does a nitrile become a carboxylic acid?

Oh, I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical conditions are either in acidic or basic conditions. In acidic conditions, you might use H2O with HCl. Alternatively, under strong basic conditions, maybe with heat and a base like NaOH. But wait,
