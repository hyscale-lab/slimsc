Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and their densities. Hmm, I need to figure out which one has the highest density. Let me think through this step by step.

The question gives four options, a to d, each with different mass and radius or density information. The options are labeled A to D, which I think correspond to the choices a to d, but wait, no, looking again, the options are A to D, each of which says something like 'd', 'a', etc. So the options are the possible answers, each referring to one of the exoplanet descriptions a to d.

Wait, actually, the options are A, B, C, D, each corresponding to one of the four exoplanet choices a, b, c, d. So the possible correct answer is one of these letters.

The question is to find which exoplanet has the highest density. So I need to calculate the density for each option a to d and compare them.

Density is mass divided by volume. Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So for each option, I need to find its mass and radius, compute density, and see which is largest.

Let me go through each option.

Option a: An Earth-mass and Earth-radius planet.
So Earth's mass is about 5.97e24 kg, radius about 6.37e6 meters. But maybe I can think in terms of Earth's density relative to itself. The density formula is mass/volume. Earth's density is roughly 5.5 g/cm³. So option a has Earth's mass and radius, so its density is the same as Earth's.

Option b: A planet with 2 Earth masses and a density of approximately 5.5 g/cm³.
Wait, this is interesting. It says the planet's density is 5.5 g/cm³. So if I don't need to calculate it because it's given. So its density is 5.5, same as Earth. But wait, Earth's density is also 5.5, but this planet is twice Earth's mass but with same density. So its radius must be larger because volume depends on radius cubed. Since M = density * volume, if M doubles and density stays same, volume doubles. Volume scales as r³, so r would be cube root of 2 times Earth's radius. But since density is given, I don't need to calculate, just note that option b's
