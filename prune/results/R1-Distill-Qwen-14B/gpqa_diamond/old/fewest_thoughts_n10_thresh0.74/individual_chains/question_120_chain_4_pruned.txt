Okay, so I've got this question about stars and their distribution in the sky, and how the number of stars per unit range of parallax changes with parallax. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my astronomy, but let's think through this.

The question says stars are uniformly distributed, which I think means that their distribution is uniform in space, but since we're observing from Earth, the distribution as we see it might not be uniform in terms of parallax. Parallax is the apparent shift in a star's position relative to background stars when viewed from different points in Earth's orbit. I remember that parallax (plx) is inversely related to distance—so a smaller parallax means the star is farther away.

Wait, but how does this relate to the number of stars per unit parallax? The question is about how the number of stars changes with parallax. So if I think about a unit range of parallax, like from plx to plx + d, how many stars would I expect in that range?

Since stars are uniformly distributed in space, their actual density is the same everywhere. But when we observe, the number we see depends on how far we can see. Let's model this. Imagine a sphere with radius r (distance from Earth) and thickness dr. The volume of such a shell is 4πr² dr. So the number of stars in that shell is proportional to the volume, assuming uniform density. 

Now, parallax p is approximately equal to 1/r (in parsecs, I think). So r = 1/p. If I have a shell at radius r, the volume is 4π r² dr. To express this in terms of parallax, let's substitute r with 1/p. So dr would be the change in distance. But since r = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. Wait, because as p decreases, r increases. So when p increases, the shell is getting closer. Hmm, maybe I should express everything in terms of p.

The volume in terms of p would be 4π (1/p)^2 * (dr). But dr is related to dp. Let me see: dr = derivative of r with respect to p times dp. Since r = 1/p, dr = - (1/p²) dp. The negative sign indicates that as p increases, r decreases. But since we're considering a positive volume, maybe we can take the absolute value.

So, substituting dr: 4π (1/p²) * (1/(p²)) dp) ? Wait, wait. Let's correct that. The volume element in shell is 4π r² dr. r is 1/p, so r² is 1/p². dr is (dr/dp) dp. dr/dp is derivative of (1/p) with respect to p: that's -1/p². So dr = -(1/p²) dp. But the volume element is positive, so we take the absolute value, making it (1/p²) dp.

Wait, that's not right. Let me think again. The volume element is 4π r² dr. So substituting r = 1/p: 4π (1/p²) dr. But dr is related to dp, so we need to express dr in terms of dp. dr = (dr/dp) dp. dr/dp is -1/p², so dr = - (1/p²) dp. But since volume can't be negative, we take the positive value, so dr = (1/p²) dp, but with a negative sign indicating direction. So when p increases, r decreases, but the volume is positive.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of stars per unit parallax. The number of stars in a shell at distance r is proportional to the surface area of the sphere (since density is uniform) times the thickness dr. The surface area is 4π r². So the number of stars in shell dr is N = n * 4π r² dr, where n is the number density (stars per volume).

But we need this in terms of parallax p. Since p = 1/r (assuming r is in parsecs), r = 1/p
