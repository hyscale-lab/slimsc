Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. Let's read the question again and think through each part.

The question describes a series of reactions involving compounds A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. I need to figure out the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups: C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

First, let's break down each reaction step by step.

1. **Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.**
   - So, A + 8 B → C.
   - The product is bright red. Hmm, bright red in chemistry often makes me think of things like rubies (crystalline form of aluminum oxide) but in reactions, maybe something else. Alternatively, could it be a transition metal compound? Like perhaps a sulfide or oxide. Wait, bright red could also indicate something like sulfur dioxide, but that's more of a gas. Or maybe a nitrate or something else.

2. **Reaction 2: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.**
   - So, C + 2 D → E.
   - E is extremely hazardous. That makes me think of something like sarin gas, but more likely a common hazardous chemical. Alternatively, maybe something like phosgene? Or perhaps something else. Wait, but maybe it's a reaction that produces a toxic gas, but E is the product, so perhaps a compound like chlorine trifluoride? Or maybe something with high symmetry.

3. **Reaction 3: C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.**
   - So, C + H2O → A + F + G.
   - F is a strong acid (like HCl, H2SO4), G is a weak acid (like acetic acid). So, C might be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces a strong and a weak acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfide or carbonate that reacts with water to form corresponding acids.

4. **Reaction 4: D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.**
   - So D + B → H (1:1).
   - H is a solvent. Common
