Okay, so I've got this question about a diatomic molecule and the quantum rotation-vibration model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. I remember that the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? The molecule can absorb a photon and switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Wait, I think in such models, the energy levels are quantized and have specific transitions.

The molecule is made of atoms X and Y. The masses are given as Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu. The bond length R is 2 angstroms, and the angular frequency ω is 4e14 rad/s. The options are various momenta for the photon.

I need to find the momentum of the photon that causes the transition. Oh wait, photons have momentum, which is p = hν/c, but wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy and frequency.

Wait, but the molecule's transition involves both rotational and vibrational energy changes. Or is it the rotation-vibration model that combines both, so it's a non-rigid rotor? Hmm.

In the quantum rotation model, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a rotating molecule is something like E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. For a diatomic, B is ħ²/(2I), and I is the moment of inertia, which is μ R²
