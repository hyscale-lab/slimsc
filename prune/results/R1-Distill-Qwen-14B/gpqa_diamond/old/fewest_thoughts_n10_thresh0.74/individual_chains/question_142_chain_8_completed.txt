Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question about density matrices. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through. 

The question is about the geometrical position of a given density matrix in the qubits space. The options are various points in 3D space, like (1,1,0) or (0,0,1), etc. 

Wait, I remember that a density matrix represents the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. For pure states, the density matrix is a projector, like |ψ⟩⟨ψ|. But when it's a mixed state, it's a statistical mixture of pure states. 

The given density matrix is ρ = 1/2 (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Oh right, this looks like a completely mixed state for a single qubit. Because |0⟩ and |1⟩ are the computational basis states, and each has a weight of 1/2. 

Now, how does this translate into the Bloch sphere representation? The Bloch sphere is a way to represent qubit states geometrically. For a pure state |ψ⟩, the Bloch vector r is such that the density matrix can be written as (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices. 

But for a mixed state, it's a bit different. Wait, when the state is completely mixed, it's the maximally mixed state, which for a qubit would be (I)/2, because I is the identity matrix. Because I is a 2x2 matrix, so I/2 would have diagonal elements of 1/2 and off-diagonal zeros. 

Wait, let me check: the given ρ is (|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|)/2. Let's compute that. |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]], and |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix. Then multiplied by 1/2, so ρ is [[0.5, 0], [0, 0.5]]. 

And I remember that the maximally mixed state has this form, so its Bloch vector r must be zero. Because when r is zero, the density matrix is (I + 0·σ)/2 = I/2, which matches our ρ. 

So the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). 

Wait, but the question is about the geometrical position in qubits space. Oh, right, the Bloch sphere is embedded in 3D space, with the vector pointing from the origin to the point on the sphere. But for a maximally mixed state, the vector is at the origin. So the position is (0,0,0), which is option C. 

Other options don't make sense. Option B is (0,0,1), which is the north pole, representing the state |0⟩. Option D is (1,1,1), which doesn't lie on the Bloch sphere because the magnitude would be sqrt(3), but the Bloch vector has length <=1. So it's not possible. Option A is (1,1,0), which is outside the Bloch sphere too because its magnitude is sqrt(2), which is more than 1. 

So the correct answer should be option C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

This represents a maximally mixed state for a single qubit. To analyze its geometrical position in qubit space, we use the Bloch sphere representation. For a pure state, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) satisfies \( \rho = \frac{1}{2} (I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}) \), where \( \boldsymbol{\sigma} \) are the Pauli matrices. However, for a mixed state like this, the Bloch vector \( \mathbf{r} \) must be zero because the density matrix corresponds to \( \frac{I}{2} \), which is the maximally mixed state. 

The maximally mixed state has no net direction in the Bloch sphere, meaning its geometrical position is at the origin, corresponding to the point \( (0,0,0) \). 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** (\( (1,1,0) \)) and **Option D** (\( (1,1,1) \)) are invalid because their magnitudes exceed 1, which is not possible for a Bloch vector.
- **Option B** (\( (0,0,1) \)) corresponds to the pure state \( \left|0\right\rangle \), which is not the case here.
- **Option C** (\( (0,0,0) \)) correctly represents the origin, corresponding to the maximally mixed state.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
