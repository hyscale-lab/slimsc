Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and magnetic fields. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my quantum mechanics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says there's a spin 1/2 particle with a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh wait, Sz is the spin in the z-direction, right? So the magnetic moment mu is proportional to the spin component along z.

Initially, the magnetic field is pointing in the +Z direction, and the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with it. That probably means it's in an eigenstate of Sz, either spin-up or spin-down. But wait, the question doesn't specify the initial state, just that the moment is aligned with the field. So I guess it's in an eigenstate of Sz, maybe spin-up.

Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, and both have the same magnitude B. So the field changes direction from Z to Y. Because the change is sudden, the state of the particle doesn't change immediately. So the wavefunction remains the same, but the Hamiltonian changes.

Because the field was along Z before, the initial Hamiltonian was H_initial = -mu·B_initial, which would be proportional to Sz. Since B was in +Z, H_initial = -gamma S_z B (but wait, mu is gamma S_z, so H_initial would be -mu·B, so -gamma S_z B. But I might have to check the signs carefully, but maybe the sign doesn't matter for the frequency.)

After the field changes, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu·B, but now the magnetic field is along Y. So H_final = -gamma S_y B. Because the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S, so mu·B is gamma times the dot product of S and B. When B is along Y, that becomes gamma S_y B.

So the new Hamiltonian is proportional to S_y. Wait, but S_y is an operator, and the initial state is an eigenstate of S_z. So the state after the change is still in the same state, let's say |+z> or |−z>.

Now, the question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the particle's moment. So we're looking at the expectation value of Sz over time.

Hmm, when the state is
