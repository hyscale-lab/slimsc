Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Hmm, let me see what it's about. Oh right, it's about finding the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions. The components are 500 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid (CH3COOH), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)2). My task is to figure out the pH. 

Wait, I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So first, I think I need to calculate the moles of each acid and base involved. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by calculating the moles for each component. Moles are calculated as concentration (M) multiplied by volume (L). 

For CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L (since 500 mL is 0.5 L) = 0.05 moles. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so I can't ignore its dissociation, but maybe after neutralization, it'll form a buffer or something.

HCl: It's a strong acid, so it'll dissociate completely. 0.2 M * 0.4 L (400 mL) = 0.08 moles of H+ ions.

Ba(OH)2: Barium hydroxide is a strong base. Each formula unit gives 2 OH- ions. So first, moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Since each mole gives 2 OH-, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when mixing acid and base, the H+ and OH- will react. So I should find out which is in excess. Let's sum up the moles of H+ and OH-.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles. Plus the H+ from CH3COOH? Oh wait, wait. CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But in the presence of a strong acid like HCl, the HCl will provide a lot of H+ ions, so I think the CH3COOH might not contribute much H+ because it's a weak acid. Hmm, but maybe I should consider all the H+ sources. Alternatively, perhaps the HCl and Ba(OH)2 will neutralize each other first.

Let me think: when you mix an acid and a base, they neutralize each other. So let's combine the H+ and OH- from all sources.

Wait, but HCl is a strong acid, so it will donate H+ completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate OH- completely. So the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH and the OH- from Ba(OH)2 will react.

Wait no, wait. Wait, CH3COOH is a weak acid, so in solution, it contributes some H+ ions, but perhaps when mixed with a strong acid (HCl), the H+ from HCl is much higher, so the CH3COOH doesn't contribute as much. But maybe I should calculate all the H+ available.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to first figure out the total H+ and OH- in the solution before considering the neutralization.

Wait, but wait another thing: when you mix all these solutions, the total volume will be 500+400+300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L. But perhaps I should calculate the moles of each H+ and OH-.

Let me proceed step by step.

First, calculate the moles of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, and the moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Moles of H+ from HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 mol.

Moles of H+ from CH3COOH: Since it's a weak acid, it doesn't fully dissociate. The formula is CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-. The initial concentration is 0.1 M in 0.5 L, so 0.05 moles. But without knowing the Ka, it's tricky. Wait, but since HCl is a strong acid, which completely dissociates, the H+ from HCl will be much higher than that from acetic acid. So perhaps the contribution from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl. Alternatively, maybe the H+ from CH3COOH is minimal, but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the presence of a strong acid will change the dissociation of CH3COOH. However, since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate a lot of H+ ions, making the solution more acidic. So the CH3COOH might not dissociate much because the solution is already saturated with H+ ions. Alternatively, the HCl will completely dissociate, and the CH3COOH will dissociate a little, but perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl.

Similarly, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will donate 0.18 moles of OH-.

Wait, but when OH- and H+ meet, they neutralize each other. So total H+ is 0.08 (from HCl) plus whatever from CH3COOH. Let me assume that the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible, so total H+ = 0.08 moles. Total OH- = 0.18 moles.

So let's calculate the net H+ or OH- after neutralization.

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.08 (HCl) + x (from CH3COOH, which is small, perhaps 0.005 or something, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'll ignore it for now and see where that takes me.)

So, 0.08 H+ and 0.18 OH-.

The OH- is in excess: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining.

Wait, but that's only if the H+ comes from HCl. But what about the CH3COOH contributing some H+?

Alternatively, perhaps the H+ from CH3COOH is negligible compared to HCl, so I can proceed with that.

If that's the case, then after neutralization, we have 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 moles of OH- remaining in the solution.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think: when I mix all these solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L. So the molarity of the excess OH- would be 0.10 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0833 M.

Then, the pH would be calculated from the excess OH-.

So, pOH = -log(0.0833) ≈ 1.08. Then, pH = 14 - 1.08 ≈ 12.92. But wait, that's not one of the options. The closest is option A) 12.62. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in ignoring the H+ from CH3COOH. Let me try to include that.

Wait, the acetic acid is 0.05 mol in 0.5 L. Its Ka is about 1.8 × 10^-5 (I remember that from previous knowledge). So, to find the H+ it contributes, I can set up the dissociation equation.

CH3COOH ↔ H+ + CH3COO^-

Initial concentrations: [CH3COOH] = 0.1 M (since 0.05 mol / 0.5 L), and [H+] and [CH3COO^-] are zero.

Let x be the [H+] from CH3COOH.

So, Ka = x² / (0.1 - x) ≈ 1.8e-5.

Assuming x is small compared to 0.1, so 0.1 - x ≈ 0.1.

Thus, x² ≈ 1.8e-5 * 0.1 → x² = 1.8e-6 → x ≈ sqrt(1.8e-6) ≈ 1.34e-3 M.

So, H+ from CH3COOH is about 0.00134 M. In 0.5 L, moles = 0.00134 * 0.5 ≈ 0.00067 mol.

But wait, that's just the H+ from CH3COOH in its own solution. But when we mix all the solutions, the total volume is 1.2 L. So the concentration would be 0.00067 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.000556 M. So the H+ from CH3COOH is about 0.000556 M, which is 5.56e-4 M.

In comparison, the HCl contributes 0.08 mol in 1.2 L → 0.0667 M. So the H+ from HCl is way higher than that from CH3COOH. So perhaps the contribution from CH3COOH is indeed negligible. So I can proceed by considering only the H+ from HCl and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, total H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol, and OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.18 mol.

They react: 0.08 H+ + 0.18 OH- → 0.08 H2O, leaving 0.10 OH-.

So, 0.10 moles of OH- in 1.2 L → concentration is 0.10 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0833 M.

pOH is -log(0.0833) → Let's calculate that.

Log(0.0833) is log(8.33e-2) → log(8.33) is about 0.92, so 0.92 - 2 = -1.08.

So pOH is 1.08. pH is 14 - 1.08 = 12.92.

Hmm, but the options don't go up to 12.92. The closest is A) 12.62, but that's a bit off. What did I miss?

Wait, perhaps the neutralization isn't just between the H+ and OH- from HCl and Ba(OH)2. Because CH3COOH is a weak acid, when the OH- is added, it might neutralize some of the CH3COOH as well, producing CH3COO^- and water. So perhaps I should account for that.

Wait, let me think again. When you mix a strong acid (HCl) and a weak acid (CH3COOH) with a strong base (Ba(OH)2), the base will first neutralize the H+ from the strong acid, then neutralize the H+ from the weak acid.

So the steps would be:

1. H+ from HCl reacts with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

2. Any remaining OH- reacts with CH3COOH.

So, first, moles of H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

They neutralize each other:

H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, after this, H+ is 0.08 - 0.08 = 0 mol, OH- is 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol, but wait that's not correct. Wait, because the OH- is in excess. So after neutralizing the H+, 0.10 mol of OH- remains.

Now, this excess OH- will react with acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is a weak acid.

The reaction is: OH- + CH3COOH → CH3COO^- + H2O.

So, moles of OH- remaining: 0.10 mol.

Moles of CH3COOH: 0.05 mol.

So, OH- will neutralize some of the CH3COOH.

CH3COOH has 0.05 mol. OH- has 0.10 mol. So OH- will neutralize all the CH3COOH, converting it to CH3COO^-.

But wait, because CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, and OH- is 0.10 mol. So after neutralizing all of CH3COOH, there's 0.05 mol of OH- left.

So, the OH- after neutralizing HCl and CH3COOH is 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol.

So now, the total moles of OH- is 0.05 in a total volume of 1.2 L.

So, concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.0417 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0417) ≈ 1.38.

pH = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.

Ah, that's option A) 12.62.

Wait, that makes sense. Because after the OH- neutralizes the HCl's H+ (0.08 mol), there's 0.10 mol OH- left, which then neutralizes 0.05 mol CH3COOH. So the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol, leading to a higher pH than I previously calculated. So that's why the pH is 12.62.

So the correct answer should be option A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we first calculate the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ contributed by the given solutions:

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of H⁺} = 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol}.
   \]  
   \[
   \text{Moles of OH⁻} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Moles of H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, and its contribution of H⁺ is negligible compared to the strong acid HCl. Thus, we ignore it for this calculation.

Next, we neutralize the H⁺ and OH⁻:

- **Neutralization between H⁺ (from HCl) and OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂)**:  
  \[
  \text{Excess OH⁻} = 0.18 \, \text{mol} - 0.08 \, \text{mol} = 0.10 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

- **Neutralization of remaining OH⁻ with CH₃COOH**:  
  CH₃COOH has 0.05 mol in the solution. The remaining 0.10 mol of OH⁻ reacts with CH₃COOH:  
  \[
  \text{Excess OH⁻ after neutralizing CH₃COOH} = 0.10 \, \text{mol} - 0.05 \, \text{mol} = 0.05 \, \text{mol}.
  \]

Now, the total volume of the solution is:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]

The concentration of excess OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{Excess OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.0417 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.0417) \approx 1.38.
\]

Finally, the pH is:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

Thus, the pH of the solution is **12.62**.
