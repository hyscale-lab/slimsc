Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the diffraction pattern created by a polygonal aperture. Let me read the question carefully.

The problem states that the aperture is shaped like an N-sided polygon, and all the apothems are of the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is falling vertically on this aperture. In the far field, it creates intensity maxima and minima. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Also, we're told to use the small angle approximation where tanθ ≈ θ.

Hmm, I remember that when the number of sides N becomes very large, the polygon approaches a circle. So this must be a problem related to the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture. But wait, the apothem is given as 'a'. What's the apothem? Oh right, the apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of one of the sides. For a regular polygon, the apothem is related to the radius of the circumscribed circle. So as N becomes large, the polygon becomes a circle with a radius equal to the apothem 'a'?

Wait, no, wait. For a regular polygon with N sides, the apothem 'a' is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. The radius (the distance from the center to a vertex) is usually denoted by 'R'. So the relationship between apothem 'a' and radius 'R' is a = R * cos(π/N), because each side is like a triangle with angle 2π/N, and the apothem is the adjacent side in that right triangle. So when N is very large, π/N is very small, so cos(π/N) ≈ 1 - (π²)/(2N²). But for N approaching infinity, it's approximately 1. So in the limit as N becomes very large, the apothem 'a' approaches the radius 'R'. So in this case, the radius of the circular aperture would be approximately 'a'. Is that correct? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. For a regular polygon, if the apothem is 'a', then the radius R would be a / cos(π/N). So as N approaches infinity, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R ≈ a. So the circle's radius is 'a'. So yes, in the limit, the
