Okay, so I have this question about particle physics, specifically about the decay of a boson. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember that bosons can decay into fermion-antifermion pairs, right? The Lagrangian provided is for the interaction between the bosonic field X and fermions. 

The Lagrangian is given as L(y) = -λ_f f_bar ψ_f (y)(υ + X(y))ψ_f(y). Wait, maybe I should parse this more carefully. Oh, wait, perhaps the interaction term is something like λ times the fermion fields interacting with X. But the exact form isn't crucial here; what's important is the mass of the boson and the possible fermions it can decay into.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it must produce a pair of particles whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV. Because in particle physics, the decay products' rest masses must each be less than half the parent mass (since each would get some energy and momentum).

Wait, no. Actually, for a boson at rest, each fermion pair needs to have a combined energy/mass less than or equal to the boson's mass. Because the total energy of the decay products can't exceed the parent's mass. So, each pair of fermions must satisfy 2m_fermion ≤ m_X.

So m_X is 6 GeV. Let me list the masses of various fermions:

- Electron (e-): negligible, about 0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~1.5 MeV → 0.0015 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~3.3 MeV → 0.0033 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~95 MeV → 0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, around 173 GeV
