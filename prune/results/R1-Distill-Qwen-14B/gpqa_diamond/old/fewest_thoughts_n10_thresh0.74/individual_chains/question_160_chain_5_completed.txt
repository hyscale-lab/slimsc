Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about an aperture shaped like a regular N-sided polygon. All the apothems are the same length 'a'. Monochromatic light of wavelength λ is shining along the z-axis, and we're supposed to find the angular distance between the first two minima in the far field when N is infinitely large. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, let's start by recalling what I know. When light passes through an aperture, it diffracts and creates a pattern of intensity maxima and minima, known as the diffraction pattern. For a circular aperture, the first minima occur at an angle θ given by sinθ = λ/(πa), but wait, for a single slit, the minima are at a sinθ = λ. But wait, that's when the slit width is a single slit. But in this case, the aperture is a polygon, and when N approaches infinity, it's almost like a circular aperture, right?

Wait, no. Wait a second. If N is large, the polygon tends towards a circle. But wait, the problem is about a polygon, but when N is infinitely large, it's like a circle. Are we treating this as a circular aperture then?

Wait, but I'm being asked about the first two minima in the far field. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ = λ/(π a), I think. But wait, for a circular aperture, the formula is sinθ = λ/(π a), but for very small angles, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ λ/(π a). But wait, when N is very large, the shape is almost a circle, so the diffraction pattern would approximate that of a circular aperture.

But wait, another thought. Alternatively, the polygon could be approximating a rectangular aperture when N is infinite? No, a polygon with infinite sides is a circle. So perhaps we're to model it as a circular aperture.

Wait, but the problem says it's a regular N-gon, and all apothems are of length 'a'. The apothem is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. So, for a regular polygon, the apothem a is related to the side length or the radius (distance from center to a vertex).

Wait, but when N is very large, the polygon becomes a circle, with radius equal to the apothem a? Because for a regular polygon, as N approaches infinity, the apothem tends towards the radius of the circumscribed circle. Wait, no. Let me think: the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So for a regular polygon, the apothem a is the radius of the inscribed circle, and the radius R of the circumscribed circle is a * (something). For a regular polygon, R = a / cos(π/N). Because as N increases, cos(π/N) approaches 1, so R approaches a. So when N is very large, the apothem a is approximately equal to the radius R of the circumscribed circle. So in that case, the aperture would approximate a circle with radius a.

Wait, wait. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle of radius a. Therefore, the diffraction pattern would be similar to that of a circular aperture.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ = λ/(π a). Because the formula for the minima in single-slit diffraction (which is a single straight slit, not a circle) is a sinθ = mλ, where m is the order. For the first minimum, m=1, so sinθ = λ/a. But wait, that's for a single slit. For a circular aperture, the situation is a bit different because it's a 2D problem, but the first minimum is at θ = (λ)/(π a), right?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The single-slit diffraction formula is a sinθ = mλ for minima, where 'a' is the width of the slit. For the first minimum, m=1, so sinθ = λ/a. But that's a single slit, which is a rectangular aperture of width 'a' and infinite height.

But for a circular aperture, the situation is different because the diffraction pattern involves multiple interference. The minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction) for a circular aperture occur at specific angles. The first minimum (the first dark ring) is given by the condition sinθ = λ/(π a), where 'a' is the radius of the aperture. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the formula. Let me think about the derivation.

In the case of a circular aperture, the far-field diffraction pattern is found using the Bessel functions. The intensity minima occur when the argument of the Bessel function J1 reaches its zeros. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the zeros of the Bessel functions determine the minima. For the circular case, the minima occur when r * sinθ = (m * π * a), where m is an integer, but I might be mixing up the terms.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Since the problem says N is very large and we can approximate the polygon as a circle, perhaps the angular distance between the first two minima is the same as that for a circular aperture.

Wait, but for a circular aperture, the first minimum (dark ring) is at θ = λ/(π a), as I thought before. Wait, but wait—no, wait. Let me clarify: The minima for a circular aperture occur when the phase difference around the circumference is an odd multiple of π. The condition for the first minimum (the first dark ring) is that the path difference equals λ/2. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right way to think about it. Alternatively, in the Fraunhofer diffraction for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ = λ/(π a), which is the angle where the intensity drops to zero for the first time.

Wait, that would mean that the angle between two consecutive minima would be the same as the change between m=1 and m=2 zeros of the Bessel function. But wait, each minimum in the circular case is a ring, and the angular position is determined by the zeros of the Bessel function J1.

Wait, no, the first minima—wait, perhaps the first two minima are the same as the first and second zeros of the Bessel function. So let me recall: the zeros of J_m(x) occur at x_n,m, where n is the index of the zero and m is the order. For J_1(x), the first zero is at x ≈ 3.8317, the second at 7.0156, and so on.

Wait, but for the circular aperture, the minima in the diffraction pattern are given by the zeros of J_1(k a sinθ), where k is the wave number (2π/λ). So the condition is k a sinθ = x_n,1, where x_n,1 is the nth zero of J_1. For the first minimum, n=1, so x_1,1 ≈ 3.8317. So the condition is (2π/λ) a sinθ ≈ 3.8317. So sinθ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a).

But wait, since the angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ, so θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). Let me compute that: 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.610. So θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

Wait, but the question is asking for the angular distance between the first two minima. So the first minimum is at m=1 (x_1=3.8317), the second at m=2 (x_2=7.0156). The difference between the two angles would be (x_2 - x_1)/(2π a) * λ. So the angular separation Δθ = (7.0156 - 3.8317)/(2π a) * λ. Let me compute that.

7.0156 - 3.8317 ≈ 3.1839. So 3.1839/(2π) ≈ 3.1839/6.2832 ≈ 0.506. So Δθ ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

Hmm, that's one of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Option D is 0.506 λ/a. Option C is 1.220 λ/a. Hmm. So according to this, the answer would be D.

Wait, but I thought for a circular aperture, the first minimum is at θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a. So that would be about 0.610 λ/a for the first minimum. Then the second would be at 7.0156, which would be θ ≈ (7.0156 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (7.0156)/(6.2832) λ/a ≈ 1.116 λ/a. So the difference between the two is 1.116 λ/a - 0.610 λ/a ≈ 0.506 λ/a. That matches option D.

Wait, but wait another thought. The problem says the polygon is N-sided, and all apothems are length 'a'. So when N is very large, it's a regular polygon with a very high number of sides, which approximates a circle. But the apothem is the radius of the inscribed circle. So when N approaches infinity, the polygon becomes a circle with radius a. So in that case, the circular aperture's diffraction pattern applies.

But wait, in this case, the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is such that the first minima (the first dark ring) occurs at θ = λ/(π a), which is approximately 0.318 λ/a. Wait, no, because 1/π is about 0.318. But earlier calculation using the Bessel function gave me that the first minimum is at θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a. So now I'm confused. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. The condition for the minima in the circular aperture's far-field diffraction is that the Bessel function J_1(k a sinθ) is zero. So J_1(x) = 0, where x = k a sinθ = (2π/λ) a sinθ. The first zero of J_1 is at x ≈ 3.8317. So, (2π a / λ) sinθ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). So θ ≈ (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). 3.8317/(2π) ≈ 0.610. So θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a. But when the angles are small, sinθ ≈ θ, so that's correct.

Wait, but I have a conflicting thought. I thought that the first minimum for a circular aperture is at θ = λ/(π a), which would be twice as big as 0.610 λ/a. Because 1/(π) is approximately 0.318, so 0.318 λ/a is θ. Hmm, but that's not matching. So which is it?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the single-slit diffraction with the circular aperture. Let's think again. The single-slit formula is a sinθ = mλ, for minima. So for first minimum, sinθ = λ/a. But that's a single slit, which is a rectangular aperture. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is given by J_1(k a sinθ) = 0 → k a sinθ = x_1,1 = 3.8317. So sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a). So θ ≈ 3.8317/(2π) * λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

Wait, but some sources say that the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/a. Hmm, is that correct? Or am I mixing up the conditions.

Ah! Wait a second. Maybe I messed up the formula. Because sometimes the formula is given as a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ, but for the minima. No, wait, that's for something else. Alternatively, wait, maybe I'm confusing the condition for maxima and minima.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture (like a pinhole) in the far field can be thought of as the Fourier transform of the aperture. The intensity is given by the square of the Bessel function. The first minimum (the first dark ring) occurs at the first zero of J_1, which is at x ≈ 3.8317. So the condition is (2π a / λ) sinθ = 3.8317 → sinθ = (3.8317 λ) / (2π a). So θ = (3.8317/(2π)) * λ/a ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

But wait, I've read that the first minimum occurs at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. Maybe that's when considering a different approach or a different condition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me re-derive it. The condition for minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture occurs when the phase difference around the perimeter of the aperture leads to destructive interference.

The phase difference between two points on the perimeter of the aperture, separated by a path difference, is given by (2π/λ) * (Δr) sinθ. Wait, no, that's not exactly it. Alternatively, for a circular aperture, the wavelets from different points on the aperture interfere. The condition for a minimum is when the phase difference is an odd multiple of π.

Wait, perhaps another approach: The intensity in the far field is proportional to the square of the Bessel function J_0(k a sinθ), where k = 2π/λ. Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern involves the zeroth-order Bessel function J_0. Wait, no, I'm getting this mixed up. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, for a circular aperture, the Fraunhofer diffraction pattern is given by the zeroth-order Bessel function squared, but I'm not entirely confident. Wait, perhaps it's J_0(k a sinθ). Hmm, but I thought the condition for minima comes from the zeros of J_1, not J_0. Hmm, perhaps I should look this up, but since I can't, I'll have to think.

Wait, I found this conflicting information: The single-slit diffraction minima are given by a sinθ = mλ, where 'a' is the slit width. For a circular aperture, the minima are given by a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ, where 'a' is the radius. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, another source says the minima occur at a sinθ = (m + 0.5) λ, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the conditions.

Wait, I think I'm getting more confused. Let me approach it differently. Let's consider the problem again. The polygon becomes a circle as N approaches infinity. The apothem is 'a', which is the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side. For a circle, the apothem is the same as the radius. So the radius is 'a'. So the problem is effectively about a circular aperture of radius 'a'.

The question is about the angular separation between the first two minima. So for a circular aperture, the first minima are at θ1 = (x1 λ)/(2π a), where x1 is the first zero of J_1(x), which is approximately 3.8317. The second minimum is at x2 = 7.0156, so θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a). The difference is θ2 - θ1 = (7.0156 - 3.8317) λ/(2π a) ≈ (3.1839) λ/(6.2832 a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a. So the angular distance between the first two minima is 0.506 λ/a, which is option D.

But wait, another thought: when N is very large, the polygon's diffraction pattern approaches that of a circle, but perhaps the calculation is different because it's a polygon. Or maybe the problem is considering a different approach, such as using the single-slit formula.

Wait, the problem states that all apothems are the same. So each side of the polygon is equidistant from the center. So maybe the approach is to model the diffraction as a single slit with width equal to the side length of the polygon. But for a regular polygon, the side length 's' is related to the apothem 'a' by s = 2a tan(π/N). As N approaches infinity, tan(π/N) ≈ π/N, so s ≈ 2a (π/N) → 0 as N→infinity. So the side length approaches zero, which might complicate the model. Alternatively, perhaps the polygon is approximated as a circle, and the diffraction is treated that way.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to model the polygon as a series of slits. Alternatively, perhaps it's a single slit approximation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: For a polygon with a very large N, each side is very small, and the overall shape is circular. So the diffraction pattern would resemble that of a circle, with the first minima at θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a, and the second at θ ≈ 1.220 λ/a. Wait, that can't be right because that would make the separation 0.610, but I'm getting conflicting numbers.

Wait, no, perhaps the first minimum occurs at 1.22 λ/a, which is option C. But according to the earlier calculation from the Bessel function zeros, the first minimum is at 0.610 λ/a. So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the first minimum in the circular aperture occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/a. For example, I've heard that the central maximum is surrounded by minima at θ ≈ 1.22 λ/a. But wait, that's when the radius is a, so perhaps 1.22 λ/(π a) ?

Wait, let's compute 1.22 λ/a. 1.22 = 2 * 0.61, so maybe that's where some confusion comes in. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the units.

Wait, someone correct me: For a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/a, where 'a' is the radius. So that would imply that the first minimum is at 1.22 λ/a. But according to the Bessel function approach, the first zero is at x=3.8317, so θ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ (1.221 λ)/(a). Because 3.8317/(2π) is approximately 0.61, but 3.8317/(2π) is about 0.61. Wait, no, 3.8317/(2π) is approximately 3.8317/6.283 ≈ 0.61. So θ is approximately 0.61 λ/a. But 1.22 is twice that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe the condition is (2π a / λ) sinθ = x, where x is the zero of J_1. So, sinθ = x λ/(2π a). So when x is 3.8317, sinθ = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a) ≈ 0.610 λ/a. So θ ≈ 0.610 λ/a.

But I've also read that the first minimum occurs at θ = 1.22 λ/a. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the diameter instead of the radius. Let me see. Suppose the diameter is D = 2a. Then, for a single-slit, the first minimum is at D sinθ = λ, so sinθ = λ/(2a). So θ = λ/(2a). But wait, that's for a single slit of width D=2a. So that would be sinθ = λ/(2a). So for the circular aperture, if I use the same approach, perhaps the condition is a sinθ = λ/(2), so sinθ = λ/(2a), θ = λ/(2a). But that doesn't align with the Bessel function approach.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to think differently. The question is about the angular distance between the first two minima when N is very large, so the shape is a circle. If I can find the angle of the first two minima, the difference will give the angular distance.

From the Bessel function J_1, the first zero is at x1 = 3.8317, the second at x2 = 7.0156. So the angles would be θ1 = (3.8317 λ)/(2π a), θ2 = (7.0156 λ)/(2π a). The difference is (7.0156 -3.8317) * λ/(2π a) = (3.1839) * λ/(2π a) ≈ 0.506 λ/a.

So the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately 0.506 λ/a.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.506 λ/a.

Alternatively, perhaps another factor comes into play because the polygon has N sides and the apothem is 'a'. Let me think about the polygon's diffraction pattern. For a regular polygon, the diffraction pattern would be similar to a single slit if the number of sides is large, but perhaps it's treated differently.

Wait, but for a polygon with a very large number of sides (N → ∞), the shape becomes a circle. Therefore, the diffraction pattern would approach that of a circular aperture. So the first two minima would be at θ1 and θ2 as per the Bessel function zeros, and the separation is 0.506 λ/a.

So the correct answer must be option D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the diffraction pattern created by a monochromatic light source falling on an aperture shaped as a regular N-sided polygon with all apothems equal to \(a\). When \(N\) is very large, the polygon approximates a circular aperture with radius \(a\). The goal is to determine the angular distance between the first two intensity minima in the far field.

For a circular aperture, the diffraction pattern is governed by the zeros of the Bessel function \(J_1(x)\), where \(x = k a \sin\theta = \frac{2\pi a}{\lambda} \sin\theta\). The first zero of \(J_1(x)\) occurs at \(x_1 \approx 3.8317\), and the second zero occurs at \(x_2 \approx 7.0156\). These correspond to the angular positions of the first and second minima, respectively.

The angular positions of the minima are given by:

\[
\sin\theta = \frac{x}{2\pi a / \lambda},
\]

where \(x\) is the zero of \(J_1(x)\). For small angles, \(\sin\theta \approx \theta\), so the angular positions are approximately:

\[
\theta_1 \approx \frac{x_1 \lambda}{2\pi a}, \quad \theta_2 \approx \frac{x_2 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

The angular distance between the first two minima is:

\[
\Delta\theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \frac{(x_2 - x_1) \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Substituting \(x_1 = 3.8317\) and \(x_2 = 7.0156\), we find:

\[
\Delta\theta = \frac{(7.0156 - 3.8317) \lambda}{2\pi a} = \frac{3.1839 \lambda}{2\pi a}.
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
\Delta\theta \approx \frac{3.1839}{6.2832} \frac{\lambda}{a} \approx 0.506 \frac{\lambda}{a}.
\]

Thus, the angular distance between the first two minima is approximately \(0.506 \lambda / a\), which corresponds to option D.

**Critical analysis of options:**

- **Option A (\(0.610 \lambda / a\))**: This value corresponds to the angular position of the first minimum, not the separation between the first two minima.
- **Option B (\(0.500 \lambda / a\))**: This is close but slightly less accurate than the calculated value of \(0.506 \lambda / a\).
- **Option C (\(1.220 \lambda / a\))**: This is incorrect, as it does not match the separation between the first two minima for a circular aperture.
- **Option D (\(0.506 \lambda / a\))**: This matches the calculated angular separation between the first two minima and is therefore correct.

Answer: D
