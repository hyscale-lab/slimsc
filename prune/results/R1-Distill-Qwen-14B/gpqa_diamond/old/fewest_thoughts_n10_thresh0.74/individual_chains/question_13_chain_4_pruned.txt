Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this organic chemistry problem. Let's start by reading the question carefully. 

The problem involves a series of reactions starting with (R)-(+)-Limonene. I remember Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, specifically a bicyclic monoterpene, but wait, no, actually it's a cyclic monoterpene. Limonene has a structure with a cyclohexene ring and a methyl group attached, I think.

The first step is that the solution of (R)-(+)-Limonene is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen atmosphere. Hydrogen usually indicates a hydrogenation reaction. Since Pd/C is a catalyst used for hydrogenation, probably of double bonds. So the starting material is Limonene, which has a double bond in the cyclohexene ring. When hydrogenated, the double bond would be saturated, turning the ring from cyclohexene to cyclohexane.

Wait, but the question says after 1 equivalent of hydrogen is consumed. So each molecule of Limonene has one double bond, so adding one equivalent of H2 would hydrogenate that double bond. So the product 1 would be the hydrogenated form of Limonene, which is called (R)-carvone maybe? Wait, no. Wait, Limonene is a cyclic monoterpene, and when hydrogenated, it becomes carvone or something else? Hmm, wait, I think that hydrogenation of limonene (which is a cyclic monoterpene with a double bond) would give a cyclohexane ring. The configuration would depend on the starting configuration.

Wait, (R)-(+)-Limonene has a specific configuration. When hydrogen is added across the double bond, the stereochemistry of the hydrogen atoms will depend on the catalyst. Pd/C is a Lindlar catalyst? Wait no, Lindlar is for hydrogenation of alkynes to cis alkenes. Pd/C is usually for alkene hydrogenation, and it's a non-stereoselective catalyst, so it would add hydrogen in a syn fashion but maybe lead to a racemic mixture. Wait, but wait, Limonene's double bond is in a specific position. Let me think: Limonene is a bicyclic molecule? No, wait, I think it's a cyclic monoterpene with a single double bond in the ring. So when hydrogenated, it would add two hydrogens across the double bond, making it
