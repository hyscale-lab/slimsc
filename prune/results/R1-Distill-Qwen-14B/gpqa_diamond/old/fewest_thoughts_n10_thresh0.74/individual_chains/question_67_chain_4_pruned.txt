Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. So each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l. For a p orbital, l is 1. So l1 and l2 are both 1. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Here, l1 and l2 are the individual quantum numbers, l is the total angular momentum quantum number, and m is the z-component of that total.

The question is about the joint probability of measuring both L1z and L2z (the z-components of the orbital angular momenta of each electron) and getting -Ä§ for both. So, we need to find the probability that when we measure L1z and L2z, both give -Ä§.

Wait, but orbital angular momentum states are for individual particles. Each electron has their own orbital angular momentum. The coupled state is about the total angular momentum of the system. So, I think I need to expand the coupled state into the product basis states of the individual electrons and see what the coefficients are for the states where each electron has m=-1.

Wait a second, the orbitals are p, so each has l=1, and m can be -1, 0, +1. So the individual states for each electron can be |l1, m1> and |l2, m2>, where m1 and m2 are the z-components for each electron.

The coupled state is given in terms of total angular momentum quantum numbers. So, the state |1,1,2,-1> is a state with total l=2 and m=-1.

Hmm, but wait, can two electrons combine to give a total l of 2? Oh wait, no wait, the maximum possible l when combining two l=1 states is l1 + l2 = 2. So that's possible.

But wait, when combining two angular momenta, the possible total l values are |l1-l2| to l1+l2 in integer steps. So 1 + 1 = 2, so possible l=0, 1, 2. But wait, the problem states that the coupled state is |1,1,2,-1>, so l is 2 and m is
