Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying a compound given its IR and 1H NMR spectra. The molecular formula is C9H11NO2. The options are A to D. Let me break down the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the IR data. The strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1 are probably due to N-H stretching. These are broad or medium intensity, which makes me think of amines or amides. But wait, the presence of a strong band at 1720 cm-1 is a key clue. That's typical of a carbonyl group, like an ester, amide, or maybe a ketone. But since the formula has two oxygen atoms, it might be either an ester or an amide.

Now, moving on to the 1H NMR. Let's list out the peaks:

- 1.20 ppm (t, 3H): This is likely a CH2CH3 group, like an ethyl group. The triplet suggests it's next to a CH2.
- 4.0 ppm (bs, 2H): Broad singlet for 2H. Broad suggests maybe an amine or an exchange process, but in this case, with 2H, could it be an OCH2 group? Or maybe adjacent to something else.
- 4.5 ppm (q, 2H): Quadruplet, probably a CH2 next to an O, since the splitting is from neighboring CH2 groups. For example, in an ester, the OCH2CH3 would split into a quartet. Wait, but here it's 2H, not 3. Hmm, maybe it's a methylene next to another group. Like OCH2CO something.
- 7.0 ppm (d, 2H), 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): These are two doublets each integrating for 2H. That suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Like a substituent attached to the benzene in the para position, so each substituent is opposite each other. So the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, each with 2H. So maybe a benzamide or something with a substituent para to another group.

Let me think about the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with an ethoxy group at position 3. But wait, if the ethoxy is at position 3, the aromatic protons might not give a para substitution pattern. Let me think. Benzamide has a CONH2 group. If there's an ethoxy at position 3, then the substituents are at 3 and 1 (assuming the amide is at position 1). So the aromatic protons would not be in a para situation. They would be ortho and meta. So the NMR would show more complex splitting, maybe not two doublets. Hmm, perhaps not.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)form
