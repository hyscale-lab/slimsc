Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the maximum orbital period of a second planet that can still show both transit and occultation events. Hmm. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the setup: there's a star with a radius 1.5 times the Sun's. The first planet has Earth's radius and an orbital period of 3 days. The second planet is bigger, 2.5 Earth radii. Both are in circular orbits with the same impact parameter of 0.2, and they share the same orbital plane.

Wait, what's an impact parameter? Oh right, it's the distance (in terms of stellar radius) from the star that the planet's path comes closest during transit. So, if the impact parameter is 0.2, that means the planet's closest approach is 0.2 times the star's radius away. So, for a circular orbit, that's the distance from the star's center to the planet's path at the point of closest approach.

Transit and occultation events happen when the planet passes in front of the star (transit) and behind the star (occultation) from our point of view. For both to occur, the orbital distance must be such that the planet doesn't orbit too far, but I think it has more to do with the star's habitable zone or orbital speeds. Wait, perhaps it's about the relative sizes and the orbital distance.

Wait, no, maybe it's about the orbital distance. For a planet to transit, the orbital plane must be aligned so that the planet passes in front of the star. But since both planets are in the same orbital plane, that's already taken care of. So, the question is about the orbital periods. Hmm.

I remember that the orbital period depends on the distance from the star. Kepler's third law says that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. Since both planets are in the same system, the same star, so the same mass. So, for each planet, their periods relate to (a^3)/(T^2) being constant, where a is the semi-major axis (
