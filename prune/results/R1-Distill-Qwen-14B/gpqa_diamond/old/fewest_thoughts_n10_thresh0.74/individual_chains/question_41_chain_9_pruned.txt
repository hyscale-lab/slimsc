Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about light passing through a moving glass. Hmm, I remember from my classes that when things move relative to each other, especially at high speeds, you have to consider relativity, right? But wait, this glass is moving at a constant velocity. Oh, right, if it's moving at a constant velocity, maybe we don't need to worry about the more complicated parts of relativity like time dilation or length contraction. But I'm not entirely sure.

The question is asking about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The glass has an index of refraction n. I know that the speed of light in a medium is c divided by n. Wait, but c is the speed in a vacuum, which is 1 here. So normally, the speed in glass is 1/n.

But the glass itself is moving. Oh, right, this is a case where the medium (glass) is moving. So how does that affect the observed speed of the light? Because in Newtonian mechanics, velocities just add up. Like, if you're in a train moving at speed v, and you throw a ball forward at u in your frame, someone outside sees it moving at u + v. But wait, but light is different. Because according to relativity, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But wait, this is a problem that might not be using relativity, or maybe it's a trick question.

Wait, the problem says the speed of light in vacuum is c=1. So we're probably supposed to use classical addition of velocities here, but that can't be
