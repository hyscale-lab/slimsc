Okay, so I've got this NMR problem to solve. Let's see what I can figure out. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are between different propenyl and butenyl acetates, both cis and trans.

First, I'll look at the NMR data provided:

1H NMR (ppm):
- 7.0 (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 (1H, dq)
- 2.1 (3H, s)
- 1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm, I remember that in acetates, the ester group is usually OAc, which has a carbonyl. The ester protons (like the methyl group in acetate) typically show up around 2.1 ppm as a singlet because they're not split by neighboring protons. So the 2.1 ppm peak with 3H and a singlet probably is the methyl group attached to oxygen (OAc).

Next, let's think about the other signals. The 7.0 ppm region is usually aromatic, but wait, acetates don't have benzene rings. Oh, wait, maybe it's part of a vinyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a trans coupling in a double bond. The double doublet at 5.5 ppm suggests that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, or perhaps it's a triplet split from coupling with two different groups.

Wait, the first peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a pretty large coupling constant. I think that's indicative of a trans configuration in a double bond. Because in a trans configuration, the vicinal coupling (J) can be around 15-17 Hz. So if that's the case, the structure probably has a trans double bond.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. The options are between propenyl and butenyl acetates. Let me recall: propenyl would be CH2CHCH2, but wait, no. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc? Or butenyl is CH2CHCHCH2-OAc, but with a double bond.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure of propenyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH2CH2? No,
