Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The compound has the molecular formula C8H9NO. The NMR data is given, and there are three reagents it's reacted with. The question is about identifying the final product from the options provided.

First, I'll look at the NMR data to figure out the structure of the starting compound. The 1H NMR peaks are:

- 9.72 ppm (triplet, 1H)
- 6.98 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.51 ppm (doublet, 2H)
- 6.27 ppm (broad singlet, 2H)
- 3.66 ppm (doublet, 2H)

I remember that in NMR, certain regions indicate functional groups. The peak at 9.72 ppm is a triplet, which is quite downfield. That makes me think of an aldehyde proton (RCHO), which usually appears around 9-10 ppm. But wait, sometimes amines or other deshielded protons can appear there. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic proton, but that seems less likely because aromatic protons are usually lower downfield than aldehydes.

The 9.72 ppm triplet suggests maybe a conjugated aldehyde, perhaps in an aromatic system or part of an enal (like a conjugated enal). Another possibility is that the proton is adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group, like an aromatic ring, but I'm more inclined towards an aldehyde since it's quite a strong deshielding.

Looking at the other peaks: the 6.98 and 6.51 doublets add up to four aromatic protons. Maybe it's a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if we have two doublets each integrating for 2H, that could be a pair of adjacent protons on a benzene ring. Wait, no. Wait, if it's a para-substituted benzene, the protons would be ortho to each other. Hmm, maybe it's a di-substituted benzene, like a para-substituted group. Let me think: if the ring has two substituents, perhaps one is an electron-withdrawing group (like a nitro
