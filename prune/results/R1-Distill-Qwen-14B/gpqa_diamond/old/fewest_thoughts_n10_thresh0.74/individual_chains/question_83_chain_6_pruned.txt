Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can get a little tricky for me. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate that solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are given as A, B, C, D.

First, let's break down the problem. When you dilute a solution, the concentration changes. Then, when you titrate, you're reacting the acetic acid with NaOH, which is a strong base. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so the reaction should produce acetate ions and water.

So, step one: Calculate the concentration after dilution.

The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid are Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M × 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After dilution, the new concentration is moles / new volume. So 0.001 mol / 0.04 L = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Oh wait, 20 cm³ is 0.02 liters, right. So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 mol. Diluting to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), so 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. So the reaction is CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na^+ + H2O.

So we need to find the pH when 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized. And the pH at the equivalence point.

Let me tackle the 25% titration first.

At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the moles of NaOH added would be 25% of the moles of acetic acid.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001 mol. So 25% of that is 0.00025 mol of NaOH added.

But wait, the NaOH is in solution, so I should consider the volume of NaOH added to calculate the new concentration, or perhaps it's easier to compute the concentrations in the mixture.

Alternatively, perhaps using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation would be more straightforward, but I think I need to find the concentrations at that point.

Wait, let's think about the solution after 25% titration.

The initial solution is 40 cm³ of 0.025 M acetic acid. So moles of acetic acid = 0.025 * 0.04 L = 0.001 mol.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 mol of CH3COOH has reacted with NaOH, producing 0.00025 mol of CH3COO^-.

So the moles left of acetic acid are 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 mol. The moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 mol.

But wait, what about the volume of the solution? The original solution is 40 cm³, and we're adding some volume of NaOH. Let me compute how much NaOH is added.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. Moles needed for 25% reaction is 0.00025 mol. So volume of NaOH added is moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³.

So the total solution volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

So the concentrations would be:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.017647 M

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 mol / 0.0425 L ≈ 0.005882 M

Wait, but wait, Henderson-Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

So pKa is log(1/(1.85e-5)).

Compute pKa: log(1.85e-5) is about 4.735 (since log(1.85)=0.267, so 5 - 0.267 = 4.733. Let's say pKa ≈ 4.73.

So pH = 4.73 + log( (0.0
