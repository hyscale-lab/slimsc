Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system where a mass experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement. In the classical case, it's F = -kx. But this is the relativistic version, so I need to consider how relativity affects the dynamics.

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are all different expressions involving constants, so I need to derive v_max from the given parameters: mass m, maximum amplitude A, and spring constant k. Oh, and the speed of light c is involved, which tells me relativity is definitely playing a role here.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the maximum speed would be when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. For a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². So setting them equal gives v_max = sqrt(kA²/m), which looks like option C. But wait, this is the relativistic case, so that's probably not the right answer because relativistic effects come into play at high speeds.

In relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy includes the rest mass energy. The relativistic energy equation is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The kinetic energy K is E - m c², so K = (gamma - 1) m c².

In the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy at maximum displacement is (1/2)kA². So in the relativistic case, at maximum amplitude, all the energy is potential, but when the mass passes the equilibrium point, all of that converts to kinetic energy.

Wait, but at maximum displacement, potential energy is maximum. So when the mass is at x=A, the velocity is zero. But as it moves towards x=0, the velocity increases, and at x=0, the velocity is maximum. So the maximum speed occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic.

So, the total energy E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy at maximum speed. But wait, actually, the total energy should be conserved. So the total energy E is the sum of the potential energy at maximum displacement and the kinetic energy when the mass is at the equilibrium point. At maximum
