Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory, SMEFT for short. Hmm, what do I remember about SMEFT? I think it's an effective theory that includes all possible higher-dimensional operators respecting the Standard Model's symmetries. Right, so the question is about which symmetries all operators in SMEFT must respect.

The options are Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry. The choices are combinations of these four. I need to figure out which of these symmetries are automatically respected by all operators in SMEFT.

Wait, I remember that in SMEFT, the operators are classified based on their dimension. The Lagrangian includes the Standard Model part plus higher-dimensional terms. These terms have to be consistent with the Standard Model's gauge symmetry, which includes SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1). But symmetries like Lorentz and Poincare might be different.

Lorentz symmetry is part of Poincare symmetry, which includes Lorentz transformations, translations, and their combinations. Since the Standard Model and thus SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry (as it's a relativistic theory), all operators in SMEFT should also respect Lorentz symmetry. So point 1 is definitely a yes.

What about Poincare symmetry? Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz and translations. Wait, but SMEFT is a field theory, so it's built on the framework of QFT, which already includes Poincare symmetry. But I'm not sure if all operators in SMEFT automatically satisfy Poincare or if it's just part of the framework. Let me think. I think that in SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant terms. So they must respect Lorentz symmetry, but do they have to respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations. Hmm, but when you add higher-dimensional operators, do they automatically respect translation invariance?

Wait, translation invariance is part of the framework of the theory, so all terms in the Lagrangian must be translation-invariant. So the operators must respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, another thought: the SMEFT operators are built in a way that the Lagrangian is Poincare invariant. So any operator added must have the same symmetries as the SM, which includes Poincare
