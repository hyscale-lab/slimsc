Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says that an organic chemist does two reactions. Reaction I involves treating (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one with LAH, followed by an acidic workup. Reaction II is treating pentane-2,4-dione with excess NaBH4 and then an acidic workup. After both reactions are done, the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a normal-phase and a chiral one. The question is about how many peaks each HPLC will show.

Hmm, okay. I think I need to figure out what each reaction produces, then see how those products behave in the HPLC conditions.

Let's start with Reaction I. The starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. LAH is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketone reductions. So, I'm pretty sure that the ketone group will be reduced. Let's visualize the structure. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, but wait, the actual structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH(CH2CH2CH3) with the methoxy group on the 5th carbon.

Wait, no, wait. (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: the carbonyl is on C3, so the structure is:

CH2-CH2-CO-CH(CH2-OCH3)-CH2-CH3?

Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(O)-CH2CH2CH2CH3? But wait, wait. Wait, let me count. Hexan-3-one is:

CH3CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, n=6, so positions 1-6. So 3 is the carbonyl. So positions 1 and 2 are CH2 groups, then the carbonyl on C3, then C4, C5, C6. So for 5-methoxy, the OCH3 is on C5.

So, structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3?
