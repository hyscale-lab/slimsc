Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, right. So the operator P is a vector operator, and its components are given. The direction is in the x-z plane, which means the direction vector n has components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), I think. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so θ would be the angle from the z-axis. So the direction is arbitrary but in x-z. 

The operator P would be in the direction of n, so P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n is in x-z, n_y is zero. So P becomes P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. The direction vector n is (something). Wait, the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane, so n could be represented as (a, 0, b), but since it's a unit vector, a² + b² =1. Alternatively, perhaps it's represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. So n_x is sinθ, and n_z is cosθ. So the operator P along direction n is P = n ⋅ (P_x, P_y, P_z). So that's P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z. But since n_y is zero, P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but wait, each component P_x, P_y, P_z are 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. So P is a 2x2 matrix. So the operator along n is (n_x P_x + n_z P_z) multiplied by ħ/2? Or is it each component multiplied by the corresponding n component. Let me think.

Wait, P is a vector operator, so the operator along n is sum over components (n_i P_i). So yes,
