Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, the question is about finding the concentration of orthophosphate ions in a solution. I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3-.

The solution contains two substances: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Both are 1.00 grams each, and the volume is 200.00 cm³. Oh wait, 200 cm³ is 0.2 liters, right? That's important for calculating molarity later.

I need to find the concentration of PO4^3- ions. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think this has to do with the phosphate buffer system. Phosphoric acid (H3PO4) is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. The K values given are Ka1, Ka2, and Ka3 for each dissociation step.

So, the Ka values are:
Ka1 = 7.5e-3
Ka2 = 6.2e-8
Ka3 = 1.8e-12

These values are in order for each deprotonation. H3PO4 → H2PO4^- with Ka1, then H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- with Ka2, and finally HPO4^2- → PO4^3- with Ka3.

The substances in the solution are KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. Let me think about their dissociations.

KH2PO4 will dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^-. So, it's providing H2PO4^- ions. On the other hand, Na2HPO4·2H2O will dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- (and water molecules, but as ions, it's just HPO4^2-).

So, in the solution, we have H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. These can react with each other because they are in a buffer system. The phosphate ions come into play when HPO4^2- dissociates further into PO4^3-.

Wait, but HPO4^2- can act as an acid (losing a proton to become PO4^3
