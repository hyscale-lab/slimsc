Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think. The question is asking for the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian H, which is given by ε times the dot product of σ and n vectors. Oh right, σ is the Pauli spin matrices, and n is an arbitrary unit vector. So I need to find the eigenvalues of this operator.

Wait, I remember that the Pauli matrices are vector-like in a sense. So σ · n would be a matrix where each component is multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Oh, right, because the dot product of σ and n is Σ σ_i n_i, where i runs over x, y, z.

Now, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σ · n, when n is a unit vector, should be ±1. Because each Pauli matrix squares to the identity, and the combination would give an eigenvalue problem where the eigenvalues are plus and minus one. Let me think: for example, if n is along the z-direction, σ · n is σ_z, whose eigenvalues are +1 and -1. So for any direction n, the eigenvalues would still be ±1, because the system is rotationally symmetric here.

But wait, the Hamiltonian H is ε times that. So if the operator σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then multiplying by ε would give eigenvalues ±ε. Because eigenvalues scale linearly with the scalar multiplied. So the eigenvalues of H would be ε and -ε.

Looking at the options, option B
