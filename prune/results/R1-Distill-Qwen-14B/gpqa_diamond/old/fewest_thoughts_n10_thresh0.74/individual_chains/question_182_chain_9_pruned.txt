Okay, so I have this question about the Mott-Gurney equation and its validity. Hmm, I need to figure out which statement correctly describes when this equation is applicable. Let me think about what I remember from my solid-state devices class.

The Mott-Gurney equation models the dark current in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions. From what I recall, the equation is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * (V²)/(L³). It's used in the SCLC regime, which I think stands for space-charge-limited current. So, the key here is understanding the conditions under which this equation holds true.

I remember that in the SCLC regime, the current is limited by the accumulation of charge in the device, creating a space charge that repels incoming carriers. This effect is significant when the voltage is high enough that the space charge can't be neglected.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate things, maybe leading to more complex current behavior. Single-carrier suggests either electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact implies that the contacts are good, so no significant barrier for the carriers. Drift current refers to the movement due to electric field, but if it's SCLC, I think drift is involved. Oh wait, or is it the other way around? Maybe drift is the main current here, and diffusion is negligible? Or the other way? Hmm.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier would mean that the work function is such that carriers can easily enter. Negligible diffusion current—so the current is mainly due to drift, not diffusion. So in SCLC, maybe the current is dominated by drift, making diffusion negligible. That makes sense because when the electric field is strong, the space charge builds up, and the current is due to the movement of carriers under the field, not so much from concentration gradients.

Option C: Single-carrier with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier that only allows majority carriers to pass, but I'm not sure how that affects the validity of Mott-Gurney. Also, does the contact type affect the current expression? I think Mott-Gurney is more about the conditions under which the
