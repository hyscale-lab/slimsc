Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an aperture shaped like an N-sided polygon, and when a monochromatic light hits it, it creates intensity maxima and minima in the far field. The question is about finding the angular distance between the first two minima when N approaches infinity. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with diffraction patterns.

Wait, when N is infinitely large, the aperture becomes a circle, right? Because a polygon with infinite sides would approximate a circle. So the problem reduces to finding the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture.

I think the minima in the diffraction pattern of a circular aperture occur at certain angles. What's the formula for those minima? Oh right, I remember that for a circular aperture, the first minimum occurs at an angle θ given by sinθ = λ/(π a), but wait, isn't that the first minimum? Or maybe I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, no. Another thought: the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture is called the Airy disk. The angular positions of the minima correspond to the zeros of the Bessel function J1. The first minimum occurs when J1 is zero. The zeros of J1 are at certain points. The first zero of J1 is at around 3.8317, but wait, I'm not sure about that. Or wait, maybe for the minima in the far field (Fraunhofer diffraction), the condition is different.

Wait, I think for single-slit diffraction, the minima are at a sinθ = mλ, where m is an integer. But for a circular aperture, it's a bit different. Oh right, the formula for the m-th minimum in circular diffraction is something like sinθ = (m * λ)/(a), but I'm not quite recalling it correctly. Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's think about the intensity pattern.

The intensity in the far field for a circular aperture is given by the square of the Bessel function. The first minimum occurs when the Bessel function J1 has its first zero. The first zero of J1 is at x ≈ 3.8317, but since the condition for minima in the diffraction pattern is when the argument of the Bessel function is such that J1 reaches a zero. Wait, but the formula I'm trying to remember is that the minima occur at θ where (a sinθ)/λ = something like pi*a/(something).

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is (a sinθ)/λ = (m * pi)/something. Let me think again. Oh, right! The condition for the minima in a circular aperture is given by a * sinθ = m * λ, where m is an integer. But wait, I'm not sure. Or is it m * (λ) = a sinθ? Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct condition for the minima (dark rings) in the Airy pattern is when a sinθ = m λ, where m is an integer. So the first minimum would be at m=1, so sinθ = λ/(a). But wait, I'm getting confused because I'm thinking about the first minimum in the single-slit diffraction, which is when a sinθ = λ. But for a circular aperture, is it the same?

Wait, I think I'm mixing up concepts. Single-slit and circular apertures have different diffraction patterns. For a circular aperture, the first minimum is when the angle satisfies a sinθ = λ. So when m=1, sinθ = λ/a. But wait, when the diameter is involved, it's a bit different. Or is 'a' the radius here? Because in the single-slit, 'a' is the slit width. In a circular aperture, 'a' would be the radius, I think.

So if the radius is a, then the diameter is 2a. But the formula for the minima in a circular aperture is (from what I remember) when the argument of the Bessel function's first kind of order 1 is equal to its zero. The first zero of J1 is at approximately 3.8317. So the condition is (π a sinθ) / λ =
