Okay, so I have this question about symmetries in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Hmm, I remember that SMEFT is an effective theory that incorporates the Standard Model (SM) plus higher-dimensional operators. These operators are classified by their dimension and the symmetries they respect.

The question is asking which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT. Let's think through each symmetry.

First, Lorentz symmetry. I know that the SM respects Lorentz symmetry, and SMEFT should extend that. So all operators in SMEFT must be Lorentz scalars, meaning they transform covariantly under Lorentz transformations. So Lorentz symmetry (option 1) is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry. Poincare includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. Wait, but in effective field theories, operators are typically local, and they should respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, SMEFT includes higher-dimension operators which are local, so they must respect local symmetries. So Poincare symmetry (option 2) is also required. But wait, Poincare is more about the combination of Lorentz and translations. Since SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, operators must be Poincare invariant as well?

Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Because the effective theory is built from local operators, which are constructed to be Poincare invariant. So all operators in SMEFT respect Poincare symmetry. So 2 would be correct.

But wait, wait a second. The question is whether the operators must respect all these symmetries. So if an operator doesn't respect, say, C, then it's allowed if the symmetry is not imposed. But for Lorentz, Poincare, etc., these are fundamental symmetries of the theory.

Wait, another angle: SMEFT is a low-energy effective theory, so it must respect the same symmetries as the SM. The SM respects Lorentz, Poincare, CPT. Does it respect CP? The SM doesn't respect CP globally because of things like CP violation in the CKM matrix. So SMEFT operators can have CP violation.

So which symmetries are 'must' for all operators?

So, for SMEFT, all operators must be Lorent
