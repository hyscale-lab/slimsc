Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, let's try to think this through. I'm a bit rusty on statistical mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

The problem states that we have three spins, S1, S2, and S3. Each can be either +1 or -1. The energy of the system is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. We need to find the partition function Z, and the options are given as A to D.

Wait, the partition function is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), where β is 1/(kT). But each spin can be either +1 or -1, so each spin has two possible states. So for three spins, how many total states are there? Let's see, each spin has 2 options, so 2^3 = 8 states in total. So Z is the sum of exp(-βE) for each of these 8 states.

But calculating each term individually might be tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way to approach this. Let's think about the energy expression. The energy E is -J multiplied by the sum of the products of each pair of spins. So E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let me denote the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3. Then E = -J S.

So each state's contribution to the partition function is exp(β J S), because Z is sum of exp(-β E), and E is -J S, so -β E = β J S. So each term is e^{β J S}.

Now, I need to find all possible values of S for each state and count how many states have each value of S. Then multiply the count by e^{β J S} and sum them up.

Wait, what possible values can S take? Let's think about all possible combinations. Each of S1, S2, S3 can be +1 or -1. So let me list all possible states and calculate S for each.

But that's a bit time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe I can find the possible values of S and their multiplicities.

Wait, S is the sum of the three pairwise products. Let me consider each term:

Each term S1S2, S1S3, S2S3 can be either +1 or -1 because each spin is ±1. So the sum S can range from? Let me think: each term can be ±1, so three terms, so their sum can be from -3 to +3. But wait, let's see the possible combinations.

Wait, when all three are the same, say all +1, then S1S2 = +1, S1S3=+1, S2S3=+1. So S = 3. Similarly, if all are -1, then each product is +1, so S=3 again.

Wait, no. Wait, S1S2 when S1 and S2 are
