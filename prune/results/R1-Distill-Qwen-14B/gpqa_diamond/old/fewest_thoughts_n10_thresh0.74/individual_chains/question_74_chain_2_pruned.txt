Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it again.

The question says that an atom has a 32% chance of decaying within 100 minutes. So far, 50 minutes have passed, and it hasn't decayed yet. Now they're asking what the probability is that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, no, actually, noâ€”wait, let me read that again. Oh, no, wait, the question is about the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes after the 50 minutes have passed. So the total time from now would be 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, no, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the initial statement says that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed. The question is, what is the probability it will decay in the NEXT 150 minutes. So that would be from the current time (50 minutes in) to 50 + 150 = 200 minutes total. So the time interval we're considering is 150 minutes, starting now.

Wait, but radioactive decay is a Poisson process, right? So the decay is memoryless. That means the probability of decaying in a certain period doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So if the probability of decaying in 100 minutes is 32%, but 50 minutes have already passed without decay, then for the next 150 minutes,
