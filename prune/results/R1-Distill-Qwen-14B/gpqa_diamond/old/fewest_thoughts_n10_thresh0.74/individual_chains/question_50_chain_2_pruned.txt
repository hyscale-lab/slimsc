Okay, so I've got this quantum field theory problem here. Let's see what it's about. The question is about figuring out how many loops a Feynman diagram has based on a given expression of factors. Hmm, I remember that Feynman diagrams and loop diagrams are related to perturbation theory in QFT. Each loop typically corresponds to a certain order in the perturbation expansion.

The note says: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. I'm trying to remember how these factors relate to the number of loops. Oh right, when you calculate loop integrals, you often get factors involving pi and powers of alpha (the fine-structure constant) and coupling constants like g. The denominator with (4pi)^something could be from loop integrals.

Wait, each loop in a Feynman diagram contributes a factor of integrating over four momentum variables, which introduces a 4-dimensional integral. But in regularization, especially dimensional regularization, these integrals often result in expressions with factors like (4pi)^epsilon or something similar, depending on the scheme. But I'm not sure about the exact scaling here.

The denominator here is (4pi)^6. Hmm, each loop usually gives a 4pi factor from the integration over d^4k. Wait, but each loop integral in 4 dimensions would have a (4pi)^2 factor? Or maybe more? Wait, I think loop integrals often involve (4pi)^{d/2} where d is the dimension. But wait, in 4 dimensions, each loop might contribute a factor like (4pi)^2. So for example, a one-loop diagram would have a term with (4pi)^2 in the denominator after evaluating, perhaps. Or maybe more accurately, the integral in four dimensions, when evaluated, gives factors involving (4pi)^2 multiplied by gamma functions and so on.

Wait, but for loop integrals, each loop contributes a factor of (4pi)^{n}, where n depends on the loop integrals and the number of loops. Let me think: for a one-loop integral, I remember that the integral typically has a term like (4pi)^2 in the denominator when you use dimensional regularization or other schemes. For higher loops, like two loops, it would be (4pi)^4, and so on. Because each loop contributes a (4pi) factor from the integral.

So in this given expression, the denominator is (4pi)^6. That would mean that the number of loops is 3 because each loop adds two to the exponent (since each loop gives a (4pi)^2 factor). So 2 * 3 loops would give (4pi)^6. Wait, let me think again. Let's say each loop contributes a (4pi)^2 in the denominator. So for n loops, the denominator would be (4pi)^{2n}.

So the denominator here is (4pi)^6, which is (4pi)^(2*3), so n=3. So the number of loops is 3. So the answer would be D) 3.

But wait, maybe I should double-check. Another approach is to think about the general form of the amplitude for a loop diagram. For a one-loop diagram, the amplitude might scale as alpha
