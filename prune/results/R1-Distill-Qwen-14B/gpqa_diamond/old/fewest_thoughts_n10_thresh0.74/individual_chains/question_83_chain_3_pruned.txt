Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because titration calculations can get tricky. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says we dilute 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D, each with two pH values.

First, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So when they react, they'll form sodium acetate, which is the conjugate base of acetic acid.

Let me outline the steps I think I need to take:

1. Calculate the concentration of acetic acid after dilution.
2. Determine the equivalence point volume to find the pH at the equivalence point.
3. For the 25% titration point, find out how much NaOH has been added and calculate the resulting concentrations of acetic acid and acetate ions.
4. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for the 25% point and the pOH for the equivalence point.

Wait, no, at equivalence point, since it's a salt of a weak acid and strong base, the solution will be basic. So I should calculate the pH based on the hydrolysis of the acetate ion.

Let me start with the first step.

Step 1: Diluting the acetic acid.

We have 20.00 cm³ (which is 0.020 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid. We add 20.00 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.040 L). 

The concentration after dilution can be found using M1V1 = M2V2.

M1 is 0.05 M, V1 is 0.020 L.

M2 = (M1 V1) / V2 = (0.05 * 0.020) / 0.040 = (0.001) / 0.040 = 0.025 M.

So after dilution, the acetic acid concentration is 0.025 M.

Step 2: Equivalence point calculation.

At equivalence point, all the acetic acid will have reacted with NaOH to form sodium acetate.

Molarity of NaOH is 0.1 M. So the volume needed can be calculated by:

moles of acetic acid = M_acetic * V_acetic.

M_acetic is 0.025 M, V is 0.040 L. Moles = 0.025 * 0.040 = 0.001 moles.

Since NaOH reacts 1:1 with acetic acid, moles of NaOH needed is 0.001. So volume V = moles / M_NaOH = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.010 L, which is 10 cm³.

Wait, but the question is about 25% titration, so I'll get back to that. For the equivalence point, once all the acetic acid is neutralized, the solution will consist of sodium acetate.

Sodium acetate dissociates completely into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The concentration of CH3COO^- is moles / total volume.

Moles of CH3COO^- is 0.001 moles. The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added at equivalence (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.050 L.

Concentration of acetate = 0.001 / 0.050 = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate is a weak base. Its Kb can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^-:

Kb ≈ x² / (0.02 - x). Since Kb is very small, x will be much smaller than 0.02, so we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

So x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have a pH near 9. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate the Kb part.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = approximately 5.405
