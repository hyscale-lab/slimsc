Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The problem says that we have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form a basis for the spin-½ system.

Wait, the state is proportional, so I probably need to normalize it. That means I have to find the normalization constant. The state can be written as |alpha> = a|up> + b|down>, where a is (1+i) and b is (2 - i). The normalization condition is |a|² + |b|² = 1. Let me compute |a|² and |b|².

Calculating |1+i|²: the modulus squared is (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.
Similarly, |2 - i|² is (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5. So the total is 2 +5=7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down>.

Now, the problem mentions an operator with matrix elements A_ij where A_ij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Wait, so the matrix is 2x2, since it's for spin-½. So the matrix would look like:

[0, hbar/2]
[hbar/2, 0]

Because for i≠j, the elements are hbar/2, and the diagonal elements (i=j) are zero. Hmm, that looks familiar. Oh, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2, right? Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so this operator A is (hbar/2) * σ_x.

Wait, σ_x is the Pauli X matrix, so this operator A is (hbar/2) σ_x. So its eigenstates are |+x> and |-x>, the eigenstates of σ_x. So to find the probabilities of measuring each eigenstate, we need to express |
