Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem states that we have an electron in a state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. I remember that |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, so they form the basis for the spin states.

The first part of the question asks me to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of another operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i is different from j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I think this is the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. Because the Pauli matrices are 2x2, and their off-diagonal elements are 1, while the diagonal are 0. So scaling them by hbar/2 would give Aij as 0 on the diagonal and hbar/2 elsewhere.

Wait, wait. Let me write it out. The Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by hbar/2, each off-diagonal element becomes hbar/2. So the matrix for this operator is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. 

So this operator probably has eigenstates that are different from the |up> and |down> states. Because the Pauli X matrix's eigenstates are the spin states in the x-direction, like |right> and |left> or something similar. So the eigenstates of this operator are probably |+x> and |-x>, which are superpositions of |up> and |down>.

The question is about finding the probabilities of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. So I need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities will be the square of the coefficients.

But wait, maybe there's another approach. The operator in question has a matrix that's given. Let me think about its eigenstates. For a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving det(A - λI)=0. The matrix A is [[0, hbar/2], [hbar/2, 0]]. So the characteristic equation is (0 - λ)^2 - (hbar/2)^2 = 0 → λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2. So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

The eigenstates corresponding to these eigenvalues are the eigenvectors. For λ = hbar/2, the equation (A - λ I)|v> = 0 becomes:

[-λ, hbar/2; hbar/2, -λ] |v> =0. Plugging λ = hbar/2:

[-hbar/2, hbar/2; hbar/2, -hbar/2] |v> =0. Let's write the equations:

(-hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v
