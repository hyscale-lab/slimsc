Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. It's about finding the pH of a solution when you mix three different solutions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says we have 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)2. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I think the approach is to figure out the moles of H+ and OH- ions and see what's left after they react.

Wait, so CH3COOH is acetic acid, which is a weak acid. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base because it's a group 2 hydroxide, I think, so it dissociates completely too. So Ba(OH)2 will release OH- ions.

Hmm, but first I should calculate the total moles of each acid and base. Let me get that out.

For CH3COOH: Molarity is 0.1 M, volume is 500 mL, which is 0.5 L. Moles = M * V = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl: 0.2 M, 400 mL (0.4 L). Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 M, 300 mL (0.3 L). Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. So moles of OH- = 0.3 * 0.3 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Wait, wait, no. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH- per formula unit. So each mole gives two OH- ions. So moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2 is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2, which gives 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, what about the H+ ions? HCl is a strong acid, so it gives 0.08 moles of H+.

CH3COOH is a weak acid, but it doesn't dissociate completely. So it contributes some H+ ions, but not all. But wait, when you mix the solution, the total volume changes, so I might need to consider that when calculating concentrations, but perhaps for the initial neutralization, I should just calculate the moles first.

Wait, but when you mix all three solutions, the total volume is 500 + 400 + 300 = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 L.

But wait, the problem is about neutralization between acids and bases. So the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. The OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O.

So the total moles of H+ available before reaction are the sum of H+ from HCl and CH3COOH. Wait, but CH3COOH doesn't fully dissociate, so maybe I should treat it differently. Oh wait, but when you mix the solutions, the H+ from HCl (a strong acid) will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2 first, and then any excess H+ will react with the CH3COOH, or perhaps the other way around. Or maybe it's better to think in terms of all the H+ and OH- ions available.

Wait, but maybe first calculate the total H+ and OH-.

Wait, HCl gives
