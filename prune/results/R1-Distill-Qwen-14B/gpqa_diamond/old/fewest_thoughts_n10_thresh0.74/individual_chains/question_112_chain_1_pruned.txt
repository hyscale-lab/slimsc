Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the problem again.

So, the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. The |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator. I need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of another operator, which has a matrix representation Aij where Aij is hbar/2 if i≠j and 0 otherwise. Then find the average value of that operator.

Hmm. Wait, I remember that the spin matrices for the z-component are diagonal. So the eigenstates of Sz are |up> and |down>, which are basis vectors. 

First, let me normalize the state |alpha>. Because the problem says it's proportional, I need to find the normalization constant. So |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. The normalization condition is <alpha|alpha> = 1.

Calculating the inner product: 
(1 - i)(1 + i) + (2 + i)(2 - i) because |up> and |down> are orthonormal. 

(1 - i)(1 + i) = 1 + i - i -i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2. 

(2 + i)(2 - i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5. 

So total is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) |up> + (2 -i)/sqrt(7) |down> ].

Wait, no. Wait, the initial state is proportional, so we have |alpha> = [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ] / sqrt(7) because the norm is sqrt(7), so to make it unit length.

So the coefficients are a = (1+i)/sqrt(7) and b = (2 -i)/sqrt(7).

Now, the next part is about another operator whose matrix elements are Aij = hbar/2 if i !=j, else 0. So the matrix is 2x2 because there are two eigenstates. Let's see, the operator's matrix would look like:

[[0, ħ/2],
 [ħ/2, 0]]

Because when i=j (the diagonal), Aij=0, and when i≠j (off-diagonal), Aij= ħ/2.

Wait, so what is this operator? Oh, wait, the Pauli matrix sigma_x multiplied by ħ/2. Because the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when multiplied by ħ/2, the operator becomes [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]].

Yes, so this operator is (ħ/2) σ_x. So the eigenstates of this operator are the eigenstates of σ_x, which are the eigenstates of the X basis, i.e., the states like (|up> + |down>)/
