Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's take it step by step.

The question is about the Cope rearrangement and another reaction. There are two parts, A and B, and I need to find the major products from each.

Starting with part A: The starting material is ((3-methylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)methyl)benzene. The reagents are BuLi followed by H+. Hmm. Wait, BuLi is a strong base, a butyllithium. It's often used to deprotonate compounds. So what's happening here?

The structure of the starting material: It's a benzene ring with a substituent. The substituent is an oxy group (O-) connected to a methyl group and then a but-2-en-1-yl group. Let me draw this out.

So, the substituent is OCH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. The but-2-en-1-yl group is CH2=CHCH2CH2- but wait, maybe I'm getting that wrong. No, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait, but-2-en-1-yl is CH2CH2CH2CH2 but with a double bond starting at C2. So, structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but the double bond is between C2 and C3? Wait, no. Wait, 1-yl means the substituent comes from the 1 position. So but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-? Or is it CH2=CHCH2-CH2? Wait no, but-2-en-1-yl would be CH2CH2CH2CH2, but the double bond is between carbons 2 and 3. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-, but wait, no. Let me think: but-2-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So but-2-en-1-yl is when the substituent comes off the first carbon. So, CH
