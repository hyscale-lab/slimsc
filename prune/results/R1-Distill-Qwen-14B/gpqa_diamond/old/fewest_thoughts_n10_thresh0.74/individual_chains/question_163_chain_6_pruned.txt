Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me see if I can work through it step by step. The question is about dissolving iron(III) hydroxide, Fe(OH)3, in a strong acid and finding the minimum volume of the acid needed, as well as the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and a sparingly soluble compound. So when it dissolves in an acid, the H+ ions from the acid should react with the OH- ions from the Fe(OH)3. Oh wait, but since the acid is strong and monobasic, it will completely dissociate, providing a lot of H+ ions.

The reaction should be something like Fe(OH)3 reacting with HCl (as an example of a strong monobasic acid) to produce Fe^3+ ions, water, and Cl- ions. Let me write that down:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O

So I need to find out how much H+ is needed to dissolve all the Fe(OH)3.

First, let's calculate the molar mass of Fe(OH)3. Iron is about 55.85 g/mol, oxygen is 16, and hydrogen is 1. So:

Fe: 55.85
Each OH- group: (16 + 1) = 17 g/mol. There are three OH groups, so 3 * 17 = 51 g/mol.
Total molar mass: 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

The mass given is 0.1 grams. So the moles of Fe(OH)3 are 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that calculation. 0.1 divided by 106.85—wait, 106.85 is about 107, so 0.1/107 is approximately 0.0009346, so yeah, around 9.35e-4 moles.

Each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+ to dissolve. So 0.000936 mol Fe(OH)3 × 3 = 0.002808 mol H+ needed.

The acid is 0.1 M (molarity). Molarity is moles per liter. So to find the volume, I can use the formula:

Molarity = moles / volume (in liters)
→ volume = moles / Molarity

So volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Wait, but wait, 0.02808 L is 28.08 mL, which is 28.08 cm³. Looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³, which is very close. So maybe the minimum volume is about 28 cm³. But wait, I remember that sometimes you have to consider the stoichiometry accurately.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake. Oh no, wait—did I forget that the acid is monobasic? So each mole of acid provides one mole of H+. Right, so the H+ calculation is correct. So 3 moles H+ per mole Fe(OH)3, yeah.

So the volume is 28.08 cm³. That's approximately 28.08, so option C is 28.05. Close enough, given possible rounding in the problem.

Now, the second part is the pH of the resulting solution. Let's think about that.

After dissolving Fe(OH)3 in the acid, the solution will contain Fe^3+ ions and the excess H+ from the acid. Since the acid is in excess (because we used the minimal volume needed to react with Fe(OH)3), the solution's pH will be determined by the excess H+.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: when Fe(OH)3 reacts with H+ (from the acid), the H+ neutralizes the OH- in Fe(OH)3. Let me calculate the moles of H+ added and the moles used in the reaction.

The moles of H+ added from the acid: 0.02808 L × 0.1 M = 0.002808 mol. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no. The volume is 28.08 cm³ (
