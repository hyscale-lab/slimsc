Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see, the question is about a particle in an isotropic three-dimensional potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω²r². Oh wait, that's the same form as a harmonic oscillator potential, right? So this must be a three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator problem.

The question is asking about the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for that energy eigenvalue. Hmm, I remember that in three dimensions, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers in each direction. Since it's isotropic, the potential is the same in all directions, so maybe the energy depends on the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

In three dimensions, the total energy for a harmonic oscillator is given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), or something like that. Oh wait, because each direction contributes (n_i + 1/2)ħω, so when you add them up, it's (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2)ħω.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Third excited state—so what does that mean? Oh right, the ground state is the lowest energy, which would be n=0 in each direction, so n_x = n_y = n_z = 0. Then the first excited state would be when one of the n's is 1, so like (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). The second excited state would probably be when two of them are 1, like (2,0,0), (1,1,0), etc. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the order.

Wait, I think the energy levels are determined by the sum n = n_x + n_y + n_z. Each time n increases by 1, the energy increases by ħω. So the ground state is n=0 (sum of n_x, n_y, n_z is 0), energy is (3/2)ħω. The first excited state would be n=1, so (3/2 + 1) = 5/2 ħω. Second excited would be n=2, energy 7/2 ħω. Third excited would be n=3, so energy (3 +
