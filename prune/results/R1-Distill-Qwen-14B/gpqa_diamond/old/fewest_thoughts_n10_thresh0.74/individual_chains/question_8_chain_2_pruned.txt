Okay, so I've got this genetics question here about gene interactions in white lupine related to anthracnose resistance. Hmm, let's see what I can figure out.

The setup is that they found three candidate genes, G1, G2, G3. They made knockout mutants and some double mutants. The key here is that at least one of these genes is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, transcription factors are usually regulatory proteins that turn on other genes.

They tested the mutants for resistance. The wild-type has 100% resistance. Let's look at the data:

- g1: 75% → less resistance than wild type. So knocking out G1 reduces resistance.
- g2: 0% → this is really bad. No resistance at all. So G2 is crucial.
- g3: 50% → also reduced, but not as bad as g2.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → very low.
  - g2g3: 0% → same as g2 alone.
  - g1g2: 0% → same as g2 alone.

Wait, so when both G2 and another gene is knocked out, the resistance is zero. But for g1g3, it's even lower than either g1 or g3 alone.

Hmm. I remember that in epistasis, the effect of one gene is dependent on another. Like, if gene A is epistatic to gene B, the phenotype of gene B's mutation is masked when gene A is also mutated. So in the double mutant, the phenotype would be the same as the more severe single mutant.

Looking at the data, when G2 is mutated (g2 has 0%), any double mutant with G2 (g1g2, g2g3) also has 0% resistance. But when G1 is mutated (g1 is 75%), the double mutant with G3 (g1g3) is 10%, which is worse than either single.

Wait, what's the deal with G2? Because in all double mutants involving G2, the resistance is 0%. That suggests that G2 is epistatic. Because when you have the mutation in G2, regardless of other mutations, the resistance is gone. So G2 is acting upstream. Oh, because the question says that one of them is a transcription factor upstream of others. So G2 is probably the transcription factor.

So the possible options: the answer must have G2 as the transcription factor.

Looking at the options, options A, B, D have G2 as transcription factor. Option C has G2 as transcription factor as well.

So which relationships hold?

In the double mutants:

g1g3 is worse than either g1 or g3 alone. So the double mutant shows more severe phenotype than either single. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in the same pathway, but maybe in parallel pathways. Or perhaps they have some redundant functions. Because if they were in the same pathway, then the double mutant might not be worse than the worse single.

Alternatively, gene redundancy
