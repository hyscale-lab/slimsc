Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure out what compound E is. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

First, I'll read the question carefully. The reaction scheme involves several steps, and there are some hints provided. The options are all cyclic ketones, so E must be a ketone. Let's outline each step.

Starting with compound A. When A reacts with HCN, it produces compound B. Then, B is reduced with H2 and Pd to form C. Next, C reacts with HNO2 to form D. Finally, D loses an inert gas to give E.

Looking at the hints, hint a says that when A reacts with an unknown phosphorous ylide, it forms 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Hmm, phosphorous ylides are typically used in Wittig reactions. The Wittig reaction forms alkenes by reacting aldehydes or ketones with ylides. So A must be a ketone because the product has a double bond (the ylidene group).

Wait, the product from the Wittig is 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. Let me imagine the structure. The cyclopentane ring has substituents at positions 1 and 2 as methyl groups. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=. So, the Wittig product has a double bond between C4 and the propan-2-ylidene group.

So the ylide must have formed from a ketone. The ylide structure is probably something like (CH3)2P=CHCH(CH3). Wait, but the product has a propan-2-ylidene group, which is CH2-C(CH3)=. So the ylide would be derived from (propan-2-yl) group. The ylide would have a structure like Ph3P=CH2CH(CH3). Wait, no, propan-2-yl is CH(CH3)2. So the ylide would be CH2-PPh3 with a CH(CH3)2 group attached. Or perhaps the ylide is (CH2)2C(CH3)-PPh3. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this a bit wrong, but the main point is that the Wittig reaction takes a ketone and forms an alkene.

Another thought: the Wittig reaction adds a double bond. So if A is a ketone, and the product has a new double bond, then A's structure must have been such that the new double bond is formed at a certain position.

So the starting material for the Wittig is a ketone. Let's consider the product: 1,2-dimethyl-4-(propan-2-ylidene)cyclopentane. The cyclopentane ring has methyl groups at 1 and 2 positions. At position 4, there's a propan-2-ylidene group, which is a CH2-C(CH3)= group. So the structure would be cyclopentane with substituents: two methyl
