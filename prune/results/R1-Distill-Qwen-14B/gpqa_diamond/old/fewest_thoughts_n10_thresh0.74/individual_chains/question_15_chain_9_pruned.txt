Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting transiting planets. Hmm, I remember that the transit method is when a planet passes in front of its star from our point of view, causing a dip in brightness. The probability of this happening depends on the size of the planet relative to the star and the alignment of the orbit.

The question says there are two Earth-like planets, Planet_1 and Planet_2. Both have been detected via the RV method, so we know their minimum masses and orbital periods. Wait, but in the question, it says both have the same masses. Oh, but Planet_1's orbital period is three times shorter than Planet_2's. So Planet_1 is orbiting much closer to its star.

The host stars have different masses but the same radii. Planet_1's star has twice the mass of Planet_2's star. So Star_1 is more massive, but same size. Wait, but more massive stars are usually bigger. Oh wait, the question says the host of Planet_2 is slightly evolved, so maybe it's a subgiant or something, which can expand but in this case, both stars have the same radii. Interesting.

The question is about which planet has a higher probability of transiting, so the researchers will choose the one with higher probability.

I remember the formula for transit probability. I think it's something like (R_planet / R_star)^2 multiplied by the probability that the orbital plane is aligned with our line of sight. Wait, but the main factors are the size of the planet relative to the star and
