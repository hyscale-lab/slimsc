Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a metric and the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I remember that a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, right? But wait, what's a pseudosphere exactly? Oh right, it's like a tractricoid or something, the surface formed by rotating a tractrix.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 -x² -y²)] (dx² + dy²). I think this is in two dimensions because I see dx and dy. So this is a 2D metric, probably describing some kind of space, maybe a sphere or a hyperbolic space.

Wait, the denominator is (4 -x² -y²). So if I rearrange that, it's 4 - (x² + y²). So the denominator becomes zero when x² + y² =4, which is a circle of radius 2. So as x² + y² approaches 4, the denominator goes to zero, and the metric blows up, which suggests that the region is only defined where x² + y² <4. So the area is within a circle of radius 2.

But wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Because the pseudosphere is a two-dimensional surface, but here the metric is in 2D, so maybe this metric represents the pseudosphere.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is of a space that's topologically a sphere but has negative curvature. Wait, in 2D,
