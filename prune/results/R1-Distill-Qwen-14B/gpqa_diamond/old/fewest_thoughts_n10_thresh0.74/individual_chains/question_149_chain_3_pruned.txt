Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me read it again.

So, the scenario is that I have a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly right, but there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Both similar shifts and equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it.

Then, LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks with same mass. The mass spectrum is consistent with the expected molecule.

Hmm. So what's going on here?

Let me think about the possibilities. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Since the integrals are the same and the shift is similar, maybe they're diastereotopic protons or something else, but wait, the question says it's the same alpha-proton. So same proton, but two peaks. But how?

In the case of diastereomers, the same proton might split into different environments, leading to different shifts. But wait, if the shift is similar, maybe the diastereomers are close, like a cis and trans arrangement around a chiral center. So, for example, if there's a chiral center adjacent, maybe the alpha protons are in slightly different environments.

But wait, the NMR shows two peaks but they integrate to 1H total. So maybe each peak is for the same proton in different environments, but in each molecule, each has only one. Wait, no.
