Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question talks about five binary compounds of fluorine with element Y. Hmm, binary compounds mean two elements, so Y and F. So we're looking at YF, YF2, YF3, etc., but wait, the problem says five, so maybe Y has multiple oxidation states with fluorine.

The first part mentions a bright-red substance A1 that decomposes at 293 K (which is room temperature) into A2 and fluorine. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon under normal conditions. Xenon is a noble gas, so if something oxidizes it, it must be a strong oxidizing agent. That makes me think of fluorine compounds because F is a strong oxidizer.

A1 decomposing into A2 and F2. So maybe A1 is a higher fluoride that breaks down into a lower one plus F2. Let's think about known red-colored fluorides. I remember that AgF is white, but maybe something else. Oh wait, I think AgF is not red. Alternatively, maybe it's mercury(I) fluoride or something else. Alternatively, perhaps A1 is something like ClF3, but Cl isn't the Y here. Wait, Y is the other element, so maybe Y is a metal like mercury or something else.

Wait, but the problem says that A1 is a binary compound of Y and F, so it's YFn. When it decomposes, it gives A2 and F2. So, A2 might be another YFm compound. Let's consider the decomposition reaction. If A1 decomposes into A2 and F2, perhaps:

2 A1 → 2 A2 + F2

But I'm not sure yet. Also, A1 oxidizes xenon. Xenon can be oxidized to XeF2 or XeF4 or XeF6. So if A1 is a strong oxidizing agent, perhaps it's a fluorinating agent as well. Wait, the decomposition of A1 gives F2, so A1 has more fluorine atoms than A2. Because F2 is being released, so maybe A1 has more F than A2.

Let me think about what happens when a binary fluoride decomposes to form F2. For example, if A1 is YF3 and it decomposes into YF2 and F2. Or maybe YF4 → YF2 + 2F2? Wait, let's see the stoichiometry.

Wait, the problem says that after decomposition, the ɷF (I think that's the degree of unsaturation or maybe it's the oxidation state?) is 31.96%. Hmm, that part might be tricky. Alternatively, ɷF might refer to the molar amount of F. Wait, the wording says "ɷF=31,96%". Oh, maybe it's the percentage composition by mass of F in A2. So A2 has 31.96% fluorine by mass.

31.96% of what? Let's see, fluorine has an atomic weight of about 19 (I remember F is 19). So if, in A2, F is 31.96% by mass, let's
