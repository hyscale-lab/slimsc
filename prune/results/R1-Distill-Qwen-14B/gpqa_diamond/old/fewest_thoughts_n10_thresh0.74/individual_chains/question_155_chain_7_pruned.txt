Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again and break it down.

So, the question is about finding the uncertainty ΔP_z of the operator P_z. The system is in an eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. The state is given as a column vector: (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which I think means that the state is expressed in the P_z eigenbasis.

Hmm, I remember that the uncertainty in an operator is calculated using the formula ΔA = sqrt(⟨A²⟩ - ⟨A⟩²). So for P_z, I'll need to find the expectation values ⟨P_z⟩ and ⟨P_z²⟩.

Wait, but since the state is already an eigenstate of P_x, how does that relate? Well, the uncertainty in P_z is just based on the state's properties, regardless of what operator it's an eigenstate of. So maybe I don't have to worry about P_x too much here, except that the state is given in the P_z basis.

So, the state is |ψ⟩, and it's expressed as a column vector. Let me write that out:

|ψ⟩ = [ -1/2, 1/√2, -1/2 ]^T

Wait, but wait, wait. The matrix for P_z is given as:

P_z has rows:
[ ħ, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, 0 ]
[ 0, 0, -ħ ]

So, the eigenstates of P_z are the basis vectors. So each basis vector corresponds to one of these rows. So, the first basis vector is [1,0,0], the second [0,1,0], and the third [0,0,1], because the matrix is diagonal in this basis.

So, the state |ψ⟩ is a linear combination of these basis vectors. Let me see: the components are (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). So:

|ψ⟩ = (-1/2)|z=+ħ⟩ + (1/√
