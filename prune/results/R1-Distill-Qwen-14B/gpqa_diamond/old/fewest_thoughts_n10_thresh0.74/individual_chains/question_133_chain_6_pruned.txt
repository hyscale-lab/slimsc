Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³. That's 200 milliliters or 0.2 liters. The solution contains 1.00 g of KH2PO4 and 1.00 g of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The molecular weights are given as 136.09 g/mol and 177.99 g/mol respectively. The temperature is 25°C, and we're supposed to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions in the solution. 

Wait, orthophosphate ions... I remember that orthophosphate is PO4^3- right? So, the phosphate ion, PO4^3-, is what we're looking for. 

The problem also gives me the Ka values for H3PO4: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. So, these are the acid dissociation constants for each step of the phosphoric acid dissociation. 

Hmm, okay, so I think this is a buffer solution problem because we have two different phosphate species: KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. KH2PO4 is probably H2PO4^- (since K+ is a spectator ion), and Na2HPO4 is HPO4^2- (with Na+ as the spectator). 

So, the solution contains H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. I remember that when you have a mixture of a weak acid and its conjugate base, you can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. But wait, here we're asked about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. How does that fit in?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think. The phosphate species in solution are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and PO4^3-. But in this case, the solution has KH2PO4 (which is H2PO4^-) and Na2HPO4·2H2O (which is HPO4^2-). So, the solution is a buffer between H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-. 

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for this buffer would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-]). Because Ka2 is the dissociation of H2PO4^- to HPO4^2- and H+.

Wait, but the question is about the concentration of PO4^3- ions. How does that happen? Because PO4^3- is the conjugate base of HPO4^2-. So, HPO4^2- can donate another proton to form PO4^3- and H+. The Ka3 is given, which is 1.8e-12. That's a very small Ka, so PO4^3- concentration is going to be very low.
