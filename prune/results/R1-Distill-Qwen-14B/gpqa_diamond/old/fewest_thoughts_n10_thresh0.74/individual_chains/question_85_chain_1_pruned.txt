Okay, so I've got this question about planets orbiting a star and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, there's a star with 1.5 solar masses, 1.2 solar radii, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. Two planets are orbiting it. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and a radius 1.7 times Earth's. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses with a radius 1.3 times Earth's. Both orbits are circular.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. The options are given, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

Wait, equilibrium temperature. Right, that depends on a few factors. The formula I remember is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ) ) ? Or maybe I'm mixing it up. Oh wait, the formula is T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( ( (1 - A) )^(1/4) ), where A is the albedo. Since both planets have the same albedo, A is the same for both, so it will cancel out in the ratio.

So the ratio of T1 to T2 would be sqrt( (R_star/(2a1)) / (R_star/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ), because R_star is the same for both. So the ratio is sqrt(a2 / a1).

But wait, I need to find a1 and a2, the orbital distances. How do I get those?

The question mentions the RV method and transit method. Oh, right! The radial velocity method measures the Doppler shift, which gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The transit method gives the size of the planet relative to the star.

Wait, but how do the given RV shifts relate to the planets' masses? The RV method gives the mass of the planet (but with a sin i factor, but maybe that's not needed here). Alternatively, perhaps the given shifts can be used to find the velocity semi-amplitude, which relates to the orbital period and other factors.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what data is given.

The star's parameters: mass M = 1.5 Msun, radius R = 1.2 Rsun, Teff = 6300 K.

Planet1: M1 = 7 Earth masses, R1 =1.7 REarth.

Planet2: M2 =5 Earth masses, R2=1.3 REarth.

The RV shifts: Planet1 causes a shift of up to 0.03 angstrom in [OI] line at 6300 Å. Planet2 causes a shift of 0.04 angstrom.

Wait, the RV method measures the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v * sin i) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(0.5) )) )^(1/3) ) *
