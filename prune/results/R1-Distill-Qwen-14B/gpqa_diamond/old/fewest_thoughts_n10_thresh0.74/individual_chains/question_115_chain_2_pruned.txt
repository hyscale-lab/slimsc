Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about electrons and positrons annihilating and producing photons. Hmm, I need to figure out the angle between the two photons. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that an electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, but one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Wait, so I'm dealing with relativistic particles here. Lorentz factors are given, so I need to consider their relativistic masses and momenta. But wait, since it's an electron-positron pair, when they annihilate, they produce photons. The key here is conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me start by recalling some basic concepts. The Lorentz factor gamma is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). The relativistic momentum p is gamma * m * v. Also, energy E is gamma * m * c².

Since it's an electron and a positron, their rest masses are the same—m_e. But their directions are opposite. The electron is moving left to right, the positron right to left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the electron is moving from the left (so to the right?), and the positron from the right (so to the left?), along the horizontal axis. So their velocities are opposite. So their momenta are opposite in direction as well.

Since it's a collision, they come towards each other, so their momenta are in opposite directions. After collision, they annihilate into two photons. So I need to conserve both momentum and energy.

The problem states that the two photons have the same energy. That's an important point. Also, their directions are upper-right and lower-right. So both are moving towards the right, but one is above the axis and the other below. So the angle between them will be determined by their individual angles above and below the horizontal.

Wait, but how do I find their angles? Let me think about the conservation laws.

First, let's compute the total energy and momentum before the collision.
