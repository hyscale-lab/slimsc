Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem starts with Compound A, which has a specific proton NMR spectrum. It shows two signals: a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 6H and a quartet at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Hmm, I remember that in NMR, the splitting tells us about neighboring protons. Let me think about what this could mean.

So, the triplet at 0.9 ppm with 6H. Triplets usually mean each proton is next to two equivalent protons. 6H suggests maybe two sets of three equivalent protons each. Wait, maybe it's two methyl groups (each with 3H) attached to a CH2? Because if each CH3 is adjacent to a CH2, their protons would be split into a triplet. Wait, no, let me think. If a CH3 is next to a CH2, the CH2 would be a quartet. Because each proton in CH2 is adjacent to two from CH3 and maybe another from another CH2?

Wait, the quartet is at 1.3 ppm for 4H. Quartet means each proton is next to three equivalent protons. 4H could be a single CH2CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense. Or maybe two equivalent CH2 groups next to each other. Oh wait, perhaps it's a CH2CH2CH3? No, that might not fit. Alternatively, I think the quartet comes from a CH2 that's adjacent to another CH2 group which has two protons. So if I have a structure like (CH2CH3)2CH2, but I think I'm mixing things up.

Wait, maybe it's a diethyl group. Like if there are two ethyl groups attached to something. Because ethyl groups have CH2CH3. Let me think, the triplet for the CH3 (ethyl end) would be a triplet because the CH2 has two H's. But wait, in the NMR, the triplet is for the 6H, which would be two CH3 groups, each giving 3H. So each CH3 is next to a CH2, which has two H's, so each CH3 gives a triplet. So the two CH3 groups would integrate to 6H as a triplet. Then the quartet at 1.3 ppm is 4H, which would be the two CH2 groups. Each CH2 is next to another CH2 (like in ethyl groups), so each CH2 would be a quartet. So the structure could be (CH2CH3)2 something.

Wait, but the quartet is 4H, which would be two CH2 groups each with two H's. So the overall structure is probably (CH2CH3)2CH-something. But wait, wait. If it's (CH2CH2), no, maybe it's (CH2CH3)2CH2. Or wait, perhaps it's a neopentyl group, but that's more like (CH3)CCH2CH3, but that might have a different NMR.

Alternatively, I think of diethyl ether, but that's O(CH2CH3)2, but that would have more complex splitting. Maybe it's
