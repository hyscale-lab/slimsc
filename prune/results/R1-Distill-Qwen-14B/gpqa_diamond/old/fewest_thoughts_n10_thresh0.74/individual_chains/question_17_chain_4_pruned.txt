Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is about. 

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution. The solution contains 0.02 M of a stoichiometric Ca-EDTA complex. They also mention that the pH is ideal, and the temperature is 25°C. The given formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. 

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, which means it forms complexes with metal ions like Ca²+. The formation constant, K, tells us how strong the complex is. A larger K means the complex is more stable, so the ions are more likely to be bound.

So, the problem involves the dissociation of the Ca-EDTA complex. The complex is CaY²-, where Y is the EDTA^4- ion. The dissociation would be: CaY²- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-.

The formation constant K is given by K = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY²-]. Wait, but wait, I think the formation constant is usually written for the formation of the complex. Let me think. Oh right, the formation constant Kf is for the reaction: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA²-. So Kf = [CaEDTA²-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]).

But in this problem, they're giving K_Ca-EDTA as 5e10. So I think that K is the formation constant, since that's the usual way these are presented. But I should double-check.

Wait, the problem says K_Ca-EDTA is 5e10. So that would be Kf for the formation of the complex. So Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) = 5e10.

But wait, in solution, the complex is 0.02 M. So the concentration of the complex [CaY²-] is 0.02 M. We're asked to find [Ca²+], which is the concentration of free calcium ions.

So let me set up the equation. Kf = [CaY²-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) =
