Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about detecting large clouds of neutral hydrogen using optical telescopes. Hmm, let's see. I remember that neutral hydrogen emits or absorbs light at a specific wavelength. Oh right, the Lyman alpha line is around 1216 Angstroms, which is in the ultraviolet range. That's important because Earth's atmosphere doesn't let UV light through, so ground-based telescopes usually can't see it.

Wait, but the question is about absorption. So when a background quasar's light passes through a cloud of neutral hydrogen, the hydrogen absorbs at the Lyman alpha wavelength. But if that wavelength is shifted into the optical range because of the redshift, then ground-based telescopes can observe it.

Redshift, z, relates the observed wavelength (λ_observed) to the rest wavelength (λ_rest) by the formula λ_observed = λ_rest * (1 + z). So for the Lyman alpha line, λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms. We want to find the smallest redshift z such that the observed wavelength is in the optical range.

What's the optical range? I think optical is roughly from about 400 to 700 nm, which is 4000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms. So the observed wavelength needs to be at least 4000 Angstroms for ground-based telescopes to see it. Because if the Lyman alpha is at, say, 3000 Angstroms, that's still UV, and ground telescopes can't see it. So the lower limit would be when λ_observed is at the lower end of optical, maybe around 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

Let me plug in the numbers. We have λ_observed = 4000 Angstroms (since 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms). λ_rest is 1216 Angstroms. So:

4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)

So solving for z: 4000 / 1216 = 1 + z. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1216 is approximately 3.29. So 1 + z = 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29. Hmm, that's about 2.3.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4 and D is 1.9. So 2.3 is close to 2.4. But wait, the question says "lower limit" on redshift. Wait no, because higher redshift would make the observed wavelength longer (since λ_obs = λ_rest*(1+z)). So if the observed wavelength is at 4000 Angstroms, that's z ≈2.29. If the redshift is lower than that, the observed wavelength would be in UV, which we can't see. So the lower limit on z would actually be when z is as small as possible but the observed wavelength is just entering the optical. So the minimum z is when λ_obs is 4000 Angstroms, so the minimal z is about 2.29.

Looking at the options, the closest is C) 2.4. But wait, what if the telescope can't detect below a certain wavelength? Like, maybe the cutoff is a bit higher, like 4000 or higher. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately. 4000 / 1216 = let's see: 1216 * 3 is 3648, 4000 - 3648= 352. 1216 * 0.29 is approximately 1216 *0.3 is 364.8, minus 1216*0.01=12.16 → 364.8-12.16=352.64. So 3.29 is correct. So z is approximately 2.29.

So the lower limit on redshift is about 2.29. The options are 1.9 (D), 2.4 (C), 3 (A). So the minimum redshift is the smallest z that allows detection, which would be just when λ_obs is in the optical. So the lower limit is 2.29. The options that are higher or equal to this are C and A. But 3 is higher than 2.29, but since the question is about the lower limit, the minimal z is 2.29. So the lower limit is z ≈2.3, so the minimal redshift is 2.29. So the lower limit is when z is just enough to bring Lyman alpha into the optical, which is z ≈2.29.

But wait, the options are 2.4 and 1.9. 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. Wait, but 2.29 is higher than 1.9, so the minimal z is 2.29. So any z below that would make the observed wavelength less than 4000 Angstroms, which is UV and not detectable. So if the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift (the minimal z needed for detection), then the answer would be just above 2.29. Since 2.4 is higher than 2.29, but 1.9 is lower. So the correct answer would be the minimal z where it's possible, so the lower limit is z≈2.29. But the options don't
