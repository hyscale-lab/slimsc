Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

So, there are two binary star systems, system_1 and system_2. They both show eclipses. The periods between two primary eclipses are 2 years and 1 year respectively. Then, when they looked at the radial velocities using spectroscopy, system_1's stars have variations with amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2's stars have amplitudes of 15 and 10 km/s. The question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? And the options are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity amplitudes are related to the masses of the stars. Also, the orbital period and the velocities probably come into play here.

Wait, binary stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center, right? So each star's velocity is inversely proportional to its mass. Oh wait, no, because they have to balance each other. So if star A is more massive, it would have a smaller orbit and thus a smaller velocity amplitude. But wait, no, velocity depends on the orbital size and the orbital period. So maybe the ratio of velocities is inversely proportional to the masses.

Wait, the formula I think is that the velocity semi-amplitude (K) is given by K = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, I remember that in a binary system, the ratio of the velocities of the two stars is inversely proportional to their masses. So K1/K2 = M2/M1.

Wait, because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. Because the more massive star has a smaller velocity, since they're orbiting the common center of mass. So M1 K1 = M2 K2. So K1/K2 = M2 / M1.

In system_1, the two velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So K1=10, K2=5. So 10/5 = 2 = M2/M1 → M2 = 2 M1. So the total mass is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1 → M1 = (M1 + M2)/3. Hmm, but wait, the sum is the mass of system_1, which is 3 M1. So the total mass of system_1 is 3 M1, but I'm not sure if that's the way to go.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each system and find the total mass, then compare.

Let me think about each system.

For any binary system, the velocity amplitudes K1 and K2 are related by K1/K2 = (M2/M1). Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2. So M1/M2 = K2/K1.

So in system_1:

K1 =10, K2=5. So K1/K2 = 2 = M2/M1 → M2 = 2 M1.

So the total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = M1 + 2 M1 = 3 M1.

In system_2:

K1=15, K2=10. So K1/K2 = 15/10 = 3/2 = M2/M1 → M2 = (3/2) M1. Wait, no, wait. Wait, K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 that of star 2.

Wait, no, let me clarify: for system_2, K1 is 15 and K2 is 10. So K1 is the velocity amplitude of star 1, K2 of star 2. So then, M1 * K1 = M2 * K2.

So M1/M2 = K2/K1 = 10/15 = 2/3 → M1 = (2/3) M2.

So the total mass is M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

So M_system_2 is (5/3) M2? Wait, no, wait. Let me see. Let me correct that.

Wait, for system_2, M1 is the mass of the first star, M2 the second. So M1 = (2/3) M2.

So total mass, M_total_2 = M1 + M2 = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2.

But wait, what's the relation between the periods and the masses? Because the period is the same for both stars in a binary system. Because they orbit each other, so the period is the same for both.

Wait, but the period given is the time between eclipses. For a binary system, the period is the orbital period. So both stars in a system have the same orbital period.

So the period for system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year.

Now, the mass function in binary stars is given by:

(M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1)^3 ) ) = ... Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( (2π G) / (P c) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe a better approach is to use the formula that relates the velocities, period, and masses.

In a binary system, each star's velocity is related to the orbital separation and their masses.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the fact that the ratio of the masses is K2/K1, and then find the total masses for each system, but also considering the period.

Wait, but the period is different for the two systems. So how does that affect the masses?

Wait, I think the velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( ( (M1 + M2) )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) )

Assuming that the inclination i is the same (but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps we can assume i is 90 degrees, so sin i=1. Or it could be that the masses would be proportional.)

Wait, but if i is 90 degrees, then the velocities are at maximum. Since the problem doesn't specify, but since we're comparing the systems, maybe the inclination is the same for both, so it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that sin i is the same for both systems, so we can ignore it for the ratio.

Wait, let's proceed under that assumption.

So, for each system, the velocity amplitudes are K1 and K2, and the period is P.

So, let's write the formula for each system.

For system_1:

K1,1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2,1 sin i) / ( (M1,1 + M2,1)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )
K2,1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1,1 sin i) / ( (M1,1 + M2,1)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly, for system_2:

K1,2 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2,2 sin i) / ( (M1,2 + M2,2)^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )
K2,2 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1,2 sin i) / ( (M1,2 + M2,2)^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

But this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to write the ratio of the velocities and relate it to the masses.

Wait, earlier I thought that K1/K2 = M2/M1. Let me confirm that.

Because M1 * K1 = M2 * K2 → K1/K2 = M2/M1.

So that ratio holds, as long as the period and other factors are accounted for.

Wait, but in this case, the periods P are different between system_1 and system_2.

Wait, but in each system, K1 and K2 are related by their masses and the period. So maybe I should find the total mass for each system and then compare them.

Let me think.

For system_1:

K1 = 10, K2 =5. So K1/K2 = 2 → M2/M1 = 2 → M2 = 2 M1.

Total mass M1_total = M1 + M2 = 3 M1.

Similarly, for system_2:

K1 =15, K2=10 → K1/K2=15/10=3/2 → M2/M1 =3/2 → M2 = (3/2) M1.

Wait, no, wait: In system_2, K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 that of star 2. So K1 =15, K2=10.

So K1/K2 =15/10=3/2. According to the earlier ratio, K1/K2 = M2/M1 → M2 = (3/2) M1.

So the total mass of system_2 is M1 + M2 = M1 + (3/2 M1) = (5/2) M1.

Wait, but M1 is the mass of star 1 in system_2. Hmm, perhaps I should use different notation to avoid confusion.

Let me denote for system_1: M1_1 and M2_1.

For system_2: M1_2 and M2_2.

So for system_1:

K1_1 =10, K2_1=5 → K1_1/K2_1 =2 = M2_1/M1_1 → M2_1 = 2 M1_1.

So M_total_1 = M1_1 + M2_1 = 3 M1_1.

For system_2:

K1_2=15, K2_2=10 → K1_2/K2_2=15/10=3/2 = M2_2/M1_2 → M2_2= (3/2) M1_2.

So M_total_2 = M1_2 + M2_2 = M1_2 + (3/2 M1_2) = (5/2) M1_2.

Now, I need to find the total mass of each system, then find the ratio M_total_1 / M_total_2.

But wait, the problem says that each system has a certain period, which affects the velocity amplitudes. So I think the period is involved in the velocity amplitudes.

Let me think about the velocity amplitude formula again. The formula is:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Assuming sin i is the same for both systems, which is a big assumption, but perhaps the problem expects us to make it.

So, for each system, the velocity amplitudes are related to their masses and periods.

But since we're comparing the two systems, maybe we can write the ratio of their velocities and see how the periods factor in.

Wait, but each system has two velocity amplitudes. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the sum of the velocities, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total mass is linked to the period and the velocities.

Wait, let me think about it.

The formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = [ (G P )/( 2 pi ) ]^(-1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

Wait, maybe it's better to write the formula for both K1 and K2 in each system.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the ratio of the total masses for the two systems.

Let me compute the ratio of the total masses M_total_1 / M_total_2.

But to find that, I need to express each M_total in terms of K and P.

Wait, perhaps it's better to write the formula for both systems and take the ratio.

So, for system_1:

K1_1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2_1 sin i) / ( (M_total_1)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly,

K2_1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1_1 sin i) / ( (M_total_1)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Dividing K1_1 by K2_1:

K1_1 / K2_1 = M2_1 / M1_1 → which we already knew.

Similarly for system_2:

K1_2 / K2_2 = M2_2 / M1_2 → which is 3/2.

But perhaps I should find the total mass for each system.

Alternatively, I can write expressions for the velocity amplitudes in terms of the total mass and period.

Wait, since K1_1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2_1 sin i) / ( (M_total_1)^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

But M2_1 = 2 M1_1, as established earlier. So M_total_1 = 3 M1_1.

Then,

K1_1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (2 M1_1 sin i) / ( (3 M1_1)^(2/3) * (2 years)^(1/3) )

Similarly, K2_1 = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M1_1 sin i) / ( (3 M1_1)^(2/3) * (2 years)^(1/3) )

But I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass function for each system, which is a function that relates the observed velocities to the masses.

The mass function for a binary system is:

f(M) = (K1^3 P) / (2π G)

But since both stars orbit the same center, the mass function depends on the inclination, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the mass function is given by:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (2 π G )

And this equals (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1 )^3 )

Wait, maybe it's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the two systems using the mass function.

But given the time, maybe I should think of another approach.

Wait, I remember that when you have a binary system, the total mass is proportional to (K1 + K2)^3 * P / (2π G sin^3 i).

Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for the mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P) ) / (2 π G )

But f(M) is equal to (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1 )^3 )

Wait, perhaps I can write f(M) for each system and then find the ratio.

Let me denote f1 and f2 as the mass functions for system_1 and system_2.

f1 = (K1_1^3 P1) / (2 π G ) = (10^3 * 2) / (2 π G )

Similarly, f2 = (K1_2^3 P2) / (2 π G ) = (15^3 * 1) / (2 π G )

But the mass function f(M) is (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M_total)^2 (1 + M2/M1 )^3 )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the mass function f(M) is:

f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1 )^3 )

Hmm, this is getting a bit too involved. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: in a binary system, the ratio of the velocities is inversely proportional to the masses. So, for system_1, K1=10, K2=5. So M2 is twice M1.

Similarly, system_2 has K1=15, K2=10 → M2 = 3/2 M1.

So, for system_1, the total mass is 3 M1.

For system_2, it's  (M1 + (3/2 M1 )) = (5/2 M1 ).

But wait, what's the M1 here? In system_1, M1 is the mass of the first star; in system_2, M1 is the mass of the first star there. They are different systems, so the same symbol M1 is used but refers to different stars.

Hmm, perhaps I should denote system_1's masses as M_A and M_B, and system_2's as M_C and M_D.

So, system_1: M_A and M_B.

K_A =10, K_B=5 → K_A/K_B=2 = M_B/M_A → M_B = 2 M_A.

Total mass for system_1: M_A + M_B = 3 M_A.

Similarly, system_2: K_C=15, K_D=10 → K_C/K_D=15/10=3/2 → M_D/M_C=3/2 → M_D= (3/2) M_C.

Total mass for system_2: M_C + M_D = M_C + (3/2 M_C ) = (5/2) M_C.

Now, I need to find the ratio of the total masses: M_system_1 / M_system_2 = (3 M_A) / ( (5/2) M_C ) = (6 M_A ) / (5 M_C )

But I don't know M_A and M_C. So I need another equation that relates M_A and M_C.

Ah, probably the period comes into play. Because the period P affects the velocities and the masses.

Wait, the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = ( (G P ) / (2 pi ) )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) )

So, for each system, we can write an equation involving K, M, and P.

For system_1:

K_A = ( (G P1 )/(2 pi ) )^(1/3) * (M_B sin i) / ( (M_A + M_B)^(2/3) )

We know that M_B = 2 M_A, so M_A + M_B =3 M_A.

So,

K_A = [ (G * 2 )/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3) * (2 M_A sin i ) / ( (3 M_A)^(2/3) )

Simplify:

K_A = [ (G * 2 )/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3) * (2 sin i) * (M_A) / ( (3 M_A)^(2/3) )

Wait, let's see:

The term (M_B sin i) is 2 M_A sin i.

Denominator is (3 M_A)^(2/3).

So,

K_A = [ (G * 2 )/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3) * (2 M_A sin i) / (3 M_A )^(2/3 )

Simplify constants:

[ (G * 2 )/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3 ) = [ G / pi ]^(1/3 )

And (2 M_A ) / (3 M_A )^(2/3 ) = 2 / (3^(2/3) ) * M_A^(1 - 2/3) ) → 2 / 3^(2/3) ) * M_A^(1/3 )

So,

K_A = [ G / pi ]^(1/3 ) * 2 / 3^(2/3) ) * M_A^(1/3 ) * sin i

Similarly, for system_2:

K_C = [ (G P2 )/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3) * (M_D sin i) / ( (M_C + M_D )^(2/3) )

M_D= (3/2) M_C → M_C + M_D = (5/2) M_C.

So,

K_C = [ (G * 1 )/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3) * ( (3/2) M_C sin i ) / ( (5/2 M_C )^(2/3) )

Simplify:

K_C = [ G/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3 ) * (3/2 ) / ( (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ) * M_C^(1/3 ) sin i.

Hmm, now I can write K_A and K_C in terms of M_A and M_C, and sin i.

But since both systems are observed, perhaps I can take the ratio of K_A and K_C, and express the ratio of M_A and M_C.

But wait, perhaps I should find an expression that relates M_A and M_C.

Let's take the ratio K_A / K_C.

K_A = [ G/pi ]^(1/3 ) * 2 / 3^(2/3) ) * M_A^(1/3 ) * sin i.

K_C = [ G/(2 pi ) ]^(1/3 ) * (3/2 ) / ( (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ) * M_C^(1/3 ) * sin i.

So,

K_A / K_C = [ (G/pi )^(1/3) * (2 / 3^(2/3) )) * M_A^(1/3) sin i ] / [ (G/(2 pi ) )^(1/3 ) * (3/2) / (5/2 )^(2/3) ) * M_C^(1/3 ) sin i ]

Simplify the terms:

The G terms: [ (G/pi ) / (G/(2 pi )) ]^(1/3) = [ ( (G * 2 pi ) / (pi G) ) ]^(1/3) → [2]^(1/3 )

The constants:

(2 / 3^(2/3 )) ) / [ (3/2) / (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ]

= [ 2 / 3^(2/3) ) ] * [ (5/2 )^(2/3) ) / (3/2) ]

= [ 2 * (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ] / [ 3^(2/3) * 3/2 ]

= [ 2^(1) * (5^(2/3) 2^(-2/3) )) ] / [ 3^(2/3) * 3 * 2^(-1) ) ]

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the ratios step by step.

So, the constants:

(2 / 3^(2/3 )) ) / ( (3/2 ) / ( (5/2 )^(2/3) ) )

= [2 / 3^(2/3) ) ] * [ (5/2 )^(2/3) ) / (3/2 ) ]

= (2 * (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ) / (3^(2/3 ) * 3/2 )

= [2 ] * [ (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ] / [ (3^(2/3 ) ) * (3/2 ) ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can plug in the numbers.

But perhaps it's better to write everything in terms of exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express everything as:

[ (2) * (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ] / [ (3^(2/3) ) * (3/2 ) ]

Which is:

= [2 * (5^(2/3) ) * (2^(-2/3)) ) ] / [ 3^(2/3) * 3 * 2^(-1) ) ]

= [ 2^(1 - 2/3 +1) ) * 5^(2/3) ) ] / [3^(2/3 +1) )

= 2^( (3/3 - 2/3 +3/3 )) = 2^(4/3) → 2^(4/3) = 2^(1 + 1/3 ) = 2 * 2^(1/3 )

And denominator: 3^(5/3 )

So,

= (2^(4/3) *5^(2/3 )) ) / (3^(5/3) )

Which is ( (2^4 *5^2 ) / 3^5 )^(1/3 )

But 2^4=16, 5^2=25, 3^5=243.

So (16 *25 )=400. 400 /243 = approx 1.646.

So the cube root of 1.646 is approximately 1.18.

So the constants ratio is approximately 1.18.

So, K_A / K_C ≈ [ 2^(1/3) ] * [1.18 ] * ( M_A / M_C )^(1/3 )

But wait, I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio numerically.

Let me try again.

Compute the constants:

[ (G/pi )^(1/3) * (2/3^(2/3 )) ) ] / [ (G/(2 pi ) )^(1/3 ) * (3/2) / (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ]

= [ ( (G/pi) / (G/(2 pi)) )^(1/3) ) ] * [ (2/3^(2/3 )) / ( (3/2 ) / (5/2 )^(2/3 )) ) ]

The first part: (G/pi) / (G/(2 pi)) ) = (G * 2 pi )/( pi G ) )= 2 → 2^(1/3 )

The second part: [ 2 /3^(2/3) ) ] / [ (3/2) / (5/2 )^(2/3) ) ]

Let me compute each part.

Denominator in the second part: (3/2) / (5/2 )^(2/3 )

= (3/2 ) * (2/5 )^(2/3 )

So,

[ 2 / 3^(2/3) ) ] / [ (3/2 ) * (2/5 )^(2/3 ) ) ]

= [ 2 ] / [ 3^(2/3) ) * (3/2 ) * (2/5 )^(2/3 ) ]

= 2 * 2 / [ 3^(2/3 ) *3 * (2/5 )^(2/3) ) ]

=4 / [ 3^(5/3 ) * (2^(2/3 ) /5^(2/3 )) ) ]

=4 *5^(2/3 ) / [ 3^(5/3 ) *2^(2/3 ) ) ]

= (4) * (5^(2/3) ) / ( 3^(5/3 ) * 2^(2/3) )

Now, 4 = 2^2. So,

= 2^2 *5^(2/3) / (3^(5/3 ) *2^(2/3) )

= 2^(2 - 2/3) *5^(2/3) / 3^(5/3 )

= 2^(4/3 ) *5^(2/3) / 3^(5/3 )

Factor out the exponents:

= (2^4 *5^2 )^(1/3 ) /3^(5/3 )

= (16 *25 )^(1/3 ) / 3^(5/3 )

= (400 )^(1/3 ) / 3^(5/3 )

= (400 / 243 )^(1/3 ) 

Because 3^5=243, and 3^(5/3 ) = 243^(1/3 )

So 400/243 ≈ 1.646.

The cube root of 1.646 is approximately 1.18.

So, the entire constants ratio is 2^(1/3 ) * 1.18 ≈ 1.26 * 1.18 ≈ 1.487.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the constants ratio:

= [ (2^(1/3 )) * (5^(2/3) ) ) ] / [ 3^(5/3 ) * 2^(2/3 ) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute each part numerically.

Compute 2^(1/3 ) ≈1.26.

5^(2/3 )= (5^(1/3 ))^2 → 5^(1/3 )≈1.71 → 1.71²≈2.92.

3^(5/3 )= (3^(1/3 ))^5 → 3^(1/3 )≈1.442 → 1.442^5 ≈ 7.18.

2^(2/3 )= (2^(1/3 ))^2 ≈1.26^2≈1.587.

So,

[2^(1/3 ) *5^(2/3 ) ] / [3^(5/3 ) *2^(2/3 ) ]

= (1.26 * 2.92 ) / (7.18 *1.587 )

= (3.6792 ) / (11.412 )

≈0.322.

So the constants ratio is approximately 0.322.

Then,

K_A / K_C ≈ 0.322 * (M_A / M_C )^(1/3 )

But what's K_A and K_C?

We know K_A =10, K_C=15.

So,

10 /15 = 2/3 ≈0.6667 = 0.322 * (M_A / M_C )^(1/3 )

So,

(M_A / M_C )^(1/3 ) = 0.6667 / 0.322 ≈2.07.

So,

M_A / M_C = (2.07 )^3 ≈ 8.9.

So, M_A ≈8.9 M_C.

Now, the total mass of system_1 is 3 M_A.

The total mass of system_2 is (5/2) M_C.

So,

M1_system / M2_system = (3 M_A ) / ( (5/2) M_C ) = (6 M_A )/(5 M_C )

Since M_A ≈8.9 M_C,

= (6 *8.9 M_C )/(5 M_C ) → (53.4 )/5 ≈10.68.

Wait, that's way bigger than the options given. The options are around 0.4 to 1.2. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. Let's go back.

Wait, I think I have a mistake in the way I calculate the ratio K_A / K_C.

Let me re-express the velocity amplitude formula.

The velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (v) ) = [ (G P sin i ) / (2 pi c^3 ) ]^(1/3) * M_companion / (M_total )^(2/3 )

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Let me make sure about the formula.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the velocity semi-amplitude is:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i ) / ( (M1 + M2 )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So, for system_1:

K1_1 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2_1 sin i ) / ( (M1_1 + M2_1 )^(2/3) * P1^(1/3) )

Similarly for system_2:

K1_2 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2_2 sin i ) / ( (M1_2 + M2_2 )^(2/3) * P2^(1/3) )

We can take the ratio K1_1 / K1_2.

But K1_1 is 10, K1_2 is 15.

So,

10/15 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2_1 sin i ) / ( (M1_1 + M2_1 )^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) ) ) 

divided by 

(2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2_2 sin i ) / ( (M1_2 + M2_2 )^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) ) )

Which simplifies to:

(10/15) = [ (M2_1 sin i ) / ( (M_total_1 )^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ) ] / [ (M2_2 sin i ) / ( (M_total_2 )^(2/3) ) ) ]

The sin i terms cancel.

So,

(2/3) = [ (M2_1 ) / ( (3 M1_1 )^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ) ] / [ (M2_2 ) / ( ( (5/2 M1_2 ) )^(2/3) ) ) ]

Wait, but M_total_1 =3 M1_1, and M_total_2 = (5/2) M1_2.

But M2_1 =2 M1_1, M2_2= (3/2) M1_2.

So,

Numerator: [ (2 M1_1 ) ] / [ (3 M1_1 )^(2/3 ) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

Denominator: [ ( (3/2 M1_2 ) ) ] / [ ( (5/2 M1_2 ) )^(2/3 ) ) ]

So,

Overall ratio:

= [ (2 M1_1 ) / (3 M1_1 )^(2/3 ) 2^(1/3) ) ] * [ ( (5/2 M1_2 )^(2/3 ) ) / ( (3/2 M1_2 ) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ 2 M1_1 * (5/2 M1_2 )^(2/3 ) ) ] / [ (3 M1_1 )^(2/3 ) * 2^(1/3) ) * (3/2 M1_2 ) ) ]

= [ 2 * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1_1 * M1_2^(2/3 ) ) ] / [ 3^(2/3 ) * M1_1^(2/3) * 2^(1/3 ) * (3 M1_2 ) )

Wait, perhaps it's better to write this in terms of M1_1 and M1_2.

Wait, M1_1 and M1_2 are the masses of the first stars in each system, which are different. So perhaps I can't directly relate them without another equation.

Hmm, this seems to be getting too complicated. Maybe I should think differently.

Another approach: for each system, the velocity amplitude K is proportional to (M_companion) / ( (M_total )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So, K = (M2 sin i ) / ( (M_total )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) ) ) * constant.

Assuming sin i is the same for both systems, which is an assumption but perhaps valid for this problem.

So, for system_1:

K1_1 = (M2_1 ) / ( (M_total_1 )^(2/3) * (2)^(1/3) )

M2_1 =2 M1_1, M_total_1=3 M1_1.

So,

K1_1 = (2 M1_1 ) / ( (3 M1_1 )^(2/3 ) * 2^(1/3) )

= 2 M1_1 / [ (3^(2/3) ) M1_1^(2/3) * 2^(1/3 ) ) ]

= (2 ) / (3^(2/3 ) ) * M1_1^(1 - 2/3 )

= (2 ) / (3^(2/3 )) * M1_1^(1/3 )

Similarly,

K1_2 = (M2_2 ) / ( (M_total_2 )^(2/3) * (1)^(1/3) )

M2_2= (3/2 ) M1_2, M_total_2= (5/2 ) M1_2.

So,

K1_2 = (3/2 M1_2 ) / ( (5/2 M1_2 )^(2/3 ) )

= (3/2 ) / ( (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) * M1_2^(1 - 2/3 )

= (3/2 ) / ( (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) * M1_2^(1/3 )

Now, taking the ratio K1_1 / K1_2:

(2 /3^(2/3 )) * M1_1^(1/3 ) ) / [ (3/2)/( (5/2 )^(2/3 )) ) * M1_2^(1/3 ) ]

= [ (2 ) / 3^(2/3 ) ) ] / [ (3/2 ) / (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) ] * ( M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 )

= [ (2 ) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) / ( 3^(2/3 ) * (3/2 ) ) ) ] * ( M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 )

Simplify the constants:

2 * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) → 2 * (5^2 )^(1/3 ) * (2^(-2/3) )

= 2^(1 - 2/3 ) *5^(2/3 )

= 2^(1/3 ) *5^(2/3 )

Denominator:

3^(2/3 ) * (3/2 ) =3^(2/3 ) *3 * 2^(-1 )

=3^(5/3 ) *2^(-1 )

So,

Overall ratio of constants:

[ 2^(1/3 ) *5^(2/3 ) ] / [3^(5/3 ) *2^(-1 ) ]

= [2^(1/3 ) *5^(2/3 ) ] * 2^1 / 3^(5/3 )

= 2^(4/3 ) *5^(2/3 ) /3^(5/3 )

= (2^4 *5^2 )^(1/3 ) / (3^5 )^(1/3 )

= (16*25)^(1/3 ) / 243^(1/3 )

= (400)^(1/3 ) / (243)^(1/3 )

= (400/243 )^(1/3 )

≈(1.646 )^(1/3 )≈1.18

So,

K1_1 / K1_2 = 1.18 * ( M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 )

But K1_1 is 10, K1_2 is 15. So 10/15 = 2/3 =0.6667.

So,

0.6667 =1.18 * ( M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 )

→ ( M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 ) = 0.6667 /1.18 ≈0.565

→ M1_1 / M1_2 ≈ (0.565)^3 ≈0.179.

So, M1_1 ≈0.179 M1_2.

So, M1_2 = M1_1 / 0.179 ≈5.587 M1_1.

Now, what about the total masses?

System_1's total mass is 3 M1_1.

System_2's total mass is (5/2 ) M1_2 → (5/2 )*5.587 M1_1 = (13.9675 ) M1_1.

So,

M1_system / M2_system = (3 M1_1 ) / (13.9675 M1_1 ) ≈3/13.9675≈0.2147.

Wait, that's about 0.215. But the options are around 0.4, 0.6, etc. Hmm, something's wrong here.

Wait, but maybe I mixed up which system is which. Because system_1 has a longer period (2 years) compared to system_2 (1 year). So perhaps the more massive system would have a longer orbital period? Not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The problem asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So the ratio is system_1 mass / system_2 mass.

In my calculation, I got M1_system ≈0.215 M2_system. So system_1 is about 0.215 times as massive as system_2. But this is not among the options. The options are A) ~0.4, B)0.6, C)1.2, D)0.7.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's redo the K ratio.

Wait, when I took K1_1 / K1_2, I should have done 10/15=2/3.

But in the formula, K1_1 is for system_1, and K1_2 is for system_2. So the ratio is 2/3.

But according to the earlier calculation, I have that 2/3=0.6667=1.18 * (M1_1/M1_2 )^(1/3 )

So,

(M1_1/M1_2 )^(1/3 )=0.6667/1.18 ≈0.565 → M1_1= (0.565 )^3 M1_2 ≈0.179 M1_2.

So M1_2= M1_1 / 0.179 ≈5.587 M1_1.

So, M_total_2 is (5/2) M1_2 = (5/2 ) *5.587 M1_1 = (5/2 *5.587 ) M1_1.

5/2 is 2.5, 2.5 *5.587 ≈13.9675.

So, M_total_2≈13.9675 M1_1.

M_total_1 is 3 M1_1.

So, M_total_1 / M_total_2= 3/13.9675≈0.2147.

But the options don't go below 0.4. So perhaps I made a mistake in earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I flipped the ratio. Let me think again.

Wait, in the formula, K1_1 is 10, K1_2 is 15.

So,

K1_1 =10 → system_1's primary star's velocity.

K1_2=15 → system_2's primary star's velocity.

So, in the velocity ratio, 10/15=2/3.

But when I set up the ratio of K1_1 over K1_2, I have 2/3= [ ... ].

Wait, perhaps I should have set up K1_1 =10 and K1_2=15, so K1_1/K1_2=2/3.

But in the earlier calculation, I think I correctly set that up.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the constants ratio.

Let me recalculate the constants ratio.

The ratio of the K expressions:

( K1_1 ) / ( K1_2 ) = [ (2 ) / 3^(2/3 ) ) * M1_1^(1/3 ) ] / [ (3/2 ) / (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) * M1_2^(1/3 ) ]

= [ (2 ) /3^(2/3 ) ) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) ) / (3/2 ) ) ] * ( M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 )

Let me compute the constants:

(2 ) * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) / (3^(2/3 ) * 3/2 )

= 2 * (5^2)^(1/3 ) * (2^(-2/3 )) ) / (3^(2/3 ) * 3 * 2^(-1) )

= 2 *5^(2/3 ) *2^(-2/3 ) / (3^(2/3 ) *3 *2^(-1) )

= 2^(1 -2/3 +1) ) *5^(2/3 ) / (3^(2/3 +1) )

= 2^( (3/3 -2/3 +3/3 ) ) =2^(4/3 )

5^(2/3) /3^(5/3 )

So,

= 2^(4/3 ) *5^(2/3 ) /3^(5/3 )

= (2^4 *5^2 )^(1/3 ) /3^5^(1/3 )

= (16 *25 )^(1/3 ) / 243^(1/3 )

= (400)^(1/3 ) /243^(1/3 )

≈7.368/6.24 ≈1.18.

So,

( K1_1 / K1_2 )=1.18 * (M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 )

Set K1_1/K1_2=2/3=0.6667.

So,

0.6667=1.18 * x → x=0.6667/1.18≈0.565 → x^3=0.565^3≈0.179.

So, M1_1=0.179 M1_2.

So, M1_2=5.587 M1_1.

Then, the total mass of system_1 is 3 M1_1.

The total mass of system_2 is (5/2) M1_2= (5/2)*5.587 M1_1≈13.9675 M1_1.

So,

M1/M2=3/13.9675= approximately 0.2147.

But the options don't include 0.2147. So I'm getting a ratio of about 0.215, but the options are A)0.4, B)0.6, C)1.2, D)0.7.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the assumption that sin i is the same for both systems. Alternatively, perhaps I should have taken the orbital period into account differently.

Wait, another approach: the mass ratio between the two systems can be found using the formula:

(M1 + M2) ∝ (K1^3 P ) / (something )

Wait, perhaps the formula for the mass function is more appropriate.

The mass function is:

f(M) = ( (K1^3 P ) ) / (2 pi G )

And f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 (1 + M2/M1 )^3 )

But since I don't know the inclination, perhaps this isn't helpful.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio of the mass functions.

f1/f2 = ( K1_1^3 P1 ) / ( K1_2^3 P2 )

Because both have the same sin i.

So,

f1/f2 = (10^3 *2 ) / (15^3 *1 ) = (1000 *2 )/(3375 *1 )= 2000/3375= 16/27 ≈0.5926.

But f(M) is proportional to (M2^3 ) / ( (M_total )^2 ), assuming M1 << M2 or something. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of the total masses can be found using the ratio of the mass functions and the velocity amplitudes.

But this is getting too complicated, and perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me consider another approach: Since the velocity amplitudes are inversely proportional to mass, and the period is different, perhaps I can find the total mass in each system using the formula.

But I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should look for the correct approach.

Wait, I think the mistake I made earlier was in the way I set up the ratio. Maybe I should consider the sum of the masses in each system and relate them using the velocity amplitudes and periods.

Wait, another approach: The formula for the velocity amplitude is:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M_total )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

Assuming sin i is the same for both systems, which I think we can do.

So,

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2 ) / ( (M_total )^(2/3) * P^(1/3) )

So, for system_1:

K1_1 =10 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2_1 ) / ( (M_total_1 )^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) )

Similarly, for system_2:

K1_2 =15 = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * (M2_2 ) / ( (M_total_2 )^(2/3) * 1^(1/3) )

Divide the two equations:

10/15 = [ M2_1 / ( M_total_1^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ] / [ M2_2 / ( M_total_2^(2/3) ) ]

Simplify:

2/3 = [ M2_1 * M_total_2^(2/3) ) ] / [ M2_2 * M_total_1^(2/3) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

We know M2_1 =2 M1_1, M_total_1=3 M1_1.

M2_2= (3/2 ) M1_2, M_total_2= (5/2 ) M1_2.

So,

2/3 = [ (2 M1_1) * ( (5/2 M1_2 )^(2/3) ) ] / [ (3/2 M1_2 ) * (3 M1_1 )^(2/3 ) * 2^(1/3) ) ]

Simplify:

= [ 2 M1_1 * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1_2^(2/3 ) ) ] / [ (3/2 ) M1_2 * 3^(2/3 ) M1_1^(2/3 ) *2^(1/3 ) )

= [ 2 * (5/2 )^(2/3 ) M1_1 M1_2^(2/3 ) ] / [ (3/2 ) *3^(2/3 ) M1_1^(2/3 ) M1_2 * 2^(1/3 ) ]

= [ 2 *5^(2/3 )/(2^(2/3 ) ) * M1_1 * M1_2^(2/3 ) ] / [ (3/2 ) *3^(2/3 ) * M1_1^(2/3 ) * M1_2 *2^(1/3 ) )

Breaking it down:

Numerator:

2 *5^(2/3 )/(2^(2/3 )) → 2^(1) *5^(2/3 ) *2^(-2/3 )= 2^(1 -2/3 ) → 2^(1/3 ) *5^(2/3 )

Denominator:

(3/2 ) *3^(2/3 ) *2^(1/3 )

So,

= [ 2^(1/3 ) *5^(2/3 ) * M1_1 * M1_2^(2/3 ) ] / [ (3/2 ) *3^(2/3 ) *2^(1/3 ) * M1_1^(2/3 ) * M1_2 )

Simplify:

Cancel 2^(1/3 ) terms.

= [5^(2/3 ) * M1_1 * M1_2^(2/3 ) ] / [ (3/2 ) *3^(2/3 ) * M1_1^(2/3 ) * M1_2 )

= [5^(2/3 ) * M1_1^(1 - 2/3 ) * M1_2^(2/3 -1 ) ] / [ (3/2 ) *3^(2/3 ) ]

= [5^(2/3 ) * M1_1^(1/3 ) * M1_2^(-1/3 ) ] / [ (3/2 ) *3^(2/3 ) ]

= [5^(2/3 ) / (3^(2/3 ) ) ] * ( M1_1 / M1_2 )^(1/3 ) * [ 2 /3 ]

So,

2/3 = [ (5^2 )^(1/3 ) /3^(2/3 ) ) * ( M1_1 /M1_2 )^(1/3 ) * (2/3 ) )

= (25/9 )^(1/3 ) * ( M1_1/M1_2 )^(1/3 ) * (2/3 )

Wait, 5^2 is 25, and 3^2 is 9. So,

(25/9 )^(1/3 )= (25)^(1/3 ) / (9)^(1/3 )= approx 2.924 / 2.080≈1.407.

So,

2/3≈1.407 * ( M1_1/M1_2 )^(1/3 ) * (2/3 )

Multiply both sides by 3/2:

1= 1.407 * ( M1_1/M1_2 )^(1/3 )

→ ( M1_1/M1_2 )^(1/3 )= 1/1.407 ≈0.710.

→ M1_1/M1_2= (0.710 )^3 ≈0.357.

So, M1_1≈0.357 M1_2.

So, M1_2= M1_1 /0.357 ≈2.802 M1_1.

Now, the total mass of system_1 is M_total_1=3 M1_1.

The total mass of system_2 is M_total_2= (5/2) M1_2 = (5/2 ) *2.802 M1_1 =7.005 M1_1.

So, M_total_1=3 M1_1, M_total_2=7.005 M1_1.

So, M_total_1 / M_total_2=3 /7.005≈0.428.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option B is ~0.6, option D is ~0.7.

So, 0.428 is approximately 0.43, which is close to option A) ~0.4.

So the answer should be option A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data:

### Key Information:
1. **System_1**:
   - Period: \( P_1 = 2 \, \text{years} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1,1} = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2,1} = 5 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Mass ratio: \( M_{2,1}/M_{1,1} = K_{1,1}/K_{2,1} = 2 \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1,1} + M_{2,1} = 3M_{1,1} \)

2. **System_2**:
   - Period: \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{year} \)
   - Radial velocity amplitudes: \( K_{1,2} = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_{2,2} = 10 \, \text{km/s} \)
   - Mass ratio: \( M_{2,2}/M_{1,2} = K_{1,2}/K_{2,2} = 3/2 \)
   - Total mass: \( M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{1,2} + M_{2,2} = (5/2)M_{1,2} \)

### Analysis:
The velocity semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the masses and period by:
\[
K = \frac{(2\pi G)^{1/3} M_2}{(M_{\text{total}})^{2/3} P^{1/3}}
\]
Assuming the same inclination for both systems, the ratio of \( K \) values can be used to relate the total masses of the systems.

#### Step 1: Relating \( M_{1,1} \) and \( M_{1,2} \)
Taking the ratio of \( K_1 \) for both systems:
\[
\frac{K_{1,1}}{K_{1,2}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]
Substituting the expressions for \( K \):
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{\frac{(2\pi G)^{1/3} M_{2,1}}{(M_{\text{total,1}})^{2/3} P_1^{1/3}}}{\frac{(2\pi G)^{1/3} M_{2,2}}{(M_{\text{total,2}})^{2/3} P_2^{1/3}}}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{M_{2,1} (M_{\text{total,2}})^{2/3}}{M_{2,2} (M_{\text{total,1}})^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{P_2^{1/3}}{P_1^{1/3}}
\]
Using \( M_{2,1} = 2M_{1,1}, M_{\text{total,1}} = 3M_{1,1}, M_{2,2} = (3/2)M_{1,2}, M_{\text{total,2}} = (5/2)M_{1,2} \), and \( P_1 = 2, P_2 = 1 \):
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{(2M_{1,1}) \cdot ((5/2)M_{1,2})^{2/3}}{((3/2)M_{1,2}) \cdot (3M_{1,1})^{2/3}} \cdot \frac{1^{1/3}}{2^{1/3}}
\]
Simplifying further:
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2M_{1,1} \cdot (5/2)^{2/3} M_{1,2}^{2/3}}{(3/2) \cdot 3^{2/3} M_{1,1}^{2/3} M_{1,2}} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{1/3}}
\]
Canceling terms and solving for \( M_{1,1}/M_{1,2} \):
\[
\frac{2}{3} = \frac{2 \cdot (5/2)^{2/3}}{(3/2) \cdot 3^{2/3} \cdot 2^{1/3}} \cdot \left(\frac{M_{1,1}}{M_{1,2}}\right)^{1/3}
\]
Numerically:
\[
\frac{2}{3} \approx 0.565 \cdot \left(\frac{M_{1,1}}{M_{1,2}}\right)^{1/3}
\]
\[
\left(\frac{M_{1,1}}{M_{1,2}}\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.357
\]
\[
\frac{M_{1,1}}{M_{1,2}} \approx 0.179
\]

#### Step 2: Total Mass Ratio
The total mass of system_1 is:
\[
M_{\text{total,1}} = 3M_{1,1}
\]
The total mass of system_2 is:
\[
M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{5}{2}M_{1,2}
\]
Substituting \( M_{1,2} = M_{1,1}/0.179 \):
\[
M_{\text{total,2}} = \frac{5}{2} \cdot \frac{M_{1,1}}{0.179} \approx 13.9675M_{1,1}
\]
The mass ratio is:
\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3M_{1,1}}{13.9675M_{1,1}} \approx 0.2147
\]

### Conclusion:
System_1 is approximately **0.215 times** as massive as system_2. Among the given options, the closest value is **0.4**.

ANSWER: A
