Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me go through it slowly because I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts.

So the question is about a substance X that reacts violently with liquid Y, producing a gas W, a precipitate G, and possibly some other products. The gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. Then, when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point close to 277 K. There's also a part about a reaction with a keto acid producing a product with two oxygen atoms. Plus, substance X is used as a reagent in organic chemistry, and it incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements.

Alright, let's break this down.

First, what is the gas W? The molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. So, if each molecule has the same number of protons and neutrons, that suggests it's a molecule where each atom's neutron count equals the proton count. Or wait, maybe the total for the molecule as a whole? Hmm. Let's think about possible gases that fit.

Wait, the molecule as a whole has the same number of protons and neutrons. For example, H2O has 10 protons (O has 8, two Hs) and 8 + 2*1 =10 neutrons? Wait, no. Wait, O normally has 8 protons, and its common isotope is O-16 with 8 neutrons. So H2O would have 10 protons (8+2) and 8+2*0 (since H has no neutrons) =8? So that wouldn't match. Hmm, maybe another gas.

What about CO2? Carbon has 6 protons, O has 8. CO2 has 6 + 2*8=22 protons. For neutrons: Carbon-12 has 6 neutrons, O-16 has 8. So total neutrons would be 6 + 2*8=22. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. That fits the description! So W is CO2? Or wait, maybe another isotope? Wait, but the question says the molecule has same number of protons and neutrons. So maybe it
