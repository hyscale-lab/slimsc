Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a given spin state.

Hmm, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). Wait, so that's a two-component vector, right? In quantum mechanics, spin states are usually represented as column vectors, like |ψ⟩ = [a; b], where a and b are complex numbers. So in this case, the state is (3i, 4), which I'll write as a column vector:

ψ = [3i; 4]

I remember that the expectation value of an operator is calculated using the formula ⟨S_y⟩ = ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. Oh wait, right—but the operator S_y is given in terms of sigma_y (which is the Pauli matrix σ_y). The expression for S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) multiplied by the σ_y matrix.

The sigma_y matrix is given as:
σ_y = [[0, -i],
        [i, 0]]

So plugging that into S_y, we get:
S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i],
              [i, 0]]

Now, to compute the expectation value, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ, where ψ† is the conjugate transpose of ψ. Because ψ is a column vector, ψ† would be a row vector with the complex conjugate of each element.

Let me write down ψ and ψ†:
ψ = [3i; 4]
ψ† = [ -3  , 4 ] because 3i's conjugate is -3 (since (i)^* = -i), and 4 is real, so it stays as 4.

Wait, no, wait. The conjugate of 3i is -3i? Wait, no, wait: 3i is a purely imaginary number. Its complex conjugate is -3i. Oh! So when I take the conjugate transpose, the first component becomes -3i (the conjugate of 3i), and the second component is 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ] ?

Wait no, wait, maybe I got that wrong.
