Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully and try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about identifying an unknown compound using FTIR and 1H NMR spectra. The options provided are four different structures, all of which seem to be some sort of carboxylic acid since they all end with COOH. Hmm, let me jot down what I know.

First, the FTIR part. The spectrum shows a very broad absorption around 3000 cm-1. I remember that broad peaks around there usually indicate O-H stretching, like in alcohols or carboxylic acids. Carboxylic acids have a strong absorption due to the O-H group, which is usually broad because of hydrogen bonding. Also, there's a strong peak at 1700 cm-1. That's a typical region for a carbonyl group, like a C=O stretch. So, the compound is likely a carboxylic acid, which fits with all the options given.

Now, looking at the 1H NMR data. The problem states that none of the peaks correspond to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl groups are those in alkenes (like CH2=CH), so that means the compound doesn't have any double bonds. So, structures with only single bonds are possible. All the options have branched structures, so no alkenes here. That's a relief; I don't have to worry about that.

The NMR has several signals. One signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. Another is a doublet of triplets of triplets. Hmm, that's a bit complex. I need to think about splitting patterns in NMR. Splitting occurs due to neighboring protons. Each split corresponds to the number of adjacent Hs.

Let me think about what splitting patterns mean. A doublet (two peaks) means each proton is next to one set of protons. A triplet is three peaks, usually from two neighboring Hs. A quartet is four peaks, from three neighboring Hs.

So a doublet of triplets would be where a proton is next to two different sets of protons. For example, maybe it's adjacent to a group with two Hs and another group with three Hs, but more likely, it's a more complex coupling scenario.

Wait, wait. The first signal is a doublet of triplets of quartets. That's like three layers of splitting. Let me break that down. First, the quartet: that implies coupling with three equivalent protons. Then, the triplet would mean each of those is split by another set of two equivalent protons. And the doublet suggests each of those is split by another set of one proton. Oh, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me visualize: a quartet (n=3, so 3+1=4 peaks) would come from being next to a CH3 group. Then a triplet (n=2) from a CH2. And a doublet (n=1) from a CH. So, maybe the proton is attached to a carbon that's next to a CH2 group, which is next to a CH3. But wait, in the structure, how would that look?

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's look at the structures provided.

Option A: CH3C(H)(C2H5)C(H)(C2H5)CH2COOH. So, this would be something like a central CH attached to two C2H5 groups and a CH2COOH. Wait, no, the formula is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. So, the structure is CH3-C(H)(C2H5)-C(H)(C2H5)-CH2COOH. Wait, that's like a di-substituted structure. The central carbons each have a C2H5 group attached
